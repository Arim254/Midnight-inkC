    "body": "Seven bodyguards have been arrested over their alleged involvement in the murder of a popular Mexican mayor, authorities have said.Carlos Manzo, the mayor of Uruapan and an outspoken critic of cartel violence, was shot dead on 1 November at a public event marking the Day of the Dead.The office of the attorney general of Michoacán state said in a brief statement that the public servants had been detained \"for their probable participation in the crime of aggravated homicide, in commission by omission\" in relation to Manzo's killing.It follows the arrest on Wednesday of a man police described as the mastermind behind the murder, who officials said had links to a powerful cartel.The attorney general's office in Michoacán, to the west of the capital, Mexico City, said the seven guards had been arrested by both state and federal officials, including the National Guard.Troops and agents led the suspects out of a municipal building on Friday near where Manzo had been killed, according to the Associated Press.The 40-year-old mayor was attending a Day of the Dead ceremony - which honours deceased family and friends - alongside his relatives when he was shot seven times, sending bystanders running for cover.Manzo's assassination triggered mass protests and questions have been raised about why his security detail failed to stop the lone gunman. The suspect was later restrained and shot by Manzo's bodyguards. Manzo had been outspoken about how avocado growers in the region were being extorted and threatened by criminal groups, and had also demanded that Mexico's federal government do more to rein in the cartels.The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), which Mexico's security minister blamed for Manzo's slaying, engages in drug trafficking, as well as kidnapping for ransom and extortion.It is also infamous for targeting public officials who refuse to do its bidding.Mexican officials arrested the supposed mastermind of the assassination, named only by his forenames Jorge Amando, on Wednesday.While the CJNG is thought to be the most powerful of the criminal gangs operating in Michoacán, there are many others and their fights for control of drug, arms and fuel smuggling routes often result in deadly confrontations.",

    "body": "The granddaughter of former US President John F Kennedy Jr has announced her diagnosis with an aggressive form of cancer, with the 35-year-old saying she has been given less than a year to live.Tatiana Schlossberg, the daughter of former US Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, shared the news in an essay published in The New Yorker on Saturday - the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather's assassination.The mother of-two climate journalist has been an outspoken opponent of her relative Robert F Kennedy Jr's position as US health secretary under President Donald Trump.In her essay, Schlossberg describes her alarm at watching her second cousin be approved to the post as she was battling her illness. According to Schlossberg's essay - titled A Battle With My Blood - she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia after giving birth in May 2024.She describes her previously healthy lifestyle, which included running, skiing and even once swimming in New York's Hudson River, \"eerily, to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society\".Despite treatment, including a bone marrow transplant and chemotherapy, she says doctors have told her the outcome does not look good. \"During the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\" she writes. \"My first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn't remember me.\" Schlossberg's son was born in 2022 and her daughter in 2024.Schlossberg, whose uncle John F Kennedy Jr died in a plane crash at age 38 and whose grandmother Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died of cancer when Schlossberg was a toddler, also describes the pain she fears her death will cause her mother, who previously served as US ambassador to Australia and Japan. \"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she writes.She also describes her upset at watching her second cousin, known as RFK Jr - whose father Robert F Kennedy was also assassinated while running for president - become Trump's health secretary.\"I watched from my hospital bed as Bobby, in the face of logic and common sense, was confirmed for the position, despite never having worked in medicine, public health, or the government,\" she writes. \"Suddenly, the healthcare system on which I relied felt strained, shaky.\"Earlier this month, her brother Jack Schlossberg announced that he is planning to run for Congress in New York. He shared her essay online on Saturday, with the caption, \"Life is short - let it rip.\"The Kennedy family's generations-spanning participation in US politics - along with the personal tragedy which has often touched its members - has garnered it a prominent reputation in American life.",

    "body": "4 hours agoAleks PhillipsAFP via Getty ImagesAir traffic above the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven has been suspended after unidentified drones were spotted near the airport.Drones were first observed late on Friday over the nearby Volkel air force base. Weapons were deployed to try to shoot them down but the devices got away.Following more drone sightings near the main airport on Saturday, the airspace in the area was closed to both civilian and military flights. Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans said \"counter-drone assets\" were ready to intervene.It is the latest in a series of such incidents at military installations and airfields in northern Europe in recent months. Russia has denied accusations it was involved in them.As well as being used by the Royal Netherlands Air Force, Volkel Air Base hosts a US Air Force squadron as part of Nato.Officials said that for security reasons they would provide no details about how the drones were first spotted on Friday or what action was taken to try to bring them down.Drones have been sighted at other Dutch air bases in the past few weeks, as well as facilities in neighbouring Belgium, Denmark and Germany.A lack of evidence pointing to their origins has plagued investigations into the incidents since they began in September, as in many cases the drones depart after a while.Some European officials have attributed the sightings to \"hybrid warfare\" on the part of Russia, as the nations that have been targeted are all allied to Ukraine.But the Kremlin has denied it has anything to do with past incursions. Defence ministers from 10 EU countries have agreed to create a \"drone wall\" in response to the sightings, while some individual nations have sought to secure anti-drone defence measures.",

    "body": "4 hours agoRushdi Abualouf,Gaza correspondent, Istanbul and Jon Donnison,correspondent, JerusalemAt least 22 Palestinians have been killed in a series of Israeli air strikes across northern and central Gaza, Hamas medical and civil defence officials have said.They said five sites had been hit, including residential homes. A senior Hamas commander was among the dead, according to local sources.The Israeli military said it had struck targets in Gaza in response to an incident earlier on Saturday, when it said an \"armed terrorist\" had fired at soldiers after crossing the Strip's so-called \"yellow line\" designating areas under full Israeli control. Hamas denied this.Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire deal agreed on six weeks ago.More than 310 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since the ceasefire came into force, according to Gaza's health ministry.The territory's civil defence said Saturday's strikes by Israel targeted Gaza City in the north, as well as Deir al-Balah and Nuseirat camp in central Gaza.The Hamas officials said five people had been killed at the Abbas junction in the densely populated Rimal area of Gaza City. Witnesses said an Israeli strike set a car on fire.In addition, three people were killed near a mosque in Deir al-Balah, the officials said.Two houses were targeted in Israeli strikes in Nuseirat, they added, with three killed after the home of the Abu Amouneh family was hit. Seven others were killed in another strike targeting the house of the Abu Shawish family.Three more people were killed later on Saturday when a house in western Gaza City was hit, officials reported.The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a later statement: \"Today, Hamas violated the ceasefire again, sending a terrorist into Israel held territory to attack IDF soldiers. In response, Israel eliminated five senior Hamas terrorists.\"The statement also called on mediators to \"insist that Hamas fulfil its side of the ceasefire\".Following the strikes, Hamas said the army's westward push of the yellow line and continued bombardment of eastern Gaza amounted to a \"blatant breach\" of the agreement.The group called on mediators and the US to intervene urgently, warning that Israel was attempting to impose \"new facts on the ground\" and undermine the ceasefire.The Israeli military launched an offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.At least 69,500 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, including 280 during the ceasefire, according to the territory's health ministry.",

    "body": "3 hours agoSofia Ferreira Santos and Alex SmithReuters/Adriano MachadoJair Bolsonaro has been taken into custody after being determined a \"concrete flight risk\" while under house arrest.The right-wing former Brazilian president was found guilty of plotting a military coup in September and sentenced to more than 27 years in prison, but he remains under house arrest pending appeals.Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said the move to detain the 70-year-old was a preventative measure after \"new facts\" came to light.Bolsonaro admitted he had tried to open his ankle monitor with a soldering iron - but denied he wanted to remove it. Court officials said he wanted to use a planned rally outside outside his house as a cover to break free.In a filing authorising the arrest, Justice Moraes said information from the centre monitoring Bolsonaro's house arrest suggested the former president's \"intention to break the electronic ankle bracelet to ensure success in his escape\".This, it said, would be \"facilitated by the confusion caused by the demonstration called by his son\".Flávio Bolsonaro, who serves a senator, called for a gathering of his supporters near his father's home to take place on Saturday night. The senator wrote on social media on Friday: \"Are you going to fight for your country, or watch it all from your phone there on your sofa? I invite you to fight with us.\"He said the vigil would enable supporters to \"pray for his health and for the return of democracy in our country\".To explain his decision, Justice Moraes cited the possibility of Bolsonaro fleeing to foreign embassies, citing \"a history of planning to request asylum through a diplomatic representation\".The court filing notes that the US embassy in the capital, Brasilia, is located about 13km (8 miles) from Bolsonaro's home.Bolsonaro's legal woes have drawn the ire of fellow right-wing populist US President Donald Trump, prompting him to impose a 50% tariff on imports of Brazilian goods.Bolsonaro is being held in a police station in Brasilia and will undergo a custody hearing on Sunday.It was only on Friday that the former president's lawyers asked the Supreme Court to allow him to serve his whole jail sentence under house arrest, with electronic monitoring.They also asked that Bolsonaro be allowed to leave his home for medical treatment, saying he required regular treatment for pulmonary infections and other ailments.Bolsonaro was found guilty of leading a conspiracy aimed at keeping him in power after he lost the 2022 election to his left-wing rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.Supreme Court justices said that he knew of a plot which included plans to assassinate Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, and to arrest and execute Moraes - who has been overseeing Bolsonaro's trial.The conspiracy failed to get the backing of the army and air force commanders. Lula was sworn in without incident on 1 January 2023.But a week later, on 8 January, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in Brasília. The security forces intervened and about 1,500 people were arrested.The justices found that the rioters had been incited by Bolsonaro whose plan, they said, was for the military to step in and return him to power.At the time, Bolsonaro's lawyers called the 27 years and three months sentence \"absurdly excessive\".He was also barred from running for public office until 2060 - eight years after the end of his sentence.The former president called the trial a \"witch hunt\" and said it was designed to prevent him running in the 2026 presidential election.",

    "body": "14 hours agoAlex Smith, Chris Ewokor,BBC Africa, in Abuja, and Elettra NeysmithBBCSt Mary's School, in Niger state, was attacked in the early hours of Friday morningMore than 300 children and staff are now thought to have been kidnapped by gunmen from a Catholic school in central Nigeria, making it one of the worst mass abductions the country has seen.The Christian Association of Nigeria said 303 students and 12 teachers were taken from on St Mary's School in Papiri, Niger state - substantially more than previously estimated.It said the figures have been revised upwards \"after a verification exercise\".The kidnapping comes amid a surge of attacks by armed groups. The revised number of people taken surpasses the 276 abducted during the infamous Chibok mass abduction of 2014.Local police said armed men stormed the school at around 02:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Friday morning, abducting students who were staying there.Dominic Adamu, whose daughters attend the school but were not taken, told the BBC: \"Everybody is weak... it took everybody by surprise.\"One distressed woman tearfully told the BBC that her nieces, aged six and 13, had been kidnapped, adding: \"I just want them to come home.\"Police said that security agencies were \"combing the forests with a view to rescue the abducted students\".It was initially reported that 215 pupils had been taken - but that figure has since been revised upwards. The new number is believed to be almost half of the school's student population, the news agency AFP reports.Authorities in Niger state said the school had disregarded an order to close all boarding facilities following intelligence warnings of a heightened risk of attacks.They said in a statement the move exposed pupils and staff to \"avoidable risk\". The school has not commented on that claim.The kidnapping of people for ransom by criminal gangs, known locally as bandits, has become a major problem in many parts of Nigeria.The payment of ransoms has been outlawed in an attempt to cut the supply of money to the criminal gangs - but this has had little effect.Friday's mass abduction was the third such attack in the country in a week.On Monday, more than 20 schoolgirls, who the BBC has been told are Muslim, were kidnapped from a boarding school in neighbouring Kebbi state.A church was also attacked further south, in Kwara state, with two people killed and 38 others abducted.Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has postponed his foreign trips - including to this weekend's G20 summit in South Africa - in order to address the security concerns.The central government has ordered more than 40 federal colleges to close and public schools in some states have been shut.But the rising insecurity is fuelling anger as well as fear in Nigeria, with citizens demanding stronger action to protect children and communities.The mass abduction follows claims by right-wing figures in the US, including President Donald Trump, that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria - an allegation dismissed by the Nigerian government.For months, campaigners and politicians in Washington have been alleging that Islamist militants are systematically targeting Christians in Nigeria.Earlier this month, Trump said he would send troops into Nigeria \"guns a-blazing\" if the African nation's government \"continues to allow the killing of Christians\".The Nigerian government has called claims that Christians are being persecuted \"a gross misrepresentation of reality\".An official said that \"terrorists attack all who reject their murderous ideology - Muslims, Christians and those of no faith alike\".In the north-east, jihadist groups have been battling the state for more than a decade.Organisations monitoring violence say most of the victims of these groups are Muslim because most attacks happen in the majority Muslim north of the country.In the centre of Nigeria, there are also frequently deadly attacks between herders - who are mostly Muslim - on farmers, who are largely Christian.However, analysts say these are often motivated by competition for resources, such as water or land, rather than religion.The militant Islamist group Boko Haram took 276 girls from their school in the town of Chibok 2014.The incident courted international attention and sparked a global campaign seeking their return, which included an intervention from then-US First Lady Michelle Obama.Many have since either escaped or been freed - but as many as 100 still remain missing.",

    "body": "1 hour agoOlga Prosvirova & Zlata OnufrievaBBC News RussianAishat Baimuradova/Getty/BBCAishat told her friends she had been raised in a strictly religious familyWhen 23-year-old Aishat Baimuradova fled her home last year, she believed she finally had a chance to live the way she wanted.Coming from Chechnya, a conservative Muslim republic in Russia, she cut her hair short, stopped covering her head, shaved off part of her eyebrow and posted quirky selfies on Instagram.She told her new friends she could finally breathe.In October, Aishat was found dead in a rented flat in neighbouring Armenia. Police say she was murdered.Two people were seen leaving the building where she was found, including a woman Aishat had befriended not long before her death. Both reportedly left for Russia soon afterwards.Russians do not need a passport to enter Armenia; their internal ID is enough. That also makes it an easy route for anyone trying to flee.Chechnya, in Russia's North Caucasus, is often described by rights groups as a state within a state - a place where power is highly personalised and loyalty to long-standing leader Ramzan Kadyrov often over-rides laws and formal institutions.For years, human rights organisations have documented enforced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings in the republic, as well as systematic persecution of those who dissent.Chechen officials have consistently denied these allegations, complaining of fabrications aimed at discrediting the region.Aishat Baimuradova/InstagramHer friends say Aishat was a very open person seeking connection with peopleSeveral high-profile critics of Chechen authorities have been killed abroad.In 2009, Umar Israilov, a former bodyguard of Ramzan Kadyrov, was shot dead in Vienna, where he had sought asylum. Austrian authorities called the assassination politically motivated and linked the killers to Chechnya.Former Chechen rebel Zelimkhan Khangoshvili was shot dead in a Berlin park in 2019, in an attack blamed on Russian security services.But Aishat Baimuradova is the first known Chechen woman to have died in suspicious circumstances, not long after fleeing Russia.Like many other women who escape the region, she had complained of being controlled by her family. She said she was forced into a marriage, monitored, and barred from leaving home or using her phone. The BBC was not able to reach her family for a comment.Aishat arrived in Armenia at the end of 2024 with the help of SK-SOS, a crisis group that helps people facing danger in the North Caucasus. She had complained openly of conservative gender rules and the suffocating control women face in Chechnya.At first, she worked in a small town, then moved to the capital, Yerevan, hoping for a better job and more opportunities.To many who flee, such visibility is unthinkable. Most use false names, avoid showing their faces, and refuse to meet new people. Aishat chose a different path. \"She really wanted a normal life,\" her friend who asked to remain anonymous told the BBC. \"And she wanted to trust people.\"ReutersRamzan Kadyrov has ruled Chechnya since 2007. Critics accuse him of turning the Russian republic into a state within a stateHer family tried to persuade her to come back, but when nothing came of it they disowned her, according to SK SOS.\"They said to her: 'You are no longer our daughter or our wife. We won't touch you - just don't touch us,\" Alexandra Miroshnikova, spokesperson for SK SOS, told the BBC.Her uncle told local media the family had no involvement in her death.On the night of her death, Aishat was with a woman she had recently met online, who claimed to come from Dagestan, another Russian republic in the North Caucasus.People who knew Aishat told the BBC it was the woman who had first made contact with her on social media, later coming to Armenia and inviting her to parties.A man captured with her on CCTV as they left the building where Aishat's body was found was reported by a popular Russian Telegram channel to be of Chechen origin. Investigative outlet Agentstvo identified him as a relative of a businessman close to Ramzan Kadyrov.Chechen authorities deny any connection to Baimuradova's death, condemning such suggestions as a \"terrorist information attack\". Officials have also criticised groups assisting women who flee, accusing them of \"destroying family traditions\".VALERY HACHE/AFP via Getty ImagesChechen women who have sought refuge in Europe often avoid communicating with the diasporaArmenian authorities say they are investigating two unnamed people in connection with Aishat Baimuradova's murder, but they have released no further details about them.Ramzan Kadyrov is sensitive to people criticising Chechnya from abroad, says Michael Dennis, an expert on Chechen politics at the University of Texas.\"The very existence of a diaspora is a clear signal to the entire world that something is wrong in Chechnya. It's a matter of personal pride and political image,\" Mr Dennis told the BBC.Since the early 2000s, asylum seekers from Chechnya have been coming to Europe - fleeing first the war and later Kadyrov's repressive rule.But changes to EU migration policy, followed by visa restrictions for Russians because of the war in Ukraine, have all but closed that route.That leaves the South Caucasus, where Russians can travel visa-free, as the easiest escape route, but far from the safest.In July, another escapee, 24-year-old Laura Avtorkhanova, was found in a shelter in Georgia by a group of male relatives who reportedly tried to coerce her into returning to Russia. After being questioned by police she was able to stay safely in Georgia.For other Chechen women who have fled, Aishat's death has reinvigorated a fear that has haunted them since they left Russia.Several have told the BBC how even before her murder they had steered clear of community events, avoided speaking Chechen in public and restricted their social media presence. Now they worry it may not be enough to hide from those who may want to punish them.\"The fear I've lived with all my life - embedded in my DNA - has reawakened with renewed vigour,\" said one escapee living in Western Europe, who asked to hide her name and precise location.\"It's like sleep paralysis: a monster appears, and I lie there frozen, staring into its eyes. It's the fear of being killed.\"\"You can escape,\" she said, \"but you never really feel free.\"",

    "body": "1 hour agoNicole KolsterSpecial for BBC MundoBBCLike Alejandro Orellano, many Venezuelans say they are more worried about their personal finances than about a US invasion.While Nicolás Maduro's government lives on edge under a military threat from US President Donald Trump, ordinary Venezuelans spend their time trying to figure out what to eat each day.It's Wednesday morning at Quinta Crespo, a popular market in downtown Caracas. Here, a possible escalation of the conflict is not the main concern of Venezuelans, who glance at the news while checking their wallets to find enough cash to pay.\"There's not going to be an intervention, nothing like that. What's really troubling us is the rise of the dollar,\" Alejandro Orellano tells BBC Mundo as he savours a coffee, waiting for customers who never seem to arrive.In the past weeks, Trump's government has deployed thousands of troops and military assets to within striking distance of Venezuela, including the world's largest warship. On Saturday, at least four international airlines cancelled flights into or out of the country, according to the Reuters and AFP news agencies, after a Friday notice from US aviation authorities warned of \"heightened military activity in or around Venezuela\".This comes after a series of US airstrikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific killed more than 80 people.It's part of a broader effort the administration says is necessary to stem the flow of narcotics into the US, but Maduro insists the sabre-rattling is designed to push him out of office.In the streets of Caracas, daily life continues while the government tells the population that they must be ready for a US invasion.Alejandro downplays the rhetoric between Washington and Caracas.He's been selling vegetables in this market for five years. \"Look, look how empty this is,\" he insists, pointing to a long, lonely aisle full of fresh fruits and vegetables.A Christmas carol plays, but the festive atmosphere feels overshadowed.The common enemy of the people is here: the sharp rise in food prices and the lack of purchasing power. In part, this is due to the rapid depreciation of the bolívar, which will have lost 80% of its value this year, according to International Monetary Fund (IMF) figures.A kilo of chicken, for example, costs about four times the official monthly minimum wage. And although the government offers bonuses to retirees and public workers, the money is still not enough to cover the basic food basket.Consuelo, 74, is sceptical about an armed conflict with the US and says Venezuelans cannot afford to stock food in preparation for a war.\"Let whatever happens happen! And that's it!\" she tells the BBC, adding that worrying about the spectre of war doesn't help much.\"Is it true? Is it false? That just makes you sick, walking around nervous, it's better to stay calm. Emotions can also affect your health,\" continues this retired university professor who still works.\"I haven't done any panic buying; you need a lot of money to do that.\"Two economists living in Venezuela consulted by the BBC for this report preferred not to comment for fear of government reprisals.\"Inflation has reached levels of around 20% monthly,\" another expert who requested anonymity pointed out.The IMF projects a 548% price increase this year and says it will be worse in 2026, when it could soar to 629% - the highest figure on the continent.Others see a potential US intervention as an opportunity for regime change but are afraid to speak openly about it.\"We're scared, silent, afraid they'll throw us in jail. I used to post things, but not anymore - I shouldn't - because I don't know who might turn me in,\" a merchant from Ciudad Bolívar (in Bolívar state, south) tells the BBC by phone.\"There's hope, faith, but people are quiet out of fear. You don't hear anyone talking about it; it's just at home, with your family, but there's a hint of joy,\" says the woman anonymously.Consuelo says that uncertainty also makes Venezuelans nervous.Much of society avoids speaking openly about issues that could be sensitive for Maduro's government, after a wave of arrests followed anti-government protests over the disputed 2024 presidential elections, which have been widely rejected by the international community. The opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.After the elections, more than 2,000 people were arrested, official figures show. At present, 884 individuals remain in prison for political reasons, according to the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal.Barbara Marrero, a 40-year-old pastry chef, says: \"We're all waiting for something to happen because it's fair and necessary. We've been living in absolute misery for years.\"Venezuelans live day by day waiting for something to happen, but everyone is afraid [to speak] and nobody says anything.\"Esther Guevara, 53, who works in a medical lab, doesn't hide her concern amid tensions over the US naval fleet deployment.\"I'm worried because I don't really know what's happening - they might invade, strike… people think it will be ok, but this is serious,\" she says. \"A lot of innocent people could die.\"\"I feel like something's cooking out there, but I'm waiting,\" she adds.Javier Jaramillo also does not believe that an attack on Venezuela is imminent.It's now midday.Everything goes on as usual along a busy boulevard in eastern Caracas. Street vendors pushing sales. Pedestrians coming and going.There's Javier Jaramillo, 57, looking for goods to resell at Christmas. He's curious about the USS Gerald R Ford, the aircraft carrier Washington moved to the Caribbean.\"I don't think that attack will happen. I think there could be dialogue, an agreement, or a deal.\"Still, he says that when there are power cuts, he thinks: \"'They've come in,' 'They're going to come in.'\"Trump has suggested he is open to a diplomatic dialogue with Maduro, but also said he would not rule out military action.Either way, Javier repeats: \"We're more worried about food. Venezuela is in bad shape. Inflation is eating us alive.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has said a US plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war is not his \"final offer\" for Kyiv, after Ukrainian allies voiced concerns over proposals.Earlier on Saturday, leaders from Europe, Canada and Japan said the plan had elements \"essential for a just and lasting peace\", but would \"require additional work\", citing concerns over border changes and caps on Ukraine's army. On Sunday, security officials from Britain, France, Germany, the US and Ukraine will meet in Geneva, Switzerland.President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier warned Ukraine faced \"one of the most difficult moments in our history\" over US pressure to accept the plan seen as favourable to Moscow.Trump has given Ukraine until 27 November to accept the 28-point plan, while Russia's President Vladimir Putin said it could be the \"basis\" for a settlement.When asked on Saturday whether the current draft plan was his final offer for Ukraine, Trump told reporters at the White House: \"No, not my final offer.\" \"One way or another we have to get it [the war] ended, so we're working on it,\" he added.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and special envoy Steve Witkoff will be among those taking part in talks in Geneva on Sunday. National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell will attend on the UK's behalf.Saturday's joint statement at the G20 summit in South Africa was signed by the leaders of Canada, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Germany and Norway. Two top EU officials were also among the signatories.The statement said: \"We believe therefore that the draft is a basis which will require additional work. We are ready to engage in order to ensure that a future peace is sustainable. We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\"It added: \"The implementation of elements relating to the European Union and relating to Nato would need the consent of EU and Nato members respectively\".UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is at the G20 summit in Johannesburg, spoke to Zelensky on the phone on Saturday, followed by a call with Trump.On the Trump call, a Downing Street spokesman said Sir Keir \"relayed the discussions that have been taking place between Coalition of the Willing partners [Ukraine's allies] in attendance at the G20 summit today\".They added: \"The leaders agreed their teams would work together on the 28-point US peace proposal in Geneva tomorrow. They agreed to speak again tomorrow.\"Sir Keir earlier said he was concerned about proposed caps on Ukraine's military in the US plan, saying \"it's fundamental that Ukraine has to be able to defend itself if there's a ceasefire\".The widely leaked US peace plan proposes Ukrainian troops withdraw from the part of the eastern Donetsk region that they currently control, and de facto Russian control of Donetsk, as well as the neighbouring Luhansk region and the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.The plan also includes freezing the borders of Ukraine's southern Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions along the current battle lines. Both regions are partially occupied by Russia.The US draft would also limit Ukraine's military to 600,000 personnel, with European fighter jets stationed in neighbouring Poland.Kyiv would receive \"reliable security guarantees\", the plan says, although no details have been given. The document says \"it is expected\" that Russia will not invade its neighbours and Nato will not expand further.The plan also suggests Russia will be \"reintegrated into the global economy\", through the lifting of sanctions and by inviting Russia to rejoin the G7 group of the world's most powerful countries - making it the G8 again.On Friday, Trump said Zelensky would \"have to like\" the US proposals, adding otherwise Ukraine and Russia would continue fighting.Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian leader addressed the nation with a stark warning that the country \"might face a very difficult choice: either losing dignity, or risk losing a key partner\". \"Today is one of the most difficult moments in our history,\" Zelensky added, pledging to work \"constructively\" with the Americans on the plan.On Saturday, Zelensky announced that his head of office Andriy Yermak would lead Ukraine's negotiating team for future talks on a peace deal, including any that may involve Russia.\"Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine's national interests and exactly what must be done to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion, another strike against Ukraine,\" the president said in a video statement posted on social media.Kyiv is critically dependent on deliveries of US-made advanced weaponry, including air defence systems to repel deadly Russian air assaults, as well as intelligence provided by Washington.Putin on Friday confirmed Moscow had received the US plan - but said it had not been discussed with the Kremlin in detail. He added Moscow was willing to \"show flexibility\" - but was also prepared to fight on.Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.In recent months, Russian troops have been slowly advancing in Ukraine's south-eastern region - despite reported heavy combat casualties.",

    "body": "13 hours agoKwasi Gyamfi Asiedu,in Washington, and Anthony Zurcher,North America correspondent, in WashingtonKey moments from Trump and Greene's public falloutMarjorie Taylor Greene has announced she will resign from office, an unexpected turn for the high-profile Republican.One of Donald Trump's Maga superstars and staunchest defenders, the Georgia congresswoman's relentless calls for releasing files related to late paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and recent criticism of some of his policies led to a bitter public feud.After the US president labelled her a \"traitor\", she said in a video announcing her departure: \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"Trump, who had threatened to support a Republican challenger to unseat Greene, called her resignation \"great news for the country\" in an interview with ABC News.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he later wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!\"Greene said in her video statement, posted on social media, that she would leave the US Congress on 5 January 2026.She said that she did \"not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms\". She had been one of the loudest demanding the release of documents related to Epstein, an issue that once united Trump and his base but has since become divisive.Trump had spent months arguing that the issue was a distraction concocted by his political detractors to divert attention from his administration's achievements.\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene said in her resignation letter.Watch: Marjorie Taylor Greene announces resignation in video messageOver the last few months, she has gone on a number of high-profile news shows and was critical of Trump and fellow Republicans. She took issue with the president not doing enough to bring down living costs for voters and criticised his policy of introducing tariffs on imports. But above all, she criticised his administration for not releasing documents related to Epstein.Trump responded last week in a series of social media posts, calling Greene a \"traitor\" and \"wacky\". He said she should be unseated and vowed to back a challenger for her place in Congress.Days after their feud boiled over, with a growing number of Republicans calling for their release, Trump reversed course and said he would support their publication. He signed a bill this week that forces the US Justice Department to release the documents within 30 days. Greene was elected to Congress in 2020 amid a backdrop of headlines over her support and promotion of QAnon conspiracies, including claiming school shootings and the 9/11 terror attacks were staged. She has since apologised and sought to distance herself from those comments.In the video announcing her resignation, Greene ticked off a list of political achievements. She noted in her resignation letter that the comments from Trump were \"hurtful\". AFP via Getty ImagesGreene and Trump on the campaign trail in 2024While she announced her departure from the House of Representatives, US media reports have indicated Greene has shown an interest in running for state office - either as Georgia governor or for a Senate seat. The president has commented publicly about those ambitions, writing on Truth Social during their public feud that he had previously told her that she shouldn't run for either of those offices due to poor public polling. Greene has since said she did not plan to run for either of those offices. Before their public falling out, Trump and Greene had been close allies in championing the \"America First\" agenda. She joined him on the campaign trail and was one of the Republicans most vocal about Trump's false claims that he'd won the 2020 presidential election against Joe Biden. Her departure will further close the gap in the Republican-led House of Representatives, where the party only holds a handful of seats more than Democrats. Control of the chamber will be up for grabs in the 2026 midterm elections next November. ",

    "body": "1 day agoSteve RosenbergRussia editorEPAIt was quite a contrast.On Thursday, a US Pentagon delegation was in Kyiv. They were talking to President Zelensky about a draft plan to end the war in Ukraine.The same day, on Russian state TV, President Putin was in military fatigues. He was talking to his army chiefs about fighting on.\"We have our tasks, our goals,\" the Kremlin leader declared. \"The chief one is the unconditional achievement of the aims of the special military operation.\"The Izvestia newspaper called President Putin's visit to a command post \"a signal to America that he's prepared to negotiate on Ukraine, on Russia's terms\".Which brings us back to the peace plan.On Friday night, President Putin said he had seen the US settlement plan for Ukraine.Addressing a meeting of the Russian security council in Moscow, he described the American proposals as a \"modernised\" version of the plan discussed with Trump at the Alaska summit between the leaders in August.President Putin said he thought the plans could form the basis of final peace settlement.The 28-point proposal, which has been widely leaked and reported on, appeared after a visit to America by President Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev. He took part in three days of discussions in Miami with President Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff.According to drafts of the peace proposal, Ukraine would cede to Russia parts of the Donbass still under Kyiv's control; the Ukrainian armed forces would be reduced in size and Ukraine would vow not to join Nato.\"The Russian military's effective work should convince Zelensky and his regime that it's better to strike a deal and do it now,\" President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously told journalists on a Kremlin conference call.A peace proposal does not automatically mean peace. What if there's no agreement?Pro-Kremlin commentators insist that, deal or no deal, Russia will prevail.\"Everyone thought that the idea of a peace deal had sunk in a swamp,\" wrote Russian news outlet Moskovsky Komsomolets. \"But suddenly, a rocket has shot out of this bog with a new, or rather an 'old new' peace plan, with something of the Alaska summit about it. It shot out like a jack in the box.\"How long and how far will this missile fly? Will it crash, sabotaged by Europe and Kyiv? Even if the launch is a false start, it's unlikely to change the general trend. The balance of power is shifting in Russia's favour.\"But after nearly four years of war Russia is under pressure, too. Since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, not only has Russian's army suffered huge losses on the battlefield, but back home the economy is faltering. Russia's budget deficit is growing, revenues from oil and gas falling.\"Russia's industry is somewhere between stagnation and decline,\" declared the broadsheet Nezavisimaya Gazeta this week.It's unclear, though, whether economic pressures will change President Putin's calculations and convince him that now is the moment to end his so-called special operation: even on terms that many believe benefit Moscow.Many. But not everyone.Some elements of the peace plan haven't gone down well in Russia. Some reports suggest that Ukraine could be offered security guarantees modelled on Nato's Article 5. That might commit Western allies to treat any future Russian attack on Ukraine as an attack on the transatlantic community as a whole and trigger a combined military response.\"This is, in effect, Ukraine in Nato,\" wrote Moskovsky Komsomolets, \"only without the deployment of bases and weapons on its territory.\"The full details of the peace plan have yet to be confirmed. We may be entering another period of intense diplomacy.For now, though, Russia's war on Ukraine continues.",

    "body": "'I'll be cheering for him': Takeaways from Trump and Mamdani's surprisingly cordial meeting21 hours agoKayla EpsteinWatch: \"I’ll be cheering for him\" - Trump praises Mamdani after first meetingUS President Donald Trump met New York City's newly elected mayor Zohran Mamdani at the White House in what was billed as the political showdown of the year - but instead became a praise fest. In his election victory speech, the self-described Democratic socialist mayor called Trump a \"despot\".  And before Friday's meeting, the president's spokeswoman had billed Mamdani's visit as a \"communist coming to the White House\". But standing side-by-side in the Oval Office, the two men struck a surprisingly conciliatory tone.Over and over, both men emphasised their shared interest in addressing New York City's affordability crisis. They smiled often, and Trump even appeared amused as reporters asked him about the political attacks Mamdani had fired his way.The tone of the meeting appeared to strike political observers off-guard, but offered a signal that both men understand that tackling the affordability crisis is critical to their political success.Whether the truce will last once Mamdani takes office on 1 January remains to be seen.Until then, \"I'll be cheering for him,\" Trump said.Trump full of praiseThe rapport was evident from the moment they started speaking to the press. Facing the media after a private meeting, Mamdani stood to Trump's right with his hands clasped, as the president sat behind the Resolute Desk. Their body language was relaxed – particularly Trump's.Not only did Trump refrain from attacking Mamdani, he praised him numerous times.The president expressed hope that Mamdani would be a \"really great mayor\". Later, the president added he was \"confident that he can do a very good job\". Brushing off questions about jihad and fascismGetty ImagesBoth men were all smiles at the meeting Mamdani and Trump traded political barbs throughout the mayoral election. A reporter in the room on Friday reminded the two men that Trump had called Mamdani a \"communist\" and Mamdani had referred to the president as a \"despot\". Both men deflected multiple questions about their previous statements and pivoted back to praise.Trump even let Mamdani answer a question about whether the mayor-elect thought the president was a \"fascist\". \"That's ok, you can just say yes,\" Trump interjected, giving Mamdani a light tap on the arm and smiling. \"It's easier than explaining.\"The closest Trump came to criticising Mamdani's politics was telling reporters: \"He's got views that are little out there.\"Perhaps most striking, Trump dismissed a question echoing an attack on Mamdani by one of Trump's top political allies in New York.\"Do you think you're standing next to a 'jihadist' right now in the oval office?\" a reporter asked, quoting Republican Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, who is mounting a run for governor of New York state.\"No I don't,\" Trump quickly replied.\"You say things sometimes in a campaign,\" Trump said of Stefanik. \"She's a very capable person.\"Bonding over New York rootsGetty ImagesMamdani and Trump have something in common: they're both New Yorkers, and both have called the borough of Queens home.Trump's childhood home is in the neighbourhood of Jamaica Estates, while Mamdani currently resides in Astoria.The two had a \"shared admiration and love\" of the city, Mamdani said.Though Trump rarely spends time in his namesake Manhattan skyscraper these days, he spoke fondly of his hometown throughout the news conference.\"This city could be unbelievable - if he could be a spectacular success, I'll be very happy,\" Trump said.At one point, the president suggested that, in a different political lifetime, he would have liked to be mayor of New York himself.Affordability focusPerhaps part of the reason the two men appeared in lock-step on Friday was their shared focus on cost-of-living issues.Trump won re-election last year after relentlessly hammering the issue of high inflation that had frustrated voters in 2024. As consumers grow restless about the cost of groceries, housing and other essentials, Trump has tried to convey a message of economic stability.During his election campaign in New York City, Mamdani maintained a laser focus on the lack of affordable housing and proposed freezing rent increases on certain rent-stabilised apartments, among other initiatives.Mamdani said he and Trump discussed how to \"deliver affordability to New Yorkers\".Whenever he was asked a question about their differing views, the mayor-elect brought the conversation back to this topic.Facing one question about their different views on achieving peace in the Middle East, Mamdani responded that Trump voters had expressed to him a wish for \"an end to forever wars\" and for leaders to address \"the cost-of-living crisis\".On law enforcement and immigration, they also appeared to find some common ground. Mamdani said he and Trump discussed federal immigration-enforcement operations in New York, and he relayed concerns from residents about how they are being conducted.But Trump said they discussed crime more than immigration.\"He doesn't want to see crime and I don't want to see crime,\" the president said. He had \"very little doubt\" the two wouldn't get along on that issue.Trump even said he would feel safe living in a Mamdani-led New York.A complication for Republicans' strategy? The cordial relations on display on Friday may complicate efforts by Republicans to use the self-described democratic socialist as a bogeyman in the upcoming 2026 midterm elections, when control of the US Congress will be up for grabs.In elections earlier this month, Republicans struggled and Democrats won key races. It's unclear whether that trend will hold. Republicans had plans in place to make Mamdani the face of the Democratic Party, according to US news site Axios. They included painting him as anti-police, anti-capitalism and anti-Israel in an effort to give Republicans a leg-up in key races. But the Oval Office chuminess could undercut that strategy.While praising Mamdani, the president said he believed the new mayor would \"surprise some conservative people\".",

    "body": "2 days agoPaul Kirby,Europe digital editor and BBC MonitoringBloomberg via Getty ImagesKirill Dmitriev has played a prominent role in Russia's return from diplomatic isolation in 2025Kirill Dmitriev is a rare breed of Russian diplomat.At 50 he is relatively young and he has a deep understanding of the US, having studied and worked there for several years.He is also a man of commerce, as head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, and a good fit for his opposite number in the Trump administration, special envoy Steve Witkoff.Dmitriev now finds himself under the spotlight over a draft peace plan that emerged after he spent three days with Witkoff in Miami.His team has refused to comment on its proposals, which read like a Putin wishlist, requiring Ukraine to cede territory under its control and slash the size of its military.Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has been careful not to reject its terms, but says any deal must bring a \"dignified peace, with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty\".  VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV/POOL/AFPWitkoff (R) and Dmitriev have struck up a close diplomatic rapportPutin's special envoy understands modern Ukraine better than most in Moscow. He was brought up in Ukraine, and a friend claims that as a 15-year-old Dmitriev took part in pro-democracy protests in Kyiv before the fall of the Soviet Union.He has been a fixture of US-Russian diplomatic initiatives pretty much since the start of Trump's second presidency - and Steve Witkoff has been a regular counterpart.\"We are sure we are on the road to peace, and as peacemakers we need to make it happen,\" Dmitriev told a conference in Saudi Arabia in late October.The pair appear to have first crossed paths in February 2025 when Putin's envoy played a role in securing the release of an American teacher from a Russian jail.\"There's a gentleman from Russia, his name is Kirill, and he had a lot to do with this. He was important. He was an important interlocutor bridging the two sides,\" Witkoff told reporters.Days later, when US and Russian diplomats met in Saudi Arabia, in effect bringing an end to Russia's diplomatic isolation in the West, Dmitriev took part in talks on economic relations and Witkoff was there too.Dmitriev's direct approach to Trump officials has not always paid off. When Trump announced sanctions on Russia's top two oil firms last month, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent labelled him a \"Russian propagandist\" for suggesting it would mean higher US fuel prices at the pump.Unlike the majority of Putin's entourage, the Russian leader's envoy is comfortable in a US TV studio. He is careful to praise Trump's diplomatic skills while giving Western viewers the Russian government narrative in their own language.\"I'm not a military guy… but the position of [the] Russian military is they only hit military targets,\" he told CNN's Jake Tapper recently, days after a kindergarten was bombed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. \"I'm just working to have dialogue and make sure that the conflict is ended as soon as possible.\"Dmitriev certainly is not a military guy, he's a private investment specialist with an eye for a deal.Getty ImagesWhen Putin travelled to the UAE in August, Dmitriev was there in the backgroundWitkoff may rate him, but in 2022 during Joe Biden's presidency, the US Treasury called him a \"known Putin ally\"  and imposed sanctions on the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which he has run since 2011.\"While officially a sovereign wealth fund, RDIF is widely considered a slush fund for President Vladimir Putin and is emblematic of Russia's broader kleptocracy,\" it said.Dmitriev's attitude to the Biden years is pretty clear: under Biden there was no attempt to understand the Russian position, he argues, while Trump's team stopped World War Three.OLGA MALTSEVA/AFPDmitriev's wife is a friend of Katerina Tikhonova, a daughter of Vladimir PutinIt is claimed that Dmitriev has accumulated a real estate fortune with his wife, TV presenter Natalia Popova.Popova is a friend and colleague of Vladimir Putin's daughter, Katerina Tikhonova - and deputy head of Tikhonova's tech firm Innopraktika. Dmitriev is also widely seen as part of Tikhonova's circle.His rise to the top in Moscow is a far cry from his childhood in Kyiv, as the son of two scientists. Dmitriev's father is a well known cell biologist in Ukraine and his mother a geneticist.That scientific background may have influenced his move to use his Russian sovereign wealth fund to finance Russia's Covid vaccine Sputnik V.Dmitriev is believed to have first met Russia's long-time leader at the start of his presidency in 2000, but he has not always agreed with his views.While Putin saw the collapse of the Soviet Union as the \"biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the century\", a friend claims Dmitriev joined an anti-Soviet student protest in Kyiv at the age of 15.His relationship with the US began the same year, in 1990, when he took part in a student exchange programme in New Hampshire, where a local newspaper quoted him highlighting Ukraine's national identity: \"Ukraine had a long history as an independent nation before it became part of the Russian empire.\"He later returned to the US as a college student and wrote a thesis on privatisation in Ukraine while at Stanford University. In his thesis proposal he suggested the research would \"prepare me better for making a contribution to the reform process in Ukraine\".After earning an MBA at Harvard, he worked for McKinsey in Los Angeles, Prague and Moscow, and then joined the US-Russia Investment Fund, set up by the US to ease Russia's transition to a market economy.Dmitriev appeared critical of Putin's crackdown on Russia's oligarchs in 2003 in a column for the Vedomosti business paper. \"The world is shrewd enough to know the difference between following the letter of the law and using the law as a tool of influence,\" he wrote.By 2007 he was back in Ukraine, in charge of Icon Private Equity, an investment fund with offices in Kyiv and Moscow.Increasingly he lamented Ukraine's political \"instability\" and suggested Russia was better placed to respond to the global financial crisis.He was a regular guest on TV talk shows and in 2010 he warned Ukraine would face an \"economic Holodomor\"  if it pursued a policy of isolation from Russia: a reference to the Ukrainian famine of the1930s brought on by the policies of Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.In 2011 he moved back to Russia to take charge of the newly-launched Russian Direct Investment Fund and remains there to this day.His overtures to the Trump administration have not come out of the blue.The Mueller report into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia during the 2016 US presidential election refers to Dmitriev meeting campaign supporters after the vote. But it was from February 2025 that contacts with the US were stepped up.Much of his work has been on diplomacy, but he has always had an eye on commercial opportunity. He proposed joint energy projects in the Arctic, and suggested partnering Russia's sovereign wealth fund with US companies in developing rare earth deposits.He has also spoken of Russia offering Elon Musk \"a small-sized nuclear power plant for a mission to Mars\" and even an $8bn (£6bn) \"Putin-Trump\" rail tunnel linking their two countries beneath the Bering Strait.Dmitriev's stock may be rising in Russia, but his reputation has taken a dive in Ukraine, where sanctions have been imposed on him for alleged crimes against Ukraine and Ukrainians.",

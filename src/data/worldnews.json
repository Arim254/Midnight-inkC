    "body": "19 hours agoJessica ParkerBerlinGetty ImagesA vast stockpile of potatoes is being given away for free by a farm in the German state of Saxony, after a bumper national harvest .Thousands of tasty tubers have been rolling into the country's capital, Berlin, since mid-January, with residents risking icy streets to bag their share.Dubbed \"the great potato rescue\" it is part of a plan to stop about 4 million kg (8.8 million lb) of surplus spuds from going to ruin. Food banks, schools and churches are among the beneficiaries, according to organisers.Germany is the European Union's potato-producing capital, and last year's harvest has left the market saturated.Ultimately it is about \"putting the potato in the spotlight as a valuable food,\" said Berliner Morgenpost editor, Peter Schink who helped spearhead the plan.The newspaper teamed up with eco-friendly search engine firm, Ecosia, to co-ordinate and fund the distribution of the spuds.Not wishing to discard its \"magnificent tubers\" back into the fields, Osterland Agrar says it's set to have bussed around 500,000kg to Berlin, and other parts of Germany and Ukraine.\"We can store them until the middle of this year,\" said Hans-Joachim von Massow, Managing Director of Osterland Agrar, the agricultural firm that ended up with all the potatoes, after a customer contract was cancelled and settled.But not everyone is celebrating.\"Food is and will remain valuable, even if thoughtless do-gooders throw around free potatoes at schools and churches,\" said Timo Scheib from the Brandenburg Farmers' Association.The BBC skidded optimistically along to a pickup spot at the city's de-commissioned airfield, Tempelhofer Feld, but there were no veggie sacks to be seen.And when we sheepishly asked a local resident about whether she'd noticed any \"frei Kartoffeln\" in the area she seemed slightly mystified, if not a little concerned for me.Nevertheless, as potatoes took off out of Saxony, so has the story, receiving media coverage in Germany and beyond.However we are told by Schink that the influx is, as things stand, set to wind down in Berlin as the funding is drying up.One more truckload can be expected once the weather is warm enough.",

    "body": "12 hours agoKayla EpsteinNew York CityGetty ImagesLuigi Mangione in court in December 2025A man accused of impersonating a federal agent in a bid to allegedly free Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down the CEO of United Healthcare in 2024, has been arrested. Mark Anderson, 36, is accused of going to the New York jail where Mangione is being housed and allegedly posing as an FBI agent, a criminal complaint states. He allegedly said he had paperwork that had been \"signed by a judge\" to free the accused killer.Though the complaint does not name Mangione, a law enforcement source told the BBC that Anderson allegedly sought to free him. He appeared before a judge on Thursday but has not entered a plea. The BBC has contacted an attorney said to be representing him. Anderson approached the intake area of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn on Wednesday and is accused of telling officers that he was an FBI agent, the criminal complaint states. He said he had paperwork \"signed by a judge\" to authorise the release of an inmate.When officers asked him for credentials, Anderson provided a Minnesota driver's licence, claimed be in possession of weapons, and \"displayed and threw\" what authorities described as \"numerous documents\" at jail staff, according to the complaint. Bureau of Prisons officials then detained Anderson and searched his bag, where they found a large \"barbecue type fork\" with two prongs and a tool that resembles a pizza cutter.The suspect had travelled to New York City for a job opportunity from Mankato, Minnesota, and had been working at a local pizzeria, according to the law enforcement source.Department of JusticeAuthorities searched Anderson's bag after he claimed to have weapons and found these utensils, according to the criminal complaintAnderson is facing a charge of impersonating an officer. Mangione has been held at the Brooklyn jail since 2024. He was arrested in a McDonalds in Pennsylvania after a multi-state manhunt and then extradited to New York. He faces both state and federal charges in the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and has pleaded not guilty. Since his arrest, Mangione has attracted a legion of supporters both online and at his court appearances. The killing also launched a debate in the US over healthcare costs.Jury selection for Mangione's highly anticipated federal trial is currently scheduled for September.",

    "body": "Trump and his sons sue IRS and US Treasury over leaked tax information10 hours agoNardine SaadReutersUS President Donald Trump and his sons Eric Trump, left, and Donald Trump Jr, right, have sued the US federal government over tax leaks.US President Donald Trump and his two sons have filed a billion-dollar lawsuit against the federal government over leaks of their business and personal tax returns.The civil complaint, filed in Miami federal court, seeks $10bn (£7.25bn) in damages.The Trump family accuses the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) - the US-wide tax body - and the Treasury Department of failing to prevent the disclosure of \"confidential, personal financial information\" by a former IRS contractor.The contractor, Charles \"Chaz\" Littlejohn, is serving a five-year prison sentence after being convicted of leaking the tax disclosures to US media outlets.Ahead of the 2016 election, Trump said he would not release his tax returns because he was under audit, making him the first in almost 50 years to not disclose the documents. He said the same ahead of his 2020 re-election run. But then in September 2020, just before the November election, The New York Times published an extensive report on Trump's tax returns, revealing he paid only $750 in federal income taxes the year he won the presidency and no taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years.The lawsuit states that both the IRS and Treasury Department \"had a duty to safeguard and protect\" such disclosures from being shared publicly but \"failed to take such mandatory precautions\". Trump, his sons Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and the Trump Organization said in the lawsuit that they suffered reputational and financial harm, along with public embarrassment from leaks to the New York Times and ProPublica, which \"unfairly tarnished\" their business reputations, portrayed them in a false light and negatively affected their public standing, according to the filing.Littlejohn pleaded guilty in 2023 to stealing tax data from Trump and thousands of wealthy Americans while working as a contractor for the IRS. In 2024, he was sentenced to five years in prison.The lawsuit accuses him of weaponising his access to \"unmasked taxpayer data to further his own personal, political agenda, believing that he was above the law\".\"Littlejohn committed these crimes because he considered President Trump to be 'dangerous' and a 'threat to democracy,' and that disclosure was, in Littlejohn's view, necessary due to political 'norms,'\" the lawsuit says. When asked in a deposition if Littlejohn was looking to cause some kind of harm to Trump, he said: \"Less about harm, more just about a statement. I mean, there's little harm that can actually be done to him, I think... He's shown a remarkable resilience.\"Trump resigned from his namesake company and hundreds of affiliated entities in 2017 before taking office during his first term.",

    "body": "14 hours agoDan JohnsonBBC correspondent, JerusalemReutersMost of Gaza has been reduced to rubble as a result of the warIsraeli media report that a senior security source has said the military accepts that more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed during the war in Gaza.Israel has previously cast doubt on figures from the Hamas-run health ministry.But their figures have been deemed reliable by the UN and other human rights groups and widely cited by international media.The war began after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, when about 1,200 other people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which more than 71,660 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. It says at least 492 Palestinians have been killed since a ceasefire began on 10 October 2025. Four Israeli soldiers have also been killed.Israel has always disputed the Hamas figures and said before last year's ceasefire it had killed 1,600 fighters since 7 October 2023 and another 22,000 combatants in the war. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) previously said it believed two or three civilians had been killed for every dead militant. Now a senior military source has indicated to Israeli journalists, including those from Haaretz and the Times of Israel, that the total number given by the Hamas health ministry is largely accurate, even though they have not been able to break down how many were combatants and how many died as a direct result of the fighting.Following the latest Israeli media reports, a military official said the details published did not reflect official IDF data. \"Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels,\" the IDF official said.",

Russia received 38 bodies in return, Moscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said.Medinsky posted a photo on Telegram apparently showing the exchange, with individuals dressed in biohazard suits standing next to a line of white refrigerated trucks used to transport bodies.Kyiv and Moscow have exchanged thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the almost four-year conflict. The latest exchange took place under an agreement reached by the two sides during negotiations in Istanbul in 2025.Under that deal, Moscow and Kyiv agreed to return the bodies of 12,000 soldiers, as well as all sick and heavily wounded prisoners of war and those aged under 25.Vladimir Medinsky/TelegramMoscow's chief negotiator Vladimir Medinsky confirmed the exchange on Telegram The last swap took place in November last year when Russia returned 1,000 bodies to Ukraine and received 30 in return.There has not been an exchange of prisoners of war since October 2025, with both sides accusing the other of stalling.As the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 inches closer, efforts at brokering a peace deal between the two countries continue.The negotiations were described by all sides as constructive, but key territorial issues remain unresolved, including Russia's demand that Ukraine give up the 25% of the Donetsk region still under its control.Despite the ongoing negotiations, both sides continue to exchange drone attacks. At least five people were killed in Ukraine's Kharkiv region on Tuesday after a Russian drone struck a passenger train. Russia has intensified its strikes on key infrastructure targets in recent months, leaving many people in Ukraine to face freezing temperatures without heating or power.More on this story",

    "body": "21 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondent, ParisAFP via Getty ImagesThe proposed bill was approved in the French National Assembly on WednesdayFrance is to enshrine in law the end of so-called \"conjugal rights\" – the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex.A bill approved on Wednesday in the National Assembly adds a clause to the country's civil code to make clear that \"community of living\" does not create an \"obligation for sexual relations\".The proposed law also makes it impossible to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce.Though unlikely to have a major impact in the courts, supporters hope the law will help deter marital rape.\"By allowing such a right or duty to persist, we are collectively giving our approval to a system of domination and predation by husband on wife,\" said the bill's sponsor, Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin.\"Marriage cannot be a bubble in which consent to sex is regarded as definitive and for life.\"The law will erase an ambiguity that has persisted despite there being no explicit mention of \"conjugal duty\" in any legal text.Currently, the French civil code defines the duties of marriage as \"respect, fidelity, support and assistance,\" and it says that couples commit themselves to a \"community of living\".Nowhere in the texts is there any mention of \"conjugal\" - ie sexual - rights. The origins of that notion lie in medieval church law.However judges in modern divorce suits have, from time to time, given a broad interpretation to the concept of \"community of living\" to include sexual relations.In a famous case in 2019 a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was then granted a \"fault-based\" divorce implying guilt on her part.But the woman then took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which last year condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce.This was hailed as an important advance by feminist campaigners.The ECHR's decision has made it, in practice, impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling - which is why the new law is mainly intended as a clarification, with the change unlikely to have a major impact on the courts.For campaigners, the notion that wives have a \"duty\" to agree to sex with their husbands is one that persists in parts of society and needs to be confronted.The Mazan trial of 2024 – where a drugged and unconscious Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband - is seen as emblematic. Several defendants said they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them.In France, as in most other countries, marital rape is now enshrined in law, where prior to 1990 men could argue that marriage implied consent.Since November last year the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent.Previously, rape was defined as a sexual act carried out with \"violence, constraint, threat or surprise\". Now it is any act where there is no \"informed,  specific, anterior and revocable\" consent. Silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent, the law says.If you have been affected by any issues raised in this article, please visit BBC Action Line",

And number two, stop killing protesters,\" the US president said, adding that \"they are killing them by the thousands\".\"We have a lot of very big, very powerful ships sailing to Iran right now, and it would be great if we didn't have to use them.\"His latest remarks follow weeks of pressure on Iran to negotiate a deal on its nuclear programme.Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said armed forces were ready \"with their fingers on the trigger\" to \"immediately and powerfully respond\" to any aggression.Araghchi arrived in Istanbul on Friday for talks expected to focus on averting the threat of any military action by the US.Later, in a call with his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey was willing to help \"de-escalate\" tensions between Tehran and Washington, his office said.Trump made his latest comments at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania.Earlier this week, Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\" He warned that a \"massive Armada is heading to Iran\", and it was \"ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary\". In response, Araghchi said: \"Iran has always welcomed a mutually beneficial, fair and equitable NUCLEAR DEAL - on equal footing, and free from coercion, threats, and intimidation - which ensures Iran's rights to PEACEFUL nuclear technology, and guarantees NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\"\"Such weapons have no place in our security calculations and we have NEVER sought to acquire them,\" he added.Earlier this month, Trump said that the US would come to the \"rescue\" of Iranian protesters if authorities used violence against them. Demonstrations began in late December after a sharp fall in the value of the Iranian currency, but swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership.The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (Hrana) says it has so far confirmed the killing of at least 6,479 people since the unrest began, including 6,092 protesters, 118 children and 214 people affiliated with the government.It is also investigating approximately 17,000 more reported deaths.Iranian authorities said last week that more than 3,100 people had been killed, but that the majority were security personnel or bystanders attacked by \"rioters\".Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "Why China moved so quickly to execute 11 members of a notorious mafia family14 hours agoJonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondentCCTVDozens of members of the Ming family were sentenced in SeptemberNo-one should be surprised that China has swiftly executed the 11 members of an organised crime family from north-eastern Myanmar who were sentenced to death in  September.China executes more people than anywhere else in the world, according to  human rights groups – the exact figure is a state secret. Officials are often executed for corruption. The accusations made against the Ming family were far more serious.The Ming, Bau, Wei and Liu clans have dominated the remote border town of Laukkaing in Myanmar's impoverished Shan state, since 2009.They rose to power after General Min Aung Hlaing, the current coup leader in Myanmar, led a military operation to drive out the MNDAA, the ethnic insurgent army which had dominated Laukkaing and the area around it since the 1980s.The four families, as they became known, took over and began shifting from the old dependence on opium and methamphetamine production to a new economy based on casinos and, eventually, online fraud.Chinese Ministry of Public SecurityMing Zhenzhen and Ming Guoping in the custody of Chinese policeThey remained close to the Myanmar military; in December 2021, after seizing power in his coup, Min Aung Hlaing feted Liu Zhengxiang, patriarch of the Liu clan, in the capital Nay Pyi Taw and awarded him an honorary title for \"extraordinary contributions to state development\".His Fully Light conglomerate had lucrative businesses all over Myanmar. Other members of the four families were candidates for the military-backed party the USDP.The scam compounds they ran in Laukkaing, though, were brutal, much more so than scam complexes in other parts of Asia. Torture was routine.Tens of thousands of mainly Chinese workers were lured there with promises of well-paid jobs, only to find themselves imprisoned in the compounds. They were forced to run elaborate \"pig-butchering\" scams, where most of the victims were also Chinese. Complaints from the victims, and by the families of those trapped in the compounds multiplied on social media.The most notorious compound in Laukkaing was called Crouching Tiger Villa, run by the Ming family. In October 2023, during what is believed to have been an escape attempt, the guards killed several Chinese nationals. The Chinese authorities felt compelled to take action.With China's apparent blessing the MNDAA and its allies attacked and recaptured Laukkaing, as part of their offensive against the Myanmar army in the ongoing civil war. The MNDAA vowed to stamp out the scam business completely.They detained the heads of the four families and handed more than 60 of their relatives and associates to the Chinese police. Ming Xuechang, the family patriarch, or warlord, killed himself after being captured, authorities said.Getty ImagesShe Zhijiang, who is accused of building an illicit gambling empire in South East Asia, was extradited to China last yearDuring interrogations by the Chinese police one of the family members is reported to have admitted killing someone chosen at random just to demonstrate his strength.These details have been publicised by China to justify its tough treatment of the families. Five of the Bau family are also awaiting execution, while the trials of the Wei and Liu families have not yet concluded.The four families are ethnic Chinese, and had close ties to the authorities on the Chinese side of the border in Yunnan. Their abuses were too close to home for China, and the action against the scam business in Laukkaing has been the most decisive yet.China has also prevailed on Thailand and Cambodia to extradite two Chinese business figures accused of running scam empires, She Zhijiang, who built an entire city in Myanmar's war-torn Karen State, and Chen Zhi, who amassed wealth and power with his Prince Group conglomerate in Cambodia. The Chinese government has also brought tens of thousands of its citizens who were working in scam compounds back to China to face trial.The scam business, though, has simply adapted and evolved. It is still thought to be by far the biggest business in Cambodia, despite pressure from China and the US on the government there to shut it down.And it has kept moving to new areas in Myanmar, even as the more prominent scam complexes like KK Park and Shwe Kokko, on the Thai-Myanmar border, have been forced to close down.",

    "body": "2 hours agoMohammad Sartaj AlamBBC HindiMohammad Sartaj AlamEight of the 16 Indian crew members who were on board the tanker seized by IranThe families of 16 Indian seafarers held in Iran since December say they are anxious about the fate of their loved ones as the geopolitical situation in the region remains tense.On 8 December, Iranian authorities seized an oil tanker, MT Valiant Roar, while it was in international waters. They alleged that the ship, operated by Dubai-based Prime Tankers LLC, was carrying 6,000 metric tonnes of illegal diesel. The company has denied this. Apart from the 16 Indians, the crew has one person each from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.The Indian families of the crew members have approached the Delhi high court, asking it to issue urgent directions to the government to secure consular access and ensure their safe return.According to documents submitted by India's foreign ministry in a Delhi court, 10 of the Indian crew members have been arrested and moved to a jail in Iran while the others remain on board the ship. The ministry said it has now gained consular access to the 10 arrested men who are being held in Bandar Abbas prison. \"The Indian embassy has learned that the Iranian side will facilitate access to the six Indian seafarers on board the vessel once requisite clearances are received from the Iranian Navy/Prosecutor's office,\" it added.Relatives of the detained crew members allege they have been confined to a tiny room on the vessel without proper food or potable drinking water. While most of their laptops and phones have been taken away, one phone was returned, allowing them to have limited contact with their families, they said.The BBC has sent detailed questions to the Iranian embassy in Delhi about the allegations but has not received a response. Press Secretary Agha Mahdi Esfandiari said in a brief phone conversation that he had no information about Indian crew members being arrested or detained in Iran.The BBC has also sent questions to the high commissions of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Delhi about the status of their citizens on the ship.While Iran had granted approval for consular access to the 10 arrested Indians on 10 January, this \"did not happen at that time, presumably, due to the prevailing situation in Iran\", according to the documents.The political situation in Iran has been turbulent over the past few weeks. Widespread protests broke out in the last week of December, initially triggered by anger against economic grievances and later expanding into calls for a regime change.Since then, there has been a significant build-up of US military forces in the region, raising speculation of a possible strike.Getty ImagesIran has seen widespread protests since the last week of DecemberJugwinder Brar, owner of Prime Tankers, told the BBC that the protests in Iran had prevented the company's lawyer from meeting the crew. He also denied the allegations by Iranian authorities, saying that the vessel was carrying Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO), a marine fuel used for refuelling the company's other ships in international waters. \"This is standard practice,\" he told the BBC.He alleged that Iran also seized another ship owned by Prime Tankers in December 2023 due to similar claims of carrying illegal fuel. Of its 21 crew members, 18 were released after nine months, but three remain imprisoned, he said.Brar insisted that both ships carried valid documents for VLSFO and the company's priority was to ensure the safe return of all crew members to India.Brar and his companies, including Prime Tankers, are subject to US sanctions, with the treasury department alleging that many of his vessels operate as \"part of Iran's shadow fleet\" to transport oil.When asked why the US sanctioned him, Brar said: \"America is an unchallenged country; no-one can question it. It can do whatever it wants.\"He also claimed that Iran may have seized his ship as they \"probably thought that the ship had an American or Israeli owner\".Domestic fuel prices in Iran are among the lowest in the world, mainly due to heavy government subsidies and authorities have said they routinely monitor maritime traffic around its waters to crack down on smuggling of fuel.Families and company officials of the seized ship allege that the crew are being held in a small room, where they also sleep at night.A relative of a detained crew member told the BBC on Thursday that food and fuel - which the Iranian navy last supplied nearly a week ago - are running low. The crew also does not have access to potable drinking water.Another concern, the person added, is that most of the ship's generators have stopped working. This has led to problems with the vessel's waste disposal and cleaning mechanisms, leading to blocked toilets and unsanitary living conditions, they added.The ship was seized weeks before many of the crew were due to complete their nine-month contracts in January.Masood Alam, one of the 10 arrested men, is set to get married after Eid, which falls in March. \"We had a short call with him on 5 January. Since then, we have had no information. He was already suffering from fever when detained,\" his father, Ibrar Ansari, told the BBC.Gayatri Singh, wife of chief officer Anil Kumar Singh, accused Iran of using the crew as \"human shields\".Cargo disputes, she said, should be settled with companies, not workers.\"The company decides the cargo, not the crew. Sending them to jail is inhuman,\" said Pradeep Singh, general secretary of the Sailors' Union of India.",

    "body": "1 hour agoAmy WalkerandSuranjana Tewari,Asia Business CorrespondentReutersPanama's Supreme Court has annulled contracts allowing a Hong Kong-based company to operate container ports on the Panama Canal.The ruling comes a year after US President Donald Trump claimed China was \"operating the Panama Canal\" - the main shipping link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans - in his inaugural speech.The court found that laws allowing the firm to operate the ports were \"unconstitutional\", but PPC said the ruling \"lacks legal basis\".Trump has made repeated claims that the central American canal is under Chinese control. During his address last January, he said: \"China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China. We gave it to Panama and we're taking it back\".The following month, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also demanded that Panama make \"immediate changes\" to what he called the \"influence and control\" of China over the canal.Panama has previously rejected the US government claims and President Jose Raul Mulino has said the canal \"is and will remain\" in his country's hands.There is no public evidence to suggest China exercises control over the canal, although Chinese companies have a significant presence there.But Beijing's tighter political control over Hong Kong in recent years has changed how the company is viewed internationally. Its global assets - which include ports and logistics hubs - are now often seen through the lens of wider concerns about China's influence.Against a backdrop of rivalry between the US and China over global trade routes, as well as the Trump administration's focus on US dominance over the western hemisphere, the ruling on Thursday is likely to be seen as a victory for Washington.In a statement published on its website, Panama's Supreme Court said that after \"extensive deliberation\", it had found laws which underpin a concession contract between the state and PPC at the ports of Balbao and Cristóbal were unconstitutional.In response, PPC said the new ruling lacks legal basis, and \"jeopardizes not only PPC and its contract, but also the well-being and stability of thousands of Panamanian families who depend directly and indirectly on port activity\".Its statement added that it had invested more than $1.8bn (£1.3bn) in infrastructure and technology since it began operating the ports in 1997.On Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said that the country would take \"all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies\".Hong Kong's government also said it firmly rejected the ruling on Panama ports.The Panamanian court's decision could disrupt plans by CK Hutchison to sell its interests in ports worldwide to a consortium led by US investment firm BlackRock and shipping group MSC under a deal worth $22.8bn. Both firms have been contacted for comment by the BBC.The sale was widely seen as an attempt by CK Hutchison to reduce political risk in sensitive locations while raising money from valuable assets.Trump had previously hailed the plans, that would place key assets under majority US ownership, while the Chinese government had criticised them for not being in the national interest.Markets reacted quickly to the court decision.CK Hutchison's shares fell 4.6% in Hong Kong trading, pushing down the Hang Seng Index down by more than 2% - a sign of both the company's importance to the market and growing investor concern about political risk.Up to 14,000 ships use the 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal each year as a shortcut between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.The waterway, which handles about 5% of global maritime trade volume, is operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an agency of the Panamanian government.From October 2023 to September 2024, China accounted for 21.4% of the cargo volume transiting the canal, making it the second-largest user after the US.",

    "body": "33 minutes agoAleks PhillipsandAbdujalil Abdurasulov,KyivPA MediaThe US president said Ukrainians were \"struggling badly\" in freezing weatherUkraine has seen a relatively quiet night after Donald Trump said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had agreed not to attack Kyiv and \"various towns\" during a cold snap.The Kremlin confirmed it had received the US president's request, but declined to give specifics about what was agreed.While Trump did not say when the pause could begin, air raid alerts sounded in just eight Ukrainian regions overnight into Friday, with two minor injuries recorded in Zaporizhzhia.Temperatures in the capital, Kyiv, are due to plummet to -24C (-11F) over the coming days. Russia has recently intensified attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, as it has during cold periods since its invasion began.Kyiv has previously seen periods without aerial attacks, so it is unclear whether a quieter night in the capital was a result of any agreement between Trump and Putin.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Putin had received a personal request from Trump to halt strikes on Kyiv until 1 February, to create favourable conditions for peace talks, but declined to comment further.Ukrainian officials had been expecting a major attack this weekend ahead of the current cold spell - if that does not take place, it could mark a significant step in US-led efforts to bring the war to a close.Ukraine's air force said more than 100 drones and a ballistic missile were fired at regions near the front line overnight.But, as of Friday morning, there have been no fresh attacks on electricity or heating infrastructure crucial for keeping people warm.Trump told a televised cabinet meeting in Washington DC on Thursday: \"I personally asked President Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that.\"He added: \"It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it.\"The US president said of the Ukrainians: \"Almost they didn't believe it, but they were very happy about it because they are struggling badly.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky later wrote on social media that Trump had made an \"important statement about \"the possibility of providing security for Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities during this extreme winter period\". He told reporters on Friday that there had been no \"direct dialogue or agreement\" with Russia to pause attacks on energy infrastructure, but that Kyiv would act in kind if Moscow did so.Ukraine has targeted oil depots and refineries within Russia in a bid to limit its ability to finance its invasion.Meanwhile, residents of Kyiv who spoke to the BBC expressed scepticism about Trump's purported deal.\"I don't believe that Putin will stop even for a week,\" said Olena. \"We have seen so many talks and deals but, nevertheless, he continues to do what he wants.\"She added: \"We have survived -20C recently, and if air strikes decrease even a little, then we'll overcome the next week as well.\"Meanwhile, Hennadiy said he too did not believe Russia would stop targeting Kyiv's energy infrastructure, but expressed hope that it would.\"If we get a one-week respite, it will be good,\" he said. \"These days, -30C is a catastrophe for us. Before it was OK and we could cope.\"Olena said Kyiv residents \"really need a break\", with temperatures inside flats at around 4-5CRussian, Ukrainian and US negotiators met in the United Arab Emirates last week for the first trilateral talks since the war began in 2022.All sides described the talks as constructive, but while Zelensky said Russia pausing its attacks for the duration of the cold snap had been discussed, no agreement was announced.Instead, attacks continued, crippling the power supply to major Ukrainian cities, leaving millions without heating or electricity.Kyiv's Mayor Vitaly Klitschko has said 378 apartment blocks in the capital remain without heating.Electrical companies have been carrying out round-the-clock repairs, but their work can be quickly undone by Russian air attacks. Even when power is restored, the supply only lasts a few hours - enough to charge appliances but not to substantially warm up homes.A second round of peace talks, scheduled to take place in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, may now be postponed and relocated due to \"what's happening between America and Iran\", Zelensky said.Trump has threatened Tehran with military action over a crackdown on nationwide protests that human rights monitors say have led to thousands of deaths, as well as its nuclear programme.Negotiations on a peace plan have been mediated by the US for months, with a key sticking point being Ukraine ceding territory to Russia. Moscow currently controls around a fifth of Ukraine, including most of the eastern Donbas region. It wants Kyiv to hand over the areas of the Donbas it has not yet taken by force, while Ukraine reportedly wants Russia to hand back control of its largest nuclear power plant in Zaporizhzhia.\"We are not ready for compromises that violate territorial integrity,\" Zelensky said on Friday. \"We will not hand Donbas or the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Russians without a fight.\"Additional reporting by Ben Hatton",

    "body": "Healthcare, visas and whisky: What did UK and China get from Starmer's visit?4 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentGetty ImagesChina and the UK have called for a reset in economic relationsSir Keir Starmer's visit to China this week is the clearest sign yet the two countries are seeking to end the diplomatic \"ice age\" that has defined their relationship.Both leaders face economic pressures at home and are seeking new opportunities for trade and investment.For Sir Keir, the first UK prime minister to visit China since Theresa May in 2018, the trip was a chance to highlight the strength of British firms in finance, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, clean energy and car making.President Xi Jinping, meanwhile, aimed to show that China can be a reliable partner for Western economies, as US President Donald Trump continues to rattle the global trading system.Although no sweeping free trade deal was reached, the visit marked a cautious but tangible reset of UK–China economic ties.Agreements on visas, services, healthcare, green technology and finance, combined with revived dialogue, might lead to better access for British firms to Chinese markets and greater Chinese investment in the UK.What deals were agreed?The biggest commercial announcement came from AstraZeneca, which promised to invest $15bn (£11bn) in China over the next four years, to expand research and the manufacturing of medicines – the company's biggest investment in China to date.In the energy sector, British firm Octopus Energy is entering the Chinese market for the first time through a partnership with local company PCG Power to develop a digital platform for trading electricity.The project aims to improve efficiency in the power system and support China's efforts to increase the use of renewable energy.For Octopus, which has grown quickly in the UK, the deal allows entry into China's large and growing energy market, where demand for clean energy and digital trading is rising.Greg Jackson, CEO of Octopus Energy who was part of the UK's business delegation to China flagged that the country's scale and innovation have made solar, wind energy and batteries cheaper. \"Now there's a huge opportunity for Britain to succeed as we build the solutions that use these products to cut the cost of electricity,\" he added.China also agreed to halve tariffs on Scotch whisky, a deal the UK government said could generate £250m for the British economy over the next five years.\"Our whisky distilleries are the jewel in Scotland's crown,\" Sir Keir said. This is \"proof that our pragmatic, hard-headed international engagement brings benefits at home\", he added.Scotch whisky is a key export for Britain's drinks sector, with more than £5bn in annual exports. In recent years, China has been one of its fastest-growing markets.Industry groups welcomed the move, saying it would help Scottish distillers compete in a crowded market where US, European and Japanese firms are also vying for customers.Another outcome of the trip was visa-free travel for British citizens visiting China for up to 30 days for holidays and business, putting the UK on par with around 50 other countries, including France, Germany, Australia and Japan.Both sides also agreed to cooperate on disrupting migrant-smuggling networks, a top priority for Sir Keir's government. For Beijing, renewed ties with the UK - a major European economy and close US ally - signal that China remains a dependable partner for the West despite Trump's trade tensions.Economically, the reset secures access for Chinese exporters of high-value goods such as electric vehicles, solar panels and clean energy, while creating opportunities for Chinese investment in British services, finance and green tech.Chinese state media framed the visit as a step toward turning the \"potential of China–UK cooperation into real achievements that benefit both peoples and the world\".British firms were also quick to emphasise the benefits for both countries through the expanded partnerships.\"The prime minister's visit, the first in eight years, is a significant moment, signalling the importance of the economic relationship between the UK and China,\" Chris Fitzgerald, group director for international affairs at Octopus Energy told the BBC from China.\"Such partnerships mean we can bring affordable, secure, clean energy to British customers... And we can use our technology and know-how to bring some of the same benefits to Chinese customers.\"What challenges remain?Foreign businesses have long complained about the difficulties of doing business in China, flagging red tape, complex regulations, and a lack of transparency.These can complicate investment decisions and create uncertainty for companies.\"Any market has its own challenges, so of course we've got to be clear eyed and seek expert advice,\" Fitzgerald said.\"We have had good discussions with the Chinese officials who have welcomed our entry. And we have been careful to choose an excellent partner... So we are excited to take the immense opportunity that the world's largest renewable energy market offers.\"Sir Keir's Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, making the China visit a high-stakes test.Despite scrutiny at home, improving relations with the world's second-largest economy has been a priority for the British prime minister.The move, however, requires a delicate diplomatic balancing act.US President Trump recently warned that Canada could face 100% tariffs over deals struck with China during Mark Carney's visit, and he has warned the UK about deepening its commercial ties with Beijing.Sir Keir has insisted that Britain does not need to choose between Washington and Beijing, framing the reset as a pragmatic way to support growth at home while managing geopolitical risk.At the UK–China Business Forum in Beijing on Friday, he described meetings with Xi as \"very warm\" and highlighted the significance of agreements on visa-free travel and whisky tariffs.These offer British firms \"really important access\" and are \"symbolic of what we're doing with the relationship\", he said. \"That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important.\"Sir Keir's visit is one of a flurry of trips to Beijing, as leaders from France, Canada and Finland seek to hedge against an increasingly unpredictable United States.With Washington pursuing aggressive tariff policies and even making threats over Greenland, these so-called middle powers are looking to diversify trade and investment partners while securing new markets.At the same time, these countries will be watching closely the deals that the UK, Canada, France and others are striking with China.They will all need to remain competitive in attracting Chinese investment and accessing the world's second largest economy.",

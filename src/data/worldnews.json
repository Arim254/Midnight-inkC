    "body": "7 minutes agoIan Aikman andRachel HaganReutersA manhunt is under way for a gang of thieves who carried out a broad daylight raid on Paris's Louvre Museum and stole jewels described as priceless. French Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said it took just a few minutes for the masked suspects to carry out the robbery on Sunday morning, shortly after the museum opened to visitors. The gang appear to have used a mechanical ladder to gain access to a first-floor window, before smashing through display cases and escaping on scooters.Officials have not confirmed which items were taken but the gallery which was targeted is home to France's royal jewels.The theft led to the evacuation of the Louvre, which remained closed throughout Sunday.DIMITAR DILKOFF/AFP via Getty ImagesThe jewellery was stolen from the Galeria d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) at around 09:30 local time (08:30 GMT), the French interior ministry said. French media reported that the thieves used small chainsaws to gain access to the building. A government minister said three or four people were involved.A vehicle-mounted extendable ladder was seen leading up to a window a stone's throw from the River Seine, apparently having been left behind by the gang. No one was injured in the incident. France's Culture Minister Rachida Dati said one item had been found close to the museum, seemingly dropped during the getaway. Several French media outlets reported it was a 19th century crown belonging to Empress Eugenie, adding that it had been broken.According to the Louvre's website, the ornate crown features golden eagles and is covered in 1,354 diamonds and 56 emeralds.Beyond their commercial value, Nuñez said the stolen items have a cultural and historical value that could not be calculated, describing them as \"priceless\" and \"of immeasurable heritage value\".Police and staff usher confused crowds away from the LouvrePolice were seen turning tourists away from the museum, the world's most visited, throughout Sunday as people continued to arrive oblivious to the closure and investigation. American tourists Jim and Joan Carpenter said they were about to see Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa when security guards \"swept us out of the gallery\". The couple was ushered past the Galeria d'Apollon and out through an emergency exit, Mrs Carpenter told Reuters news agency.Mr Carpenter said there was \"lots of confusion\" in the museum, and guards told the couple there were \"technical difficulties\" when they asked what was going on.\"I knew something was up because of the way they swept the whole museum,\" Mrs Carpenter said.Mr Carpenter added: \"But it's great. This is our last day of a long trip and it's the most exciting part today.\"",

    "body": "The Spanish town of Terrassa in north-eastern Catalonia has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters to prevent potentially sinister \"rituals\" during Halloween.All requests for the fostering or adoption of the felines will be denied from 6 October to 10 November to protect them from being hurt or used as props, said the local animal welfare service. Deputy Mayor Noel Duque told broadcaster RTVE that adoption requests for black cats usually increase around Halloween.While black cats are often associated with witchcraft and seen as bad luck in Western culture, many other cultures, including Japan and Egypt, see them as symbols of prosperity and fortune.Terassa's city council said there had been no record of cruelty towards black cats in the town, however there have been incidents in other areas and the decision was taken after warnings from animal welfare groups.\"We try to prevent people from adopting because it's trendy or impulsively. And in cases like these, which we know exist, to prevent any macabre practices,\" Duque said.Terrassa is home to more than 9,800 cats, according to local authorities, and the town's adoption centre houses around 100 felines, 12 of which are black, the Catalan News Agency reported.The city council emphasised that the measure is \"temporary and exceptional\" and represents an extra precaution for animal welfare, but did not rule out repeating the ban in the future.Exceptions during the ban period will be assessed individually by the adoption centre and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.",

    "body": "2 hours agoRachel HaganEPAThe Taliban has accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital KabulPakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban government have agreed to an \"immediate ceasefire\" after more than a week of deadly fighting.The foreign ministry of Qatar, which mediated talks alongside Turkey, said both sides had agreed to establish \"mechanisms to consolidate lasting peace and stability\".Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said ending \"hostile actions\" was \"important\", while Pakistan's foreign minister called the agreement the \"first step in the right direction\".Both sides claim to have inflicted heavy casualties during the clashes, the worst fighting since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.Islamabad has long accused the Taliban of harbouring armed groups which carry out attacks in Pakistan, which it denies. Clashes intensified along the 1,600-mile mountainous border the two countries share after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks on the Afghan capital Kabul.Rumours had circulated the blasts in Kabul were a targeted attack on Noor Wali Mehsud, the leader of Pakistan Taliban. In response, the group released an unverified voice note from Mehsud saying he was still alive.In the days that followed, Afghan troops fired on Pakistani border posts, prompting Pakistan to respond with mortar fire and drone strikes.At least three dozen Afghan civilians have been killed and hundreds more wounded, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said on Thursday.A temporary truce was declared on Wednesday night as delegations met in Doha, but cross-border strikes continued.On Friday, the Taliban said Pakistan had carried out an air strike which killed eight, including three local cricket players.Under the new agreement, the Taliban said it would not \"support groups carrying out attacks against the Government of Pakistan\", while both sides agreed to refrain from targeting each other's security forces, civilians or critical infrastructure.Pakistan's Defense Minister Khawaja Asif said the latest ceasefire meant \"terrorism from Afghanistan on Pakistan's soil will be stopped immediately\", with the two sides set to meet in Istanbul for further talks next week. Pakistan was a major backer of the Taliban after its ouster in 2001 following a US-led invasion. But relations deteriorated after Islamabad accused the group of providing a safe haven to the Pakistan Taliban, which has launched an armed insurgence against government forces.The group has carried out at least 600 attacks on Pakistani forces over the last year, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project.",

    "body": "1 hour agoHafsa KhalilGetty ImagesThe Metropolitan Police said it is \"actively\" looking into media reports that Prince Andrew tried to obtain personal information about his accuser Virginia Giuffre through his police protection.\"We are aware of media reporting and are actively looking into the claims made,\" the force said on Sunday.Ms Giuffre, who took her own life earlier this year, said she was among the girls and young women sexually exploited by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and his wealthy circle.Prince Andrew has not commented on the reports, but consistently denies all allegations against him. Buckingham Palace has been contacted for comment.Ms Giuffre also claimed that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, including when she was 17 at the home of his friend Ghislaine Maxwell in London, in 2001.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges related to Epstein, her former boyfriend.According to the Mail on Sunday, Prince Andrew asked his police protection officer to investigate her just before the newspaper published a photo of Ms Giuffre's first meeting with the prince in February 2011.The paper alleged that he gave the officer her date of birth and confidential social security number.The Sunday Telegraph also claimed that Prince Andrew \"sought to dig up dirt\" on Ms Giuffre.Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, speaking on BBC One's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, called it \"deeply concerning\", adding that if true, \"it's absolutely not the way that close protection officers should be used\".On Friday, Prince Andrew announced that he was voluntarily deciding not to use his titles and giving up membership of the Order of the Garter - the oldest and most senior order of chivalry in Britain.He will no longer use his Duke of York title, an honour received from his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II.The prince had already ceased to be a \"working royal\" and had lost the use of his HRH title and no longer appeared at official royal events. His role now will be even more diminished.Prince Andrew email to Epstein does not suggest he broke off friendship - Emily MaitlisEmily Maitlis, who conducted the now-infamous BBC Newsnight interview in 2019 with the prince, said the move had been \"a long time coming\", adding: \"Six years has been quite a long time to wait for this.\"In the interview, the prince claimed he had severed all ties with Epstein in 2010 during a visit to his New York home. Speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Maitlis said she felt \"quite sick\" when emails emerged that had been sent in February 2011 from the prince to Epstein, suggesting their friendship had not ended.She had questioned Prince Andrew on his decision to \"spend four days - four nights - in a convicted paedophile's home\" to end their friendship, to which he had responded he had a tendency to be \"too honourable\".The February 2011 emails including one from the prince that read: \"Keep in close touch and we'll play some more soon!\", suggesting he had stayed in touch with him. \"The tenor of it, the idea not just that he was saying we're in this together, but signing off 'let's play some more soon', does not suggest that he had ever finished that friendship, that he had ever broken off with Epstein,\" Maitlis said.\"You're left really questioning, why he said that, whether the conversation ever existed, and how much more there is in that interview that we have to now go back and question,\" the journalist added.Prince Andrew has faced a series of scandals over recent years, including making an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022, after she had brought a civil case against him.A posthumous memoir by Ms Giuffre to be released next week is likely to cast further attention on the prince's involvement with her and Epstein. On Friday evening, Ms Giuffre's brother Sky Roberts told BBC Newsnight his sister would have been \"very proud\" of the latest development regarding Prince Andrew's titles, but that he would like the King to go a step further and remove the title of prince.\"I think anybody that was implicated... should have some sort of responsibility and accountability for these survivors,\" he said.Former BBC royal correspondent Jenny Bond told the BBC she believed \"public clamour for more action against Andrew is going to continue because these headlines are going to continue\". \"We have to remember at the heart of all this is not really the royal family at all - it's the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, and Virginia Giuffre being one of them.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoHugo BachegaMiddle East correspondent  , JerusalemGaza's Hamas-run civil defence says 11 people were killed, all from the same family, after the bus they were in was hit by an Israeli tank shell in northern Gaza.The Abu Shaaban family, it said, were trying to reach their home to inspect it when the incident happened in the Zeitoun neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday night.This is the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire eight days ago.The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza.Israeli soldiers continue to operate in more than half of the Gaza Strip, under the terms of the first phase of the ceasefire agreement.Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP news agency the victims were killed while \"trying to check on their home\" in the area.The dead included women and children, according to the civil defence.The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said a \"suspicious vehicle was identified crossing the yellow line and approaching IDF troops operating in the northern Gaza Strip\" on Friday, prompting it to fire \"warning shots\" towards the vehicle.It said the vehicle \"continued to approach the troops in a way that caused an imminent threat to them\" and \"troops opened fire to remove the threat, in accordance with the agreement.\"Hamas said the family had been targeted without justification.The IDF has warned Palestinians from entering areas in Gaza still under its control. With limited internet access, many Palestinians do not know the position of Israeli troops as the yellow demarcation line is not physically marked, and it is unclear if the area where the bus was travelling did cross it.The BBC has asked the IDF for coordinates of the incident.Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Friday the army would set up visual signs to indicate the location of the line.In a separate development, Hamas on Friday released the body of Israeli hostage Eliyahu Margalit to the Red Cross, which returned it to Israel.Mr Margalit was the tenth deceased hostage to be returned from Gaza. The remains of another 18 people are yet to be repatriated. Israel handed the bodies of 15 more Palestinians over to officials in Gaza via the Red Cross, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.There has been anger in Israel that Hamas has not returned all of the dead hostages' bodies, in line with last week's ceasefire deal - though the US has downplayed the suggestion it amounts to a breach.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult because Israeli strikes have reduced so many buildings to rubble and it does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into Gaza to be able to search for the hostages' bodies.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza.Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 67,900 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.",

    "body": "Just nowAna Faguy and Kathryn ArmstrongPresident Donald Trump said the US will no longer offer subsidies to Colombia, one of the country's closest South American allies.The US president announced the decision in a Truth Social post on Sunday, labelling Colombia's President Gustavo Petro as \"an illegal drug leader\" who has \"strongly encouraging the massive production of drugs, in big and small fields, all over Colombia\".His comments come after Petro accused the US of committing \"murder\" when it carried out a military strike on a boat in Colombian territorial waters in September.The move is the latest in a string of escalating tensions between the US and countries in Latin America, as the US military continues to strike ships in the Caribbean Sea it alleges carry drugs.Trump said because the US offers \"large scale payments and subsidies\" and Petro \"does nothing\" to stop the drug production, the US will no longer offer \"payment or subsidies\" to Colombia. According to a government website, the US provided over $740m (£551m) in aid to Colombia in 2023. It is unclear if all of that aid will stop, or when. In September, for the first time since 1996, the US declared that Colombia had failed to uphold its drug trafficking promises, and is ineligible for aid as defined in the Foreign Assistance Act. But the state department included a waiver that allowed Colombia to continue to receive aid. But following Petro's recent accusation of Americans committing \"murder\", Trump has escalated matters and says he will halt aid.Under Petro, cocaine production has reached a record-level and the country has failed to reach its coca eradication goals, the state department said in September. Petro has said the US violated his country's sovereignty killing a Colombian fisherman with its September attack. Posting on social media, he said: \"The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure,\" when it was struck. He added: \"We await explanations from the US government.\"\"Fisherman Alejandro Carranza had no ties to the drug trade and his daily activity was fishing. The Colombian boat was adrift and had its distress signal up due to an engine failure.\"Alejandro Carranza was reportedly killed on 15 September when US forces allegedly fired on his boat while he was fishing the Caribbean.Trump has defended the ongoing boat attacks, saying they are aimed at stemming the flow of drugs from Latin America into the US, but his government has not provided evidence or details about the identities of the vessels or those on board.UN-appointed human rights experts have described the US strikes as \"extrajudicial executions\".The escalation between Trump and Petro comes on the heals of another attack on a ship in the Caribbean sea. That attack, which happened on Thursday, is at least the sixth US strike on ships in the Caribbean Sea in recent weeks. At least 27 people were killed in the prior five boat strikes in the waters off Venezuela, according to figures released by the US administration.The Thursday attack, on a submarine, is the first time survivors have been reported, though the attack also killed two people.  Trump  said US intelligence confirmed the vessel was \"loaded up with mostly Fentanyl, and other illegal narcotics\". The US president said two people who survived the submarine attack would be returned to their countries of origin, Ecuador and Colombia.They were transferred to a US Navy ship, a source familiar with the matter told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. BBC SOUNDS: Why has Trump authorised CIA action in Venezuela?In recent weeks, Trump has ramped up threats against Venezuela's leadership over claims that the country is sending drugs to the US. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused Trump of trying to make the South American nation \"an American colony\".Trump earlier told reporters that he had authorised the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, and that he was considering launching attacks on Venezuelan soil.",

    "body": "20 hours agoAna FaguyGetty ImagesAfter serving 43 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, Subramanyam \"Subu\" Vedam was finally free. New evidence had exonerated him earlier this month of the murder of his former roommate.But before he could reach his family's arms, Mr Vedam was taken into custody by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), who want to deport him to India - a country he has not lived in since he was a baby.Now, Mr Vedam's legal team is fighting a deportation order and his family is determined to get him out of custody, for good.His family are now working to navigate a new and \"very different\" situation, his sister Saraswathi Vedam told the BBC. Her brother has gone from a facility where he knew inmates and guards alike, where he mentored fellow inmates, and where he had his own cell, to a facility where he shares a room with 60 men and where his history of good behaviour and mentorship is unknown.Mr Vedam has been repeating one message to his sister and other family members in the wake of the new situation: \"I want us to focus on the win.\"\"My name has been cleared, I'm no longer a prisoner, I'm a detainee.\"The 1980 murderMore than 40 years ago, Mr Vedam was convicted of murdering his once-roommate Tom Kinser, a 19-year-old college student. Kinser's body was found nine months after he went missing in a wooded area with a bullet wound in his skull. On the day of Kinser's disappearance, Mr Vedam had asked him for a ride. While the vehicle Kinser drove was returned to its usual spot, no one saw it being returned. Mr Vedam was charged with Kinser's murder. He was denied bail, had his passport and green card seized by authorities and was labelled a \"foreigner likely to flee\".Two years later he was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. In 1984, he was sentenced to a separate two-and-a-half to five years for a drug offence, as part of a plea agreement. That sentence was to be served simultaneously with his life sentence. Throughout that time, Mr Vedam maintained his innocence on the murder charges. His supporters and family members stressed there was no physical evidence tying him to the crime. Getty ImagesMr Vedam's exoneration Mr Vedam repeatedly appealed the murder conviction and a few years ago new evidence in the case surfaced which exonerated. Earlier this month, Centre County District Attorney Bernie Cantorna said he would not pursue a new trial against Mr Vedam.But Mr Vedam's family knew there was one hurdle left before he was free: he still had a 1988 deportation order, based on his convictions for murder and a drug offence. The family expected they would have to file a motion to have his immigration case reopened, Ms Vedam said. The facts of the case are different now, she stressed.But when they arrested him, ICE cited the immigration order as their reasoning for quickly detaining him in a different Pennsylvania facility. While he was exonerated for the murder charge, his drug conviction still stands, they have said. The immigration agency said it acted on a lawfully issued order.ICE did not respond to the BBC's request for comment, but told other US outlets that Mr Vedam will remain in custody pending his deportation. Mr Vedam's family has said his decades of good behaviour, completion of three degrees and community service while behind bars should be considered when the immigration court examines his case.\"What was deeply disappointing was that we didn't even have a moment to hold him in our arms,\" Ms Vedam said. \"He was held wrongly and one would think that he conducted himself with such honour and purpose and integrity that that should mean something.\"Potential deportation to IndiaThe family has stressed Mr Vedam's ties to India - where ICE has said they would like to deport him to - are weak at best. While he was born there, he moved to the US at nine months old. What relatives are still alive, are distant ones, Ms Vedam told the BBC.His community - Ms Vedam, her four daughters and other cousins - are in the US and Canada. \"He will again be robbed and miss out on the lives of the people closet to him, by being half way across the world,\" she said. \"It's almost like having his life stolen twice.\"Mr Vedam, who is a legal permanent resident, had his citizenship application accepted before he was arrested. Both of his parents were also both US citizens.\"We believe deportation from the United States now, to send him to a country where he has few connections, would represent another terrible wrong done to a man who has already endured a record-setting injustice,\" his lawyer, Ava Benach said in a statement to the BBC.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of George Santos, a former Republican congressman serving seven years in prison for fraud and identity theft. In a post on social media, Trump said Santos \"has been horribly mistreated\", adding: \"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"The former lawmaker was only the sixth in US history to be expelled from Congress, after a damning ethics report in 2023. Santos, who admitted to stealing the identities of 11 people, including his own family members, was released on Friday night, US media reported. He served less than three months of a seven-year sentence.\"God bless President Donald J Trump,\" said one of Santos's lawyers, Joseph Murray, following Trump's announcement.In April when Santos was sentenced a judge told him: \"You got elected with your words, most of which were lies.\"He reportedly cried in court and begged for forgiveness, saying: \"I cannot rewrite the past, but I can control the road ahead.\"Prosecutors argued that the novice politician had lied about his background and misused campaign funds to finance his lifestyle.In his post, Trump justified the move by criticising a Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal, whom he accused of fabricating his US military service. \"This is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\" Trump wrote.Trump has previously called for an investigation into Blumenthal over the claim. The Democrat has acknowledged that he misspoke on numerous occasions about his time in the military, but has said the mishaps were more than a decade old. \"This allegation of 15 years ago has been really rejected by the voters of Connecticut three times, overwhelmingly re-electing me,\" Blumenthal told CNN earlier this month. Santos's downfall began in 2022, after the New York Times published an investigation revealing the freshman congressman had lied about his CV, including having a university degree and working for Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.From there, the lies continued to pile up, including allegations that he stole money from a fundraiser for a dying dog and that he lied about his mother surviving the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Shortly afterwards, local and federal officials began to investigate.He was eventually charged with 23 federal felony crimes, and in 2023 became the first expelled member of Congress in more than 20 years, and only the sixth in history.A report from the House ethics panel accused him of misusing campaign funds for personal benefits, including Botox and subscriptions on the OnlyFans website.Santos defeated a Democratic incumbent in 2022, flipping the district that encompasses parts of New York's Long Island and Queens, where he grew up.Earlier this week, Santos published an open letter to Trump in the South Shore Press newspaper in Long Island, repeating his plea to be pardoned. The letter, which was titled a \"passionate plea to President Trump\" asked for \"the opportunity to return to my family, my friends, and my community.\"He wrote that he had been kept in solitary confinement after a death threat in August, and apologised for his actions. \"Mr President, I am not asking for sympathy. I am asking for fairness - for the chance to rebuild,\" he wrote.\"I know I have made mistakes in my past. I have faced my share of consequences, and I take full responsibility for my actions. \"But no man, no matter his flaws, deserves to be lost in the system, forgotten and unseen, enduring punishment far beyond what justice requires.\"Santos began serving his sentence in July at a minimum-security jail in New Jersey.Trump has issued pardons to at least two other former Republican lawmakers since returning to office in January.In May, he pardoned former congressman Michael Grimm, who pleaded guilty in 2014 to tax crimes.He also pardoned former Connecticut Governor John Rowland, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to corruption and fraud charges.Commutations do not void criminal convictions, unlike a pardon.",

    "body": "Chen Ning Yang, Nobel laureate and one of the world's most influential physicists, has died at the age of 103, according to Chinese state media.An obituary released by CCTV cited illness as the cause of death.Yang and fellow theoretical physicist, Lee Tsung-Dao, were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957 for their work in parity laws, which led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles - the building blocks of matter. Yang was also a professor at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and an honorary dean of the Institute for Advanced Study at the institution.Born in 1922 in China's eastern Anhui province, he was the oldest of five children and raised on the campus of Tsinghua University where his father was a professor of mathematics.As a teenager, Yang told his parents: \"One day, I want to win the Nobel Prize.\"He achieved that dream at the age of 35, when his work with Lee studying the law of parity earned them the honour in 1957.The Nobel committee praised \"their penetrating investigation... which has led to important discoveries regarding the elementary particles\".Yang received his science degree in 1942 from National Southwest Associated University in Kunming, and later completed a master's degree at Tsinghua University.At the end of the Sino-Japanese War, he travelled to the US on a fellowship from Tsinghua and studied at the University of Chicago, where he worked under Italian physicist Enrico Fermi, inventor of the world's first nuclear reactor.Throughout a prolific career, he worked across all areas of physics, but maintained particular interest in the fields of statistical mechanics and symmetry principles.Yang received the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in 1957 and was also awarded an honorary doctorate by Princeton University in 1958.Yang married his first wife Chih Li Tu in 1950, with whom he had three children.After Tu's death in 2003, Yang married his second wife Weng Fan, who is more than 50 years his junior.The pair had first met in 1995 when Weng was a student in a physics seminar, and later reconnected in 2004. At the time, Yang called her his \"final blessing from God\".",

    "body": "1 day agoFergus WalshMedical editorA blood test for more than 50 types of cancer could help speed up diagnosis, according to a new study.Results of a trial in North America show that the test was able to identify a wide range of cancers, of which three-quarters don't have any form of screening programme.More than half the cancers were detected at an early stage, where they are easier to treat and potentially curable.The Galleri test, made by American pharmaceutical firm Grail, can detect fragments of cancerous DNA that have broken off a tumour and are circulating in the blood. It is currently being trialled by the NHS.The trial followed 25,000 adults from the US and Canada over a year, with nearly one in 100 getting a positive result. For 62% of these cases, cancer was later confirmed.  Lead researcher Dr Nima Nabavizadeh, associate professor of radiation medicine at Oregon Health & Science University, said the data showed that the test could \"fundamentally change\" their approach to cancer screening. He explained that it could help detect many types of cancer \"earlier, when the chance of successful treatment or even cure are the greatest\".The test correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of those who tested negative.  When combined with breast, bowel, lung and cervical screening it increased the number of cancers detected overall seven-fold.  Crucially, three-quarters of cancers detected were those which have no screening programme such as ovarian, liver, stomach, bladder and pancreatic cancer.The blood test correctly identified the origin of the cancer in nine out of 10 cases.These impressive results suggest the blood test could eventually have a major role to play in diagnosing cancer earlier.But scientists not involved in the research say more evidence is needed to show whether the blood test reduces deaths from cancer.Clare Turnbull, professor of translational cancer genetics at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \"Data from randomised studies, with mortality as an endpoint, will be absolutely essential to establish whether seemingly earlier-stage detection by Galleri translates into benefits in mortality.\"The topline results are to be released at the European Society for Medical Oncology congress in Berlin on Saturday, but the full details have yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.Much will depend on the results of a three-year trial involving 140,000 NHS patients in England, which will be published next year.The NHS has previously said that if the results are successful, it would extend the tests to a further one million people.Sir Harpal Kumar, president of biopharma at Grail called the results \"very compelling\".  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"The vast majority of people who die from cancer do so because we find their cancers too late.\"Many cancers are found when they are \"already very advanced\" he added, explaining that the aim is to \"shift to earlier detection, when we have the chance to use treatments that are much more effective and potentially curative\".But Naser Turabi of Cancer Research UK cautioned that further research is needed to \"avoid overdiagnosing cancers that may not have caused harm\". \"The UK National Screening Committee will \"play a critical role in reviewing the evidence and determining whether these tests should be adopted by the NHS,\" he added.",

    "body": "10 hours agoIan AikmanBBCA large crowd gathered for the players' funeral on SaturdayAfghanistan has pulled out of an upcoming cricket series after three players in a local tournament were killed in an air strike it blamed Pakistan for.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said it would withdraw from November's tri-nation T20 series out of respect for the dead. The three did not play for the national team.The strike hit a home in Urgon district in Paktika province, where the players were eating dinner after a match, witnesses and local officials told the BBC.Eight people were killed, the ACB said. Pakistan said the strike hit militants and denied targeting civilians. The ACB named the three players who were killed as Kabeer Agha, Sibghatullah and Haroon, calling their deaths \"a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family\".The International Cricket Council (ICC) said it was \"deeply saddened and appalled\" by the \"tragic deaths of three young and promising Afghan cricketers\" in an air strike that also \"claimed the lives of several civilians\".\"The ICC stands in solidarity with the Afghanistan Cricket Board and echoes their grief,\" it said in a statement, adding that it \"strongly condemns this act of violence\".The attack came hours after a temporary truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan was due to expire following days of deadly clashes on the border between the two nations. Dozens of casualties have been reported.Pakistan said it had targeted Afghan militants in the air strike and that at least 70 combatants had been killed. Pakistan's Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said claims that the attack targeted civilians are \"false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan\".He rejected the ICC's \"selective, biased and premature comment\", adding it had not cited any \"independent verification to substantiate these claims\". Afghanistan Cricket Board/XThe Afghanistan Cricket Board shared this image of the three players who were killedIn a social media post, Afghan national team captain Rashid Khan paid tribute to the \"aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage\".Other players for the Afghan national side joined the tributes, including Fazalhaq Farooqi, who said the attack was a \"heinous, unforgivable crime\".On Saturday, large crowds of people were seen gathering at the funeral for the strike's victims.The strike came after Pakistani officials said seven soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near the Afghan border on Friday.The 48-hour truce between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which began on Wednesday at 13:00 GMT, has reportedly been extended to allow for negotiations.An Afghan delegation arrived in the Qatari capital of Doha on Saturday for peace talks with the Pakistani side. The Taliban government said it would take part in the talks despite \"Pakistani aggression\", which it says was Islamabad's attempt to prolong the conflict.Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Pakistan should \"reconsider its policies, and pursue friendly and civilised relations\" with Afghanistan.Pakistan's Foreign Office said on Saturday that Defence Minister Khawaja Asif would lead the country's delegation in Doha.It said the talks will focus on ending cross-border terrorism and restoring peace and stability on the Pakistan-Afghan border.Zimbabwe will now replace Afghanistan in the T20 series.",

    "body": "Scientists say seven skeletons found in a mass grave in Croatia were most likely Roman soldiers who lived 1,700 years ago.The male skeletons, all with various injuries, were found \"completely preserved\" during excavations in 2011 at the site of the Roman city of Mursa - modern-day Osijek - in Croatia's far east, a new research paper says.Mursa was conquered by the Romans during the first century BC and became a large settlement that was also an important centre for trade and craft.Now, researchers from several European archaeological institutions have been able to determine not only when the men lived, but also how they may have died.According to the paper, the men in the grave were aged between 36-50 years old, taller-than-average in height, and were \"robust\" individuals. Their diets were mainly vegetarian, but some had also indulged in a little meat and seafood.All showed various healed and un-healed injuries, including those caused by blunt force trauma, and there were puncture wounds on two of their torsos, which the scientists believe were likely caused by arrows or spear tips. All of the men were suffering from some kind of \"pulmonary [affecting the lungs] disease during the final days of their lives\". DNA analysis has also revealed the men had a mix of ancestry and that none appeared to be from the local area. The paper noted that the Roman Empire was a particularly violent era and that Mursa was involved in several conflicts. The researchers believe the men were likely victims of the 'Crisis of the Third Century', most probably the battle of Mursa from 260 CE, when there were \"numerous battles fought between various claimants to the throne\".The paper states that the pit the skeletons were found in would have originally been a water-well - several of which have been discovered in the area. It notes that mass burials and mass graves were \"not a customary way of interring the dead in the Roman Empire\", and were mostly used in extreme situations and mass casualty events.Given the various angles the skeletons now lie, the researchers say they were \"most probably thrown in\" the well before being covered with soil.Mursa has been of archaeological importance for years, with various ancient civilisation sites discovered in the area.",

    "body": "Why John Bolton case is more serious than those against other Trump critics4 hours agoKayla EpsteinBloomberg via Getty ImagesFormer national security adviser John Bolton arrives at court on Friday.President Donald Trump has made no secret of his desire to see his critics investigated, pressuring the Justice Department to prosecute former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.\"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" the president wrote last month in a Truth Social post.\"They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!)\" he said, referencing the four criminal cases he faced after leaving the White House in 2021 and James's civil case.Both have since been charged, in cases that many experts have said appear to be politically motivated and difficult to win in court.But the latest charges against a Trump critic, former national security adviser John Bolton, stand apart, legal specialists and former prosecutors say.\"I would say, comparing Bolton's charges to Comey's and James' is like comparing apples to oranges,\" said Mark Lesko, a former acting US attorney for the Eastern District of New York.Bolton has been criminally indicted on federal charges pertaining to the alleged mishandling of classified information. Since leaving the White House in 2019, he has become a vocal Trump critic, going so far as to call him \"stunningly uninformed\" and unfit for office in his memoir.Experts say that while there may be political reasons to go after Bolton, the procedures used to secure an indictment and the evidence compiled against him indicate a potentially stronger case than the Justice Department brought against Comey or James. \"This misconduct that's being alleged is both more serious and appears to have occurred over a significant period of time,\" said Carissa Byrne Hessick, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.During his time as Trump's national security adviser, and after his 2019 White House departure, prosecutors alleged that Bolton put the country at risk by improperly retaining and transmitting classified information to family members using insecure means, including AOL. Some of the documents were labeled top secret.The indictment alleges that at one point a hacker gained access to Bolton's account where documents were stored and sent an apparent threat to cause \"the biggest scandal since Hillary [Clinton]'s emails were leaked\".Bolton pleaded not guilty during a court appearance on Friday to 18 separate charges of mishandling classified information.Retribution or a strong case?The timing of his indictment - coming on the tails of charges against Comey and James - has renewed questions about political pressure on the justice system.Trump once suggested Bolton belonged in jail, and called him a \"sleazebag\". Bolton, for his part, wrote a book about his time in the Trump administration that was highly critical of the president.\"There's no question that the timing of this indictment, when combined with others, has raised questions about the strength of these charges, and why these charges are being brought now,\" said Jamil Jaffer, founder and executive director of the National Security Institute at the George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School.However, he added, \"if the Justice Department is able to prove the facts alleged and demonstrate the information is properly classified, his conduct may very well have violated the law\".Charging such a high-ranking official for mishandling classified documents is \"rare\" but not unprecedented, said Carrie Cordero, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security.\"Cases that involve classified information present challenges to prosecute, but they can and are brought against both low-level and high-level officials, from time to time,\" she said.Similarities to investigations into Trump and BidenTrump similarly faced charges of improperly storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and obstructing their return, but that case was ultimately dismissed by a federal judge and negated by his re-election as president. A special counsel also found that former President Joe Biden improperly stored classified documents from his time as vice president, but did not criminally charge him.Bolton's case bears similarities to Trump's and Biden's classified documents issues, said Mr Lesko, who also held a top national security role at the Justice Department.Strict procedures govern the handling of classified documents. To win a conviction, the government must prove that Bolton knew the information he was transmitting was classified, and he had to knowingly transfer it to someone not entitled to receive it.\"Because of the classified nature of the material at issue in this case, we don't have a lot of details about why the government believes things like the diary entries and the other information he communicated by email, and why there were classified,\" said Mr Jaffer.A more traditional prosecution The process by which the Justice Department brought this case will be under scrutiny, after Trump publicly posted his desire to see his political opponents prosecuted and some of those indictments came to fruition.But Mr Lesko said in Bolton's case, prosecutors seem to have followed protocol. \"The Bolton prosecution and ultimately the indictment seemed to have followed the regular process including the rules and norms within the Department of Justice,\" he said.Unlike Comey's brief, two-page indictment, Bolton's was a more \"traditional\" document that \"clearly sets forth the details involving the facts and circumstances here,\" Mr Lesko said.\"It seems fairly consistent with a long line of cases... where government officials mishandled and transmitted classified material.\"",

    "body": "5 hours agoIan Aikman andRachel HaganHostages and Missing Families ForumRonen Engel was killed on 7 October, the Israeli military saidThe daughter of one of the latest dead hostages to be returned to Israel from Gaza has said her father is \"finally home\".Ronen Engel's daughter, Mika, wrote on Instagram: \"It's not what we hoped, it's not what we wished for him, but it's finally here.\"The remains of Mr Engel, 54, a photographer, and 30-year-old Thai farm worker Sonthaya Akrasri were the latest to be returned by Hamas on Saturday. Both were killed during the 7 October 2023 attack and their bodies were taken to Gaza, the IDF said. They are the 11th and 12th of 28 dead hostages to be returned under the ceasefire deal.Mr Engel's wife, Karina Engel-Bart, and their teenage daughters were also taken hostage but were released in November 2023 during a truce between Israel and Hamas. The following month, the IDF confirmed that Mr Engel had been killed in captivity.Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that Mr Engel was remembered by loved ones as a man with \"hands of gold and the soul of an artist\".He was a photographer and volunteer ambulance driver for Israel's emergency service Magen David Adom.The second dead hostage returned was identified by Israel on Sunday as Sonthaya Akrasri, a Thai agricultural worker who was killed on 7 October while living at Kibbutz Be'eri. Thailand's foreign ministry announced his death in May 2024.He was the father of a seven-year-old daughter and had planned to return to Thailand to open his own farm, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said.Hostages and Missing Families ForumThe delay in the return of the dead hostages has caused outrage in Israel, as the terms of last week's ceasefire deal stipulated the release from Gaza of all hostages - living and dead. Hamas has said it is struggling to locate the remaining bodies under the rubble in Gaza.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has ordered the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt to remain closed until further notice, and said its reopening would be considered based on the return of the final hostage remains and the implementation of the ceasefire agreement.The Rafah crossing is vital for Palestinians who need medical assistance to leave, and for thousands of others to return.The IDF has stressed that Hamas must \"uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages\".But the US has downplayed suggestions that the delay amounts to a breach of the ceasefire deal, which President Donald Trump claimed as a major victory on a visit to Israel and Egypt last week.The text of the deal has not been published, but a leaked version that was seen in Israeli media appeared to account for the possibility that not all of the bodies would be immediately accessible.Hamas has blamed Israel for making the task difficult, as air strikes on Gaza have reduced many buildings to rubble, and Israel does not allow heavy machinery and diggers into the territory.UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told the BBC News Channel that the Gaza Strip \"is now a wasteland\", with people picking through the rubble for bodies and trying to find their homes - many of which have been flattened.As part of the US-brokered ceasefire deal, Hamas also returned all 20 living hostages to Israel. ReutersHamas says it has been working to recover the remains of dead hostages beneath the rubble left by Israeli attacks on the Gaza StripAlso as part of the deal, Israel freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza. The bodies of 15 Palestinians were handed over by Israel via the Red Cross to officials in Gaza on Saturday, the Hamas-run health ministry said, bringing the total number of bodies it has received to 135.Separately on Saturday, 11 members of one Palestinian family were killed by an Israeli tank shell, according to the Hamas-run civil defence ministry, in what was the deadliest single incident involving Israeli soldiers in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. The Israeli military said soldiers had fired at a \"suspicious vehicle\" that had crossed the so-called yellow line demarcating the area still occupied by Israeli forces in Gaza. There are no physical markers of this line, and it is unclear if the bus did cross it. The BBC has asked the IDF for the coordinates of the incident.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In September, a UN commission of inquiry said Israel had committed genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel categorically rejected the report as \"distorted and false\".",

    "body": "3 hours agoFrank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent, Jerusalem andPaulin KolaGetty ImagesThe US state department says a Hamas attack on Palestinians would be a ceasefire violationIsrael has launched air strikes in southern Gaza, after it said \"terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire toward IDF [Israel Defense Forces] troops\".The IDF said the attack in the southern city of Rafah was \"a blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement\" and promised to respond firmly.Hamas said it was \"unaware of any events or clashes taking place in the Rafah area, as these are red zones under the control of the occupation\".The ceasefire deal - part of President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war - came into force on 10 October. The first phase currently under way has seen the release of all living hostages as well as the return to Israel of 12 out of 28 of those deceased.Israel has freed 250 Palestinian prisoners in its jails and 1,718 detainees from Gaza, as well as returning 15 bodies of Palestinians in return for every Israeli hostage's remains.The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the 7 October 2023 attack, in which Hamas-led gunmen killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took 251 others hostage.At least 68,000 people have been killed by Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen by the UN as reliable.In its statement on Sunday, the IDF said \"terrorists fired an anti-tank missile and gunfire toward IDF troops operating to dismantle terrorist infrastructure in the Rafah area, in southern Gaza\".\"In response, the IDF has begun striking in the area to eliminate the threat and dismantle tunnel shafts and military structures used for terrorist activity.\"Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he had met top defence officials and instructed them \"to act forcefully against terrorist targets in the Gaza Strip\".Hamas's military wing denied knowledge of any clashes in the Rafah area. In its statement, al-Qassam Brigades said: \"Contact with our remaining groups there has been cut off since the resumption of war in March of this year.\"Therefore, we have no connection to any events taking place in those areas, and we cannot communicate with any of our fighters there, if any of them are still alive.\"IDF forces still occupy and control just over 50% of the Gaza Strip, having withdrawn to an agreed so-called yellow line.Hamas, which has ruled the territory for 18 years, is facing a challenge from armed groups, such as Yasser Abu Shabab's Popular Forces, gangs which it says are being armed and supported by Israel.It has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control in Gaza, according to local sources.A local source familiar with Sunday's incident told BBC News that Hamas fighters attacked a group affiliated with Abu Shabab in south-eastern Rafah, an area controlled by Israeli forces.The militants reportedly came under surprise tank fire, leading to a short exchange of gunfire before Israeli warplanes bombed the site.Residents living south of the nearby European Hospital said the strikes were accompanied by artillery shelling, with explosions shaking parts of Rafah.Under the Trump 20-point ceasefire, Hamas is supposed to relinquish its weapons so that it no longer poses a threat to Israel. Hamas has accused Israel of funding and arming rival gangs that it says have looted aid trucks. It says Israel is deliberately empowering criminal gangs so as to challenge Hamas' authority and foment chaos. Without the presence of a robust international force in Gaza there is a real risk of further fighting between Palestinian factions. More on the Israel-Gaza warThe attacks in Rafah came hours after the US said it had \"credible reports\" that Hamas was planning an \"imminent\" attack on civilians in Gaza, which, it said, would be a \"direct and grave\" violation of the ceasefire agreement.A planned attack against Palestinians would \"undermine the significant progress achieved through mediation efforts\", the state department said.The statement did not not provide further details. Hamas has strongly denied any planned imminent attack.The state department said it had already informed other guarantors of the Gaza peace agreement - which include Egypt, Qatar and Turkey - and demanded Hamas uphold its end of the ceasefire terms. \"Should Hamas proceed with this attack, measures will be taken to protect the people of Gaza and preserve the integrity of the ceasefire,\" the US statement said.The ceasefire agreement also states that regional partners will ensure that \"Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbours or its people\". Therefore, any instances or evidence of armed action by either Hamas or other factions in Gaza would be considered a violation of the ceasefire.Trump has previously warned Hamas against the killing of civilians. \"If Hamas continues to kill people in Gaza, which was not the Deal, we will have no choice but to go in and kill them,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social earlier this week.He later clarified that he would not be sending US troops into Gaza.Last week, BBC Verify authenticated graphic videos that showed a public execution carried out by Hamas gunmen in Gaza.Fierce clashes erupted a week ago involving Hamas security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City. Twenty-seven people were killed in what was one of the most violent internal confrontations since the end of major Israeli operations in the enclave.",

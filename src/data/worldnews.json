    "description": "Jeffrey Epstein appears to have confirmed that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.",
    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein appears to have confirmed that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was photographed with Virginia Giuffre, according to a newly released email.The message sent by Epstein - who is alleged to have taken the photo - reads: \"Yes she [Giuffre] was on my plane and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew.\"Epstein's account appears to contradict the former prince's assertion that he never met Ms Giuffre and his longstanding suggestion that the image of him with his arm around her may have been doctored.The July 2011 email was published on Wednesday alongside more than 20,000 pages of correspondence from the convicted sex offender and disgraced financier's estate.Ms Giuffre - a prominent accuser of Epstein - alleged Andrew had sex with her three times as a teenager. Andrew, who has denied the allegations, reached an out-of-court settlement with Ms Giuffre in 2022. It contained no admission of liability or apology.The email from Epstein to his publicist Peggy Siegal was sent shortly after Ms Giuffre was identified publicly in the Mail on Sunday.The newspaper also printed the photo of her with Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Andrew denied meeting Ms Giuffre and suggested that the photograph - or elements of it - may have been faked. Andrew said at the time: \"Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken.\"The documents - published by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee - also suggest that Andrew and Epstein remained in contact four months after the prince claimed their relationship had ended.On 4 March 2011, Maxwell appears to have forwarded a right-of-reply email from the Mail on Sunday to Epstein. It outlines a series of allegations, including that Andrew had sex with a young woman introduced to him at Maxwell's London home in 2001.The message appears to have then been forwarded by Epstein to Andrew, via redacted email address marked \"The Duke\".Andrew's reply reads: \"Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can't take any more of this my end.\"The Mail on Sunday went on to publish its story alongside the photograph. It included allegations that girls were directed to sit on Andrew's knee at Epstein's New York home, that he groped them and took part in sexual encounters on Epstein's private island. The documents also reveal attempts by Epstein to discredit Ms Giuffre's testimony.In the July 2011 email to his publicist, Epstein also wrote: \"The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think Buckingham Palace would love it. \"You should task someone to investigate the girl Virginia Roberts, that has caused the Queen's son all this agro [sic].\"The latest release comes after Andrew was requested by Democrats in the US Congress to answer questions as part of its investigation into Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking offences.A Democrat on the House Oversight Committee - Congressman Suhas Subramanyam - told BBC Newsnight that Andrew had not yet responded to the Committee's invitation to testify before the committee. He said the former prince \"doesn't have to get on a plane to testify, he can do it remotely\". Andrew was stripped of all his titles earlier this month after Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir renewed interest in his ties to Epstein and Maxwell.",

    "body": "9 hours agoPaul KirbyEurope digital editorAlmost a year to the day since French-Algerian writer Boualem Sansal was arrested on arrival at Algiers airport, the Algerian president has pardoned him and allowed him to leave the country.Sansal, 81, has been at the centre of a bitter diplomatic row between Paris and Algiers and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune's decision came in response to a direct approach from German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.The writer arrived in Germany on a military plane on Wednesday evening and was taken to hospital.French President Emmanuel Macron, who spoke to Sansal by phone, said France had used respect and calm to bring about his freedom.\"I thank President Tebboune for this act of humanity,\" said Macron.Although Paris had for months sought to lower tensions with Algeria, it was the German president's role that secured Sansal's release because of his good relations with Algeria's leader.French ambassador Stéphane Romatet, who was recalled from Algiers earlier this year for consultations because of the row, told French radio on Thursday that the crisis in relations was so deep that \"from the start we knew a happy outcome... would go through a trusted third party and the German solution quickly came forward\".Steinmeier said this week he had asked President Tebboune to pardon Sansal, \"given his advanced age and fragile health\", so the writer could receive medical treatment in Germany.Tebboune said on Wednesday he had decided to respond favourably to Steinmeier's request \"because of its nature and humanitarian motives\". Sansal is being treated for prostate cancer.He was given a five-year jail sentence in July for undermining national unity with remarks that questioned Algeria's borders.The novelist has long been a critic of Algeria's government, which had not responded favourably to France's appeal for clemency.Relations had already been on the slide after President Macron announced France was recognising Moroccan sovereignty of Western Sahara and backed a plan for limited autonomy for the disputed territory.Algeria backs the pro-independence Polisario Front in Western Sahara and is seen as its main ally.The spat worsened in April when Algeria expressed outrage after one of its consular staff in France was arrested over the kidnapping of a government critic in Paris.The crisis between the two countries was seen as unprecedented in more than 60 years since Algeria secured independence from France in 1962.Some French commentators and political figures blamed what was seen as a confrontational stance to Algeria taken by right-wing former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau and others on the right of French politics.Algerian minister Sofiane Chaib also blamed Retailleau earlier this year for the \"fabricated spat\".Then at the end of last month a motion by France's National Rally was narrowly passed by MPs opposing a 1968 Franco-Algerian migration accord that granted residency rights to Algerians.Although the move was seen as a potential setback, the decision to replace Retailleau with Laurent Nuñez as interior minister appeared to signal a new mood.\"He has completely changed the way relations with [Algeria] are handled\", ex-diplomat Jean-Christophe Ruffin told French radio.Retailleau responded to Sansal's release on Wednesday speaking of \"immense relief and great joy\".Tensions between the two countries remain, though, after French sportswriter Christophe Gleizes was jailed for seven years in July for allegedly trying to interview a member of a movement designed by Algeria as a terrorist group.French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot praised diplomats for their work in securing Sansal's release, and said they remained focused on Gleizes, \"whose imminent release we are hoping for\".",

    "body": "Some 200 Kenyans are fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine and more could be recruited into the conflict, authorities say. Among them are former members of Kenya's security forces, according to Kenya's Foreign Affairs Minister Musalia Mudavadi. Some of those who have been rescued said they were forced to assemble drones and handle chemicals without proper training or protective gear, the minister added.Kenyan President William Ruto last week requested the Ukrainian government to secure the release of Kenyans currently held in the conflict zone.About 1,400 citizens from across Africa are fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, with some recruited through deception, the Ukraine government said last week. A young Kenyan athlete was in September captured in Ukraine and said that he had been tricked into joining the Russian army.\"Recruitment exercises in Russia have reportedly expanded to include African nationals, including Kenyans,\" said Mudavadi in a press conference on Wednesday. \"Over 200 Kenyans may have joined the Russian military... recruitment networks are still active in both Kenya and Russia,\" he added. Kenya's embassy in Moscow has recorded injuries among some of the recruits, who were allegedly promised up to $18,000 (£14,000) to cover costs for visas, travel, and accommodation, the minister said. Mudavadi also said the Kenyan government had concerns about the increasing number of nationals who have been recruited into \"forced criminality\" such as drug trafficking and forced labour in foreign countries. \"These crimes present a serious threat to not only the national security of Kenya but to global security as well.\" In September, Kenyan authorities rescued more than 20 nationals who were preparing to join the Russia-Ukraine war near the capital, Nairobi. One person suspected of coordinating the recruitment of Kenyans to Russia was arrested and is facing prosecution in connection with the scheme.  The BBC has found evidence to suggest the Kremlin is working to expand its sphere of influence in Africa.South Africa recently launched an investigation into how 17 of its citizens ended up in the war-torn region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.Citizens of Somalia, Sierra Leone, Togo, Cuba and Sri Lanka , among others, are currently being held in Ukrainian prisoner-of-war camps, Petro Yatsenko, Ukraine's spokesperson on the treatment of prisoners of war, recently told the BBC.Ukraine has also previously come in for criticism for trying to recruit foreign nationals, including Africans, to fight on its side.",

    "body": "5 hours agoLiv McMahonTechnology reporterValve, the company behind PC gaming platform Steam, has revealed a new console to rival Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation.The Steam Machine is a home console designed to allow gamers to play PC games on their TV - though it can also be used as a computer.It is a spiritual sequel to the 2014 device of the same name, which failed to break into a market dominated by the three big gaming giants.Prices for those consoles, back then, started at $499 (£300) - but Valve's latest iteration is expected to cost a good deal more.The Steam Machine will go on sale in early 2026, the company said, with the pricing yet to be announced.The company says this and more details will be provided closer to the exact release date, which is also currently unknown.Since Valve launched Steam in 2003, it has grown to become the world's largest distribution platform for PC gaming.Around 25 million Steam players were online and six million were playing games at the time of writing, according to the platform's own metrics.But whether its new hardware can match Steam's success will remain to be seen when the devices launch next year.Analysts previously cast doubt on the Steam Machine's significance when it launched in its original, clunkier form a decade ago - saying its price-tag and potential might only really entice Steam \"power users\".In a video announcement, Valve described the new console as \"a powerful gaming PC in a small but mighty package\".The firm argues the device is \"optimised for gaming\" over other PCs because the firm is able to say which games on its massive digital storefront will work on it before you buy.Powered by its Linux-based SteamOS operating system and AMD graphics processors, Valve said the new Steam Machine can support 4k resolution and 60 frames per second.But industry expert Christopher Dring said its potential and appeal may be limited, comparing it to the firm's handheld Steam Deck console which has a \"lucrative but niche\" audience of \"around four to five million players\".\"Most of those people were already Steam customers looking to take their PC games on-the-go,\" he said.\"My feeling is the Steam Machine will be similar - this will mostly appeal to a lucrative enthusiast audience of existing Steam players who want to play their games in a living room setting.\".In an unusual move, Valve has also announced further hardware - its Steam Frame virtual reality (VR) headset.The device is entirely wireless - and it described it as a \"streaming-first\" device - but it is also itself a PC running SteamOS.And it also claims to be bringing a technical leap forward in the VR space, with the headset displaying highest-quality graphics only in the bits of the screen a user is looks at.With the sweeping new device announcements, Valve hopes to rival its more established competitors.In recent years, Microsoft-owned Xbox has placed its subscription service Game Pass at the heart of its offering for gamers - some say at the expense of its console crown.Meanwhile the PS5 has been the best-selling console for some time, but fans have been left asking when its successor will appear on the market.Brandon Sutton, games industry analyst at Midia research, said the announcements showed Valve's \"strong grasp of where the gaming market is headed and what gamers want\".\"With Sony and Microsoft moving away from console exclusives, and the prevalence of games streaming services, it has never been a better time for a PC-Console hybrid,\" he told the BBC.",

    "body": "The Nigerian government has announced it is cancelling a controversial policy that mandated the use of indigenous languages for teaching in the earliest years of schooling instead of English.Education Minister Tunji Alausa said the programme, introduced just three years ago, had failed to deliver and was being scrapped with immediate effect.Instead, English will be reinstated as the medium of instruction from pre-primary levels through to university.The now-defunct programme was launched by former Education Minister Adamu Adamu, who had argued that children learnt more effectively in their mother tongue.At the time, Adamu argued that pupils grasped concepts more readily when taught in \"their own mother tongue\" - a view supported by numerous UN studies on early childhood education.Nigeria's education system is facing serious problems, such as poor-quality teaching, inadequate materials, low pay for teachers and numerous strikes.Although 85% of children go to primary school, less than half complete their secondary education.Some 10 million children are out of school in Nigeria, more than in any other country, according to the UN.Announcing the reversal of the language policy in the capital, Abuja, Dr Alausa pointed to poor academic results from those areas which had adopted mother-tongue teaching.He cited data from the West African Examinations Council (WAEC), the National Examinations Council (Neco), and the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (Jamb).\"We have seen a mass failure rate in WAEC, Neco, and Jamb in certain geo-political zones of the country, and those are the ones that adopted this mother tongue in an over-subscribed manner,\" the minister stated.The abrupt cancellation of the policy has drawn a mixed response from education specialists, analysts and parents.Some have hailed the government's decision, agreeing that the implementation was problematic and contributed to falling standards.Others, however, believe the policy was abandoned prematurely. They argue that such a significant shift requires substantial investment in teacher training, the development of textbooks and learning materials, and a longer timeframe before it can be fairly judged and begin to bear fruit.Education expert Dr Aliyu Tilde praised the reversal, saying Nigeria isn't ready for such a move.\"Does Nigeria have trained teachers to teach in the dozens of indigenous languages in the country? The answer is no. Also the major exams like WAEC, Jamb are all in English and not in those mother tongue languages.\"I think what's needed to improve the quality of our schools is bringing in qualified teachers,” he told the BBC.A mother who has two children in early education schools, Hajara Musa, said she supported the reversal as it would help young children to learn English at an early age.\"English is a global language that is used everywhere and I feel it's better these kids start using it from the start of their schooling instead of waiting for when they are older,” she told the BBC.However, social affairs analyst Habu Dauda disagreed.“I think it was scrapped prematurely instead of giving it more time. Three years is too little to judge a big shift such as this - the government ought to have added more investment,\" he said.The debate highlights the ongoing challenge in Nigeria of balancing the promotion of its rich linguistic heritage with the practical demands of a national curriculum and a globalised economy where English proficiency is dominant.",

    "body": "Drugs disguised as tea keep washing up on this S Korean holiday island10 hours agoKelly NgJeju Coast GuardSome 28kg of ketamine, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found in the last two monthsSince September, residents on South Korea's Jeju island have been spotting small packs of what appear to be bags of Chinese tea washed ashore. Upon closer inspection, however, they were found to contain ketamine.Some 28kg (62 lbs) of the drug, wrapped in foil and labelled with the Chinese character for tea, have been found on at least eight occasions, police say.Ketamine is used as an anaesthetic in medical procedures, but its recreational use is illegal in South Korea. It can cause severe physical and mental damage, including to the heart and lungs, when misused.The Jeju Coast Guard has formed a team to trace possible sea and land routes through which the drugs may have entered the country.Authorities have also warned residents not to touch or open any suspicious objects found along the shore, asking them to instead report such discoveries to police.On 15 October, a beach cleaner found 20kg of these \"tea bag drugs\" - the largest haul in the last two months - along the coast of Seogwipo in southern Jeju.Earlier this week, a team of more than 800 soldiers, police officers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb the beaches in Jeju City, along the holiday island's northern coast, Korea JoongAng Daily reported. Investigators are now focusing on the possibility that the drugs drifted to Jeju via ocean currents, according to the national daily.It quoted the head of the Coast Guard's narcotics unit saying that similar discoveries of \"tea bag drugs\" have been made in Pohang, another city in South Korea, and Tsushima island in Japan. News1A team of more than 800 soldiers, police officiers and civilian volunteers was deployed to comb through the beaches in Jeju CityJeju residents have shown concern over the presence of illicit drugs on their coastlines. \"I often bring my children to this beach,\" said Kim, a resident who witnessed the large-scale search effort in Jeju City this week.\"Seeing so many people looking for drugs is terrifying. I shudder to think that children might touch something like that,\" Kim told Korea JoongAng Daily.Another resident, Hyun, wants authorities to focus on \"stopping more [drugs] from drifting in\".Yoon Heung-hee, a professor at Hansung University's drug and alcohol addiction department, suggests a larger syndicate may be behind the ketamine packets. Some syndicates use a \"sea bump\" method to transport narcotics, he said, which involves dropping bundles of drugs equipped with trackers into the ocean for retrieval later.Criminal groups could have sought to smuggle the drugs across South Korea via Jeju by \"taking advantage of lax inspections at airports and ports\", Prof Yoon told The Hankyoreh, another local newspaper.Additional reporting by Suhnwook Lee in Seoul",

    "body": "5 hours agoNichola Mandil,Juba and Basillioh RukangaSouth Sudan's leader Salva Kiir has in a shock move dismissed one of his vice-presidents, Benjamin Bol Mel, who had been tipped as his possible successor.Kiir stripped Bol Mel of his military rank of general and dismissed him from the national security service. He also sacked the central bank governor and the head of the revenue authority, both considered close allies of Bol Mel.No explanation was given for the dismissals, which were announced in a decree broadcast on state television.It comes when there are growing fears of political instability and a possible return to civil war, after the recent collapse of a fragile power-sharing agreement between Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar.Bol Mel, 47, was only appointed vice-president in February, replacing James Wani Igga, a veteran politician and general. He was also elevated to become the first deputy chairman of the ruling SPLM  party, which analysts believe gave him more powers and positioned him as a potential successor to the 74-year-old Kiir. The president later promoted him to the full rank of a general in the National Security Service (NSS).Bol Mel's promotion came despite the US placing sanctions against him for alleged corruption in 2017, which were renewed earlier this year. The US Treasury described Bol Mel as Kiir's \"principal financial advisor\". Kiir's office denied the description.Bol Mel has never directly responded to the corruption accusations against him and has not commented on his sacking.The president has not announced replacements in any of the positions he held.His dismissal follows speculation on social media about an internal power struggle in the SPLM.A senior government official, who preferred to remain anonymous for safety reasons, told the BBC that Bol Mel had been a \"divisive figure\" in government. \"It's good that he has gone,\" he said.A taxi driver in the capital, Juba, also welcomed the dismissal.\"Everybody hates this man. Even in his home town of Aweil people celebrated his dismissal. We are happy for President Kiir,\" he told the BBC.Hours before Bol Mel's sacking, his security detail was reportedly withdrawn from his residence and office in the capital, Juba.South Sudan is an oil-rich nation that became the world's newest country in 2011 after seceding from Sudan. It was engulfed by civil war two years later, after Kiir and Machar fell out.The 2018 power-sharing agreement that ended the war has been fraught with challenges, as tensions persist and sporadic violence continues to erupt.Planned elections have been postponed twice in the past three years and fighting between forces loyal to the president and armed groups has recently escalated.Machar was sacked as vice-president and arrested earlier this year and in September charged with murder, treason and crimes against humanity in a move seen as aggravating tensions and sparking fears of renewed civil unrest. The case is ongoing.His spokesperson described the charges against him as a \"political witch-hunt\".The charges followed an attack by a militia allegedly linked to Machar, which the government said had killed 250 soldiers and a general.",

    "body": "13 minutes agoAnthony ZurcherNorth America correspondent, WashingtonWatch: Republican and Democratic House leaders on ending government shutdownAfter 43 days, the longest US government shutdown in history is coming to an end.Federal workers will start receiving pay again. National Parks will reopen. Government services that had been curtailed or suspended entirely will resume. Air travel, which had become a nightmare for many Americans, will return to being merely frustrating.After the dust settles and the ink from President Donald Trump's signature on the funding bill dries, what has this record-setting shutdown accomplished? And what has it cost?Senate Democrats, through their use of the parliamentary filibuster, were able to trigger the shutdown despite being a minority in the chamber by refusing to go along with a Republican measure to temporarily fund the government.They drew a line in the sand, demanding that the Republicans agree to extend health insurance subsidies for low-income Americans that are set to expire at the end of the year. When a handful of Democrats broke ranks to vote to reopen the government on Sunday, they received next to nothing in return – a promise of a vote in the Senate on the subsidies, but no guarantees of Republican support or even a necessary vote in the House of Representatives.EPASince then, members of the party's left flank have been furious. They've accused Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer – who didn't vote for the funding bill – of being secretly complicit in the reopening plan or simply incompetent. They've felt like their party folded even after off-year election success showed they had the upper hand. They feared that the shutdown sacrifices had been for nothing.Even more mainstream Democrats, like California's Governor Gavin Newsom, called the shutdown deal \"pathetic\" and a \"surrender\".\"I'm not coming in to punch anybody in the face,\" he told the Associated Press, \"but I'm not pleased that, in the face of this invasive species that is Donald Trump, who's completely changed the rules of the game, that we're still playing by the old rules of the game.\"Newsom has 2028 presidential ambitions and can be a good barometer for the mood of the party. He was a loyal supporter of Joe Biden who turned out to defend the then-president even after his disastrous June debate performance against Trump.If he is running for the pitchforks, it's not a good sign for Democratic leaders.ReutersFor Trump, in the days since the Senate deadlock broke on Sunday, his mood has gone from cautious optimism to celebration.On Tuesday, he congratulated congressional Republicans and called the vote to reopen the government \"a very big victory\".\"We're opening up our country,\" he said at a Veteran's Day commemoration at Arlington Cemetery. \"It should have never been closed.\"Trump, perhaps sensing the Democratic anger toward Schumer, joined the pile-on during a Fox News interview on Monday night.\"He thought he could break the Republican Party, and the Republicans broke him,\" Trump said of the Senate Democrat.Although there were times when Trump appeared to be buckling – last week he berated Senate Republicans for refusing to scrap the filibuster to reopen the government – he ultimately emerged from the shutdown having made little in the way of substantive concessions.While his poll numbers have declined over the last 40 days, there's still a year before Republicans have to face voters in the midterms. And, barring some kind of constitutional rewrite, Trump never has to worry about standing for election again.Watch: Moment House votes to end longest government shutdown in US historyWith the end of the shutdown, Congress will get back to its regularly scheduled programming. Although the House of Representatives has effectively been on ice for more than a month, Republicans still hope they can pass some substantive legislation before next year's election cycle kicks in.While several government departments will be funded until September in the shutdown-ending agreement, Congress will have to approve spending for the rest of the government by the end of January to avoid another shutdown.Democrats, licking their wounds, may be hankering for another chance to fight.Meanwhile, the issue they fought over – healthcare subsidies – could become a pressing concern for tens of millions of Americans who will see their insurance costs double or triple at the end of the year. Republicans ignore addressing such voter pain at their own political peril.And that isn't the only peril facing Trump and the Republicans. A day that was supposed to be highlighted by the House government-funding vote was spent dwelling on the latest revelations surrounding the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Later on Wednesday, Congresswoman Adelita Grijalva was sworn in to her congressional seat and became the 218th and final signatory on a petition that will force the House of Representatives to hold a vote ordering the justice department to release all its files on the Epstein case.It was enough to prompt Trump to complain, on his Truth Social website, that his government-funding success was being eclipsed.\"The Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects,\" he wrote.It was all a very clear reminder that the best-laid plans and political strategies can be derailed in a flash.Follow the twists and turns of Trump's second term with North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher's weekly US Politics Unspun newsletter.

    "body": "What we know about new Epstein emails that mention Trump48 minutes agoNadine YousifGetty ImagesJeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump (pictured here in 1997) were friends for years, though the US president says he had a falling out with him in the early 2000sUS lawmakers have released more than 20,000 pages of documents from the estate of the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including some that mention President Donald Trump.Early on Wednesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee published three email exchanges, including correspondence between Epstein, who died in 2019 in prison, and his long-time associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.They also released emails between Epstein and the author Michael Wolff, who has written numerous books about Trump.Within hours, House Republicans released a massive tranche of documents to counter what they said was a Democratic effort to \"cherry-pick\" documents. They also said it was an attempt to \"create a fake narrative to slander President Trump\".The emails were obtained by the committee after it subpoenaed Epstein's estate as part of its own probe into the federal investigation of Epstein.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the emails were \"selectively leaked\" by House Democrats to \"liberal media to create a fake narrative to smear President Trump\".\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" she said.Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.What the Epstein-Maxwell email saysThe first email released by Democrats is from 2011 and is between Epstein and Maxwell. In it, Epstein writes to Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump.. [VICTIM] spent hours at my house with him\". Epstein goes on to write that Trump \"has never once been mentioned\", including by a \"police chief\".Maxwell responded: \"I have been thinking about that...\"The victim's name was redacted in the email the Democrats released, although the unredacted version is in the tranche released by the committee. That shows the name \"Virginia\". The White House said it refers to the late Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Epstein accuser who died by suicide earlier this year. In a statement, the White House said Giuffre \"repeatedly said President Trump was not involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever and 'couldn't have been friendlier' to her in their limited interactions\". Giuffre said in a 2016 deposition that she never saw Trump participate in any abuse. And in a memoir released this year, she did not accuse the president of any wrongdoing.Asked why the name was originally redacted, Representative Robert Garcia - the leading Democrat on the US House Oversight Committee - said the party will never release names of victims in line with the wishes of the families.What the Epstein-Wolff emails sayIn exchanges with Wolff, the author, Epstein discusses his connection to Trump, who - at the time - was campaigning for the presidency ahead of his first term in office. In a second email exchange released by Democrats, Wolff writes to Epstein in 2015 to notify him that CNN is planning to ask Trump about their relationship, \"either on air or in scrum afterwards\".Epstein responds: \"If we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\"Wolff writes: \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt.\"He adds: \"Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"Reuters\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" Wolff said on WednesdayIn a separate email from October 2016, days before the US presidential election, Wolff offers Epstein a chance to sit for an interview that could \"finish\" Trump. \"There's an opportunity to come forward this week and talk about Trump in such a way that could garner you great sympathy and help finish him. Interested?\", Wolff writes to Epstein.A third email released by Democrats is dated January 2019, during Trump's first term in office.  In it, Epstein tells Wolff: \"Trump said he asked me to resign\" apparently referring to his membership at the president's Mar-a-Lago club, adding, he was \"never a member ever\". Epstein adds that \"of course he knew about the girls as he asked Ghislaine to stop\". Responding to the release in a video he posted to Instagram, Wolff said: \"Some of those emails are between Epstein and me, with Epstein discussing his relationship with Donald Trump.\"\"I have been trying to talk about this story for a very long time now,\" he added.Andrew emailed Epstein in 2011As well as Trump, a released document also mentions Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly Prince Andrew.He responded to an email forwarded by Ghislaine Maxwell via Jeffrey Epstein in March 2011 about alleged sexual activity with a masseuse working for Epstein.Andrew's reply reads: \"Hey there! What's all this? I don't know anything about this! You must SAY so please. This has NOTHING to do with me. I can't take any more of this.\"Maxwell had forwarded a \"right of reply\" email from the Mail on Sunday on 4 March, making numerous allegations about Maxwell, Epstein, and then-Prince Andrew.The right of reply email states that a woman, whose name is redacted in the released document, was introduced to Andrew by the disgraced financier in 2001, at Maxwell's house in London where she had sex with Andrew.On 6 March 2011 the Mail on Sunday published a story including a photograph of Prince Andrew and Virginia Guiffre.Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing and has not faced any charges.White House says Epstein story \"a manufactured hoax\"Peter Mandelson contacted Epstein in 2016Lord Peter Mandelson, who was sacked as the UK's ambassador to the US in September over his links to Epstein, is also mentioned in the new documents.They show he was in contact with Epstein as late as 2016, according to the documents.The latest previous reported contact between the pair was when the then-business secretary took advice from Epstein in a banking deal in March 2010, just months after the American businessman's release from prison for child sex offences, as reported by the Daily Telegraph.An email from Epstein to Lord Mandelson on 6 November 2016, shortly after the peer's birthday, reads: \"63 years old. You made it\".Lord Mandelson replies less than 90 minutes later saying: \"Just. I have decided to extend my life by spending more of it in the US\".Epstein then replies \"in the Donald White House\", referring to the US presidential election due later that week.Epstein goes on to say \"you were right about staying away from Andrew. I was right in your staying with Rinaldo [sic]\", a reference to Lord Mandelson's now-husband Reinaldo Avilda da Silva.Lord Mandelson has repeatedly said he regrets his relationship with Epstein. He declined to comment on the emails when approached by the BBC.What the survivors have saidAnnie Farmer, one of Epstein's accusers and a key witness in Maxwell's sex trafficking trial, shared a statement after the emails were released. In it she said: \"The more information that comes out about Jeffrey Epstein, the more questions we're left with. Survivors deserve more than a trickle of information.\"Farmer demanded the \"full release\" of the so-called Epstein files and said \"the estimated one thousand women and girls who were harmed by Epstein and his associates deserve full transparency\".",

    "body": "US calls for international action to cut weapons supply to Sudan paramilitariesJust nowNatasha Booty, Tom Bateman,State department correspondent, At the G7 ministers meeting and Barbara Plett Usher,Africa correspondentReutersThe UAE is accused of supplying the RSF with weapons, which both parties denyUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio has called for international action to cut off the supply of weapons to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are accused of mass killings in el-Fasher. At the end of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in Canada, Rubio said the RSF had committed systematic atrocities, including murder, rape and sexual violence against civilians. Sudan's army accuses the United Arab Emirates of propping up the RSF with weapons and mercenaries sent via African nations. The UAE has repeatedly denied these allegations.The RSF has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023, when a power struggle between their leaders erupted into all-out civil war.Rubio's comments are some of the most outspoken so far by the Trump administration about the war in Sudan and the actions of the RSF, but it is not clear how much impact they will have. A previous US-backed proposal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Sudan has already been violated by the RSF, even though they agreed to it last week.El-Fasher was captured last month by the RSF after an 18-month siege, meaning they now control all of the cities in the vast western Darfur region.Only a small fraction of the population has managed to flee the city, where massacres are said to have take taken place. Piles of bodies on the ground and blood-stained earth are visible from space in satellite imagery. Non-Arab groups in the wider Darfur region are being systematically targeted by the RSF in what amounts to genocide, according to the US and humanitarian groups.At the talks near Niagara Falls on Wednesday, America's top diplomat said women and children had been targeted in acts of the most horrific kind by the RSF in el-Fasher.Rubio told reporters: \"They're committing acts of sexual violence and atrocities, just horrifying atrocities, against women, children, innocent civilians of the most horrific kind.  And it needs to end immediately.\"And we're going to do everything we can to bring it to an end, and we've encouraged partner nations to join us in this fight.\"However, Rubio stopped short of publicly criticising Abu Dhabi, in spite of evidence that the Gulf state is the RSF's main arms supplier, presented in investigations by the international media that the UN has found credible.The Trump administration is working for an end to the war together with the UAE, as well as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, who are allies of Sudan's military-led government, collectively known as the \"Quad\". \"I don't want to get into calling anybody out at a press conference today, because what we want is a good outcome here,\" Rubio said on Wednesday, but added pointedly: \"We know who the parties are that are involved [in weapons supply]... That's why they're part of the Quad along with other countries involved.\"In September, the Quad jointly proposed a three-month humanitarian truce, followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transition to civilian rule.The RSF waited until it had captured el-Fasher before announcing that it was agreeing to the truce. Sudan's army says it objects to the UAE's presence in the Quad but will still consider the proposal.In the meantime, there has been no let-up in the fighting.The secretary of state rejected the paramilitary group's attempt to blame the killings on rogue elements, saying this was false and the attacks were systematic. Asked by the BBC about his assessment of the likely scale of atrocities, he said the US feared that thousands of people who had been expected to flee el-Fasher were either dead or too malnourished to move. He said the RSF, lacking its own arms manufacturing facilities, relied on outside support, and called for countries supplying weapons to stop. The joint G7 statement also condemned surging violence in Sudan, saying the conflict between the army and the RSF had triggered \"the world's largest humanitarian crisis\".To date, more than 150,000 people have been killed and about 12 million have had no choice but to flee their homes.The flow of weapons into the country during this two-year-long civil war has been analysed by various experts.Amnesty International says it has found evidence of weapons manufactured in Serbia, Russia, China, Turkey, Yemen and UAE being used in Sudan.The smuggling route is often via the UAE, through to Chad, then into Darfur - according to a leaked report by UN experts.The UAE in particular is accused of providing arms and support to the RSF, who in turn are accused of using the UAE as a marketplace for illicit gold sales.On Wednesday, Rubio pointedly said assistance to the RSF \"isn't just coming from some country that's paying for it - it's also coming from countries that are allowing their territory to be used to ship it and transport it\".He also said he did not want to \"diminish\" the involvement of other actors in the conflict, saying \"that includes potentially the Iranians, at least money and weapons being flown into the other side\", meaning to the Sudanese army.All parties deny these allegations.A fortnight ago, the UK government came under fire from its own lawmakers following allegations that British-made weapons were ending up in the hands of the RSF, who were using them to commit atrocities.In response to one MP's demand to \"end all arms shipments to the UAE until it is proved that the UAE is not arming the RSF\", Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said at the time: \"The UK has extremely strong controls on arms exports, including to prevent any diversion. We will continue to take that immensely seriously.\"There has been a UN arms embargo on the RSF's stronghold of Darfur since 2004, but it has not been extended to the rest of the country despite calls from human rights groups.More BBC stories on the Sudan crisis:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "13 hours agoMark Poynting,Climate reporter and Matt McGrath,Environment correspondentReutersThe world's burning of fossil fuels is set to release more planet-warming carbon dioxide than ever before this year, new figures show.It is another sign that efforts to fight climate change by cutting emissions are moving far too slowly to meet international targets, as countries meet in Brazil for UN climate talks COP30.But emissions have grown much less quickly over the past decade as renewables have taken off, providing hope that the world's warming trend can still be curbed.And separate analysis by clean energy think tank Ember suggests that fossil fuel use in electricity generation has flatlined in 2025, largely thanks to the rapid growth of solar power.It adds weight to the idea that global emissions may be nearing a peak – even though it's hard to say exactly when that might come.Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for 2025 are of course an estimate, with the year not yet complete – but they show a mixed picture.Emissions from fossil fuels and cement are forecast to increase yet again to 38.1bn tonnes of CO2, according to the Global Carbon Budget team, which comprises more than 130 scientists from 21 countries.That would be up 1.1% on 2024.Emissions from changing land-use – such as permanent deforestation – are forecast to be lower than last year, however.That's largely due to the end of the natural El Niño weather pattern - which can drive higher forest losses – but is the continuation of a longer-term trend.It means that, altogether, total emissions from all human activities are expected to reach 42.2bn tonnes CO2 in 2025 - down from the 42.4bn in 2024, albeit marginally.What is clearer, the team say, is that emissions have grown more slowly over the past decade - 0.3% per year - compared to the previous decade's 1.9% per year.And over the past 10 years, 35 countries significantly cut their fossil fuel emissions while also growing their economies, they say. That is nearly double the number in the decade before.\"We're not yet in a situation where the emissions go down [as] rapidly as they need to, to tackle climate change, but at the same time there are a lot of positive [developments]\" said Corinne Le Quéré, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia.Emissions have been growing much less rapidly than before \"because of that extraordinary growth in renewable energy in China and elsewhere\", she added.Nearing peak?This effect of the renewables boom is highlighted by emissions in the power or electricity sector.Electricity generated from fossil fuels is forecast to flatline or even decline slightly this year, according to the think tank Ember, for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic.What's unusual about this year, Ember says, is that this has happened even though electricity demand increased sharply, rather than resulting from an economic recession.And this year's extra electricity demand has been more than met by wind and, particularly, solar.\"We've had decades and centuries where fossil fuels were the only way that we could really grow our economy, and over the last decade, that's changed for the first time,\" said Nicolas Fulghum, senior data analyst at Ember.\"Solar power is growing at a record pace, and faster than any electricity source in history,\" he added.What happens in the power sector is particularly important in the fight against climate change.It is the single biggest emitting sector and is expected to play an increasing role in the energy system as more people buy electric cars, heat pumps and other technologies.\"Whatever happens in the power sector has an outsized influence on what happens for emissions worldwide,\" said Mr Fulghum.Ember is confident that emissions from using fossil fuels to generate electricity are now plateauing and could begin a permanent decline in a few years.That echoes yesterday's message from the International Energy Agency, the global energy watchdog.Carbon emissions from energy systems – more than just electricity - could peak within the next few years, based on countries' stated policies, it said.While there is still uncertainty about the exact timing of a peak, it would undoubtedly be a landmark moment in the fight against climate change.It would not halt warming, however, as countries would still be adding CO2 to the atmosphere - just at a slower rate.\"As long as we emit CO2, the warming will continue… to stop further warming, we have to bring [net] emissions to zero,\" said Prof Pierre Friedlingstein, chair in mathematical modelling of climate systems at the University of Exeter.And another analysis released today to coincide with COP30 offers a reality check.The Climate Action Tracker research group finds that warming could reach 2.6C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century based on current policies – a figure which has barely changed over the past few years.\"It's very clear that we have never had a better chance to do this. It's also clear that we've never been in a worse situation,\" said Dr Bill Hare, from the Climate Action Tracker team.\"So it's a diabolical dilemma. Things could go really badly. We could walk away from this COP without taking the right kind of action, and entrenching fossil gas and oil, and we'll push towards 2.5C [or] 3C warming for sure,\" he added.\"But on the other hand, the chance is there… to do exactly the opposite, and to build on the momentum of the technology changes going on globally.\"",

    "body": "'There's a bit of anxiety': Stranger Things cast and creators on the show's end16 hours agoYasmin RufoBBC News NetflixMillie Bobby Brown previously told the BBC that it was \"incredibly emotional\" filming the finale After five seasons, Stranger Things is coming to an end - but another portal is already opening as the creators behind the show, twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer, tell the BBC a spin-off series is already in development.\"It's early days but we're excited about it,\" says Matt Duffer. \"It's new characters and a new mystery, so it's different, but it will be in the same world as Stranger Things.\"The pair feel that there is more to explore, but Matt's twin brother Ross explains they always saw the original story as a self-contained arc and it's definitely \"the end for these characters\".The clarity around the ending had always been part of the plan, and Matt says the final scene \"was the one thing we had planned from the start\".\"We always knew what we were working towards so it was like our north star and we built the whole season around the final scene.\"Season five is set in the autumn of 1987. Hawkins, Indiana, is scarred by the opening of the Rifts and the group of friends must find and kill Vecna. At the same time, the town is under military quarantine as the hunt for Eleven intensifies.The brothers, who were in their early thirties when the show began, had always planned for four or five seasons, but say it still feels surreal that they managed to get that far.Getty ImagesMatt and Ross Duffer say they took inspiration from the likes of Steven Spielberg and Stephen King when creating Stranger ThingsWhat started as a nostalgic horror about a missing boy in a sleepy town quickly grew into one of Netflix's biggest global hits.\"When you're making the show, you're so entrenched in it that you forget how far it's come, and every season we put everything we have into it,\" Ross says. \"And when we made season one, we didn't even know if we'd get a second.\"It's a feeling the cast shared. Joe Keery, whose character Steve Harrington goes from a high school jock to a heroic mentor-like figure, tells the BBC he remembers saying goodbye to everyone after season one and not being sure if he would see them again.\"Season one felt like an indie film and now it's this crazy big-budget movie,\" the 33-year-old says in disbelief.By the time the final season wrapped, after a year of filming, \"it felt like we'd been working on it forever\".\"But we had a great time making it and the friendships we made aren't going anywhere. We will still be in each other's lives.\"Natalia Dyer, who plays Nancy Wheeler, says the friendships they've built off camera mirror those of their on-screen characters.\"These characters have this shared secret world they all know about and in real life, we have something similar as we're the only people who know the show inside-out.\"Charlie Heaton, who plays Natalia's on-screen boyfriend Jonathan Byers, agrees and explains that \"the events in the show change these characters' lives forever, and similarly this show has changed our lives forever\".NetflixThere have been reports that not everything has been plain sailing. The Mail on Sunday recently reported that Millie Bobby Brown filed a harassment and bullying claim against her co-star David Harbour, but that hasn't been confirmed.However, the cast insist there's a close friendship between everyone, while the Duffer brothers say they felt an immense responsibility to protect the younger cast throughout filming.\"When we cast them we didn't know the show was going to be what it was and you hear so many horror stories about young people that become famous as the spotlight can be harsh,\" Ross says.\"I think it helped that there were so many younger cast members so they weren't going through anything alone and could turn to each other during challenging times.\"That solidarity was a vital help for Finn Wolfhard, who plays Mike Wheeler and says growing up in the spotlight was a challenge \"because you're going through puberty and a life change like being part of Stranger Things at the same time\".His on-screen, and perhaps also off-screen, best friends Caleb McLaughlin and Gaten Matarazzo agree, and the trio start laughing about how young they were when they first met.NetflixI ask the young men how they feel about the show ending and stepping into new projects, and Gaten is first to admit they feel some trepidation.\"I'm a bit shaky and there is a bit of anxiety, but I think that's the point.\"The 23-year-old, who plays Dustin Henderson, says now feels like a good time to step into a period of unknown.\"Your twenties are all about change, transition and growing, and we're incredibly lucky to be in a position to establish consistency in our careers.\"I see that as a real blessing and I look at it optimistically as I can because it is scary to not have the comfort of knowing there's another Stranger Things season.\"The legacy of the show is undeniable - it's transformed a cast of newcomers into stars and spawned a global fanbase who have grown up alongside it.Caleb hopes that connection lasts and the show \"lives on and becomes one of those things that people will rewatch and never get tired of, like a classic film\".Knowing the impact of the show made saying goodbye even harder, and the final day of shooting is something Caleb won't forget for a while.\"Everyone was there and it bought us back to episode one - that feeling of home, being supported and loved, and everyone was on the same page in terms of their connection with the show,\" he says.Netflix has announced an animated follow-up, while details of the Duffer brothers' live-action spin-off are still under wraps.It's the end of an era for the current cast. But would they reunite for another project?\"Our part of the Stranger Things story is done for now,\" Gaten says. \"But if they called us in a while, who knows?\" The first four episodes of season five will be available in the US from 26 November, with the next three arriving on Christmas Day, and the finale on New Year's Eve. In the UK those releases will be a day later.",

    "body": "16 hours agoSoutik BiswasIndia correspondentPraful Gangurde/Hindustan Times via Getty ImagesMembers of India's Banjara community demand reservation benefits in MumbaiCounting castes in India has always been about more than numbers - it is about who gets a share of government benefits and who doesn't.The country's next national census, scheduled for 2027, will -  for the first time in nearly a century - count every caste, a social hierarchy that has long outlived kingdoms, empires and ideologies. The move ends decades of political hesitation and follows pressure from opposition parties and at least three states that have already gone ahead with their own surveys. A 2011 survey - neither run nor verified by census authorities or released by the government - recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names.A full count of castes promises a sharper picture of who truly benefits from affirmative action and who is left behind. Advocates say it could make welfare spending more targeted and help recalibrate quotas in jobs and education with hard evidence. Yet in a provocative new book, The Caste Con Census, scholar-activist Anand Teltumbde warns that the exercise may harden the deeply discriminatory caste system, when the need is to dismantle it.The argument cuts against the prevailing view that better data will produce fairer policy. For Mr Teltumbde, castes are \"too pernicious to be managed for any progressive purpose\". \"Caste is, at its core, a hierarchy seeking impulse that defies measurement,\" he writes.Mr Teltumbde sees the modern caste census as a colonial echo.British administrators began counting castes in 1871 as a \"deliberate response to the post-1857 unity of Indians across caste and religion\", turning it into an \"effective tool of imperial control\". They held six caste censuses between 1871 and 1931 - the last full caste enumeration in India.Each count, Mr Teltumbde argues, \"did not merely record caste, but reified and hardened it\". Independent India, in Mr Teltumbde's reading, preserved the system under the moral banner of social justice, \"while effectively evading its core obligation of building the capacities of all people, which is a prerequisite for the success of any genuine social justice policy\". The obsession with counting, he says, bureaucratises inequality. By turning caste into a ledger of entitlements and grievances, the census reduces politics to arithmetic - who gets how much - rather than addressing what Mr Teltumbde calls the \"architecture of social injustice\".He sees the demand for a caste census as a push for more reservations - a cause driven by an \"upwardly mobile minority\", while the majority slips into deprivation and dependence on state aid. Nearly 800 million Indians, he notes, now rely on free rations.Fairfax Media via Getty ImagesA 2011 unreleased survey recorded an astonishing 4.6 million caste names in IndiaAffirmative action quotas were first reserved for Dalits - formerly known as untouchables - and Adivasis (tribespeople), India's most oppressed groups. But soon, the less disadvantaged \"other backward classes\" (OBCs) began clamouring for a share of the pie. Politics quickly coalesced around demands for new or bigger caste-based quotas.Mr Teltumbde's deeper worry is that enumeration legitimises what it measures. Political parties, he warns, will exploit the data to redraw quotas or convert caste resentment into electoral capital. For Mr Teltumbde, the only rational politics is one of \"annihilation of caste\", not its management - echoing what BR Ambedkar, the architect of India's constitution, argued when he said that caste cannot be reformed, it \"must be destroyed\".But in an India where even its victims \"see value in its preservation\", that goal feels utopian, the author admits. The looming caste census, Mr Teltumbde argues, will not expose inequality but entrench it.Many scholars don't quite agree, seeing the census as a necessary tool for achieving social justice. Sociologist Satish Deshpande and economist Mary E John call the decision not to count castes \"one of independent India's biggest mistakes\".Today, they note in a paper, caste has come to be seen as the burden only of India's lower castes - Dalits and Adivasis - who must constantly prove their identity through official labels. What's needed, they write, is \"a fuller, more inclusive picture where everyone must answer the question of their caste\". This isn't an \"endorsement of an unequal system\", they stress, but a recognition that \"there is no caste disprivilege without a corresponding privilege accruing to some other caste\".In other words, the lack of reliable caste data obscures both privilege and deprivation.Sociologist and demographer Sonalde Desai told me that without a fresh caste census, India's affirmative action policies operate \"blindly\", relying on outdated colonial data.\"If surveys and censuses could shape social reality, we would not need social policies. We could simply start asking questions about domestic violence to shame people into refraining from wife-beating. We have not asked any questions in the census about caste since 1931. Has it eliminated caste equations?\" she asks.AFP via Getty ImagesBR Ambedkar, architect of India's constitution, argued that caste must be destroyed Political scientist Sudha Pai, however, broadly agrees with Mr Teltumbde's critique that counting castes can solidify identities and distract from deeper inequalities based on \"land, education, power and dignity\". Yet she acknowledges that caste has already been politicised through welfare and electoral strategies, making a caste census inevitable.\"A caste census would be useful if the income levels within each caste group are collected. The government could then use the data collected to identify within each caste the needs of the truly needy and offer them the required benefits and opportunities, such as education and jobs for upward mobility,\" Dr Pai says.\"This would require moving away from simply using caste as the parameter for redistribution of available resources, to use of both caste and income levels in policymaking.\"Dr Pai argues that if done \"thoughtfully\" - linking caste data to income and educational indicators - it could shift India from a \"caste-based to a rights-based welfare system\".Yet, scholars warn that counting castes and interpreting the data will be fraught with challenges.\"It won't be painless. India has changed tremendously in the century since 1931. Castes that were designated as being poor and vulnerable may have moved out of poverty, some new vulnerabilities may have emerged. So if we are to engage in this exercise honestly, it cannot be done without reshuffling the groups that are eligible for benefits,\" says Professor Desai.Another challenge lies in data collection - castes have many subgroups, raising questions about the right level of classification. Sub-categorisation aims to divide broader caste groups into smaller ones so the most disadvantaged among them receive a fair share of quotas and benefits.\"Castes are not made of a single layer. There are many subgroups within a single caste. What level of aggregation should be used? How will the respondents in a census respond to this question? This requires substantial experimentation. I do not believe this has yet been done,\" says Prof Desai.Mr Teltumbde remains unconvinced. He argues that endless enumeration cannot remedy a system built on hierarchy. \"You will be counting all your life and still not solve the caste problem. So what will be the use of that counting?,\" he wonders. \"I am not against affirmative action, but this is not the way to do it.\"",

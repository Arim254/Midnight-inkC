EU parliament votes to ban meat names for plant-based foods</h2><p></p><div><div><p>9 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Danai Nesta Kupemba</span><span>BBC News</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The European Parliament (EP) has voted to ban the use of words like \"burger\" or \"steak\" to describe their plant-based variants.</p><p>The 355-247 majority vote is seen as a victory for livestock farmers who say the labels threaten their industry and livelihoods. </p><p>A full ban, however, is not imminent - or even certain - as the proposal needs the backing of the European Commission - the EU's executive arm - as well as the governments of the 27 member countries to become law. </p><p>The plant-based food industry has grown exponentially in recent years, with more people opting for a meat-free lifestyle.</p></div><div><p>\"Let's call a spade a spade,\" Celine Imart, the French member of the parliament who led the initiative was quoted by AFP news agency as saying about plant-based products. </p><p>Marketing plant-based products using meat labels \"is misleading for the consumer\", the member of the conservative EPP group in the EP said. </p><p>Under the proposal, other labels like, \"egg yolk\", \"egg white\" and \"escalope\" would be restricted to products that contain meat. </p><p>The EU has already defined dairy items as products coming from the \"normal mammary secretion\". This includes products like milk, yogurt and cheese. </p><p>Oat milk, for instance, is called an oat drink on European shelves.</p><p>Greens and liberal lawmakers have criticised the now-approved EP text as \"useless\". </p><p>\"While the world is burning, the EPP has nothing better to do this week than to involve us all in a debate about sausages and schnitzel,\"  Anna Cavazzini of Germany's Green Party was quoted by Deutsche Welle as saying. </p><p>Environmentalists have said that the ban would be a setback for sustainability. </p><p>The proposal has also drawn criticism from key food industry voices in Germany - the largest market for plant-based products  in the EU, according to a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://gfieurope.org/european-plant-based-sales-data/#spain\">report by the Good Food Institute of Europe. </a></p><p>Major German supermarkets such as Aldi and Lidl, fast food joint Burger King and sausage producer Rügenwalder Mühle <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or1KNtCSQrP1zFD4-3xAQAWR8Tbwi0OA/view\">have pushed back against the proposal in a joint open letter</a>. </p><p>They said banning \"familiar terms\" would make it \"more difficult for consumers to make informed decisions\". </p><p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz - whose party is a key member of the EPP - fully backs the ban. \"A sausage is a sausage. Sausage is not vegan,\" he said recently.</p><p>The French meat industry has also strongly supported the idea. </p><p>Back in 2020, a similar proposal was on the table but it wasn't passed.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>French President Emmanuel Macron will name a new prime minister within 48 hours, the Elysee Palace has said, fending off speculation that fresh elections could be imminent.</p><p>Earlier on Wednesday, outgoing Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu said the possibility of dissolving parliament was beginning to fade following talks with political parties over the last two days.</p><p>\"There is a majority in parliament and that is the majority that is keen to avoid fresh elections,\" he said.</p><p>On Monday, Lecornu - a close ally of Macron - became the third French PM to leave his job in less than a year, driven out by a hung parliament deeply divided along ideological lines.</p></div><div><p>He was then asked by Macron to stay on for two days to form a consensus among parties on how to get out of the current political crisis.</p><p>In a much-awaited TV interview on Wednesday evening, Lecornu gave no indication about who the next prime minister would be, and although he said his mission was \"finished\", he also did not appear to rule himself out entirely.</p><p>He said that as well as not wanting fresh elections, most MPs also recognised the pressing need to pass a budget by the end of the year.</p><p>However, he recognised the path towards forming a government was still complicated due to the divisions within parliament and to politicians eyeing the next presidential election.</p><p>Whoever ends up in government \"will need to be completely disconnected from any presidential ambition for 2027,\" said Lecornu, a former armed forces minister.</p><p>France's political stalemate began following snap elections in July 2024. Since then no one party has had a majority, making it difficult to pass any laws or reforms including the yearly budget.</p><p>The big challenge facing Lecornu and his two predecessors has been how to tackle France's crippling national debt, which this year stood at €3.4tn (£2.9tn), or almost 114% of economic output (GDP), the third highest in the eurozone after Greece and Italy.</p><p>Previous prime ministers Michel Barnier and Francois Bayrou were ousted in confidence votes after they presented austerity budgets.</p><p>Lecornu said his own draft budget would be presented next week, although it would be \"open for debate\".</p><p>\"But the debate needs to begin... parties cannot say they'll vote it down without examining it,\" he added.</p><p>Similarly, Lecornu said, one big issue that has been plaguing French politics since 2023 will need to be revisited - Macron's highly contested pension reforms. \"We have to find a way for the debate to take place,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>But some factions in parliament appear immovable from their positions.</p><p>Mathilde Panot of the radical left France Unbowed (LFI) said soon after Lecornu's TV interview that the only solution was \"the resignation and departure of Emmanuel Macron\".</p><p>Meanwhile, far right National Rally's leader Marine Le Pen, who has long been calling for fresh elections, stated on Wednesday that she would vote down any new government.</p><p>It is unclear, at this stage, which political forces would support a new government.</p><p>The so-called common platform of centrists and Republicans that have run the government since last year appears to have fallen apart.</p><p>The big question now is whether over the last 48 hours Lecornu was able to persuade the Socialists, who were part of that left bloc during the elections, to prop up a government in some way.</p><p>Asked about the calls by some political factions for Macron to resign, with even Macron's own former prime minister Edouard Philippe floating the idea earlier this week, Lecornu said France needed a stable, internationally recognised figure at its helm.</p><p>\"This is not the time to change the president,\" Lecornu said.</p><p>However, Macron is appearing increasingly isolated, with even close allies beginning to distance themselves from him.</p><p>Earlier this week Gabriel Attal, widely seen as Macron's protégé, said he \"no longer understood\" Macron and called for the appointment of an independent negotiator to steer the government.</p><p>Macron has not yet spoken publicly since Lecornu's shock resignation on Monday morning. Lecornu promised the president would \"address the French people in due course,\" without specifying when that may be.</p></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>16 hours ago</p></div><p><span><p><span>Georgina Rannard</span><span>Science reporter</span></p></span></p></div><div><p>The Nobel Prize for Chemistry has been awarded to Susumu Kitagawa, Richard Robson, and Omar M Yaghi for their work on metal-organic frameworks.</p><p>The three scientists' work could tackle some of the biggest problems on our planet, including capturing carbon dioxide to help tackle climate change and reducing plastic pollution using chemistry.</p><p>\"I'm deeply honoured and delighted, thank you very much,\" said Professor Kitagawa on the phone to a press conference after he was told the news.</p><p>\"How long do I have to stay here? Because I have to go out for a meeting,\" he added.</p></div><div><p>Professor Kitagawa works at Kyoto University in Japan, Professor Richard Robson is at University of Melbourne, Australia, and Professor Omar M Yaghi is at the University of California, US. </p><p>The three winners will share prize money of 11 million Swedish kronor (£872,000).</p><p>The scientists' work is about how molecules can be built together into structures - or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The Nobel committee called it \"molecular architecture\".</p><p>The men worked out how to build constructions with large spaces between the molecules, through which gases and other chemicals can flow. </p><p>These \"rooms\" can be used to capture and store chemicals that humans want to get rid of, including carbon dioxide in the atmosphere or so-called forever chemicals, also known as PFAS.</p><p>The scientists began working independently on the structures in the 1970s and 1980s. Prof Robson asked his university to drill holes into the lab worktops so that wooden balls - representing atoms - could be attached to wooden rods, representing chemical bonds.</p><p>So far MOFs have only been used on a small-scale, but companies are looking into whether they can be mass-produced.</p><p>One potential application is to break down harmful gases, including those used in nuclear weapons. </p><p>Companies are also testing whether they can be used to capture the planet-warming gas carbon dioxide from power stations and factories.</p><p>Professor Robson, who was born in North Yorkshire but has been based at the University of Melbourne since 1966, told BBC Newshour that the news \"wasn't a big surprise [because of] all sorts of sounds I've been hearing over the years\".</p><p>When asked about the potential applications of his work he urged caution:  \"There's talk about binding CO2 and solving the world's atmospheric problems, which don't sound realistic to me - but these sorts of compounds could do that sort of job on a small scale\".</p><p>The 88-year-old professor admits the prize money \"is the main thing actually in my head. It wasn't the driving force for all of this but at this stage in my life that's a very nice thought to have\".</p><p>The award is another indicator of the value of chemistry in addressing some of the planet's hardest problems.</p><p>\"Every year we see Nobel Prizes given to chemists who welcome the challenge of finding solutions to the biggest problems our global society faces – better healthcare, environmental protection, clean energy, and secure food and water for everyone,\" said Dr Annette Doherty, president of the Royal Society of Chemistry in Britain.</p></div><div><p>The announcement was made by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences at a news conference in Stockholm, Sweden.</p><p>Professor Kitagawa was motivated by the principle of \"the usefulness of useless\", according to the Nobel committee. It reflected the philosophy of an ancient Chinese philosopher, Zhuangzi, who said that even if something did not bring immediate benefit, it could still turn out to be valuable.</p><p>Professor Yaghi was born in Amman, Jordan and raised in a single room with his siblings without electricity or running water, according to the Nobel committee.</p><p>He became captivated by molecular structures one day at school, and aged 15, he went to the US to study.</p><p>It is the third science prize awarded this week. On Tuesday John Clarke, Michel H. Devoret and John M. Martinis won the Physics Nobel for their work on quantum mechanics that paved the way for the quantum computer.</p><p>On Monday three scientists' work on how the immune system attacks hostile infections won them the prize for medicine.</p></div>",

Trump then appointed Lindsey Halligan to replace him.</p><p>Mr Comey appeared in good spirits as he entered the courtroom on Wednesday, chatting with his attorneys and making jokes. He was joined by his wife, Patrice Failor and daughter Maureen Comey, a federal prosecutor who the Trump administration recently fired. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj07ndrnr34o\">What is Comey accused of?</a></li></ul><p>After listening to the judge read his rights and the two counts against him in court on Wednesday, Mr Comey was asked if he understood the charges.</p><p>\"I do your honour. Thank you very much,\" he told the court.</p><p>US District Judge Michael Nachmanoff said the two charges each carry a penalty of up to five years in prison and a fine of up to a $200,000 (£149,442). </p><p>Representing the government, Ms Halligan took over the role of top federal prosecutor in Virginia's eastern district in September.</p><p>In less than a week on the job, she secured a grand jury indictment against Mr Comey after prosecutors before her had declined to take on the case due to a lack of evidence. </p><p>The hasty turnaround was reflected in Wednesday's court proceedings, when defence lawyers complained they did not have access to classified documents that prosecutors intended to submit as evidence. </p><p>\"We feel the cart has been put before the horse,\" Mr Fitzgerald said.</p><p>Judge Nachmanoff warned the government: \"I will not slow this case down because the government does not promptly turn over information.\"</p><p>Mr Comey was the FBI Director from 2013 to 2017 and was fired about four months into Trump's first term as president. At the time, Mr Comey was leading an investigation into Russian election interference and whether there were any links between Moscow and Trump's campaign.</p><p>During his tenure, Mr Comey sparked a backlash from Democrats when he announced just days before the 2016 presidential election that he was investigating Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Charges against Clinton were never brought, leading to criticism from Republicans as well. </p><p>Since leaving government, Mr Comey has been an ardent critic of the Trump administration.</p><p>The federal government alleges Mr Comey lied to Congress during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 2020 when he was being questioned about both the Clinton investigation as well as the Russia election probe. They say he misled the Senate by saying he had not authorised someone at the FBI to leak to news outlets information about the FBI investigations. </p><p>Prosecutors also accuse Mr Comey of \"corruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, obstruct and impede\" the panel by making false statements to it.</p><p>In a video Mr Comey posted to his Instagram after he was indicted, he said he was innocent and accused Trump of acting like a \"tyrant\".</p><p>\"My family and I have know for years that there are costs to standing up to Donald Trump,\" he said. \"We will not live on our knees.\"</p><p>\"I'm innocent,\" he added. \"So let's have a trial.\"</p><p>The charges against Mr Comey came after Trump posted on social media demanding his attorney general, Pam Bondi, prosecute Mr Comey and others.</p></div>",

The organisation said they were detained some time ago but it was not previously reported.</p><p>Security Minister Mahamadou Sana said the NGO had \"collected and passed on sensitive security information that could be detrimental to national security and the interests of Burkina Faso, to foreign powers\".</p><p>The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO), which provides safety information to aid workers, has \"categorically\" denied the allegations.</p></div><div><p>Anthony Neal,  a representative of the NGO told the BBC's Newsday programme that its Burkina Faso country director had been detained since July when the organisation was suspended. The seven others were arrested later.</p><p>\"We continue to work towards their safe and immediate release,\" he said.</p><p>The NGO was suspended on 31 July for three months by the authorities for \"collecting sensitive data without authorisation\". It has been working in the country since 2019.</p><p>On Tuesday, the security minister said that despite being banned, members of the organisation had continued to secretly collect information and hold meetings.</p><p>Mr Neal denied the claim, saying its information-collection activities had ceased on 31 July but its staff remained in Burkina Faso to deal with the detention and meet its contractual commitments.</p><p>A statement by the  organisation emphasised that the information it collects was not confidential and was meant for the safety of humanitarian workers.</p><p>It added that the Burkinabé authorities were \"fully aware\" of their work and mandate and had been co-operating with the authorities.</p><p>Mr Neal said he had tried to engage with the government to address any misunderstandings or concerns. He said safety information was critical, with a \"record\" number of aid workers having been killed this year around the world.</p><p>Burkina Faso's military government led by Capt Ibrahim Traore seized power in a coup three years ago, and has had a frosty relationship with Western nations ever since.</p><p>In response to a worsening Islamist insurgency, the junta stopped working with the former colonial power, France, and instead turned to Russia for military assistance.</p><p>Human rights groups have since accused the army of committing abuses against civilians while tackling the militants, and also cracking down on political dissent and freedom of expression.</p></div>",

Mykolaiv, to the north west of Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia, north of Verkhnya Krynytsya, are both labelled in the area of Ukraine not under any level of Russian control\" /></p></div></figure><div><p>Even the village's surroundings have changed irreparably.</p><p>Before Russia's full-scale invasion, Verkhnya Krynytsya sat on the beautiful Kakhovka reservoir, which was so vast we used to call it \"the Sea\".</p><p>You could see it from pretty much anywhere in the village. It's where locals went swimming in the summer, and where visitors from across the region came in the winter to go ice-fishing. One of my earliest memories is of local women singing Ukrainian folk songs as the sun was setting into the Kakhovka on a warm summer evening.</p><p>The Sea disappeared after the Kakhovka dam was destroyed in June 2023, leading to devastating floods that ruined homes and farmland.</p></div><div><p>To find out what conditions in Verkhnya Krynytsya are like now, I tried reaching out to locals.</p><p>Predictably, obtaining answers was very difficult.</p><p>Many have left, and those who are still in the village - as is the case in the other occupied parts of Ukraine - are afraid of speaking to the media. Frontline locations are particularly lawless places, where retribution from Russian forces can be swift and brutal.</p><p>Social media groups about Verkhnya Krynytsya went silent after it was occupied, and the questions I posted there were left unanswered.</p><p>Asking someone to go and have a look at my house was out of the question. What used to be a peaceful, sleepy village has turned into a zone of fear.</p><p>The danger in Verkhnya Krynytsya also comes from the sky. The village's proximity to the front line means it is a dangerous location, exposed to frequent aerial attacks from the Ukrainians.</p><p>One acquaintance told me that locals preferred to stay indoors for fear of being hit by drones. \"It's very dangerous there,\" I was told. \"They are active, and they can target you, your house or your car. Our village has changed a lot, Vitaly.\"</p></div><p></p><h2>New residents</h2><p></p><div><p>So, given the danger and devastation caused to Verkhnya Krynytsya by the war, who could have possibly made the track marks leading to and from my old home?</p><p>It is highly unlikely anyone would choose to move to the village now - with the exception of Russian soldiers.</p><p>Many of them moved into vacant houses after capturing Verkhnya Krynytsya. In June 2022 authorities in Zaporizhzhia said they had information that Russian troops were staying in the village. This is when satellite images first show signs of the path at my old home.</p><p>To check if I was right in assuming that Russian soldiers had likely moved into my old house, I approached the Ukrainian 128th Detached Heavy Mechanised Brigade, which is involved in operations in the area.</p><p>\"You're not wrong. It's extremely likely,\" its spokesman Oleksandr Kurbatov told me.</p><p>As locals have been fleeing frontline areas, they are being replaced with Russian military, he said.</p><p>\"If there are not enough empty houses, demand is running high. Of course, it's usually military personnel from the occupation army,\" he told me.</p><p>Because nobody in the village was willing to take the risk of having a look at my house, I asked my BBC Verify colleague Richard Irvine-Brown to obtain and analyse recent satellite images. They showed a pattern of movement around the house where I grew up.</p><p>There was no sign of a path to the property in March 2022, a month into the invasion.</p><p>Aside from the faint path seen in two satellite images in June, the property seemed ignored. Then the path reappeared in December, and a car was seen using it in January 2023. We don't have any images for the property again until August, by when the track had become well established.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d2e1/live/6abcd0f0-a430-11f0-92db-77261a15b9d2.png.webp\" alt=\"A graphic designed by the BBC's Mark Edwards shows two images, one on top of the other, of Vitaly's childhood home pictured via satellite in August 2022 and August 2023.

Even ShareChat, once touted as the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-46341633\">big rival to WhatsApp</a>, has <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/startup/sharechat-swaps-cash-burn-for-sustainable-growth-eyeing-ipo-in-2-yrs-ceo-ankush-sachdeva-13010134.html\">tempered its ambitions</a>.</p><p>Delhi-based technology writer and analyst Prasanto K Roy says that it will be difficult for Arattai to break through WhatsApp's extensive user base, especially as the Meta-owned platform hosts a large number of businesses and government services on the platform.</p><p>Arattai's success will depend on its capacity to not just amass new users but also retain them, he says, which cannot be driven by nationalist sentiment alone.</p><p>\"The product has to be good, but even then, it's unlikely that it will be able to replace an app that has billions of existing users in the world,\" Mr Roy adds.</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251007-082128-301112d266-web-2.31.2-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a039/live/f20ef3a0-9f33-11f0-9dbd-b3f32b6b15e1.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Getty Images People download the Koo app at their promotional stall in Dilli Haat.

While the app offers end-to-end encryption (E2EE) of video and voice calls, it does not currently extend this feature to messages.</p><p>\"The government wants to establish traceability of messages citing security concerns and this can be done easily without end-to-end encryption,\" says Shashidhar KJ, managing editor at MediaNama, a web portal that reports on tech policy in India. But this puts people's privacy at risk, he adds.</p><p>Arattai says it is actively working on rolling out end-to-end encryption for text messages.</p><p>\"We had initially planned to launch this app after E2EE, which would have happened in a couple of months,\" Mani Vembu said. \"However, the timelines have been pushed up, and we are trying to bring some critical features and infrastructure support as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>WhatsApp does offer end-to-end encryption of messages and calls but, according to its policy, it can share meta data - such as message or call logs - with governments under legally valid circumstances.</p><p>India's internet laws require social media platforms to share user data with the federal government under certain circumstances, but obtaining this data from international companies is difficult and time-consuming.</p><p>Global giants such as Meta and X also have the legal and financial backing to push against government requests or rules they think are unfair.</p><p>In 2021, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-57251612\">WhatsApp sued India</a> over the government's new digital rules to regulate content on social media and streaming platforms, saying they violated WhatsApp's privacy protections. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyqxp0z7x0o\">X, too, has mounted legal challenges</a> against the Indian government's powers to block or take down content.</p><p>So, experts ask would Indian-made Arattai be able to stand up to government demands that may put users' privacy rights at risk?</p><p>Rahul Matthan, who specialises in tech law, says that until there is more clarity on Arattai's privacy architecture and Zoho's stand on sharing user-generated content with the government, many people may not feel comfortable using it.</p><p>Mr Roy says that it's possible for Zoho to feel beholden to the government, especially since federal ministers have been publicising the app. Also, he adds, it may not be easy for an Indian start-up to strongly resist when asked to comply with the country's laws and law enforcement requests.</p><p>When asked about what Arattai would do if it gets such requests, Mani Vembu says the company \"wants its users to retain full control over their data while complying with the country's information technology rules and regulations\". </p><p>\"Once full end-to-end encryption is rolled out, even we won't have access to the content of user conversations. We will be transparent with our users about any legal obligations,\" he said.</p><p>Experience suggests that odds are stacked against Indian apps, especially when habit-forming giants like WhatsApp and Facebook dominate. Whether Arattai can break through - or will fade like so many before - remains to be seen.</p><p><i>Follow BBC News India on </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/\"><i>Instagram</i></a><i>, </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured\"><i>YouTube,</i></a><i> </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://x.com/BBCIndia\"><i>X</i></a><i> and </i><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/\"><i>Facebook</i></a></p></div></article>",

    "body": "Man charged with terrorism over attack targeting Aboriginal Australians at protest6 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyCason Ho/ABC NewsA 31-year-old man has been charged with a terrorist offence after throwing a homemade bomb at an Aboriginal protest in Perth.A man has been charged with terrorism after he allegedly threw an explosive device at a crowd protesting the celebration of Australia Day in Perth last month.The 31-year-old man was detained after hurling a homemade bomb into a throng of around 2,500 people who had gathered in support of the Aboriginal community. The device, which was filled with ball bearings and screws, failed to explode, but authorities said it could have turned into a \"mass casualty event\".Australia Day - a national holiday on 26 January - marks the 1788 landing of Britain's First Fleet in Sydney Cove and the start of colonisation. For many Indigenous Australians and their supporters, it is known as Invasion Day.Police had already charged the man - whose identity has been suppressed by the courts for his safety - with committing an unlawful act with intent to harm and one count of making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances.West Australian Premier Roger Cook on Thursday told reporters it is alleged \"the attack on Aboriginal people and other peaceful protesters was motivated by hateful, racist ideology\".\"Thankfully [the device] did not detonate but for that we could have seen a mass casualty event with injuries and potential loss of life,\" Cook said.The fresh charge - which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment - is the first time terrorism charges have been laid in the state, police say.\"I know this event has impacted people Australia-wide and it is deeply felt by our Indigenous communities,\" Cook said. \"I know that there is anger. We have every right to be angry.\"West Australian Police Commissioner Col Blanch said the bomb had a fuse which had been lit, adding: \"It should have gone off.\"He said police had no prior intelligence of the attack, and that the man was \"self-radicalised\" and acted alone. During their investigation, detectives had found evidence the man had accessed \"pro-white male, pro-white material online\", he allegedAustralian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters federal police and Asio, Australia's domestic intelligence agency, had been called into the investigation 36 minutes after the device was thrown and worked around the clock to establish whether there was any ongoing threat. The man, who is remanded in custody, is next due to appear in Perth Magistrates Court on 17 February. ",

    "body": "6 hours agoLana LamSydneySouth Australia PoliceGus was last seen playing outside his house on the family's remote sheep stationPolice say a suspect has been identified over the disappearance of a four-year-old boy who went missing in the South Australian outback. Gus Lamont was last seen playing outside his home on a remote sheep station near Yunta, about 300km (186 miles) from Adelaide, on 27 September.His grandmother left him alone for about half an hour before checking on him, only to find the boy missing, prompting one of the largest land and air searches in the state's history.Police said a person who lives on the property has been identified as a suspect but confirmed the boy's parents were not under investigation.In the days and weeks after the boy was reported missing, police conducted extensive searches, covering about 470 sq km - an area roughly twice the size of Edinburgh - around his home, the Oak Park station homestead.In late October, police wound down efforts and appointed a 12-member taskforce to continue the investigation.That taskforce sifted through previous statements given by family members which \"identified a number of inconsistencies and discrepancies\" of the timeline around the boy's disappearance.\"As a result of these inconsistencies, and investigations into them, a person who resides at Oak Park station has withdrawn their support for the police and is no longer cooperating with us,\" Detective Superintendent Darren Fielke said.\"I do want to stress, however, that Gus' parents are not suspects in his disappearance.\"Police conducted a search of the property in January and seized a number of items including a vehicle, motorcycle and some electronic devices. Investigators said they had initially considered three possible scenarios - the boy walked off,  he was abducted, or someone known to Gus was involved in his disappearance and suspected death.Given the remote location of the property, police ruled out abduction and there was no evidence to suggest Gus had \"merely wandered off\". \"What I can say, however, is that we'll continue to thoroughly and meticulously investigate the disappearance of Gus until we get an outcome,\" Fielke said.\"We're all focused and determined to locate Gus and return him to his parents. Nothing is off the table as we work towards that outcome.\"",

    "body": "Robbie Williams: British people are good at devaluing ourselves12 hours agoCharlotte GallagherGetty ImagesAfter more than three decades in entertainment, Robbie Williams is back on the road and ready to celebrate.The singer, whose Long 90s tour begins this week, is taking a moment to mark his achievement. \"I think as British people we're very good at piercing the balloon of our own success and undercutting it and devaluing ourselves,\" he tells BBC News. \"It's what we do best. In many ways it's why we're great.\"But with this one, I really want to let it sink in and I really want to stand in the middle of it and go, 'OK, success, do your thing to me'.\"The tour will take in smaller venues, the kind he would have played at the start of his solo stardom. The 51-year-old says Britpop is the album he wanted to make when he first left Take That. It sees him collaborate with former bandmate Gary Barlow, Gaz Coombes from Supergrass and Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi.But he looks back at the Britpop era with mixed feelings - he experienced professional huge success, but was also deeply depressed. Getty ImagesRobbie pictured with Liam Gallagher at Glastonbury in 1995, at the height of BritpopHe recalls: \"I was going through my own mental illness and anything good that's happening to somebody that is in the throes of depression... they can't experience joy and there were lots of incredible things happening and I couldn't experience joy from any of it.\"But now I look back at it and think, what a decade. The last great decade for popular culture because everything since then has become quite vanilla.\"You don't know 2007 from 2023, but you know the '50s, you know the '60s, you know the '70s you know the '80s and you know the '90s and so I look back and with a wry smile and say that the '90s was an amazing time to have a bad time.\"Robbie has spoken openly about suffering from stage fright in the past, experiencing terror before walking on stage. He tells me that everything \"clicked into place\" for him when his first child, daughter Theodora, known as Teddy, who was born in 2012. \"The world started to make sense because I'd been running away from responsibility and I should have been running towards it. \"And when things stopped being about me and started to become about precious souls, I started to realise I've got the best job in the world.\"Getty ImagesRobbie with Ayda and eldest daughter Teddy, who was born in 2012Williams says he also feels much happier being back in the UK, after a torrid experience with the British press, particularly in the early stages of his solo career. \"I think that everybody knows, because we've seen it countless times, that if you are on the crest of a wave, the media comes to bring you down and attack you and malign you at every opportunity they can. And that is heavy and brings its own problems.\"But that was then, I'm in a different place now,\" he continues. \"I'm left alone just to put my songs out and be married. \"There isn't anybody at my door trying to get pictures of me 24 hours a day or trying to pop microphones and bug my house or trying to hack my phone. There isn't any of that stuff that's happening anymore. This is what I thought it would be like when I set out on my journey when I was 16, I'm having an amazing time.\"Williams, pictured with the BBC's Charlotte Gallagher, says he's glad social media was not around earlier in his careerOne thing the singer did not have deal with back then was social media, and he tells me he thinks it would have \"seen him off\". \"I get way too invested in finding the negative things, everybody does,\" he says. \"I wonder if there's something wired in us where we go, ‘let's find the problem, let's find a threat and then we'll negate the threat’.\"Then, of course, there is the eternal question, will Robbie ever rejoin Take That? The band that launched his career.Williams has spoken of them \"riding again\" and says he \"absolutely loved\" the documentary, adding that he had \"overwhelming feeling of how much I love the boys\".Getty ImagesTake That were recently the subject of a Netflix documentary, which examined their successOn February 13 it will be 30 years since Take That split (the first time), it's also Robbie's birthday. So what was he doing that day in 1996? \"Buying a Scalextric from Harrods,\" he laughs. Not the rock'n'roll answer I expected.After breaking a record held by The Beatles and winning more Brit Awards than anyone else, I ask Robbie what he wants to do next.\"I want to build hotels with my own venues in and then I want to play my own hotels,\" he replies.\"I want to do a university of entertainment and I've got the syllabus in my mind and it would be a great revenge on education for somebody that left school with nothing higher than a D to go in and revolutionise education.\" Sign us up for the university of Robbie Williams.Britpop by Robbie Williams is out now. The Long 90s tour began earlier this week. ",

    "body": "19 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseGetty ImagesRyan Routh was taken into custody shortly after being fired upon by a Secret Service agent during the incident in West Palm Beach, Florida. Ryan Routh has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump on a Florida golf course in September of 2024. Routh, 59, was found guilty last year of trying to kill Trump, then still a presidential candidate, at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. A US Secret Service agent in the area spotted a rifle barrel poking out of the bushes and fired at Routh, who then fled the scene. He was arrested nearby. In a sentencing memorandum, Judge Aileen Cannon said Routh's crimes \"undeniably warrant a life sentence\".\"[H]e took steps over the course of months to assassinate a major Presidential candidate, demonstrated the will to kill anybody in the way, and has since expressed neither regret nor remorse to his victims,\" she wrote. Routh's lawyer, Martin Ross, said they would be appealing the case. Routh pleaded not guilty and elected to represent himself during the trial, which began on 8 September. A native of North Carolina who lived in Hawaii prior to his arrest, Routh repeatedly acted erratically during the court proceedings, including challenging Trump to a game of golf and making references to Adolf Hitler and Russian President Vladimir Putin. After a jury found him guilty, Routh attempted to stab himself in the neck with a pen before US marshals quickly escorted him out of the courtroom. While Routh is not believed to have had a clear line of sight to Trump at any point during the incident, federal agents told jurors they later recovered a semiautomatic rifle with a scope and an extended magazine in the spot where he had been hiding. Additionally, jurors were told that Routh left behind a list of places where Trump was likely to appear, as well as a note for a friend which described the incident as \"an assassination attempt\". In his closing statement during the trial, Routh spoke in the third person and touched on a wide variety of unrelated topics, including US history, the Russia-Ukraine war and his intention to buy a boat - prompting the judge to repeatedly interrupt him and send the jury away. The lead prosecutor in the case, John Shipley, said that a \"mountain of evidence\" was presented which points to \"how close he got to actually pulling this off\". The incident in Florida was the second attempt on Trump's life in 2024, after a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July. That shooting left one person dead and several wounded, including Trump. The shooter, later identified as 20-year-old Thomas Crooks, was killed by officers at the scene. ",

    "body": "Doctor who treated Bondi Junction mass killer referred to health regulator10 hours agoLana LamSydneyRohan AndersonJoel Cauchi, 40, was first diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenagerA psychiatrist who treated the man behind a fatal stabbing rampage at a crowded Sydney shopping centre will be referred to health investigators after a coroner's inquiry.Joel Cauchi, first diagnosed with schizophrenia in his teens, was unmedicated and homeless when he stabbed 16 people inside Westfield Bondi Junction in 2024, killing six.The New South Wales coroner said Dr Andrea Boros-Lavack had provided 40-year-old Cauchi \"exemplary\" care over a long period, but failed to heed warnings from family that he may be relapsing, years before the attack.This mistake was one of many that led to the tragedy, the coroner said, also pointing to a series of actions by police and shopping centre security.Six people - Dawn Singleton, 25; Yixuan Cheng, 27; Jade Young, 47; Ashlee Good, 38; Faraz Tahir, 30; and Pikria Darchia, 55 - died during the attack in April 2024.Ten others, including Good's baby, were injured in the six minutes before Cauchi - who was suffering a psychotic episode - was shot dead by New South Wales (NSW) police inspector Amy Scott.During a five-week coroner's inquest that finished last May, the coroner heard from dozens of witnesses including doctors, police, survivors and the families of victims  in a bid to unearth the events leading up to the attack and prevent such a tragedy occurring again. The coroner's 800-page plus findings were due to be released at the end of 2025 but they were delayed as a mark of respect for the victims of the Bondi Beach attack, in which 15 people were killed by two gunmen on 14 December. On Thursday, Teresa O'Sullivan told the coroner's court that Boros-Lavack had provided \"personalised, consistent and compassionate treatment\" for Cauchi for many years after she first took him on as a private patient in 2012.Between 2018 and mid-2019, the Queensland psychiatrist had worked closely with Cauchi to wean him off the medications he had been taking to treat his condition, a move that was not criticised by the coroner.However, in late-2019 when Cauchi's mother raised concerns that her son was possibly relapsing, Boros-Lavack \"failed to take more active steps or to recognise the seriousness of the situation that was unfolding before her\".She said it was a \"major failing\" for the doctor to \"not do more to proactively urge Cauchi to resume his medication\".When Cauchi moved to another city and and came under the care of a different doctor, a discharge letter from Boros-Lavack also failed to provide enough information to prompt intervention, the coroner said. It didn't emphasise the need for Cauchi to see a psychiatrist or that an urgent review of his case should be a priority.O'Sullivan's recommendation that Boros-Lavack be investigated by Queensland health authorities followed calls by some of the victim's families for such action.She also found there was a missed opportunity for police intervention after an email raising concerns about Cauchi's mental health was not acted upon due to staff shortages .The officer \"overlooked a single email amidst a significant workload\", O'Sullivan said.The inquest heard a security guard who was the sole person in the CCTV control room at the Westfield when Cauchi attacked his first victim was \"not competent\" for that role. However, O'Sullivan said this was the fault of the shopping centre, which has since improved its processes. Among her 23 recommendations, O'Sullivan also called on the NSW government to improve its mental health outreach services and provide short-term housing for people with mental health issues.The coroner praised the police and emergency services response to the stabbings, describing them as \"commendably rapid and extensive\" but said there were issues with the \"inter-operability\" between various agencies that could be improved. She also recommended a public awareness campaign with the message of \"escape, hide, tell\" when there is a situation with an armed offender.O'Sullivan, though, did criticise some media coverage, which she said \"exacerbated the trauma already being suffered\" by victims and families affected, and said she would be making recommendations to the Australian Press Council on how reporters should cover incidents that involve mass casualties.The coroner also recommended bravery awards for the police officer who shot Cauchi, two Frenchmen who tried to stop Cauchi during the attack, the husband of victim Jade Young, and Ashlee Good, who died while trying to shield her baby.Outside the court, Noel McLaughlin - Young's husband - said the inquest mattered greatly.\"The evidence has shown that what first appeared to be a sudden and random act of violence was, in fact, the end point of a long story,\" he said.Earlier, Cauchi's parents released a statement, saying they hoped the coroner's findings would prevent such a tragedy happening again.",

It is unclear if Nancy Guthrie's children were directed to do so by authorities. Pima County Sheriff's Office said on Wednesday they were still speaking with anyone who had contact with Nancy Guthrie last weekend, and that no suspect or person of interest had so far been identified.Savannah Guthrie, joined by her sister Annie and brother Cameron, said in the clip they were aware of an alleged ransom note, which was sent to at least one media outlet.  \"Mommy, if you are hearing this, you are a strong woman,\" the Today show presenter said, her voice breaking. \"Everyone is looking for you, mommy. Everywhere. We will not rest. Your children will not rest until we are together again.\"Officials have warned Nancy Guthrie could be in dire health without her medication, which Savannah Guthrie mentioned in the clip. \"Our mom is our heart and our home,\" she said. \"Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. \"She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"Her sister, Annie, said the \"light is missing from our lives\". \"Momma,\" she said, \"if you are listening we need you to come home. We miss you.\"NBC via Getty ImagesSavannah Guthrie with her mother, Nancy, on the set of Today Shortly after the video was posted, US President Donald Trump commented on Truth Social about the case. He said he was directing all federal law enforcement to help bring the investigation to a close and \"get her mother home safely\".\"I spoke with Savannah Guthrie, and let her know that I am directing ALL Federal Law Enforcement to be at the family's, and Local Law Enforcement's, complete disposal, IMMEDIATELY,\" he said, adding that the nation was praying for her family.The BBC has contacted the FBI and local officials for comment.What we know about the possible abduction of Savannah Guthrie's motherAlleged ransom notes investigated in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie's motherPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has described an all-hands-on-deck search with dogs, drones, helicopters and federal agents to find the missing woman.Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly six miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on Saturday evening, when family members dropped her off around 21:30 local time.She did not attend church on Sunday morning, which prompted members of her congregation to notify family members. When detectives searched her home, they found a scene that caused \"grave concern\", Sheriff Nanos said. He refused to elaborate on what was found. \"We do believe that Nancy was taken from her home against her will. And that's where we're at,\" he said. He would not comment on reports about blood found at the property.Sheriff's officials have asked people to stop sharing misinformation about the case. Savannah Guthrie is one of the most famous faces in US media and her video garnered support from across the media landscape and Hollywood. The broadcast journalist, who joined NBC in 2007, was named co-anchor of NBC's Today show in 2012. She also serves as NBC News' chief legal correspondent, and presents during the network's Thanksgiving Day programming and from the Olympics. Savannah Guthrie had been due to co-host NBC's coverage of the Opening Ceremony for the Winter Olympics in Milan on Friday.But she withdrew because of her mother's disappearance. Presenter Mary Carillo will take her place, NBC said.\"Our hearts go out to Savannah and the entire Guthrie family,\" Molly Solomon, the executive producer and president of NBC Olympics Production, said in a statement. \"They continue to have our full support.\"According to the Arizona Republic newspaper, a historic church in Tucson invited the community to gather on Wednesday to pray for Nancy Guthrie's safe return.",

    "body": "US launches plan to tackle China's critical minerals dominance9 hours agoKali Hays,Technology reporterandPeter Hoskins,Business reporterGetty ImagesJD Vance and Marco Rubio at the first Critical Minerals Ministerial event on WednesdayThe US has launched an effort to form a trade zone for critical minerals that are key to making everything from smartphones to weapons as it tries to break China's dominance of the industry.On Wednesday, the State Department hosted the first Critical Minerals Ministerial event - which was attended by countries and organisations including the UK, European Union, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Delegates discussed the availability of and access to minerals crucial to the manufacture of things like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries.The mining and processing of such critical minerals, which include rare earths, is dominated by China.In remarks released by the US government, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not mention China by name.Instead, Vance referred to the \"foreign supply\" of such minerals flooding global markets, making it difficult for other countries with mineral deposits to secure the financing needed to produce them.The US planned to use tariffs to stop critical mineral prices falling too low, which can deter investment, he said.David Copley, a special assistant to President Donald Trump, said the US intends to \"deploy hundreds of billions of capital into the mining sector to get projects going\".Investments have already been made in several companies, including rare earths magnets maker MP Materials and Lithium Americas, which produces material key to rechargeable batteries, he said.US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also said that the US, Japan and the European Commission are developing \"coordinated trade policies and mechanisms\" in order to collectively avoid potential issues with access to important minerals.Ahead of the meeting, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said \"countries need to follow the principles of market economy and international economic and trade rules, step up communication and dialogue\".The event was part of a broader effort by the US government to counter China's ability to use its dominance of the industry as leverage in trade negotiations.On Monday, Trump announced the creation of a critical mineral reserve, called \"Project Vault\", worth almost $12bn (£8.8bn).Industry figures welcomed the announcement.\"It's critical to see the United States take decisive steps to shore up our supply of all kinds of minerals and rare earths,\" said Wade Senti, president of Advanced Magnet Lab.China has a chokehold on rare earths and has tightened its grip over exports in recent months.Beijing requires companies in China to get government approval before shipping the minerals abroad.The Chinese government soon eased those stricter measures but analysts say it is using its dominance as a key bargaining chip in trade talks with Washington.",

    "body": "34 minutes agoKelly Ng and Tessa WongReutersTrump and Xi last met in October, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation in South KoreaChina's leader Xi Jinping has called Taiwan \"the most important issue\" in China-US relations during a phone call with US President Donald Trump.Xi told Trump to be \"prudent\" when supplying weapons to the island, state media report, adding that he attached \"great importance\" to ties with Washington and hoped both sides would find ways to resolve their differences.Trump described Wednesday's call as \"excellent\" and \"long and thorough\".The call followed a flurry of visits by Western leaders, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, to China in recent months, hoping to reset relations with the world's second-largest economy.Trump himself is due to visit China in April, a trip he said he \"very much\" looked forward to. He added that Beijing was considering buying 20 million tonnes of US soybeans, up from the current 12 million tonnes.\"The relationship with China, and my personal relationship with President Xi, is an extremely good one, and we both realize how important it is to keep it that way,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post. Apart from Taiwan and soybeans, Trump and Xi discussed Russia's war in Ukraine, the current situation in Iran, and China's purchase of oil and gas from the US, the US president wrote.On Taiwan, Xi said the self-governed island was \"China's territory\" and that Beijing \"must safeguard [Taiwan's] sovereignty and territorial integrity\".\"The United States must handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence,\" he warned.China has long vowed to \"reunify\" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to do so.The US has formal ties with Beijing rather than Taiwan, and has walked a tight diplomatic rope for decades. But it remains a powerful ally of Taiwan and is the island's biggest arms supplier.In December, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11bn (£8.2bn) to Taiwan, which included advanced rocket launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles.Beijing said at the time that this \"attempt to support [Taiwan's] independence\" would only \"accelerate the push towards a dangerous and violent situation across the Taiwan Strait\".\"Just as the United States has its concerns, China for its part also has concerns,\" Xi told Trump on Wednesday.\"If the two sides work in the same direction in the spirit of equality, respect and mutual benefit, we can surely find ways to address each other's concerns.\"On Thursday, Taiwan's leader Lai Ching-te told reporters relations with the US remained \"rock solid\" and that \"all ongoing co-operation projects are continuing\".Relations between the two countries improved steadily in the last few months, following last year's tariff war, and battles over chips and rare earths. While these still remain key sticking points, tensions appear to have ebbed since the two leaders met in person in South Korea in October and struck a deal which saw both sides de-escalating on some tariffs and rare earth export controls.Negotiators from both countries also agreed on the framework for a deal on soybeans - where China would lift a ban on imports from the US - and a deal on TikTok, which was finalised last month. Hours before his call with Trump, Xi held a virtual meeting with Russia's President Vladimir Putin, in which both hailed the strengthening of ties between Beijing and Moscow.Russian media say Putin also accepted Xi's invitation to visit China in the first half of the year.Xi's calls with the two leaders have been characterised by Chinese state media as a clear sign to the rest of the world that China will remain a responsible and rational world power.Beijing appears to be positioning itself this way following some bold and controversial moves on the world stage by Trump in January. The US president notably ordered his military to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, and ramped up his demands for the US to take over Greenland, causing consternation among European leaders.The US operation in Venezuela also led some analysts to suggest that Beijing could feel emboldened to make a move on Taiwan. Others, however, have expressed doubt. One expert, David Sacks from the Council on Foreign Relations, previously told the BBC that he expected that \"China will continue with its strategy of employing coercion to wear down Taiwan's people\".A China Daily editorial said Xi's calls with Trump and Putin showed that China would \"continue to act as a stabilising force\" at a time when \"confrontation and unilateralism are on the rise\".\"Beijing is actively shouldering its responsibility - working together with major stakeholders to contribute to world peace and stability through responsible major-country diplomacy.\"In doing so, China is showing other major players on the world stage the importance of refocusing on dialogue and coordination,\" the  China Daily editorial added.",

    "body": "A global craze for Korean culture is making its humblest snacks unaffordable14 hours agoYuna Ku,SeoulandSuhnwook Lee,SeoulGetty ImagesSouth Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of dried gimBlack, crispy, often flat and square - dried seaweed, known locally as gim - is a humble staple on everyday dining tables across South Korea. But as its global popularity grows, its rising prices are worrying gim-lovers nationwide.Lee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for the past 47 years. \"In the past, people from Western countries thought Koreans were eating something weird that looks like a piece of black paper,\" the vendor, who is in her 60s, says from a small market stall in central Seoul.\"I never thought I'd be selling gim to them. But now, they all come here and buy it.\"South Korea is known to be the world's largest producer and exporter of gim, supplying markets across Asia, North America and Europe. Some even refer to the product as Korea's \"black semiconductor\", a reference to South Korea's large share of the global semiconductor industry. Exports have risen steadily in recent years - and in 2025, South Korea's dried seaweed exports hit a record $1.13bn, according to the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI).And as demand rises, so do prices.Known locally as an affordable snack or ingredient, gim typically cost around 100 won ($0.06; £0.05) per sheet in 2024 - with the snack usually sold in bundles of 10 sheets or more, or around $0.60 per pack.  But last month, the price of one sheet of gim rose to above 150 won - a record high in the country. \"Premium products now cost as much as 350 won per sheet,\" said Lee. BBC/Suhnwook LeeLee Hyang-ran has been selling gim for 47 years Kim Jaela, who's in her 30s, typically buys gim in bulk - about 500 small sheets at a time, enough to last her several months. But she says this may need to change, considering how expensive gim has become. She does most of her grocery shopping online, and was checking prices on her phone during the interview.\"Oh my, it really did get more expensive by a few dollars! Luckily, I can survive a few more weeks with two packs of gim, but if I see the same or higher price later, I probably won't restock,\" she said.A humble Korean staple The worldwide appetite for gim reflects a growing global demand in Korean goods, driven by cultural influences like K-pop and K-dramas. As global audiences engage more deeply with such entertainment, they're also increasing looking to Korean cuisine, something businesses worldwide have picked up on. In 2023, US supermarket chain Trader Joe's Gimbap - a Korean rice roll wrapped in seaweed - went viral and was cleared off the shelves nationwide shortly after its launch.\"I first learned about gim because it's a typical Korean food often seen in K-dramas,\" Miki, a 22-year-old visitor from Japan told the BBC. \"We do have similar thing called nori in Japan, but the taste is totally different. Gim is lighter and crispier, and is mostly grilled with sesame oil and salt, whereas nori is typically seasoned with soy sauce.\"Viola, a 60-year-old visitor from Brooklyn, New York, says she enjoys gim as a snack. \"I just pop it in my mouth like a potato chip,\" she said, adding that it feels like a \"healthier alternative\". \"From Asian to Western countries, more people are becoming familiar with gim, increasing global demand,\" said Lee Eunhee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University. \"To meet overseas demand, domestic prices are being pushed up.\"Kim Namin, 29, runs a seasoned gim processing factory with a 30-year family history in Wando, an island in South Korea's southern waters known for abalone and seaweed production. His factory purchases raw seaweed, grills it with oil and salt, and cuts it into the familiar rectangular sheets sold in stores.Over the past five years, most of their products have been exported globally. \"There aren't enough gim factories compared to the rising demand,\" he said, saying that his family is now considering expanding operations.He adds that gim is a highly price-sensitive staple in South Korea, long associated with affordability. Even marginal increases in its cost are keenly felt by consumers and tend to provoke strong public resistance - another reason why he's  focusing more on overseas markets.Government officials and experts say the price increase is being driven by multiple factors, including overall inflation, rising labour costs, and a decline in overseas production. However, many agree that increased growing global demand remains a major driver.In an effort to appease domestic consumers, companies - alongside the government - are taking steps to curb rising costs.South Korea's Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries has pledged to closely monitor the situation to stabilise its price. and Korean food companies like Pulmone have plans to establish a land-based seaweed R&D centre, so they can be harvested throughout the year. Back in Seoul, the market buzzes with tourists, and business is booming for Lee. \"Gim has been selling like hot cakes... the ones for making gimbap are especially popular,\" she says. \"I'm glad Korean gim is getting popular.\"",

    "body": "Growing calls in India to restrict children's social media use12 hours agoAbhishek DeyGuwahatiGetty ImagesExperts say that a social media ban would not be easy in India and could face legal challengesA debate around banning social media for children under 16 is gathering momentum in India, with ministers in several states saying they are studying a law that recently came into effect in Australia.Ministers in at least two southern states have said recently that they are checking if a ban would be effective in keeping children away from social media. And last week, the Economic Survey - an annual document written by a team led by India's chief economic adviser - recommended that the federal government consider age-based limits for social media use by children. The survey's recommendations are not binding on the government but can inform policy decisions.Experts, however, warn that such a ban would not be easy in India and could face legal challenges.Australia recently became the first country in the world to ban most social media platforms for children under 16, making it mandatory for platforms to verify users' ages and disable accounts by underage users.The move sparked criticism from social media platforms which, Australia's internet regulator told the BBC last month, came to the regime \"kicking and screaming - very very reluctantly\". Last week, lawmakers in France's lower house approved a bill that would ban social media access for under-15s. It still needs to be passed by the Senate.The UK is also considering a ban.In India, LSK Devarayalu, a lawmaker from the regional Telugu Desam Party - which governs Andhra Pradesh state and is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's federal coalition - proposed a bill last week seeking to bar children under 16 from using social media.As a private member's bill, the proposal does not reflect government policy and is unlikely to become law - but it could shape parliamentary debates.Separately, the Andhra Pradesh government has set up a group of ministers to study global regulatory frameworks and invited major platforms, including Meta, X, Google and ShareChat, for consultations. The companies haven't commented on the invitation yet.The state's Information Technology Minister Nara Lokesh last week said on X that children were \"slipping into relentless usage\" of social media, affecting their attention spans and education.\"We will ensure social media becomes a safer space and reduce its damaging impact - especially for women and children,\" he added.Other states have expressed interest in similar measures.Goa's Tourism and IT Minister Rohan Khaunte said the state was examining whether a ban could be implemented, adding that more details would follow.Priyank Kharge, the IT minister of Karnataka - home to Bengaluru city which is known as India's Silicon Valley - told the state assembly that the government was discussing responsible use of artificial intelligence and social media, and referred to a \"digital detox\" programme involving around 300,000 students and 100,000 teachers that the government launched in partnership with Meta.Kharge, however, did not specify whether legislation was being considered or which age groups might be affected.AFP via Getty ImagesAustralia is the first country in the world to ban most social media platforms for children under 16But enforcing state-level bans would be complicated, says digital rights activist Nikhil Pahwa. \"While companies can infer users' locations through IP addresses, such systems are often inaccurate. Where state boundaries are very close, you can end up creating conflicts if one state bans social media use and another does not.\"He also points to difficulties around age verification, saying the issue was not unique to India. \"Age verification is not simple. To adhere to such bans, companies would effectively have to verify every individual using every service on the internet,\" Pahwa told the BBC.Even in Australia, some children have told the BBC that they get around the ban by using fake birthdays to create new accounts.According to Prateek Waghre, a public policy expert and head of programmes at the Tech Global Institute, enforcement would also depend on the cooperation of platforms and intermediaries. \"In theory, location can be inferred through IP addresses by internet service providers or technology companies, but whether the companies operating such apps would comply, or challenge such directions in court, is not yet clear,\" he says.While lawmakers have identified a genuine problem, a ban seems to be an overly narrow response, experts think. A recent study by a non-profit organisation that surveyed 1,277 Indian teenagers suggests that age-based restrictions and verification systems may face additional hurdles in India's digital landscape. Many accounts, it says, are created with help from family members or friends and are not linked to personal email addresses, complicating assumptions of individual ownership that underpin age-verification systems.While some parents in India have welcomed the idea of a ban online, others point out a deeper issue.\"Parents themselves fail to give enough time to children and hand them phones to keep them engaged - the problem starts there,\" says Delhi resident Jitender Yadav, who has two daughters aged eight and four. \"I am not sure if a social media ban will help. Because unless parents give enough time to their children or learn to keep them creatively engaged, they will always find ways to bypass such bans,\" he says.",

    "body": "3 hours agoBecky DaleandMatt Murphy,BBC Verify  BBCUnredacted images and videos showing nudity released in the Epstein files have been online for days despite US officials being warned about failures in redaction, which lawyers say has caused victims \"irreparable\" harm.The files seen by BBC Verify are among thousands of documents lawyers say they have discovered that contain identifying information about dozens of Epstein's victims.Victims groups first spoke out about the issue at the weekend when the New York Times reported nearly 40 separate images had been published as part of the Epstein files on Friday.On Tuesday, a New York judge said the Department of Justice (DoJ) had agreed to quickly fix the issue after victims called for the website to be shut down until names and images could be properly redacted.The DoJ removed thousands of documents from its website, stating that the files had been uploaded due to \"technical or human error\". The department said it was continuing to examine new requests, as well as checking whether there were any other documents that might need further redaction.BBC Verify found independently that a number of images of identifiable people were still online on Wednesday, despite the US government stating it was tackling the issue of incomplete redactions the previous day. We have approached the DoJ for comment and supplied the names of unredacted files.\"The damage done is irreparable,\"  Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing the victims, said in a statement.\"I'm heartbroken for the girls whose information was released,\" Ashley Rubright, a survivor of Epstein's abuse, told the BBC. \"That's such a huge violation of one of the most horrible moments of their lives.\"Four of the images identified by BBC Verify showed partially clothed young females with their faces and bodies unredacted.They were found during a general search of the millions of files released for evidence of Epstein's interactions with public figures.Photos of other people appear to have been redacted in some documents but left unredacted elsewhere. One document contained two versions of the same picture, one showing the face covered with a black square and another that showed the face in full.Another video also identified someone who was seen lifting up her shirt and showing her breast to the camera.Department of Justice (DoJ) officials were tasked with redacting all sexually explicit photos or any information which could identify victims before the latest tranche of Epstein files was due to be published over the Christmas period.Ahead of the deadline set by Congress, deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files would not be published on time, citing the extra work needed to guard victims' identities. \"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim - their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected - is completely protected,\" he said at the time.BBC Verify has separately found the identities of several people have been revealed in medical information and legal statements published in the files.One name was shown in full in two videos showing foetal ultrasound scans. The time, date and what appears to be the location of the scans, as well as the gestational age of the foetus, were also clearly visible.Another document contained a recording of Epstein being questioned in which a lawyer mentioned the name of at least one victim.Watch: \"Everybody needs to do better\" - Survivor says US shouldn't move on from EpsteinLawyers for Epstein's victims have heavily criticised the DoJ for its failure to adequately protect hundreds of women identified in the files.\"We are getting constant calls from victims because their names – despite them never coming forward, being completely unknown to the public – have all just been released for public consumption,\" Brad Edwards, one of the attorneys, said on Sunday.\"It's literally thousands of mistakes.\"",

    "body": "The son of Norway's Crown Princess is due to return to a court in Oslo on Thursday for the third day of his trial for rape and more than 30 other alleged offences. On Wednesday, Marius Borg Høiby, 29, told the court he has lived a life of partying out of an extreme need of validation. He was giving evidence after the first woman he is alleged to have raped told the court she believed \"100 percent\" that she had been drugged during an \"after-party\" in the basement of Høiby's parents' house in December 2018. He denies four allegations of rape as well as other serious charges against him. The 29-year-old defendant, who was born four years before his mother, Mette-Marit, married Norway's Crown Prince Haakon, is not a member of the royal family or a public figure, but grew up as part of the wider family. The BBC's Paul Kirby reports from outside the court in Oslo.Video edited by Ian Aikman.",

Instead the jellyfish use them to catch their prey of fish and plankton, according to the institute.The team also discovered 28 potential new species including corals, sea urchins, and sea anemones.",

Colombia has been criticised by US President Trump for not doing enough to combat the drugs trade, though Colombia's President Gustavo Petro claims that his government has seized the largest amount of drugs in history.Correspondent: Orla Guerin, Camera: Goktay Koraltan Producer: Wietske Burema Edited by: Marina Costa",

    "body": "1 day agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterSinger Julio Iglesias has denied allegations of sexual assault made by two female former employees.The women allege that the 82-year-old Spanish superstar \"normalised abuse\" in a coercive, threatening and violent environment while they were working at his properties in the Bahamas and Dominican Republic.Responding on Instagram, Iglesias said: \"I deny having abused, coerced, or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and deeply sadden me.\"The allegations, which were first reported earlier this week, are being investigated by Spain's judiciary.The two women - a domestic worker and a physiotherapist - have alleged they suffered sexual and other forms of abuse while working at Iglesias's properties.The reports said they worked in his Caribbean residences for 10 months in 2021, which is when they allege the sexual assaults took place.On 5 January, the women filed a legal complaint for sexual assault and human trafficking with the national court, which investigates crimes allegedly committed beyond Spain's borders.Advocacy groups Women's Link Worldwide and Amnesty International said the acts alleged in the complaint could be considered \"a crime of human trafficking for the purpose of forced labour\" and \"crimes against sexual freedom\".According to testimony collected by the two groups, Iglesias subjected the women to \"sexual harassment, regularly checked their mobile phones, restricted their ability to leave the home where they worked, and required them to work up to 16 hours a day without days off\".Women's Link described the complainants as young Latin American women \"in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions\".In his Instagram statement, Iglesias wrote: \"It is with profound sadness that I respond to the accusations made by two people who previously worked for me.He added: \"I have never felt such malice, but I still have the strength to let people know the whole truth and defend my dignity against such a serious accusation.\"The singer also thanked the \"so many dear people who have sent me messages of affection and loyalty\", adding: \"I have found great comfort in them.\"According to by Spanish news site elDiario.es and US outlet Univision, which investigated the claims over three years, the women's allegations are backed up by documentary evidence including photographs, phone records, text messages and medical reports.Their reports cite other former employees who describe a threatening, highly stressful atmosphere for those working for Iglesias.But an old friend of the singer, Jaime Peñafiel, labelled the accusations \"absolute lies\", while another ally, journalist Miguel Ángel Pastor, said he had never heard \"any suggestion that he might have committed this kind of act\".Iglesias is one of the most successful Latin artists of all time, having sold more than 300 million records in a career spanning decades.He is also the father of fellow music superstar Enrique Iglesias.",

    "body": "4 hours agoTinshui YeungAnadolu via Getty ImagesMayor Yamanaka has been accused by officials of workplace harassmentThe mayor of Yokohama has apologised for insulting colleagues after an official publicly accused him of making offensive remarks.At a news conference, the Japanese city's human resource chief, Jun Kubota, alleged that Mayor Takeharu Yamanaka had used terms such as \"idiot\" and \"human scum\" to disparage staff.It is highly unusual in Japan for a serving city official to openly accuse a sitting mayor and demand an apology.Yamanaka initially denied the allegations, but later admitted to some of them. \"I want to frankly apologise for placing a psychological burden on the personnel director,\" he said.At a news conference on Thursday, Kubota accused Mayor Yamanaka of repeatedly making remarks towards officials - including himself - that could amount to workplace harassment.The mayor was accused of calling officials \"useless\", \"silly\" and \"low-spec\", as well as making comments about colleagues' appearance and likening them to animals.He is also accused of threatening Kubota, saying he would have to \"commit seppuku\" - a Japanese ritual suicide by disembowelment - if he failed to secure an international conference bid.Kubota demanded an apology from Yamanaka and called for an investigation.Yamanaka initially published a statement on his personal website, denying the allegations.But on Friday, he publicly acknowledged some remarks - such as using words like \"idiot\" and \"human scum\" - and apologised.\"I am reflecting on this. I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

    "body": "17 hours agoMaia DaviesBBC NewsWatch: What Machado and Trump have said about Nobel Peace Prize medal exchangeVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has vowed she will lead the country \"when the right time comes\".\"There's a mission, and we are going to turn Venezuela into that land of grace, and I believe I will be elected when the right time comes as president of Venezuela, the first woman president,\" she told Fox News.Her comments come a day after she gave President Donald Trump her Nobel Peace Prize medal, calling it a recognition of his commitment to Venezuela's freedom.The US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in Caracas on 3 January and removed him to New York to face various drugs and weapons charges. EPA/ShutterstockMachado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday However, Trump has declined to endorse Machado as Venezuela's new leader, saying she did not have enough domestic support - despite her opposition movement claiming victory in 2024's widely contested elections. He has instead been dealing with the country's interim president Delcy Rodríguez, who had been Maduro's vice-president and who on Friday held a two-hour meeting with the director of the CIA \"at President Trump's direction\" aimed at building trust and communication between the two countries, according to a US official.\"Director Ratcliffe discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries,\" the US official said.Asked on Friday about his decision to work with Rodríguez over Machado, Trump told reporters his decision had been informed by the US experience in Iraq more than 20 years ago. Security and political structures were dismantled after the US invaded, setting the scene for insurgency and the eventual emergence of the Islamic State group.\"If you ever remember a place called Iraq, where everybody was fired - every single person, the police, the generals, everybody was fired - and they ended up being ISIS... I remember that,\" he said.Speaking later at an event in Washington, Machado said she was confident there would be an \"orderly transition\" in her country.\"The result of a stable transition will be a proud Venezuela that will be the best ally the US has ever had in the Americas,\" she said.\"This has nothing to do with a tension between Delcy Rodríguez and myself, this is about a criminal structure - that is the regime - and the Venezuelan people,\" she added, describing herself as \"just one member of a movement of millions of Venezuelans\".Meanwhile, in Venezuela's capital Caracas, Rodríguez gave her first state of the union address since taking over as interim president.She said she was not afraid to face the US \"diplomatically, through political dialogue\".Rodríguez also said Venezuela needed to defend its \"dignity and honour\", and announced oil industry reforms to allow more foreign investment in a step away from Maduro's policies.Trump called Rodríguez a \"terrific person\" on Wednesday after the pair spoke on the phone, a conversation the Venezuelan leader called \"productive and courteous\".The following day, the US president called Machado a \"wonderful woman who has been through so much\", describing her gift of the Nobel Peace Prize medal as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect\".Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal on Thursday",

    "body": "1 day agoLucy WilliamsonBashmaq border crossing, Iraqi KurdistanFred Scott/BBCPeople and traffic still regularly cross the Iran-Iraq borderAt the border crossing from Iran into Iraqi Kurdistan, the stern face of Iran's former supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, peers down at the trickle of Iranians leaving the territory.Thick snowflakes confetti the lorries and pedestrians arriving at this remote mountain pass.Metres away, just beyond the border post, an Iranian flag flutters in the snow.Iran has shut down the internet and blocked phone calls into the country, but its borders are still open.Inside the arrivals hall, we find dozens of men, women and children – many arriving to visit family on the Iraqi side of the border. No-one we met said they were fleeing Iran because of the recent protests and government crackdown, but one man – who asked us to hide his identity – told us security forces had shot him during a protest in central Iran last Friday.\"I was hit in the face by seven pellet rounds,\" he said, pointing out several weals and bruises on his face. \"They struck above my eyelid, on my forehead, my cheek, my lip, under my ear and along my jaw. I had to use a razor blade to cut one of the pellets out.\"He told us he was too afraid of being arrested to get medical help, and that others injured during the government crackdown on protestors were also avoiding treatment, out of fear that security forces would arrive and arrest them.\"One of my friends told me he was hit by a pellet round,\" he told us.  \"His son, who is around 12 or 13 years old, was struck twice in the leg by live ammunition. One of the bullets is lodged in the shin bone.  They're terrified of going to hospital to have it removed.\"Iran's regime has treated these protests as an existential threat.  Its crackdown seems to be working, and protesters are now thought to be largely staying at home, for fear of being shot or arrested. Rights groups say at least around 2,500 people have been killed.But several people here told us that demonstrations had continued, at least into this week. The protester we spoke to said security forces had crushed protests in his own town last Friday, but that they had continued elsewhere.\"Demonstrations were still going on in Fardis and Malard, and some areas of Tehran,\" he said.  \"My friends were there.  We were constantly on the phone.  On Tuesday night, the protests were still going on, but I haven't had any updates since then.\"Iranians don't need a visa to cross here, and officials say there is regular traffic back and forth.Another man we spoke to at the border said he had been in Tehran on Wednesday, and seen protesters on the street.  It's not clear what form of protest that was, or how many were taking part.The BBC has seen no hard evidence that street protests are still continuing. Very little footage at all is trickling out, and the reports we heard today are impossible to confirm. The BBC, along with other international media, is barred from reporting inside Iran.Fred Scott/BBCThe Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout more than a week agoThe government's repression largely seems to be working. But the economic problems that sparked this crisis haven't gone away.A teacher from a town close to the border told us she didn't care who the leader was, she just wanted the economic situation to improve.\"We don't want anything more than our basic rights,\" she told me. \"To own a house, to own a car, to have a normal life. My salary lasts 10 days, and I have to borrow money to cover the rest of the month. It's very bad.\"I ask about US President Donald Trump, and his threat of military strikes if the regime kept killing protesters.\"We're waiting to see what Trump does,\" he told me. \"In the meantime, civilians are getting killed.\"The force with which Iran's leaders have crushed this protest signals their weakness.  The regional proxy groups they once used as defences against attack have been weakened by Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah, and by the fall of the former Syrian President, Bashar al-Assad.And the Israeli-US war with Iran last year has depleted its military capabilities, and left it vulnerable to attack.Hidden behind this mountainous border, Iran's regime is re-imposing its control.But hidden behind that repressive control is the growing fear of the Islamic Republic, unable to meet its people's most basic demands: protection from foreign attacks, and prosperity at home.Additional reporting by Samantha Granville and Maad Mohammed",

    "body": "A man has gone on trial in Germany charged with driving his car into a crowd of people in the city of Munich last year, killing two people.The 25-year-old man, named only as Farhad N, in line with German privacy laws, is an Afghan national.Prosecutors say that on the morning of 13 February 2025, he deliberately drove his BMW Mini into a trade union demonstration in the centre of Munich. About 1,400 people were taking part in the street rally.A 37-year-old woman called Amel and her two-year-old daughter Hafsa died in hospital of their injuries shortly afterwards.They were the hit by the car first and thrown several metres by the force of the impact. Hafsa was still in her buggy.Among the 44 others who were hurt, a number suffered critical injuries.Those taking part in the union rally included city workers such as hospital and daycare staff calling for better wages. Amel herself had been working as an engineer and had come to Germany from Algeria at the age of four.Farhad N went on trial on Friday only a few hundred metres from the scene of the attack. Federal prosecutors say they believe he \"committed the crime out of excessive religious motivation. \"He believed he was obliged to attack and kill randomly selected people in Germany in response to the suffering of Muslims in Islamic countries,\" they say.According to investigators, the man shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" and prayed after committing the act.He is also accused of watching extremist preachers online, however officials do not believe he was part of any jihadist movement such as Islamic State.At the start of the trial the defendant hid his face behind a red folder and raised his right index finger – a common gesture among Muslims worldwide, symbolising belief in one God.His lawyer said his client would not comment on either the attack or his personal circumstances.Officials say he arrived in Germany in 2016 as a teenager. Germany took in more than a million asylum seekers in 2015-2016 at the height of Europe's migrant crisis - an influx that has proved deeply divisive and fuelled the rise of the far-right AfD.Farhad N came alone, without his family and, although his asylum request was rejected, he was not deported and had been given temporary residency in Munich.German authorities said he was legally resident in Germany, had a work permit and had jobs working as a shop security guard and for security companies.Farhad N had no previous convictions. He was active on Instagram, where he posted about bodybuilding and religious themes.He was arrested on the day of the Munich attack. The trial is expected to continue until June.",

    "body": "17 hours agoMallory MoenchWatch: 'The Islamic Republic will fall', says exiled crown princeThe exiled son of the last Iranian shah (king) has called on the world to help protesters topple Iran's government, saying he is confident \"the Islamic Republic will fall - not if, but when\".Reza Pahlavi, a US-based opposition leader, asked the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guard leadership, which he said would \"facilitate our task and prevent more loss of life\".More than 2,600 protesters have been killed, according to a human rights group, in demonstrations that started over the economy on 28 December and turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Hosseini Khamenei.The Iranian government has called the protests \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent figure in Iran's fragmented opposition and has previously urged Iranians to escalate their protests. But protesters have been met with deadly force by authorities, masked by a near total shutdown of the internet and communication services.Speaking on Friday at a news conference in Washington, Pahlavi claimed that sections of Iran's security apparatus had refused to take part in the crackdown and that the Iranian authorities had brought in fighters from foreign militias to quell the protests.He urged the world to target Iran's Revolutionary Guards, and command and control infrastructure, calling for a \"surgical strike\". He also asked global powers to deliver economic pressure, expel Iranian diplomats, demand the release of all political prisoners, and deploy satellite internet Starlink and other secure communications to allow connectivity in Iran.\"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully,\" he said.\"With or without the world's help, the regime will fall. It will fall sooner and more lives will be saved if the world turns its words into action.\"He declined to speak about reports that he had held discussions with senior US officials, but said: \"I believe that President Trump is a man of his word and, ultimately, he will stand with the Iranian people.\"Trump has previously warned Iran's government against killing protesters and told CBS News, the BBC's US media partner, that the US would take \"very strong action\" against Iran if it executed protesters.He later said he had been told \"the killing has stopped\" - but did not rule out military action against the country. Iran's parliament speaker had warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centres in the region would become legitimate targets. The US and UK have reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar, with officials telling CBS News it was a \"precautionary measure\".Who is Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah?On Friday, Pahlavi also vowed to return to Iran and laid out a plan for creating a new constitution in the country.Asked about future leadership in Iran, he said: \"It's for the Iranian people to decide.\"He said he believes he can lead and has the Iranian people's support: \"I am trying to help them liberate themselves,\" he said.Pahlavi said he supported a governing programme based on the principles of Iran's territorial integrity, a separation of religion and state, individual liberties and the right of the Iranian people to decide on the form of democratic government they want.Pahlavi's father, the last shah of Iran, was overthrown in an Islamic revolution in 1979 and a devout Shia Muslim regime took over.The current wave of protests began after shopkeepers in Iran's capital Tehran went on strike over the rising cost of living and the depreciating value of the currency.They quickly spread across the country and turned against Iran's clerical establishment, particularly Khamenei. The slogans chanted by demonstrators have included \"Death to the dictator\" and \"Seyyed Ali [Khamenei] will be toppled this year\".According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), at least 2,677 deaths have been confirmed and more than 1,600 more are under review.It reports that about 19,000 protesters have been arrested.The Iranian government has imposed an internet blackout on the country since 8 January, with authorities stepping up their crackdown on protests.The BBC and most other international news organisations are also unable to report from inside Iran, making obtaining and verifying information difficult.Residents in four cities - Tehran, Karaj, Isfahan and Sanandaj - told the BBC on Friday there were no protests taking place. Security forces were still present on the streets and in public squares, some said.",

    "body": "10 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoGoogle has appealed a US district judge's landmark antitrust ruling that found the company illegally held a monopoly in online search.\"As we have long said, the Court's August 2024 ruling ignored the reality that people use Google because they want to, not because they're forced to,\" Google's vice president for regulatory affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland said.In its announcement on Friday, Google said the ruling by Judge Amit Mehta didn't account for the pace of innovation and intense competition the company faces.The company is requesting a pause on implementing a series of fixes - viewed by some observers as too lenient - aimed at limiting its monopoly power.Judge Mehta acknowledged the rapid changes to the Google's business when he issued his remedies in September, writing that the emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) had changed the course of the case.He refused to grant government lawyers their request for a Google breakup that would include a spin-off of Chrome, the world's most popular browser.Instead, he pushed less rigorous remedies, including a requirement that Google share certain data with \"qualified competitors\" as deemed by the court.That data was due to include portions of its search index, Google's massive inventory of web content that functions like a map of the internet.The judge also called for Google to allow certain competitors to display the tech giant's search results as their own in a bid to give upstarts the time and resources they need to innovate.On Friday, Mulholland balked at being forced to share search data and syndication services with rivals as she justified the request for a halt to implementing the orders.\"These mandates would risk Americans' privacy and discourage competitors from building their own products — ultimately stifling the innovation that keeps the U.S. at the forefront of global technology,\" Mulholland wrote.While the company has invested growing sums of cash into AI, those ambitions have come under scrutiny.Last month, the EU opened an investigation into Google over its AI summaries which appear above search results.The European Commission said it would probe whether Google used data from websites to provide the service and failed to offer appropriate compensation to publishers.Google said the investigation risked stifling innovation in a competitive market.This week, Google parent Alphabet became the fourth company ever to reach a market capitalisation of $4tn.",

    "body": "1 day agoJake Kwon,Seoul correspondentandLeehyun Choi,SeoulEPA/ShutterstockYoon was impeached in 2024 for his martial law attemptSouth Korea's impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol will be jailed for five years over abuse of power, obstructing justice and falsifying documents in relation to his failed martial law bid in 2024.This is the first of the verdicts in four trials linked to his shock martial law decree. Although short-lived, the move triggered nationwide turmoil, sparking protests as MPs rushed to the national assembly to overturn Yoon's decision.  Yoon's actions \"plunged the country into political crisis\", a judge said on Friday, noting that Yoon had \"consistently shown no remorse\".Friday's ruling offers clues as to how the rest of Yoon's trials could go. His string of charges range from abuse of power to campaign law violations. The most serious charge is insurrection, for which prosecutors have demanded the death penalty. The verdict in that trial is expected in February.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on Friday to watch the livestreamed proceedings projected on a large screen.Some of them held red banners that read: \"Yoon, again! Make Korea great again\". Several could be heard yelling at the judge as he delivered the guilty verdicts, while others looked solemn.On Friday, Yoon was convicted of using presidential bodyguards to prevent his arrest; failing to consult his entire cabinet before declaring martial law; as well as drafting and then destroying a falsified document claiming the martial law bid had been endorsed by the prime minister and defence minister.\"The accused has the duty to safeguard the constitution and law but turned his back on them,\" the judge said. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year jail term for the charges in Friday's ruling. Both sides have seven days to appeal.About 100 supporters of Yoon had gathered outside the courthouse on FridayYoon denied the charges, arguing that the arrest warrant itself was invalid and that the letter of the law does not require him to consult every member of the cabinet before exercising emergency power.He had claimed across his trials that investigators had no legal basis to probe and arrest him in the first place. Most of the accusations against him are invalid because there was no procedural lapse when he declared martial law, he argues.South Korea's courts often grant leniency when the accused accepts guilt or responsibility. But prosecutors argue that Yoon's lack of remorse is grounds for an even more severe penalty.Park Geun-hye, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for abuse of power and bribery in 2021, was the last former president to be jailed for a criminal charge. But she was pardoned and released from prison shortly after.Six months after Yoon's martial law attempt, voters elected opposition leader Lee Jae Myung in a decisive victory . But Yoon's trials bring the spotlight back to deep divisions in South Korea, where the former president  retains strong supporters who see him as a martyr. According to a survey conducted last December, nearly 30% of South Koreans did not believe that Yoon's martial law declaration amounted to an insurrection.While his martial law attempt brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets, it also saw his supporters show up in counter protests, though in smaller numbers.

    "body": "13 hours agoMaia DaviesGetty ImagesThe Trump administration has named US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former UK prime minister Sir Tony Blair as two of the founding members of its \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also sit on the \"founding executive board\", the White House said in a statement on Friday.Trump will act as chairman of the board, which forms part of his 20-point plan to end the war between Israel and Hamas.It is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza and manage its reconstruction.Also on the founding executive board are Marc Rowan, the head of a private equity firm, World Bank chief Ajay Banga and a US national security adviser, Robert Gabriel.Each member would have a portfolio \"critical to Gaza's stabilisation and long-term success\", the White House statement said.Trump had said on Thursday that the board had been formed, calling it the \"Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place\".Further members of the board would be named in the coming weeks, the White House said.Sir Tony was UK prime minister from 1997 to 2007 and took the UK into the Iraq War in 2003. After leaving office, he served as Middle East envoy for the Quartet of international powers (the US, EU, Russia and the UN). In this role, he focused on bringing economic development to Palestine and creating the conditions to move towards a two state-solution.Sir Tony had already been a part of high-level talks about Gaza's future with the US and other parties. In August, he joined a White House meeting with Trump to discuss plans for the territory, which Witkoff described as \"very comprehensive\".In September, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC that involving Sir Tony in such talks, given his record on the Iraq War, would \"raise some eyebrows\".But Streeting also noted the former prime minister's role in brokering the 1998 Good Friday Agreement to end Northern Ireland's Troubles.\"If he can bring those considerable skills there, in both diplomacy and state craft,\" Streeting told the BBC, \"that can only be a good thing\".BBC/Monika GhoshFormer UK Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair is a founding member of Trump's \"Board of Peace\"It comes after the announcement of a separate 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza.Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Palestinian Authority (PA) which governs parts of the occupied West Bank not under Israeli control, will head that new committee.The statement also said that Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, would be the board's representative on the ground in Gaza working with the NCAG.Trump's plan says an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) will also be deployed to Gaza to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces and the White House statement said that US Major General Jasper Jeffers would head this force to \"establish security, preserve peace, and establish a durable terror-free environment\".The White House said that a separate \"Gaza executive board\" was being formed that would help support governance and includes some of the same names as the founding executive board as well as further appointees.The US peace plan came into force in October and has since entered its second phase, but there remains a lack of clarity about the future of Gaza and the 2.1 million Palestinians who live there.Getty ImagesBulgarian politician Nickolay Mladenov will represent the board \"on-the-ground\" in Gaza, the White House saysUnder phase one, Hamas and Israel agreed a ceasefire in October, as well as a hostage-prisoner exchange, a partial Israeli withdrawal, and an aid surge.Earlier this week Witkoff said phase two would see the reconstruction and full demilitarisation of Gaza, including the disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian groups.\"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations,\" he warned, noting these include the return of the body of the last dead Israeli hostage. \"Failure to do so will bring serious consequences.\"However the ceasefire is fragile, with both sides accusing each other of repeated violations.Almost 450 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes since it came into force, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, while the Israeli military says three of its soldiers have been killed in attacks by Palestinian groups during the same period.Humanitarian conditions in the territory remain dire, according to the UN, which has stressed the need for the unrestricted flow of critical supplies.The war in Gaza was triggered by the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.More than 71,260 people have been killed in Israeli attacks in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",

    "body": "1 day agoEd Habershon,JohannesburgandNatasha BootyThe US has accused South Africa's defence ministry of refusing to obey orders from its own government to send home Iranian warships that have been conducting naval exercises in the African country's waters. \"South Africa can't lecture the world on 'justice' while cozying up to Iran,\" it said in a statement.In response, South Africa's defence ministry said it was launching an inquiry to get to the root of these \"serious allegations\".Washington has criticised South Africa for inviting Iran at a time when a brutal crackdown against protests was happening in the Middle Eastern country. It said the South African military's actions did not amount to \"non-alignment\" but were instead a \"choice to stand with Iran\". \"This is absolutely no surprise. Protests against the Iranian regime are happening right now, human rights organisations here in SA have been calling for support for the protesters,\" William Gumede, an associate professor at the University of Witwatersrand, told the BBC. \"These are all democratic violations and human rights abuses and we have not heard a whimper from the ANC. That is the irony and hypocrisy, it's been criticising other regimes but it's been silent on what's happening in Iran.\"In the strongly worded statement posted on its social media accounts, the US embassy in South Africa said it noted with \"concern and alarm\" reports that the country's defence minister and its defence forces had defied government orders to ask Iran to leave. The US embassy said Iran's participation \"undermined maritime security and regional stability\" and was \"unconscionable\" as it suppressed protests back home, comparing them to \"peaceful political activity South Africans fought so hard to gain for themselves\". On Friday the office of Defence Minister Angie Motshekga said she \"would like to place it on record\" that President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions had been \"clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to as such\".Dubbed \"Peace Resolve\", the week-long naval drill got under way last Friday. It is being led by China - and involves other members from an alliance of major developing countries, including Russia, which when it was launched in 2006 was known as Bric.It took its acronym from its founding members Brazil, Russia, India and China - and when South Africa joined four years later an \"s\" was added to its name.With the recent addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the alliance is now called Brics+ - and its aim is to challenge the political and economic power of the wealthier Western nations.Iranian warships had already arrived in Cape Town when the order to turn them around reportedly came through.

    "body": "23 hours agoLaura Bicker,Beijing ,Suranjana Tewari,Singapore ,Koh Ewe,SingaporeandJessica Murphy,TorontoReutersMark Carney's visit to China is the first by a Canadian leader in nearly a decadeChinese leader Xi Jinping and Canadian PM Mark Carney have announced lower tariffs, signalling a reset in their countries' relationship after a key meeting in Beijing.China is expected to lower levies on Canadian canola oil from 85% to 15% by 1 March, while Ottawa has agreed to tax Chinese electric vehicles at the most-favoured-nation rate, 6.1%, Carney told reporters. The deal is a breakthrough after years of strained ties and tit-for-tat levies. Xi hailed the \"turnaround\" in their relationship but it is also a win for Carney, the first Canadian leader to visit China in nearly a decade.  He has been trying to diversify Canadian trade away from the US, his country's  biggest trading partner, following the uncertainty caused by Trump's on-again-off-again tariffs. The deal could also see more Chinese investments in Canada, right on America's doorstep. Carney himself seemed to allude to the fact that this was a result of Trump's tariffs, which have now pushed one of the US's key allies towards its biggest rival. He told reporters that Canada's relationship with China had been more \"predictable\" in recent months and that he found talks with Beijing \"realistic and respectful\".He also made clear Ottawa does not agree with Beijing on everything, adding that in his discussions with Xi he made clear Canada's \"red lines\", including human rights, concerns over election interference and the need for \"guardrails\".\"We take the world as it is - not as we wish it to be,\" he said when asked about China's human rights record.Observers believe Carney's visit could set an example for other countries across the world who are also feeling the pain from Washington's tariffs. In contrast, Xi has been trying to show that China is a stable global partner and has been urging more pragmatic ties - in the words of Beijing, \"a win-win\" for all.And it seems to be working. The South Korean president and the Irish prime minister have both visited Beijing in recent weeks. The UK prime minister is expected to visit soon and so is the German Chancellor.Carney said the \"world has changed dramatically\" and how Canada positions itself \"will shape our future for decades to come,\" he added. Earlier in his three-day visit, he had said that the Canada-China partnership sets the two countries up for a \"new world order\". He later added that the multilateral system had been \"eroded, to use a polite term, or undercut\". As the Chinese and Canadian delegations sat down in the Great Hall of the People on Friday, Xi said: \"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations is conducive to world peace, stability, development, and prosperity.\" Getty ImagesCarney in the Great Hall of the People during the meeting with Xi  A trade reset Tariffs have been a key sticking point between the two sides. In 2024, Canada imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, following similar US curbs.Last year, Beijing retaliated with tariffs on more than $2bn (£1.5bn) of Canadian farm and food products like canola seed and oil. As a result Chinese imports of Canadian goods fell by 10% in 2025.In the deal struck on Friday, Canada will allow only 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at the 6.1% tariff rate.The cap is in response to Canadian automakers' fears of an influx of affordable Chinese EVs.As well as relief for canola producers, there will also be reduced tariffs on Canadian lobsters, crabs, and peas.China is Canada's second-largest trading partner but it's still a long way behind the US in volume.Economic ties with China are increasingly important for Carney. On arrival in Beijing on Wednesday, he met senior executives from prominent Chinese businesses, including an electric vehicle battery maker and an energy giant.On Thursday the two countries signed several agreements on energy and trade cooperation.The visit is a \"reset of a relationship\" that may be \"modest in ambition\" but \"much more realistic about what we can reasonably obtain\", said Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat and vice-president at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.A frosty history The last Canadian PM to visit China was Justin Trudeau, who met Xi in Beijing in 2017.That visit took place before the relationship soured in 2018, following Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer  at the Chinese tech giant Huawai, at the request of the US.Days later, China detained Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor on espionage charges - a move critics saw as retaliation for Meng's arrest, which China denied.Meng and both Michaels were released in 2021.Ahead of the Carney-Xi meeting, Michael Kovrig wrote on X that the visit should not just be about warming ties but also \"managing leverage\".Kovrig described Chinese negotiators as \"extremely adroit, calculating, and always looking for leverage\".\"That's why engagement has to be handled with discipline,\" he wrote, adding that Carney should also advocate for Canadians imprisoned in China. There are about 100 of them, according to Canadian media.Speaking to reporters, Carney was clear that with countries that do not share the same values, Ottawa will engage on a \"narrower, more specific\" manner.\"We're very clear about where we cooperate, where we differ,\" he said, adding that Chinese claims over self-governed Taiwan and Hong Kong's jailed pro-democracy figure Jimmy Lai came up in \"broad discussions\". Canada and China have \"different systems\", he said, which limits the breadth of their cooperation. \"But to have an effective relationship, we have direct conversations. We don't grab a megaphone and have the conversations that way.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoWill GrantBBC's Cuba correspondent in HavanaWatch: Public pay their respects to Cubans killed in Venezuela during US raidFrom sunrise, throngs of military personnel, government officials and civilians lined the route between Havana's airport and the Armed Forces Ministry to applaud home the remains of 32 Cuban troops killed in Venezuela as they passed by in a funeral cortege.The country's leadership – from Raul Castro to President Miguel Diaz Canel – were at the airport to receive the boxes carrying the cremated ashes of their \"32 fallen heroes\".In the lobby of the ministry building, each box was draped in a Cuban flag and set next to a photograph of the respective soldier or intelligence officer beneath the words \"honour and glory\".But despite the pomp and full military honours, this has been a chastening experience for the Cuban Revolution.First, it is believed to be the biggest loss of Cuban combatants at the hands of the US military since the Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. The fact that six-and-a-half decades have passed with barely a comparable firefight between Cuban and US troops, either during the Cold War or afterwards, shows how rare it is.It is not necessarily surprising that the better-trained and better-equipped Delta Force soldiers emerged virtually unscathed, especially given their elite reputation within the most powerful military in the world.Getty ImagesSome 32 Cubans were killed during the US military invention in VenezuelaBut that is of no comfort to the grieving family members as they tearfully placed their hands on the wooden boxes in Havana.Furthermore, in the days after the US military intervention in Venezuela and the forced removal of Nicolas Maduro from power, the Cuban Government was obliged to admit something it had long denied: the very existence of Cuban intelligence officers inside the corridors of power in Caracas.It is now clear, as it had been claimed for years by many in Venezuela, that Cubans have been present at every level of the country's security apparatus and that the bilateral intelligence arrangements were a crucial part of Cuba-Venezuela ties.In short, the Cuban Government has shared its years of experience of how best to maintain an iron grip on power with its Venezuelan partners. The 32 killed on Venezuelan soil were part of that shared strategy.In the wake of their deaths, though, Cubans can feel the sands shifting beneath their feet. A day earlier, Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, held a phone call with President Trump, after which he described her as \"a terrific person\".Rewind the clock just three weeks and it would have been almost unthinkable to hear such praise from the same administration who painted her predecessor as running an entire regime of \"narco-terrorists.\"It seems the Rodriguez and the Trump administrations are finding a modus vivendi. But few in the Cuban government seem to yet understand where that will leave them or their shared vision of state-run socialism with Venezuela.Washington insists the days are numbered for the Cuban Revolution.However, one of its \"original generation\" disagrees. At 88 years old, Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, and says the current conflict with the US has echoes of the CIA-backed invasion at the Bay of Pigs in April 1961.He led two companies of Cuban troops that day and argues that Cubans would still repel any repeat attempt:\"If the US tries to invade, they'll stir up a hornets' nest\" he said, quoting Raul Castro. \"They'd never even see our combatants coming, men and women.\"\"If the Americans put a single foot on Cuban soil, it won't be like their cowardly ambush of our combatants in Venezuela\", he says. \"Out here, things would be very different.\"Victor Dreke is a contemporary of Fidel Castro and Che GuevaraIn the past few days, Cuban state television has shown images of civilian reservists receiving weapons training from the Cuban military.In truth, pitted against the US military, it would be an uneven fight. The US attack on Venezuela was intended, in part, to underscore that point to the region.The stakes for Cuba are particularly high.The island is experiencing widespread blackouts which are bad in Havana but much worse in the provinces. The economy, battered by the US economic embargo and by government mismanagement, is limping along at best. Fuel is scarce and the motor of the economy, tourism, has never recovered to its pre-pandemic levels.It's into that already-complex picture that Cubans are trying to imagine the near total loss of Venezuelan support. It feels to most like a bleak scenario.But former-commander, Victor Dreke, is adamant that Cuba has ridden out tough times before and can do so again with enough revolutionary fervour.Cuba doesn't want any conflict with Trump administration, he insists, and won't be looking to escalate matters with Washington.\"But that doesn't mean we won't be ready\", he adds, defiantly.",

    "description": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at ",
    "body": "Myanmar has denied committing genocide against the Ronhingya people, saying The Gambia has failed to provide enough proof, as it begun its defence at the UN's top court.Ko Ko Hlaing, a Myanmar government representative, told judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the allegation was \"unsubstantiated\".Earlier this week, The Gambia's foreign minister Dawda Jallow told the court Myanmar wanted to erase the minority Muslim population through its use of \"genocidal policies\".Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in Myanmar in 2017.A damning report issued by the UN the following year said top military figures in Myanmar must be investigated for genocide in Rakhine state and crimes against humanity in other areas.Myanmar - which has been under military control since it overthrew the civilian government in 2021 - rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats.On Friday, Hlaning told the ICJ that \"Myanmar was not obliged to remain idle and allow terrorists to have free reign of northern Rakhine states\", where the majority of Rohingya lived.\"These attacks were the reasons for the clearance operations, which is a military term referring to counter-insurgency or counter-terrorism operations,\" Hlaing said.The Gambia launched its case against Myanmar in 2019, with Jallow telling the ICJ it did so out of a \"sense of responsibility\" following its own experience with a military government.Jallow told the court on Monday that the Rohingya \"had suffered decades of appalling persecution and years of dehumanising propaganda\", which was followed by the military crackdown and \"continual genocidal policies meant to erase their existence in Myanmar\".Lawyers for the Muslim-majority West African country also argued that the killing of women, children and the elderly, along with the destruction of their villages, was hard to justify under combatting terrorism. \"When the court considers... all of the evidence taken together, the only reasonable conclusion to reach is that a genocidal intent permeated and informed Myanmar's myriad of state-led actions against the Rohingya,\" said Philippe Sands, arguing for The Gambia, which has the backing of 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in its action.More than a million Rohingya refugees now live across the border in Bangladesh's Cox's Bazar region alone - some of the largest and most densely populated camps in the world, according to the UN's refugee agency.Hlaing - the Myanmar government representative - said on Friday that it was committed to \"achieving the repatriation to Myanmar of persons from Rakhine State currently living in camps in Bangladesh\". But he also said external forces, such as Covid-19, had hampered those efforts.\"Myanmar's commitment and constant efforts since 2017 contradict Gambia's narrative that Myanmar's intention is to destroy or forcibly deport this population,\" Hlaing told the court.He added that \"a finding of genocide would place an indelible stain on my country and its people\", so the outcome was of \"fundamental importance for my country's reputation and future\".The court has also set aside three days to hear from witnesses, including Rohingya survivors, but these sessions will be closed to the public and media.A final ruling is expected towards the end of 2026, Reuters news agency reported.It is expected to set a precedent in other genocide cases, including one brought by South Africa against Israel over the war in Gaza, as it is the first to be heard in more than a decade - and is being seen as an opportunity for ICJ judges to refine rules around the definition of genocide.The 1948 UN Genocide Convention, which The Gambia accuses Myanmar of breaching in its treatment of the Rohingya, was adopted following the mass murder of Jews by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. It defines genocide as crimes committed \"with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\".",

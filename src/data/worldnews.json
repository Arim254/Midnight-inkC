Despite immediate rescue efforts, the three individuals were found dead,\"  a police statement said.The fatalities follow a deadly week in the alps.Last weekend in France, six skiers died after being caught in avalanches in various Alpine resorts and in western Austria, a 58-year-old skier died in in the Tyrolean resort of Weerberg.On Tuesday, an avalanche killed a 13-year-old Czech boy skiing in Austria's Bad Gastein resort.And in neighbouring Switzerland, a German man was killed in an avalanche, and four other people were injured, as they were cross-country skiing on Friday.",

More than 30 people have been reported missing by their families, who have gathered outside what remains of the centre, waiting anxiously for news of their loved ones. Administrators for the city have set up a desk to register the names and details of the missing.Smoke was still billowing from what remains of the Gul Plaza building on Sunday morning. Much of it has collapsed and there are concerns it could collapse further.Hassan Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Karachi, told BBC Urdu the shopping centre contains flammable materials such as plastic foam, cloth, carpets and perfume. Summaiya Syed, Karachi's police surgeon, said six bodies had been transferred to the city's Civil Hospital as well as some of the injured.She added that the police were \"invoking mass disaster protocols\".Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences and told the government of Sindh province, where Karachi is based, to conduct a comprehensive review of safety arrangements in commercial and residential buildings across the area.",

    "body": "32 minutes agoRachel Hagan,BBC NewsandHarry Sekulich,BBC NewsAt least 21 people have been killed after a crash involving high-speed trains in southern Spain, as authorities warn the death toll could rise overnight.The incident happened near the town of Adamuz, close to the city of Cordoba, when a high-speed train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed and crashed onto a neighbouring track, rail network operator Adif said.A second train travelling in the opposite direction, from Madrid to Huelva, also derailed. Spain's Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, said the country will endure a \"night of deep pain\". More than 30 are being treated for serious injuries in hospital, Spain's transport minister Oscar Puente said. He added the incident appeared to be \"extremely strange\", while the official cause is not yet known. An investigation is not expected to determine what happened for at least a month.The mayor of Adamuz, Rafael Moreno, was one of the first people on the scene of the accident. He described it as like \"a nightmare\".Andalusian emergency services said at least 73 people in total were injured in the collision.The twisted wreckage of the train made it difficult to recover survivors and bodies, rescue crews said.Cordoba fire chief Francisco Carmona told Spanish public broadcaster RTVE: \"We have even had to remove a dead person to be able to reach someone alive. It is hard, tricky work.\"According to Adif, the crash happened about ten minutes after the train left Malaga at 18:40 local time (17:40 GMT). The company said it was setting up spaces for relatives of victims at Atocha, Seville, Cordoba, Malaga and Huelva stations. All rail services between Madrid and Andalusia were suspended following the accident and will remain close on Monday. The company said it will keep terminals open overnight for impacted passengers. Iryo, a private rail company that operated the journey from Malaga, confirmed the derailment and said around 300 passengers were on board.King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia said they were following news of the disaster with \"with great concern\".\"We extend our most heartfelt condolences to the relatives and loved ones of the dead, as well as our love and wishes for a swift recovery to the injured,\" the royal palace said on X.Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with RTVE who was on one of the trains, said the impact felt like an \"earthquake\". \"I was in the first carriage. There was a moment when it felt like an earthquake and the train had indeed derailed,\" Jimenez said.In his latest update on X, he said he was among a group of passengers waiting in the \"freezing cold night\" for buses to transport them to a local sports centre.The Spanish Red Cross has deployed emergency support services to the scene, while also offering counselling to families nearby.Miguel Ángel Rodríguez from the Red Cross told an RNE radio program: \"The families are going through a situation of great anxiety due to the lack of information. These are very distressing moments.\"",

I will be more careful with my words and behaviour,\" Yamanaka said.He said those comments were made during discussions over personnel evaluations.However, the mayor denied other accusations, including insulting colleagues' appearance.Yamanaka said an investigation was being considered under the supervision of the deputy mayor, adding that he would co-operate \"sincerely\" if an investigation takes place.In response, Kubota insisted Yamanaka had made the comments he has not admitted to, saying: \"The mayor doesn't understand anything. I cannot accept that as an apology. I want him to change.\"More from the BBC",

At least 20,000 have been evacuated. The most dangerous fire has swept through dry forests bordering the coastal city of Concepción. About 250 homes have been destroyed, disaster officials said.Local media show pictures of charred cars in the streets. Chile has experienced a series of devastating fires in recent years, worsened by long-term drought.Chile's forestry agency, Conaf, said firefighters were battling a total of 24 fires across the country on Sunday. The most threatening, it added, were in Ñuble and Biobío.\"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe\" in the two regions, Boric said in a post on X. \"All resources are available,\" he added.The fires have affected 20,000 hectares (50,000 acres) in the two regions so far, local media say.The bulk of the evacuations were carried out in the cities of Penco and Lirquen, just north of Concepción, which have a combined population of 60,000.Strong winds have fanned the flames amid summer temperatures, endangering communities and hampering firefighting efforts.Much of Chile is under heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach 38C between Santiago and Biobío in the next two days.Two years ago, forest fires killed at least 120 people in the Valparaíso region near Santiago.",

    "body": "The Syrian government has announced an immediate nationwide ceasefire with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), taking almost full control of the country, Syrian state media says.The ceasefire ends nearly two weeks of fighting and forms part of a broader 14-point agreement that will see the SDF integrated into Syria's military and state institutions.Speaking in Damascus, President Ahmed al-Sharaa said the deal would allow Syrian state institutions to reassert control over three eastern and northern governorates - al-Hasakah, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa. It follows a meeting between al-Sharaa and the US special envoy to Syria, Tom Barrack, in Damascus. Barrack praised the agreement as a step toward a \"unified Syria.\"SDF commander Mazloum Abdi was expected to attend the meeting but was unable to travel due to weather conditions, with his visit postponed until Monday, al-Sharaa said.In a televised address, Abdi confirmed the meeting and said he would share more details about the agreement with Syria's Kurds after returning from the capital. Speaking on Kurdish television channel Ronahi, he said the deal he had agreed to with Damascus included a ceasefire to avoid a broader war, stressing that the fighting had been \"imposed\" on the SDF.Kurdish-led forces established their autonomous administration during Syria's civil war, almost a decade ago, with strong backing from the United States, which armed and trained the SDF as its main local partner in the fight against the Islamic State group (Isis). With US military support, the SDF drove Isis from much of northeastern Syria and went on to govern both Kurdish and Arab-majority areas.Under the agreement, signed by al-Sharaa and Abdi, Syrian authorities will take over civilian institutions, border crossings and oil and gas fields that have underpinned Kurdish self-rule. SDF military and security personnel will be integrated into Syria's defence and interior ministries following vetting, while Damascus will assume responsibility for prisons and detention camps holding tens of thousands of foreign Isis fighters and their families.Damascus also reiterated pledges to recognise Kurdish cultural and linguistic rights, including giving Kurdish official language status and marking the Kurdish new year as a national holiday - the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence from France in 1946.Kuridsh media reported that Abdi said the SDF remained committed to protecting what he described as the \"achievements\" and \"specific characteristics\" of the Kurdish-led administration in northeast Syria.The agreement also reaffirms Syria's participation in the US-led coalition against Islamic State.The deal follows months of stalled negotiations after a previous integration effort failed and comes after Syrian government forces moved into Raqqa and nearby oil facilities following an SDF withdrawal earlier on Sunday.Al-Sharaa said last week it was unacceptable for a militia to control a quarter of the country and hold its main oil and commodities resources.",

    "body": "Soldiers are on standby for possible deployment to Minneapolis, a US defence official has told CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The official said the 1,500 soldiers, currently in Alaska, are an option for US President Donald Trump if he decided to use active duty military personnel, as anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) demonstrations continued in the city on Saturday.No decision has yet been made on whether to deploy the soldiers from Alaska, the official said.Minnesota officials have urged protesters to stay orderly and peaceful during demonstrations after an ICE agent shot dead US citizen Renee Good earlier this month. The soldiers are part of the 11th Airborne Division in Fort Wainwright, the official added.In a Sunday interview on CBS Face the Nation, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey condemned Trump's threat to send more troops into the city, saying the existing presence of federal ICE agents is already an \"occupying force that has quite literally invaded our city\".\"You can go through whatever rhetorical flourish you want, but when you have 3,000 ICE agents and border control come to the city, when you've got this supposed threat of 1,500 military coming to the city, yeah, that's very much what it feels like,\" Frey said.Last week, Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used law that allows active-duty military personnel to be deployed for law enforcement duties inside the US.It comes as a US federal judge issued an order limiting the crowd control tactics that can be used by ICE agents towards \"peaceful and unobstructive\" protesters in Minneapolis.On Friday, Judge Katherine Menendez ruled that federal agents cannot arrest or pepper spray peaceful demonstrations, including those monitoring or observing ICE agents. But Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a Sunday interview on CBS's Face the Nation that the judge's ruling is \"a little ridiculous\" because it \"didn't change anything\". \"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"The state's National Guard has been mobilised and placed on alert by Governor Tim Walz, and other law enforcement officers were deployed to Minneapolis ahead of the anti-ICE demonstrations.Recent protests in the city were sparked by widespread action by ICE in the city, and follow Good's death on 7 January.City leaders said Good was there as a legal observer of ICE activity.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".",

    "body": "4 hours agoNick BeakeEurope correspondent, in BrusselsIt's not yet a full year since European leaders buckled up for President Trump's second term, and now this rollercoaster ride feels it has reached its most dangerous turn yet.The occupant on the White House is dangling the threat of economic punishment over the heads of countries that are supporting the territorial integrity of an EU member, Denmark. Leaders will hold an emergency EU summit about this in the coming days. If the European Union fights back with similar countermeasures, then it risks a full-blown trade war with the US.If it doesn't take action, will Trump conclude the bloc of 27 is weak, divided and too scared to stop him carrying out his threat of obtaining Greenland – either by buying or taking it with military force?French President Emmanuel Macron says it's time to use the EU's \"trade bazooka\" for the first time. This is the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which would allow Europe to hit back with counter-tariffs, restrict access to the Single Market and block applications for lucrative EU contracts.There is a great irony that this weapon was originally designed to combat any bullying interference from a hostile external power.They were thinking of China, not the US.In the here and now, some EU leaders are weary of the Macron approach. Among them is Italy's Giorgia Meloni, who has enjoyed a better-than-most rapport with Trump.She has spoken of a \"problem of understanding and communication\" over the recent sending of troops to Greenland by some European countries, including Denmark, but hasn't expanded on what may have been misunderstood.If the intention was to placate Trump and suggest he is absolutely right that Arctic security must be stepped up, the sight of those soldiers only seemed to provoke him into making his latest threat.Meloni's explanation of something lost in translation opens the door to a more diplomatic approach to tackling this precarious EU-US crisis.Sunday's emergency meeting in Brussels of EU ambassadors was a discreet affair, unlike the routine top level summits where the traffic stops, roads are closed and leaders stream towards the cameras to deliver their thoughts.It's not clear who will make the next move and whether Trump will take some heat out of his latest threat or in fact double down on it.EU action on something so sensitive is unlikely to be swift and unanimous.Europe has tried to placate President Trump in his second term as best they can. Some have called it shrewd, others sycophantic.But now, there's a distinct feeling he's not just pulling up the Transatlantic diplomatic drawbridge, but is threatening to blow it up altogether.",

    "body": "1 day agoJack BurgessandGhoncheh Habibiazad,BBC PersianIranian leader press office via Getty ImagesIran's supreme leader has for the first time publicly acknowledged that thousands of people were killed during recent protests.In a speech on Saturday, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said thousands had been killed, \"some in an inhuman, savage manner\", and blamed the US for the deaths.A violent response to the unrest has claimed 3,090 lives, according to US-based Iranian Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), with some activist groups putting the death toll far higher. An internet blackout has made it extremely difficult to get clear information.US President Donald Trump recently urged Iranian demonstrators to \"keep protesting\" and threatened military intervention if security forces kill them.\"Those linked to Israel and the US caused massive damage and killed several thousand,\" Khamenei said, quoted by Iranian state media.\"We consider the US president criminal for the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted on the Iranian nation.\"The protests, which began on 28 December over the economy, have turned into calls for the end of the rule of Iran's supreme leader.The Iranian government has called the demonstrations \"riots\" backed by Iran's enemies.Protesters have been met with deadly force and videos of security forces shooting at demonstrations have been authenticated by both BBC Persian and BBC Verify.There has also been a near-total shutdown of the internet and communication services in Iran. On Saturday overall connectivity remained at about 2% of ordinary levels, according to cyber monitor NetBlocks.There have been fewer reports of unrest in recent days but with internet access still restricted developments on the ground remain unclear. A woman in Shiraz, south-western Iran, told BBC Persian that \"security forces are still patrolling on motorbikes to keep the situation under control, but overall things have gone back to normal\". During his speech on Saturday, Khamenei also said Iran considered President Trump to be a \"criminal\" and said the US must be \"held accountable\" for recent unrest.He also claimed on social media that \"America's goal is to swallow Iran\". Trump has not yet responded to the supreme leader and the BBC has approached the White House for a comment.The US state department said on Saturday that it had \"heard reports that the Islamic Republic is preparing options to target American bases\".It said Iran would be met with \"a very, very powerful force\" if it launched such an attack and warned Tehran not to \"play games with President Trump\".The US president said on Wednesday he had been told \"the killing in Iran has stopped\", but added that he had not ruled out military action against the country.His comments came after the US and UK both reduced the number of personnel at the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar.Officials told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that a partial American withdrawal was a \"precautionary measure\".",

    "body": "8 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersIsrael's leader Benjamin Netanyahu has convened a meeting with his top advisers to discuss US President Donald Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, after Israel said it was not included in talks about the makeup of one of the board's lower bodies. The US on Saturday named the first members of the Gaza Executive Board - including Turkey's foreign minister, a Qatari official, former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Netanyahu's office has since said this was \"not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy\". The Board of Peace is part of Trump's 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war and is expected to temporarily oversee the running of Gaza.The exact structure of the board, which will also manage Gaza's reconstruction, remains unclear and members are still being invited.The \"Gaza Executive Board\" will be responsible for overseeing all on-the-ground work of yet another administrative group, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), according to a statement released by the White House. A second body, the \"founding Executive Board\" - which also includes Kushner and Blair - will have a high-level focus on investment and diplomacy.So far, the only Israeli member on the Gaza Executive Board is Yakir Gabay, a businessman born in Israel and now based in Cyprus. There are no Palestinians on either senior board. Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir wrote on X: \"The Gaza Strip does not need any \"administrative committee\" to oversee its \"rehabilitation\" - it needs to be cleansed of Hamas terrorists\".Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid called the announcement a \"diplomatic failure for Israel.\"Officials from Qatar and Turkey, which have both been critical of Israel's military actions in Gaza, are confirmed members of the advisory panel.The overarching Board of Peace will be made up of world leaders, with President Trump as its chairman, the White House said.While those members have not been announced, the leaders of the UK, Hungary, Argentina, Jordan, Turkey, India, and Egypt have reportedly been invited.Governments have reacted cautiously to the invitations, with only Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a Trump ally, confirming he has accepted the role.The White House said those chosen will work to ensure \"effective governance and the delivery of best-in-class services that advance peace, stability, and prosperity for the people of Gaza\".The UK was seeking more clarity on the committee, a government source told the BBC.On Saturday, Bloomberg reported that Trump was asking countries to contribute $1bn (£745m) to join the panel.Speaking to CBS news, a US official confirmed the reports, but clarified that countries could still join on a three year membership without paying anything. Canada's Mark Carney said that he agreed with Trump's plan on principle, but that the details - including financial ones - were still being worked through. Speaking to reporters in Doha on Sunday, he made clear that Canada did not have \"unimpeded\" aid funds to cover the costs of membership.  Meanwhile, the United Nations warned on Saturday that the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is \"far from over\". The UN estimates around 80% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged and families who have survived the war are now struggling with the winter weather, and a lack of food and shelter.Olga Cherevko from the UN aid coordination office said that the delivery of tonnes of aid and the fixing of roads in the months since a ceasefire came into effect were a \"band aid\" rather than a solution. Bitter winter weather has led to further complications, destroying buildings and making it difficult to access healthcare. Israel says that it is facilitating humanitarian assistance, and has blamed the UN for failing to distribute supplies already in Gaza. It argues any restrictions are designed to stop Hamas infiltrating and exploiting relief efforts.",

    "body": "'Young 40s': Gen Z has found a new way to mock millennials for their style in South Korea1 day agoHyojung KimBBC KoreanInstagram/@detailanceJi says he has become more self-conscious interacting with younger colleaguesJi Seung-ryeol, 41, prides himself on his sense of fashion. He diligently shares mirror selfies on Instagram, where everyone knows the more likes you get, the cooler you are.  So he was bewildered to find out that men his age have become the subject of ridicule online, mocked for shoehorning their way into styles associated with Gen Z and younger millennials.AI-generated caricatures of this demographic have gone viral on social media: a middle-aged man decked out in street wear and clutching an iPhone. The kids call them \"Young 40s\".The memes have made Ji's beloved Nike Air Jordans and Stüssy T-shirts the butt of jokes—and the source of much indignation.\"I'm just buying and wearing things I've liked for a long time, now that I can afford them,\" he tells the BBC. \"Why is this something to be attacked for?\"The iPhone that started it allOnce celebrated as pioneers of taste in the 1990s, the tide of public opinion on 40-year-olds turned after the release of the iPhone 17 last September.The smartphone, long considered the preserve of the youth, was suddenly recast as a tacky trademark of Young 40s. These are, in the words of Gen Z Jeong Ju-eun, people \"trying too hard to look young\", who \"refuse to accept that time has passed\".The figures seem to reflect this shift. While the majority of young South Koreans still prefer the iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy, over the past year Apple's market share fell by 4% among Gen Z consumers and rose 12% for people in their 40s, according to research by Gallup.Something similar played out a few years back with Geriatric Millennials, born in the early '80s, whose brand of humour—the crying-laughing emoji, finger moustaches and the word \"adulting\"—was derided as cringey.Back then, debate over Geriatric Millennials sparked self-deprecating jokes, think pieces and quizzes dictating if you're meant to pile on the ribbing or be subjected to it.The same trends have taken hold in South Korea with Young 40s.News1The iPhone, long considered the preserve of young people, is now seen as a trademark of Young 40sIn Korea, age difference, even by a year, forms the basis of social hierarchy. Age is one of the first things strangers ask each other, setting the tone for future interactions: how they address one another, who gets to open the bottle of soju at parties (it's usually the oldest person) and which way to tip your shot glass (the correct answer: away from your seniors).But the Young 40 memes also represent Korean youth's growing scepticism of this almost forced reverence for elders.Just a few years ago, the term \"kkondae\" was another buzzword among young South Korean to describe an annoying breed of rigid, condescending elders.Such friction has been exacerbated by social media, where \"multiple generations mix within the same space\", says Lee Jae-in, a sociology professor at Korea University's Sejong campus.\"The old pattern where different generations consumed separate cultural spaces has largely disappeared,\" he adds.A self-conscious sandwich generationPopularised in marketing circles in the 2010s, the term \"Young 40\" originally referred to consumers with youthful sensibilities. They were health-conscious, active and comfortable with technology—an important target demographic for companies.\"In the past, people in their 40s were seen as already old,\" says Kim Yong-Sup, a trend analyst widely credited with coining the term \"Young 40\".As the median age of South Korea's society rose, however, these people were \"no longer on the verge of old age but at the centre of society\", he says.But the marketing term has since taken a viral, sardonic turn. Over the past year, \"Young 40\" was mentioned online more than 100,000 times - more than half the references were used in a negative context, according to analytics platform SomeTrend. Many of them appeared alongside words like \"old\" and \"disgusting\".An offshoot of the meme is Sweet Young 40, a sarcastic label for middle-aged men who like to hit on young women.Getty ImagesMany South Korean youth face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job marketSome see the jokes about Young 40s as a form of punching up: these are people at the peak of their careers, who amassed wealth in a time of economic stability and a property boom.On the other side are Gen Z and young millennials, born a couple of decades later, who face soaring house prices and cut-throat competition in the job market. In their eyes, Young 40s represent \"the generation that made it through just before the door of opportunity closed\", according to psychologist Oh Eun-kyung.\"They are seen not simply as individuals with personal tastes, but as symbols of privilege and power,\" she says. \"That's why the energy of mockery is focused on them.\"But Ji, the 41-year-old fashion enthusiast who lived through the so-called golden era, tells a different version of that story.After experiencing the Asian financial crisis as a teen, Ji entered a tough job market in his 20s, submitting around 60-70 applications to land a job. His generation is one that \"had very little to enjoy growing up, and only began to enjoy things later, as adults\", he says.Instagram/@detailanceJi says he feels \"caught in between\" two generationsNow at the workplace, he often finds himself sandwiched between two worlds. The generation above him ran a \"strict, top-down system where you did what you were told\", while below him is \"a generation that asks 'why''\".\"We're a generation that has experienced both cultures. We feel caught in between.\"While the ability to straddle two generations was once a badge of honour, Ji says he has become self-conscious about interacting with younger colleagues for fear of being labelled a kkondae or Young 40.\"These days, I hardly organise drinking gatherings,\" he says. \"I try to keep conversations focused on work or career concerns, and only share personal stories when discussions naturally deepen.\"According to Kang, another fashionable 41-year-old, sitting at the heart of the Young 40 meme is a deeply human desire.\"As you get older, longing for youth becomes completely natural. Wanting to look young is something every generation shares.\"",

    "body": "2 days agoNadine YousifSenior Canada reporterWatch: Canada-China trade relationship \"more predictable\" than with US, says CarneyPrime Minister Mark Carney's new approach to Canada's foreign policy can perhaps be distilled in one line: \"We take the world as it is, not as we wish it to be.\"That was his response when asked about the deal struck with China on Friday, despite concerns over its human rights record and nearly a year after he called China \"the biggest security threat\" facing Canada. The deal will see Canada ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles that it imposed in tandem with the US in 2024. In exchange, China will lower retaliatory tariffs on key Canadian agricultural products.Experts told the BBC the move represents a significant shift in Canada's policy on China, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner. \"The prime minister is saying, essentially, that Canada has agency too, and that it's not going to just sit and wait for the United States,\" said Eric Miller, a Washington DC based trade adviser and president of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group.China and Canada announce tariffs relief after high-stakes meetingCarney faces delicate balancing act in China visitFour things the US wants from Canada on tradeCarney told reporters on Friday that \"the world has changed\" in recent years, and the progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".Canada's relationship with China, he added, had become \"more predictable\" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration. He later wrote, in a social media post, that Canada was \"recalibrating\" its relationship with China, \"strategically, pragmatically, and decisively\".In Canada, as daylight broke on Friday, reaction to the deal was swift.Some, like Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe, hailed it as \"very good news\". Farmers in Moe's province have been hard hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola oil, and the deal, he said, would bring much needed relief.But Ontario Premier Doug Ford, whose province is home to Canada's auto sector, was sharply critical of the deal. He said removing EV tariffs on China \"would hurt our economy and lead to job losses\". In a post on X, Ford said Carney's government was \"inviting a flood of cheap made-in-China electric vehicles without any real guarantees of equal or immediate investment in Canada's economy\". Some experts said the electric vehicle provisions in the trade deal would help China make inroads into the Canadian automobile market.With the lower EV tariffs, approximately 10% of Canada's electric vehicle sales are now expected to go to Chinese automakers, said Vivek Astvansh, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal.The expected increase in Chinese EV sales could put pressure on US-based EV makers like Tesla which are seeking to expand their market share in Canada, he said.\"Carney has signalled to the Trump administration that it is warming up to China,\" Astvansh added.Reaction from the White House, meanwhile, has been mixed.In an interview with CNBC on Friday morning, US trade representative Jamieson Greer called the deal \"problematic\" and said Canada may come to regret it. President Donald Trump, however, hailed it as \"a good thing\".\"If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" he told reporters outside the White House.Since taking office for a second time last year, Trump has imposed tariffs on Canadian sectors like metals and automotives, which has led to swirling economic uncertainty. He has also threatened to rip up a longstanding North American free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, calling it \"irrelevant\".That trade agreement, the USMCA, is now under a mandatory review. Canada and Mexico have both made clear they want it to remain in place. But the decision to carve out a major new deal with China is a recognition by Carney that the future of North American free trade remains unclear, Miller of the Rideau Potomac Strategy Group told the BBC.\"There's a reasonable chance that we could end up in 2026 without a meaningful, workable trade deal with the United States,\" he said. \"And Canada needs to be prepared.\"Getty ImagesChina is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for over 70% of global productionThe deal with China drops Canada's levies on Chinese EVs from 100% to 6.1% for the first 49,000 vehicles imported each year. That quota could rise, Carney said, reaching 70,000 in half a decade.Canada and the US put levies on Chinese EVs in 2024, arguing that China was overproducing vehicles and undermining the ability of other countries to compete. China is the world's largest producer of EVs, accounting for 70% of global production. In exchange, China will cut tariffs on Canadian canola seed to around 15% by 1 March, down from the current rate of 84%. Carney said Beijing had also committed to removing tariffs on Canadian canola meal, lobsters, crabs and peas \"until at least the end of the year\". China also committed to removing visa requirements for Canadian visitors, Carney said.Beijing did not corroborate the details in a separate statement, but said \"the two reached a preliminary joint agreement on addressing bilateral economic and trade issues\". The introduction of Chinese EVs to Canada's market will likely mean cheaper prices for Canadian consumers, said Gal Raz, an associate professor of Operations Management and Sustainability at Western University and an expert on the EV supply chain. But Raz acknowledged that the deal Canada struck could hurt Canadian car manufacturers if it comes without further action from the Carney government to help the domestic sector. He said it was the result of an \"unfortunate\" deterioration of the Canada-US trade relationship, which he noted has also hurt Canada's automotive industry.\"The US has really put Canada in a corner,\" he said.Asked why Canada is giving China access to its automotive market, Carney said that China produces \"some of the most affordable and energy-efficient vehicles in the world\". He said he expects the deal will spur Chinese investment into Canada's auto industry, though he did not provide further details.Trump himself has signalled openness to China building plants in the US if it means creating more jobs for Americans, despite his tough-on-China stance.\"If they want to come in and build a plant and hire you and hire your friends and your neighbours, that's great, I love that,\" Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club on Tuesday. \"Let China come in, let Japan come in.\"The US president is notably headed to Beijing for his own meeting with President Xi Jinping in April. He has also invited Xi for a state visit to Washington. For Carney, though, Friday's deal may just be the first step in a \"recalibration\" of Canada's trade relations.With additional reporting from Daniel Bush in Washington",

    "body": "2 days agoYolande KnellMiddle East correspondent, JerusalemBBCItzik Gvili demands the return of his son Ran, the last dead hostage in Gaza, in Tel Aviv's Hostages SquareIn central Tel Aviv, the main stage has now been dismantled in Hostages Square, the focal point for the campaign over the past two years to bring back Israelis held in Gaza.Nearby, signs and posters have been taken down, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum has vacated the offices that served as its nerve centre. Of the 251 hostages seized by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups in the 7 October 2023 attacks, 168 have been brought back alive from Gaza, eight have been rescued. Only one deceased hostage, Ran Gvili, remains.With songs and prayers instead of mass rallies, the Gvili family and a small crowd of supporters assemble in Hostages Square each Friday to mark the start of the Jewish Sabbath; this week, a candle for the Hanukkah holiday was also lit. They are determined to bring back the young police officer who was killed by Hamas fighters after he rushed to help people being attacked in Kibbutz Alumim in southern Israel in October 2023.\"I feel every day is still the 7 October. We didn't pass the 7 October, but we are strong, and we're waiting for him. We do whatever we need,\" says Itzik Gvili, Ran's father. \"This gives us hope: the support of the people.\"ReutersThe Hostages and Missing Families Forum's slogan is: \"Bring them home now\"From the start, people power has been key to the hostage families. As its operations wind down, members of the Hostages Families Forum have been reflecting on its extraordinary evolution which turned the grassroots group into a powerful international lobbying force.In the terrible aftermath of the 2023 Hamas-led assault on southern Israel, which also killed some 1,200 people, a huge group of distraught relatives gathered for the first time in Tel Aviv desperately seeking answers about their missing loved ones. Because of the incoming rocket fire from Gaza, they met in an underground car park.\"We were together, shocked, and it fell on me that this is actually real, that now we are going to face this unbelievable challenge of understanding where all these people are, getting them home,\" recalls Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat had been snatched from Kibbutz Be'eri.\"And the second thing is that we're going to do this together. I'm not going to stand alone.\"ReutersGil Dickmann (2nd R) said the public support gave him hope after kidnapping of his cousin, Carmel GatThe formation of the new forum, with its slogan: \"Bring them home now\", gave the hostages' families a much-needed sense of regaining control.\"It was very, very powerful to feel that when the government and Israeli state, in a way collapsed in those very first few days after 7 October, it felt like nothing was working, what was working was Israeli society,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"So many wonderful people came to help. That brought me a lot of hope.\"Dividing its efforts between supporting the families - many of whom were bereaved and displaced from their homes following the attacks - and campaigning in Israel and around the world, the Hostages Families Forum worked with more than 10,000 volunteers. They included former Israeli diplomats, lawyers and security officials.Funded entirely by donations, it began to pay some staff, and a high-tech company loaned its central Tel Aviv office space.ReutersA makeshift tunnel symbolizing Hamas's tunnel network in Gaza was constructed at Hostages Square In November 2023 - more than six weeks into the brutal war in Gaza, which had by then killed more than 14,000 Palestinians according to the Hamas-run health ministry - Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated truce.This saw most women and children hostages returned in exchange for Israel releasing more than 240 Palestinian prisoners, all women and children. Hamas also freed some foreign nationals.But after a week, the fighting resumed with ferocity. About half of the hostages were left in Gaza. In December, three Israeli hostages were killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza despite the fact they were shirtless, waving a makeshift white flag, and calling out in Hebrew.Israeli Prime Minister's Office/handout via ReutersItay Regev and his sister Maya were released during the November 2023 ceasefireThose were difficult days for the Hostages Families Forum and in early 2024, with polls suggesting more Israelis prioritised eliminating Hamas over the return of those still held captive, it brought in political strategist, Lior Chorev, as campaign manager.\"We were in deep war in Gaza, deep war in Lebanon, there was the Iranian threat, and it appeared that everything was stuck, and public opinion was against us,\" Mr Chorev explains.\"As a civil society organisation, we could not impact whether or not there's going to be a deal, but we could work hard on the Israeli public opinion to ensure that if a deal came into place, it would have a sound civilian majority within the country.\"ReutersGaza has been devastated by the two-year war sparked by 7 October 2023 Hamas-led attacks on IsraelAs well as Saturday evening demonstrations in the plaza in front of the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, now renamed Hostages Square, there were near-daily actions by the Hostages Families Forum ranging from concerts and art installations to civil disruption. Media and diplomatic teams helped keep the hostages at the centre of attention.\"They kept going 24/7 for two years,\" comments Times of Israel political correspondent Tal Schneider who, like visiting foreign officials, often went to the forum's HQ. \"This place became like a foreign ministry for the country, for the families of 250 people.\"Looking back, Michael Levy says his intensive campaigning helped him deal with the \"emotional rollercoaster\" after his sister-in-law, Einav, was killed at the Nova Festival and his younger brother, Or, was taken hostage alive.\"The only thing that helped me was becoming active. I was interviewed all the time. I went with 15 different delegations to over 12 countries. I spoke to whoever was willing to listen and didn't want to stop and think,\" Mr Levy says.\"You need to stay optimistic all the time. You need to tell yourself every morning that today is going to be the day that he's going to be released, even though you know you are lying to yourself.\"ReutersMichael Levy's brother, Or, was released during the ceasefire that lasted from January to March 2025Although a hostage-prisoner exchange deal to end the war laid out in mid-2024 was described by then-US President Joe Biden as an Israeli proposal, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was widely seen as dragging out hostilities to aid his own political survival – a claim he rejected.Tensions rose between the Hostages Families Forum and Israel's government; there was open animosity from some government supporters.The situation worsened after a Netanyahu aide was accused of deliberately acquiring and illegally leaking a top-secret document to a German newspaper to influence how Israel's public viewed negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal. The document was misleadingly cast as suggesting that pressure on the prime minister played into the hands of Hamas.ReutersHundreds of people were killed or taken hostage at the Nova music festival during the 7 October 2023 attacksFor Mr Dickmann and Mr Levy, there was a low point when they headed to Washington for Netanyahu's address to a joint meeting of US Congress in July 2024 with other forum members.They showed off T-shirts saying \"Seal the deal\" during an ovation for the Israeli leader and were arrested for an unlawful demonstration. \"That was one of the moments in which I felt most alone,\" Mr Dickmann says. \"It was one of the most frightening things and it was while Carmel was still alive in captivity.\"The worst news came a month later when Carmel and five other hostages were killed by their Hamas captors, as the Israeli military closed in nearby.Mr Dickmann says it was only an \"unbelievable support group\" of younger forum members that helped him get through the ordeal.After the Israeli deaths were confirmed, angry protesters flooded the streets of Israeli cities. The forum puts the total number at 600,000.In Tel Aviv, a crowd of hostage families and their supporters marched with six prop coffins. A crowd gathered outside Israel's military headquarters and clashed with police on a major road.EPAThe killing of Carmel Gat and five other hostages by their Hamas captors sparked a huge protest in Tel AvivBy the start of 2025, international opposition to the devastating Gaza war had reached new heights as the number of Palestinians killed approached 48,000, according to Gaza's health ministry.In Israel, polls indicated a clear shift in Israeli public opinion, with a growing majority backing a hostage deal to end the war. With the election of a new US president, the Hostages Families Forum was increasingly directing its efforts stateside.\"They needed to bypass their own government,\" comments Ms Schneider.  \"The most important person for the job was obviously [US] President [Donald] Trump. There were signs written in English carried by the people and they would pack all their messages into a one-minute video, and they'd send it to him.\"Working with regional mediators, the US secured a new Gaza deal between Israel and Hamas in January 2025, just as Trump took office. The first stage brought back 33 hostages – eight of whom were dead – in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. Five Thai hostages were also released.But in mid-March, Israel ended the ceasefire, resuming its heavy bombing of Gaza, without starting talks on the deal's second stage, which involved a full end to fighting and the return of the remaining hostages.The White HouseReleased hostages travelled to Washington to ask President Donald Trump to ensure the return of those left behind in GazaFrail and emaciated following his release in February under the ceasefire deal, Or Levy was emotionally reunited with his three-year-old son, his parents and brother Michael. However, Michael's joy was short-lived. He quickly resumed his campaigning with others in the Hostages Families Forum.\"I got what I wanted, I got my brother back, but I couldn't just stop,\" he says, \"I couldn't be happy because in those 491 days, they became my family. I almost felt I knew all the other hostages, that every hostage still there was part of my family.\"Newly freed hostages gave TV interviews saying they had been starved and beaten in captivity, sometimes in response to the ill-treatment of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Despite their trauma and fragile health, a few of the former hostages travelled to the White House urging President Trump to use his influence to bring back all the living and dead Israelis they had left behind in Gaza.ReutersEvyatar David was among the last 20 living hostages freed shortly after the current ceasefire began in OctoberThere were more dramatic moments.In September, an Israeli air strike unsuccessfully targeted the exiled Hamas leadership as it met in Qatar, a regional mediator, to discuss a new ceasefire proposal presented by the US.However, the ultimate effect was to push the Trump administration - backed up by its Arab allies – towards a new plan to end the war, which had by then killed more than 67,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's health ministry.Israel and Hamas agreed a ceasefire deal, under which all 20 living and 28 dead hostages still in Gaza would be handed over in return for almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in Israeli jails, as well as a surge in humanitarian aid and a partial Israeli withdrawal.ReutersIsrael released about 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees from Gaza in exchange for the living hostagesWhen Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, arrived in Israel just after the latest ceasefire started on 10 October, they were greeted by rapturous applause on stage in Hostages Square.On 13 October, the remaining living hostages came back.\"I'll never have a happier day in my life,\" says Mr Dickmann, remembering seeing his best friends reunited with their loved ones.Mr Chorev, the Hostage Families Forum's chief strategist, considers that long-held Jewish and Israeli traditions won through.\"This basic value of the Israeli theme that you don't leave anyone behind, that you're responsible for each and every Israeli held by the enemy, this was something that was unclear to certain elements in the Israeli government,\" he says. \"But it was very clear to the Israeli public.\"Tali (L) has been helping out hostages' families since the beginning of the warSlowly, 27 of the dead hostages' bodies have been returned to Israel over the past two months.Amid the ruins of Gaza, where health ministry officials say the number of Palestinians killed has risen to more than 70,000, Hamas operatives and the Red Cross have been searching for Ran Gvili's body east of Gaza City.Now, the last funds of the Hostages Families Forum are being used to support the Gvilis and a few dozen volunteers continue to head to Hostages Square on Fridays.\"We have been here in the rain and in nearly 50-degree [Celsius] heat, from winter to summer,\" says Tali, from Tel Aviv. \"Now that this is nearly over, I have mixed emotions. There is still one hostage who hasn't come back. I told myself I would stay until the last one.\"A symbolic tunnel, a large \"Hope\" sign and a piano put in the square in honour of now released hostage, Alon Ohel - a musician - have not yet been removed, nor has the giant countdown board which marks the days since 7 October 2023. A final mass rally is promised for when Ran Gvili's body is returned for burial.Itzik and Talik Gvili are determined to bring their son Ran home for a proper burial Israel's prime minister has never appeared in Hostages Square, but he has met with released hostages and hostage families, including those from a small, alternative group to the Hostages Families Forum, the Tikva Forum. The Gvilis belong to both.The family joined a candle-lighting ceremony on the first night of Hanukkah with Netanyahu.\"We will bring Ran back, just as we brought back 254 out of our 255 abductees,\" the prime minister said - counting two living and two deceased hostages held in Gaza before 2023.  \"Some did not believe. I believe. My friends in the government believed. They said: 'It will be a miracle.' I said: 'This nation performs miracles.'\"But in Israel, painful questions linger over why more hostages' lives were not saved.The Hostages Families Forum recently released harrowing Hamas videos recovered in Gaza which show the six hostages who were later murdered, including Carmel Gat, celebrating Hanukkah in a tunnel in 2023.The hostage crisis continues to cast a long shadow over Israeli society; even as many take heart from the families' message of endurance and solidarity.Additional reporting by Davide Ghiglione and Gidi Kleiman",

    "body": "2 days agoGrace Tsoi,BBC World ServiceandBBC News Chinese,Hong KongBBCJimmy Lai, 78, faces life in prison for national security offencesOn a winter morning in 2022 Raphael Wong and Figo Chan walked into Hong Kong's Stanley prison to meet Jimmy Lai, the media billionaire who had been arrested two years before and was awaiting trial charged with national security offences.They had all been part of the turbulent protests that had rocked Hong Kong in 2019, when hundreds of thousands took to the streets demanding democracy and more freedom in the Chinese territory. They would also often meet for dinner, sometimes lavish meals, gossiping and bantering over dim sum, pizza or claypot rice.In prison, he \"loved eating rice with pickled ginger,\" Chan said. \"No-one could have imagined Jimmy Lai would eat something like that!\"But neither had they imagined a reunion at a maximum security prison, the protests crushed, friends and fellow activists jailed, Hong Kong just as boisterous and yet, changed. And gone was the owner of the irreverent nickname \"Fatty Lai\": he had lost considerable weight.Decades apart - Lai in his 70s, Wong and Chan about 40 years younger - they had still dreamed of a different Hong Kong. Lai was a key figure in the protests, wielding his most influential asset, the hugely popular newspaper, Apple Daily, in the hope of shaping Hong Kong into a liberal democracy. That proved risky under a contentious national security law imposed in 2020 by China's Communist Party rulers in Beijing.Lai always said he owed Hong Kong. Although he is a UK citizen, he refused to leave. \"I got everything I have because of this place,\" he told the BBC hours before he was arrested in 2020. \"This is my redemption,\" he said, choking up.He wanted the city to continue to have the freedom it had given him. That's what drove his politics - fiercely critical of the Communist Party and avowedly supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. It cost him his own freedom.Watch: Jimmy Lai's last interview as a free man in 2020Lai harboured \"a rabid hatred\" of the Chinese Communist Party and \"an obsession to change the Party's values to those of the Western world\", the High Court ruled on Monday as it delivered the verdict in his trial. It said that Lai had hoped the party would be ousted - or, at the very least, that its leader Xi Jinping would be removed.Lai was found guilty on all counts of charges he had always denied. The most serious one - colluding with foreign forces - carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.\"Never,\" Lai had said to that charge when he testified, arguing that he had only advocated for what he believed were Hong Kong's values: \"rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly\".Monday's verdict was welcomed by Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee, who said Lai had used his newspaper to \"wantonly create social conflicts\" and \"glorify violence\". The law, he added, never allows anyone to harm the country \"under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom\".Getty ImagesLai's wife Teresa and son Shun-yan at court for Lai's verdict, along with Cardinal Joseph Zen, former bishop of Hong Kong who baptised Lai in 1997 Back in 2022, before Wong and Chan left the prison, Lai asked them to pray with him, to Wong's surprise.Lai's Catholic faith had deepened in solitary confinement - an arrangement he had requested, according to authorities. He prayed six hours a day and he made drawings of Christ, which he sent in the mail to friends. \"Even though he was suffering,\" Wong said, \"he didn't complain nor was he afraid. He was at peace.\"Peace was not what Jimmy Lai had pursued for much of his life - not when he fled China as a 12-year-old, not while he worked his way up the gruelling factory chain, not even after he became a famous Hong Kong tycoon, and certainly not as his media empire took on Beijing.For Lai, Hong Kong was everything that China was not - deeply capitalist, a land of opportunity and limitless wealth, and free. In the city, which was still a British colony when he arrived in 1959, he found success - and then a voice.Apple Daily became one of the top-selling papers almost instantly after its debut in 1995. Modelled on USA Today, it revolutionised the aesthetics and layout of newspapers, and kicked off a cut-throat price war.From a guide to hiring prostitutes in the \"adult section\" to investigative reports, to columns by economists and novelists, it was a \"buffet\" targeting \"a full range of readers\", said Francis Lee, a journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.Former editors and employees spoke of Lai's encouragement - \"If you dared to do it, he would dare to let you do it\" - and his temper. One said he often swore.They describe him as unconventional, and as a visionary who wasn't afraid to bet on experiments. \"Even before the iPhone was launched, he kept saying mobile phones would be the future,\" recalled one of the paper's editors, adding that he was full of ideas. \"It was as if he asked us to create a new website every day.\"It had been the same when he owned a clothing label. \"He was not afraid of disrupting the industry, and he was not afraid of making enemies,\" said Herbert Chow, a former marketing director at a rival brand.That was both his making and undoing, Chow said: \"Otherwise, there would have been no Apple Daily. Of course, he wouldn't have ended up like this either.\"An early TV commercial for Apple Daily featured the then 48-year-old Lai biting the forbidden fruit while dozens of arrows took aim at him.It became a self-fulfilling prophecy.Jimmylai.substack.comThe Apple Daily commercial when it launched in 1995Escape from ChinaIt was his first taste of chocolate that beckoned Lai to Hong Kong as a boy.After carrying a passenger's luggage at a railway station in China, Lai was given a tip, and a bar of chocolate. He took a bite. \"I asked him where he's from. He said Hong Kong. I said, 'Hong Kong must be heaven' because I had never tasted anything like that,\" Lai said of the encounter in a 2007 documentary, The Call of the Entrepreneur.Life in Mao Zedong's China was punctuated by waves of oppressive campaigns - to industrialise China overnight, to weed out capitalist \"class enemies\". The Lais, once a family of business people, were blacklisted. His father fled to Hong Kong, leaving them behind. His mother was sent to a labour camp.Decades later, Lai wrote of how of he and his sisters would be dragged out of their homes to watch a crowd forcing their mother to kneel while she was shoved and taunted - cruel public shaming that soon became the norm. The first time, Lai wrote, was terrifying: \"My tears flowed freely and wet my shirt. I dared not make a move. My body was burning with humiliation.\"Uncowed, his grandmother finished every story with the same message: \"You have to become a businessman even if you only sell seasoned peanuts!\"And so, at the age of 12, he set off for Hong Kong, among millions who fled the mainland - and Mao's devastating rule - over the years.The day he arrived, on the bottom of a fishing boat, along with about 80 seasick travellers, he was hired by a mitten factory. He described the long working hours as a \"very happy time, a time that I knew I had a future\". It was there that one of his co-workers helped him learn English. Years later, he would give interviews and even testify at court in fluent English.By his early 20s, he was managing a textile factory and after making money on the stock market, he started his own, Comitex Knitters. He was 27.Getty ImagesJimmy Lai at his home in Hong Kong in 1993 Business often took Lai to New York, and on one of those trips, he was lent a book that came to define his worldview: The Road to Serfdom by Nobel Prize-winning economist Friedrich Hayek, a champion of free-market capitalism. \"People's spontaneous reaction\" and \"the exchange of information\" have created the best in the world, was his takeaway. To him, that was Hong Kong's strength.The book spurred a voracious reading habit. He would read the same book multiple times, and read every book by authors he admired.  \"I want to turn the author's thoughts into my backyard garden. I want to buy a garden, not cut flowers,\" he said in a 2009 interview.After a decade in manufacturing, he was \"bored\" and founded the clothing chain Giordano in 1981, which became a fast-fashion pioneer. It was so successful that Tadashi Yanai sought advice from Lai when his Japanese label Uniqlo opened shops.Lai launched stores in China, which had begun to open up after Mao died. He was \"excited\", China \"was going to be changed, like a Western country\", he said in the 2007 documentary.Then in 1989, Beijing crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: a rude awakening for Lai and Hong Kong, which was set to return to Chinese rule in 1997 under a recent agreement by China and the UK.Giordano sold tees with photos of Tiananmen protest leaders and anti-Beijing slogans, and put up pro-democracy banners in stores across Hong Kong.A million people marched in Hong Kong in solidarity with student protesters in Beijing. Until 2020, Hong Kong held the largest vigil that mourned the massacre.Lai said later that he \"didn't feel anything about China\" until then. He had always wanted to forget that part of his life but \"all of a sudden, it was like my mother was calling in the darkness of the night\".Getty ImagesLai was a frequent attendee at Hong Kong 's annual vigils in memory of those who died at Tiananmen Square in 1989'Choice is freedom'The following year Lai launched a magazine called Next, and in 1994 published an open letter to Li Peng, \"the Butcher of Beijing\" who played a key role in the Tiananmen massacre. He called him \"the son of a turtle egg with zero intelligence\".Beijing was furious. Between 1994 and 1996, Giordano's flagship store in Beijing and 11 franchises in Shanghai closed. Lai sold his shares and stepped down as chairman.\"If I just go on making money, it doesn't mean anything to me. But if I go into the media business, then I deliver information, which is choice, and choice is freedom,\" Lai said in the 2007 documentary.He soon became a \"very active participant\" in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, meeting leaders to discuss strategy, said Lee Wing Tat, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party.He became an outspoken critic of the CCP, writing in 1994: \"I entirely oppose the Communist Party because I hate everything that restrains personal liberties.\" He also started to voice concerns about the looming handover of Hong Kong, from Britain to China, in 1997. \"After more than a century of colonial rule, Hong Kongers feel proud to return to the embrace of the motherland,\" he wrote. \"But should we love the motherland even if it doesn't have freedom?\"During the handover, however, China's then-leader Jiang Zemin promised that Hongkongers would govern Hong Kong and the city would have a high degree of autonomy for the next 50 years.Getty ImagesLai at an \"Occupy Central\" protest in Admiralty in October 2014The 2014 Umbrella Movement sparked by Beijing's refusal to allow completely free elections in Hong Kong became another turning point for Lai.Protesters occupied the city's main commercial districts for 79 days. Lai turned up from 9am to 5pm every day, undeterred after a man threw animal entrails at him. \"When the police started firing tear gas, I was with Fatty,\" the former lawmaker Lee recalled.The movement ended when the court ordered protest sites to be cleared, but the government did not budge. Five years later, in 2019, Hong Kong erupted again, this time because of a controversial plan that would have allowed extradition to mainland China.What began as peaceful marches became increasingly violent, turning the city into a battleground for six months. Black-clad protesters threw bricks and Molotov cocktails, stormed parliament and started fires; riot police fired tear gas, rubber bullets, water cannons and live rounds.Lai was at the forefront of the protests and served 20 months for participating in four unauthorised assemblies. A protester told the BBC he was surprised to see Lai: \"To me, he's a busy businessman, but he showed up.\"Getty ImagesLai at a pro-democracy march in 2019 Apple Daily provided blanket coverage or, as critics would argue, a sounding board for an anti-government movement.Government adviser Ronny Tong said Lai was \"instrumental\" in the protests because Apple Daily carried a \"totally false\" slogan – anti-extradition to China – which \"caught the imagination of people who wanted to cause havoc in Hong Kong\".Whether Apple Daily played a seditious role, and how much control Lai exerted over its stance was at the centre of his 156-day national security trial.Lai instructed the editorial team to \"urge people to take to the streets\", according to Cheung Kim-hung, former chief executive of Apple Daily's parent company Next Digital, and a defendant-turned-prosecution witness. After the National Security Law took effect, the newspaper was raided twice and eventually shut down in 2021.During the height of the protests, Lai flew to the US where he met then Vice-President Mike Pence to discuss the situation in Hong Kong. A month before the National Security Law was imposed, Lai launched a controversial campaign, despite internal pushback, urging Apple Daily readers to send letters to then US President Donald Trump to \"save Hong Kong\".All of this, the court ruled, amounted to a public appeal for a foreign government to interfere in Hong Kong's internal affairs.\"Nobody in their right mind should think that Hong Kong can undergo any kind of political reform without at least tacit acceptance from Beijing,\" Tong said. The protests in 2014 and 2019 \"are totally against common sense\".Getty ImagesCopies of the last Apple Daily newspaper early on June 24, 2021Beijing says Hong Kong has now moved from \"chaos to governance\" and onto \"greater prosperity\" because of the national security law and a \"patriot-only\" parliament. But critics, including hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers who have since left, say dissent has been stifled, and the city's freedoms severely curbed.Lee, the lawmaker, is among them: \"When I first came to the UK, I had nightmares. I felt very guilty. Why could we live in other places freely, while our good friends were jailed?\"Lai's family has been calling for his release for years, citing concerns for his health because he is diabetic, but their calls have been rejected so far. The government and Lai's Hong Kong legal team have said that his medical needs are being met.Carmen Tsang, Lai's daughter-in-law who lives in Hong Kong with her family, says her children miss grandpa - and the big family dinners he hosted every two weeks. His loud voice scared her daughter when she was younger, but \"they loved going to grandpa's place… They think he's a funny guy\".She is not sure today's Hong Kong has a place for Lai. \"If there's a speck of dust in your eye, you just get rid of it, right?\"Watch: What does the Jimmy Lai verdict mean for democracy in Hong Kong?",

    "body": "5 hours agoEmily AtkinsonGetty ImagesA senior staff member at France's presidential palace will stand trial over the alleged theft of precious tableware, including Baccarat Champagne glasses and Sèvres porcelain plates. Around 100 objects that were reported missing from the presidential collection were allegedly later found in the locker, car and home of Thomas M, who is reported to be the Élysée Palace's chief butler. He will stand trial alongside two others. Investigators say they found some of the items - thought to be worth between €15,000 and €40,000 (£13,000 and £35,000) - on his Vinted account. It comes just months after the Louvre Museum in Paris suffered a brazen heist in which jewels worth €88m (£76m) were taken. French media reported that Thomas M's role as head butler and keeper of precious silver involved setting the tables at state dinners and other prestigious events.He is accused of siphoning off the items over several months and falsifying the records to cover his tracks.Also among the alleged stolen goods are solid silver cutlery and a René Lalique figurine.The inventory kept by Thomas M suggested he was planning to steal more goods, prosecutors say.The Élysée has already posted a job advertisement to find his replacement, according to French media outlet TF1 Info. Officials at Sèvres - France's state-owned porcelain factory - also identified some of their items on online auction sites, including a plate embossed with an air force stamp and ashtrays.Thomas M was arrested on Tuesday 16 December on suspicion of theft, alongside his partner Damien G - a collector and manager of an online auction company.A third man, Ghislain M, was arrested a day later, accused of receiving stolen goods. His \"passion\" for rare antiques has been put forward by his lawyer as being behind his alleged involvement.According to Le Parisien - which first reported on the case - he was working as a guard at the Louvre at the time and has been barred from returning until the trial is completed.The trial is scheduled for February.More on this story",

    "body": "5 hours agoAlex BoydandLaura GozziBBC Russia Editor Steve Rosenberg on scene of Moscow car bombingA Russian general has been killed in a car bombing in Moscow, officials have said.Russia's Investigative Committee said Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov died on Monday morning after an explosive device planted under a car detonated.He is the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year.Sarvarov, 56, was the head of the armed forces' operational training department, the committee said.It added one theory being investigated was that the bomb was planted with the involvement of Ukrainian intelligence services. Ukraine has not commented.Sarvarov died in hospital as a result of his injuries, the committee said, adding it had opened an investigation into murder and illegal trafficking of explosives.Investigators have been sent to the scene, in a car park near an apartment block in the south of Moscow.Images from the area show a badly damaged white Kia Sorento with the doors blown out, surrounded by other vehicles. According to Russian media, Sarvarov previously took part in combat operations during the Ossetian-Ingush conflict and the Chechen wars in the 1990s and early 2000s, and also led operations in Syria between 2015-2016. ReutersInvestigators could be seen working at the scene on Monday morningVladimir Putin was informed of Sarvarov's death immediately, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a number of military officials and high-profile individuals have been targeted in the Russian capital.Darya Dugina, the 29-year-old daughter of a prominent nationalist figure and Putin close ally, was killed in a suspected car bombing in 2022.Gen Yaroslav Moskalik was killed in a car bomb attack last April, while Gen Igor Kirillov died in December 2024 when a device hidden in a scooter was detonated remotely.A Ukrainian source later told the BBC that Kirillov was killed by Ukraine's security service, though this was never confirmed on the record. As a matter of policy, Ukraine never officially admits or claims responsibility for targeted attacks.",

    "body": "17 hours agoAbu Bakar YasinandNaomi Clarke,BBC NewsbeatGetty ImagesThe Fulham midfielder will represent his home country Nigeria in the competitionHe's played on some of the biggest stages in the world in the Premier League, but Alex Iwobi believes the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) is a \"special\" experience. The tournament will see 24 teams battling for the continental crown across the next couple of weeks. Fulham midfielder Iwobi will represent his home country of Nigeria in the competition, where they will be hoping to clinch the title after missing out in a 2-1 loss to Ivory Coast in 2023's final.\"With Afcon, you get to celebrate Africa through football,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat. \"You get to see different cultures, you get to see how different people dress, how people from Nigeria, the way we walk into the changing rooms.\"When some of the other countries walk into the changing rooms, we play music, so we're celebrating our music through that as well.\"Nigeria will be hoping to redeem themselves after failing to qualify for a second successive World Cup. Iwobi says it was a \"big disappointment\", but the team will be using it to fuel them in the Afcon tournament.\"We owe it to ourselves to make it right, and there's no better way from the last Afcon to improve (than) just to win this one,\" the 29-year-old says. This year's Afcon is being held in Morocco.Nigeria have won the competition three times over the years, the last being back in 2013. Their most recent loss to Ivory Coast is still prominent in Iwobi's mind as he says it \"shattered\" their dreams. However, he feels the moment was \"written\" for striker Sébastien Haller, who scored the winning goal after overcoming testicular cancer. \"It was a tough loss, but you give credit when credit due, they deserved it,\" Iwobi says.\"But it's also fuelled us and we've been working hard to get into the Afcon again and, hopefully, this is our story.\"Getty ImagesAlex Iwobi made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015The Fulham midfielder was born in Lagos, but moved to London as a child. His talent was spotted early and he was selected to represent England up to under-18 level.After many years with the Three Lions, he made his debut for Nigeria's national team in 2015 as he says he felt more \"at home\" with the team.\"England treated me with a lot of respect and they loved me,\" he says. \"But at the same time, I felt more of a connection with my roots in Nigeria.\"He has since made 91 appearances, making him the fourth most capped player for the Nigerian Super Eagles. Iwobi says he never thought he would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria growing up, but he is \"honoured and grateful\" for his achievements. Ademola Lookman, Calvin Bassey and Iwobi's school friend Ola Aina are also among the players on the Nigerian national team who were not raised in the country.They have been affectionately nicknamed the \"innit boys\", and Iwobi hopes they have helped open the door for others to represent their home country. \"You're Nigerian at the end of the day and you will get loved regardless,\" he says.Getty ImagesIwobi says he never thought we would play for Arsenal, Fulham, or Nigeria in his careerThere has been debate over whether Afcon gets the respect it deserves.Earlier this year, Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher caused a stir when he suggested Afcon was not considered a \"major tournament\", when discussing Mohamed Salah's chances of winning the coveted Ballon d'Or.Iwobi feels there is still more work to be done.\"It's obviously getting recognised a lot more,\" he says. \"There's a lot of great talents, great nations representing.\"In the Premier League there's a lot of players in each team that are going to be represented so the awareness is growing, but it definitely deserves a lot more respect, in my opinion.\"If he wins the tournament, the Fulham player says he will be on the phone to his parents and sister straight away, while his extended family will be dancing.\"I've heard from previous people that when they win it, it's like everything just stops, you become like a king, you're just royalty,\" he says. \"Just going to the final we got treated like royalty anyway, so I can't imagine winning it.\"It would just be crazy, but I want to experience that.\"Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

    "body": "6 hours agoJosh MartinBusiness reporterThe gold price has hit another record high, trading above $4,400 (£3,275) an ounce for the first time.The price of the precious metal has risen on expectations the US central bank will cut interest rates further next year, analysts said.Gold started the year worth $2,600 an ounce, but geopolitical tensions, the Trump tariffs and expectations of rate cuts have added to investor demand for safe haven assets, such as gold and other commodities.The prices of other precious metals also rose on Monday, with silver hitting a record high as well.The gold price has risen more than 68% this year, the highest increase since 1979, according to Adrian Ash, director of research at gold bullion marketplace BullionVault.2025 has seen \"slow-burning trends around interest rates, around war and trade tensions\", Mr Ash said, which have helped to push up the price of gold.\"The precious metals market says that President Trump has really triggered something – and gold has gone crazy this year.\"You've got the trade war, the attacks on the US Federal Reserve and you've got geopolitical tensions, all of those provocations come from Trump,\" he said.After passing the $4,400 an ounce mark on Monday, the spot price of gold hit a high of $4,426.66.Lower interest rate expectations typically mean lower returns for investments such as bonds, so investors look to commodities such as gold and silver to get a return, but also diversify their portfolios.The consensus among analysts currently is that the US will lower interest rates twice in 2026.Another factor adding to demand is that central banks globally are expanding their own physical holdings of gold as a way to counter economic turbulence, reduce reliance on the US dollar, and diversify their own portfolios, according to analysis from Goldman Sachs, which predicted the pattern would continue in 2026.The steady increase in the price of gold across the year could be because it is seen as a way for traders to help shield themselves from the threat of inflation and economic turmoil, Anita Wright, chartered financial planner at Ribble Wealth Management, said.\"When confidence in financial assets and policy stability starts to wobble, gold tends to respond first as the primary monetary metal,\" Ms Wright said.A weaker US dollar has also helped push gold prices higher by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.Other precious metals have also had record years. The price of silver also hit a record of $69.44 an ounce on Monday.For 2025 so far, silver is up 138% year-to-date and platinum is at a 17-year high, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by strong and supply constraints, according to analysts. Unlike gold, the other precious metals are also used widely in industrial manufacturing which helps stoke demand.Separately, oil prices rose on Monday, after the US ordered a \"blockade\" last week of sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.The price of Brent crude rose $1.31 to $61.78 a barrel, while US oil was up $1.25 at $57.77. However, both measures look set to end 2025 at prices lower than where they started the year.",

    "body": "Russia has intensified its strikes on the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa, causing widespread power cuts and threatening the region's maritime infrastructure.Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Moscow was carrying out \"systematic\" attacks on the region. Last week, he warned that the focus of the war \"may have shifted towards Odesa\".President Volodymyr Zelensky said the repeated attacks were an attempt by Moscow to block Ukraine's access to maritime logistics. Earlier in December, Russian President Vladimir Putin threatened to sever Ukraine's access to the sea as retaliation for drone attacks on tankers of Russia's \"shadow fleet\" in the Black Sea.\"Shadow fleet\" is a term that refers to hundreds of tankers used by Russia to bypass Western sanctions imposed after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.On Sunday night in the Odesa region, strikes cut off electricity for 120,000 people and sparked a fire at a major port which destroyed dozens of containers of flour and vegetable oil.It was the latest in a series of hundreds of strikes which have disrupted power supplies in the region for days on end and caused several casualties. Last week, a ballistic missile strike on the Pivdenniy port east of Odesa killed eight people and injured at least 30.Another attack earlier in the week killed a woman who was travelling in a car with her three children and temporarily cut off the Odesa region's only bridge linking Ukraine and Moldova.Zelensky indicated a new commander of the air force for the region would be selected soon following the dismissal of Dmytro Karpenko over the weekend.Odesa's port has always been key for the country's economy. The city is Ukraine's third largest after Kyiv and Kharkiv. It now occupies strategic importance as other ports in the Zaporizhzhia, Kherson and Mykolayiv regions are inaccessible to Ukraine due to Russian occupation.Despite the war, Ukraine remains one of the world's top exporters of wheat and corn. Since August 2023, Odesa has been the starting point of a crucial corridor that allows it to export grain out of the country, following the coastlines of Romania and Bulgaria before reaching Turkey.Zelensky, who has previously accused Russia of \"sowing chaos\" on the people of Odesa, said that \"everyone must see that without pressure on Russia, they have no intention of genuinely ending their aggression\".His comments came as the latest round of US-led diplomatic efforts wrapped up in Miami. The US separately met the Ukrainian and Russian delegations, with the meetings yielding optimistic statements but no clear progress to bring the end of Moscow's nearly four-year war on Ukraine any closer.US President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said he and his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov had worked on \"aligning positions\" on a 20-point draft peace plan put forward by Ukraine earlier this month. The plan is an alternative to a proposal presented by the US in November, which was seen as favourable to Moscow.Before Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev even returned to Moscow from Florida, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters that the European and Ukrainian changes to the peace proposal would not improve the chances of peace being achieved.On Monday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused EU countries of having a \"firm aspiration\" to derail potential Russia-US agreements on Ukraine and to \"in general prevent Russia-American relations getting healthier\".He also said European countries were \"possessed by a maniacal\" fear of a Russian attack. Russia was ready to confirm in a legal agreement that it had no intention of attacking either the EU or Nato, Ryabkov added, echoing previous comments from Putin. \"We've never planned to [attack Europe], but if they want to hear it from us, well, let's do it, we'll put it in writing,\" Putin said in November.",

    "body": "Officials from Thailand and Cambodia will meet next week to discuss the possibility of reviving a ceasefire, Thailand's foreign minister said, as deadly border clashes entered a third week. Both countries had signed a ceasefire earlier in July, brokered by US President Donald Trump. But fighting broke out again earlier this month - which both countries have blamed each other for. On Monday, top officials from both countries met at a summit in Malaysia, their first first face-to-face meeting since fighting resumed.Speaking afterwards, Thailand's Foreign Minister said the July ceasefire was \"rushed\", saying it was because the US \"wanted the declaration signed in time for Trump's [visit]\".\"We were sometimes in a rush because the US wanted it signed by the visit of President Trump,\" said Sihasak Phuangketkeow.\"But sometimes we really just [need to] sit down, trash things [out]...  make sure that the ceasefire reflects... the situation on the ground. And the ceasefire is one that really holds.\"Mr Phuangketkeow said a meeting between military officials from both Thailand and Cambodia would take place on 24 December, and that this would need to happen before any ceasefire agreement could be reached. Cambodia has yet to comment on the matter. At least 41 people have been killed and almost one million displaced since the renewed fighting this month. Both countries have blamed each other for the fresh hostilities. The most recent fighting has seen the exchange of artillery fire along the 800km (500-mile) border. Thailand has also launched air strikes targetting Cambodian positions.At the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) meeting on Monday, Malaysia's foreign minister had asked both sides and other Asean members to give the matter \"our most urgent attention\".\"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve,\" Mohamad Hasan told his counterparts, according to news agency AFP.The conflict has been the worst between Asean member states since the association was founded in 1967. The failure to contain it represents a serious blow to the bloc's credibility.The US and China have also been attempting to mediate a new ceasefire.China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, visited Phnom Penh last week. A statement from Beijing said he reaffirmed that China would continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at the daily press briefing that China had been mediating the confict in its own way since fighting restarted this month. He added that Beijing would release information on the mediation conducted by Deng \"in due course\".The argument between Thailand and Cambodia dates back more than a century, and there have been sporadic clashes, with soldiers and civilians killed on both sides over the years. But in May, tensions ramped up after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a clash. And on  24 July, the situation dramatically escalated after a Cambodian rocket barrage into Thailand, which was followed by Thai air strikes. That set off five days of intense fighting, which left dozens of soldiers and civilians dead.The two countries later agreed to an \"immediate and unconditional ceasefire\" brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and US President Donald Trump - who at the time threatened to stop tariff negotiations until the hostilities stopped.The US president later oversaw the signing of what he dubbed \"the Kuala Lumpar peace accord\" in October. Thailand refused to call it that - instead referring to it as \"Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur\".But that ceasefire fell apart in December, with both sides blaming each other for re-igniting the fighting, which has seen air strikes and exchanges of artillery fire.Additional reporting by Jonathan Head and Thanyarat Doksone",

    "body": "In rebel-held Myanmar, civilians face devastating air strikes and a sham election22 hours agoYogita LimayeSouth Asia and Afghanistan correspondent in MyanmarAamir Peerzada/BBCSome Burmese refugees who fled Chin state are now taking shelter across the border in IndiaLate one night last month Iang Za Kim heard explosions in a neighbouring village, then fighter jets flying overhead. She ran out of her home to see smoke rising from a distance.\"We were terrified. We thought the junta's planes would bomb us too. So we grabbed what we could – some food and clothes and ran into the jungles surrounding our village.\"Iang's face quivers as she recounts the story of what happened on 26 November in K-Haimual, her village in Myanmar's western Chin State, and then she breaks down.She's among thousands of civilians who've fled their homes in recent weeks after the Burmese military launched a fierce campaign of air strikes, and a ground offensive in rebel-held areas across the country, to recapture territory ahead of elections starting on 28 December.Four other women sitting around her on straw mats also start crying. The trauma of what they've gone through to make it to safety is clearly visible.While the air strikes were the immediate cause for Iang to flee, she also doesn't want to be forced to participate in the election.\"If we are caught and refuse to vote, they will put us in jail and torture us. We've run away so that we don't have to vote,\" she says.Aamir Peerzada/BBCIang Za Kim had to flee her home after the junta launched air strikes nearbySome from Chin state have described the junta's latest offensive as the fiercest it has launched in more than three years.Many of the displaced have sought refuge in other parts of the state. Iang is among a group that crossed the border into India's Mizoram state. Currently sheltered in a rundown badminton court in Vaphai village, the group's few belongings they were able to carry are packed in plastic sacks.Indian villagers have given them food and basic supplies.Ral Uk Thang has had to flee his home at the age of 80, living in makeshift shelters in jungles for days, before finally making it to safety.\"We're afraid of our own government. They are extremely cruel. Their military has come into our and other villages in the past, they've arrested people, tortured them, and burned down homes,\" he says.It isn't easy to speak to Burmese civilians freely. Myanmar's military government does not allow free access in the country for foreign journalists. It took over the country in a coup in February 2021, shortly after the last election, and has since been widely condemned for running a repressive regime that has indiscriminately targeted civilians as it looks to crush the armed uprising against it across Myanmar.During its latest offensive, the junta last week targeted a hospital in Rakhine State, just south of Chin State. Rebel groups in Rakhine say at least 30 people were killed and more than 70 injured.The Chin Human Rights Organisation says that since mid-September at least three schools and six churches in Chin State have been targeted by junta airstrikes, killing 12 people including six children.The BBC has independently verified the bombing of a school in Vanha village on 13 October. Two students –Johan Phun Lian Cung, who was seven, and Zing Cer Mawi, 12 - were killed as they were attending lessons. The bombs ripped through their classrooms injuring more than a dozen other students.Myanmar's military government did not respond to the BBC's questions about the allegations.This is the second time Bawi Nei Lian and his young family – a wife and two young children - have been displaced. Back in 2021, soon after the coup, their home in Falam town was burnt down in an air strike. They rebuilt their lives in K-Haimual village. Now they're homeless again.\"I can't find the words to explain how painful and hard it is and what a difficult decision it was to make to leave. But we had to do it to stay alive,\" he says.\"I want the world to know that what the military is claiming – that this election is free and fair – this is absolutely false. When the main political party is not being allowed to contest the election, how can there be genuine democracy?\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCBawi Nei Lian (left) says the scheduled elections are a shamThe National League for Democracy party, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won landslides in the two elections prior to the coup, will not be contesting as most of its senior leaders including  Suu Kyi are in jail.\"We don't want the election. Because the military does not know how to govern our country. They only work for the benefit of their high-ranking leaders. When Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's party was in power, we experienced a bit of democracy. But now all we do is cry and shed tears,\" says Ral Uk Thang.Iang Za Kim believes the election will be rigged. \"If we voted for a party not allied with the military, I believe they will steal our votes and claim we voted for them.\"The election will take place in phases, with a result expected around the end of January. Rebel groups have called it a sham.At the base of the Chin National Front in Myanmar, the most prominent rebel group operating in the state, the group's Vice Chairman Sui Khar says: \"This election is only being held to prolong military dictatorship. It's not about the people's choice. And in Chin State, they hardly control much area, so how can they hold an election?\"He points out the areas where the most intense fighting is ongoing on a map and tells us nearly 50 rebel fighters have been injured in just the past month. There have been deaths too, but so far the groups have not released a number.\"There are columns of hundreds of soldiers trying to advance into the northern part of Chin state from four directions,\" Sui Khar says. \"The soldiers are being supported by air strikes, artillery fire and by drone units.\"Aamir Peerzada/BBCAbel lost his right leg and his hands were severely wounded fighting against the juntaAccess to the base is extremely rare. Set amid thickly forested mountains, it is the heart of the resistance against the junta in Chin state.Sui Khar takes us to the hospital at the base. We see a group of injured fighters who were brought in overnight and had to undergo hours of surgery. Some of them have had to undergo amputations.Many of them were just schoolboys when the coup occurred in 2021. Just about adults now, they've let go of their dreams to fight on the frontline against the junta.Abel, 18, is in too much pain to speak. He was with a group of fighters trying to take back territory the junta captured a week ago. They won the battle, but Abel lost his right leg and has serious injuries to his hands as well.In a bed next to him is Si Si Maung, 19, who's also had a leg amputated.\"As the enemy was retreating we ran forward and I stepped on a landmine. We were injured in the explosion. Then we were attacked from the air. The airstrikes make things very difficult for us,\" he says. \"I've lost a leg, but even if I've to give up my life I'm happy to make the sacrifice so that future generations have a better life.\"The impact of the ferocity of the latest offensive is visible in room after room at the hospital.Yet, it's the support and grit of tens of thousands of youngsters like Si Si Maung, who picked up arms to fight against the junta, that have helped the rebels make rapid advances against a much more powerful rival in the past four-and-a-half years.Some like 80-year-old Ral Uk Thang hope that after the election, the junta will retreat, and he will be able to go back home.\"But I don't think I will live to see democracy restored in Myanmar,\" he says. \"I hope my children and grandchildren can witness it some day.\"Additional reporting by Aamir Peerzada, Sanjay Ganguly and Aakriti Thapar",

    "body": "11 hours agoShaimaa Khalil,JerusalemandMallory MoenchIsrael's security cabinet has approved the recognition of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank as the government continues its settlement expansion push.Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler who proposed the move alongside Defence Minister Israel Katz, said the decision was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said Israel's \"relentless\" settlement expansion fuels tensions, restricts Palestinian access to land, and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Saudi Arabia and the UK also condemned the move. The announcement risked \"undermining the [US] 20 Point Plan [for ending the Gaza war] and prospects for the long-term peace and security that only a two-state solution can deliver\", said UK foreign office minister Hamish Falconer.Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began following Hamas's deadly attack on Israel in October 2023, further heightening fears that settlement expansion could entrench Israel's occupation and undermine a two-state solution.The two-state solution refers to the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, broadly along the lines that existed prior to the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.Since taking office in 2022, the current Israeli government has significantly increased the approval of new settlements and begun the legalisation process for unauthorised outposts, recognising them as \"neighbourhoods\" of existing settlements.The most recent decision brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to Smotrich.The approvals come just days after the United Nations said settlement expansion had reached its highest level since 2017. The latest approvals include the re-establishment of two settlements — Ganim and Kadim — which were dismantled nearly 20 years ago.In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades.The Israeli government also approved plans in August to build more than 3,000 homes in the so-called E1 project between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, which had been frozen for decades amid fierce opposition internationally.Smotrich at the time said the plan would \"bury the idea of a Palestinian state\".About 700,000 settlers live in approximately 160 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now. It is land Palestinians seek for a future independent state.Settlement expansion has angered Arab nations who have consistently said it undermines prospects for a two-state solution. It has also raised concerns about the possible annexing of the occupied West Bank.US President Donald Trump had warned Israel about such a move, telling TIME magazine that Israel would lose all its support from the US if it happened.In September, the UK - along with other countries including Australia and Canada - recognised a Palestinian state, a significant although symbolic change in government policy.Israel opposed the move, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying a Palestinian state \"will not happen\".",

    "body": "Watch: Images, cassettes and high-profile figures - What's in the latest Epstein files?A pair of US lawmakers have threatened legal action against US Attorney General Pam Bondi, after her deadline to release all government files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was met only in part. The release of the Department of Justice (DoJ) documents was highly anticipated but in the end, only a portion of the available material was made public.A leading campaigner on the issue, Republican congressman Thomas Massie, said he could try to bring contempt proceedings against the attorney general as a result.The DoJ insists it is complying with its legal obligations, and Bondi herself has said she is part of \"the most transparent administration in American history\".In addition to the move by Massie in the House, the top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, has announced an effort of his own to put pressure on the DoJ.On Monday, Senate Minority Leader Schumer said he would introduce a resolution in the Senate to take legal actions of its own against the Trump administration for failing to release the files in full and \"to hold the Department of Justice accountable\". The issue would be considered when the upper chamber reconvenes in January. Schumer appealed for support from Republican senators, pointing out that the law to release of the full trove was a bipartisan effort. The phrase \"Epstein files\" refer to the trove of information that was amassed by the US justice department during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.A law that compelled the release of the full trove was signed by US President Donald Trump in November, after pressure from his supporters and members of his own Republican Party. Friday was the deadline for the release of the material. Although some material was released, there were many redactions and other information was withheld - which angered Massie and his allies, as well as survivors of Epstein's abuse. Trump himself is yet to comment.The DoJ has said that more material will follow in the coming weeks. But speaking to CBS programme Face the Nation on Sunday, Massie suggested that the justice department was \"flouting the spirit and the letter of the law\".He went on to say: \"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn't require going through the courts.\"Inherent contempt is a little-used legal recourse that can be used by either the Senate or House - the upper and lower chambers of Congress respectively - which has not been invoked for nearly a century, according to the American Bar Association.Massie added that \"Ro Khanna and I are talking about and drafting that right now\", referring to a Democratic congressman who has also been prominent in the campaign for the release of the full Epstein files.Speaking to the same programme, Khanna gave further detail on how the contempt proceedings could work. \"We're building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she's not releasing these documents,\" he said.Unlike an impeachment effort - another option that would be theoretically available to critics of Bondi - the contempt move would only require support from the House of Representatives, Massie pointed out in Sunday's interview. During an interview of his own on Sunday, with a different broadcaster, Bondi's deputy Todd Blanche was defiant.Asked by the Meet the Press programme on NBC News whether he took threats from Congress members seriously, the deputy attorney general said: \"Not even a little bit. Bring it on. We are doing everything we're supposed to be doing to comply with the statute.\"Blanche pointed to the magnitude of the task. \"You're talking about a million or so pages of documents,\" he said. \"Virtually all of them contain victim information.\" He continued: \"And if by complying with the statute we don't produce everything on Friday, we produce things next week and the week after, that's still compliance with the statute.\"Speaking to the same programme, another member of Khanna's party, Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said contempt or impeachment efforts would be \"premature\".\"We have tools in appropriations bills and other tools to force compliance if somebody is dragging their feet and I'd rather focus on those tools,\" Kaine said.Blanche said elsewhere on Sunday that certain Epstein-related files that were originally released on Friday were later removed by the DoJ from its website because of concerns raised by victims.One of those files - an image featuring Trump - was later reinstated after review, said Blanche.",

    "body": "4 hours agoJames Landale,Diplomatic correspondentandRachel HaganWatch: Trump's appointment of Greenland envoy sparks fresh row with DenmarkDonald Trump has sparked a fresh row with Denmark after appointing a special envoy to Greenland, the vast Arctic island he has said he would like to annex.Trump announced on Sunday that Jeff Landry, the Republican governor of Louisiana, would become the US's special envoy to Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Gov Landry said in a post on X it was an honour to serve in a \"volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US\".The move has angered Copenhagen, which said it would will call the US ambassador for \"an explanation\". Greenland's prime minister said the island must \"decide our own future\" and its \"territorial integrity must be respected\".Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has revived his long-standing interest in Greenland, citing its strategic location and mineral wealth. He has refused to rule out using force to secure control of the island, a stance that has shocked Denmark, a Nato ally that has traditionally enjoyed close relations with Washington.Greenland, home to about 57,000 people, has had extensive self-government since 1979, though defence and foreign policy remain in Danish hands. While most Greenlanders favour eventual independence from Denmark, opinion polls show overwhelming opposition to becoming part of the US.Denmark's Foreign Minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, described the appointment of Landry as \"deeply upsetting\" and warned Washington to respect Danish sovereignty.He told Danish broadcaster TV2: \"As long as we have a kingdom consisting of Denmark, the Faroe Islands and Greenland, we cannot accept actions that undermine our territorial integrity.\"Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the territory was willing to cooperate with the US and other countries, but only on the basis of mutual respect.He said: \"The appointment of a special envoy does not change anything for us. We decide our own future. Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected.\"EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X that the EU stands in \"full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland\". Writing on social media, the US president said Landry understood how \"essential Greenland is to our national security\" and would advance US interests.Getty ImagesUS President Donald Trump and Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry in a file photo in MarchThe significance of this appointment is both the US presumption that Greenland is separate to Denmark and the new appointee's assertion that he will help the island become part of the US. Envoys are informal appointments and unlike official diplomats, do not have to be approved by the host country.What this appointment shows is that Trump's ambition to control Greenland remains undimmed. As with his military and rhetorical aggression towards Venezuela, it indicates Trump is determined to gain greater control over what his recent National Security Strategy called \"the Western hemisphere\", a sphere of influence that he hopes will cover the whole of the Americas.Trump tried to buy Greenland during his first presidential term. Both Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"ReutersLandry has previously voiced his opinion on Greenland, writing on his personal X account in January: \"President Donald J. Trump is absolutely right! We need to ensure that Greenland joins the United States. GREAT for them, GREAT for us! Let's get it done!\"Landry is a military veteran and former police officer who was a US Congressman and Louisiana's attorney general before being elected governor in 2023.  He said his new role would not affect his duties as governor. The dispute over his appointment comes as strategic competition in the Arctic grows, with melting ice opening new shipping routes and increasing access to valuable mineral resources. Greenland is located in the Arctic between North America and Europe, which also makes it central to US and Nato security planning. The US has maintained a base in Greenland since World War Two, after invading to establish military and radio stations across the territory after the Nazis occupied Denmark during the conflict.Vice-President JD Vance visited the base in March as he asked Greenland's people to \"cut a deal with the US\".The US reopened a consulate in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, in 2020 - during Trump's first term - after closing it in 1953. A number of European countries, as well as Canada, have honorary general consulates in Greenland.",

    "body": "12 hours agoClaire Keenan,Elettra NeysmithandAbayomi Adisa,BBC Africa, LagosNigerian authorities say they have secured the release of the remaining 130 schoolchildren and teachers kidnapped from a Catholic boarding school in the country's central Niger state.Nigeria's federal government described the latest release as a \"moment of triumph and relief\", after one of the country's worst mass kidnappings.More than 250 children and staff were abducted from St Mary's Catholic school in Papiri on 21 November. Earlier this month about 100 of the children were released.The authorities confirmed \"the rescue of the remaining 130 children and staff\" in a statement, saying \"not a single pupil is left in captivity\".Niger state police chief Adamu Abdullahi Elleman told the BBC that they were being \"examined by security forces and will be taken to their school tomorrow [Monday] to reunite with their families\".Bishop Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, who is in charge of the school as the Catholic cleric who heads the region, also confirmed the development.He said the local governor had informed him of the release of the remaining schoolchildren and teachers, and \"asked me to come and receive them\".Parents are in high spirits over the news of the release, Abdullahi Rofia, a local emergency worker in Papiri where the school is located, told the BBC. The parents are expected to gather at the school later in the day.On Sunday, presidential spokesperson Bayo Onanuga said the total of freed students was now 230.Since the kidnapping, the exact number of people taken and how many have remained in captivity has been unclear.On 8 December, authorities secured the release of 99 children and one teacher, reportedly leaving at least 165 others with the kidnappers.However, the Niger state police chief told the BBC that the 130 who have now been released account for all the remaining abductees, faulting the initial figures released by the school management.It has not been formally made public how the government secured the latest release - or whether any ransom was paid.The announcement by Onanuga included pictures of children smiling and waving. The students are expected to arrive in the Niger state capital, Minna, on Monday.When the earlier release happened the governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, told local media that the federal government had played a key role, adding that the behind-the-scenes efforts could not be disclosed for security reasons.The Christian Association of Nigeria reported that 50 students managed to escape at the time of the kidnapping.November's abduction was the latest incident in a number of targeted attacks on schools and places of worship in north and central Nigeria.The attack on St Mary's was preceded by mass kidnappings just days earlier.On 18 November, two people were killed and 38 abducted in an attack on the Christ Apostolic Church in Kwara state, and a day before that, two were killed and 25 Muslim students abducted from Government Girls' Secondary School in Kebbi state.All those taken in the Kwara and Kebbi attacks have since been freed.It is not clear who is behind these kidnappings - most analysts believe they are carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments.On 9 December Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu said his government would continue to work with Niger and other states \"to secure our schools and make the learning environment safer and more conducive for our younger ones\".",

    "body": "Detty December, a popular term for Ghana and Nigeria's end-of-year party season, can have \"negative connotations\", Ghana's official for diaspora affairs has said, adding that he does not want the label linked with his country.\"On a personal level I don't want the word 'detty' to be associated with anything Ghana... that's something I'm not very comfortable with,\" Kofi Okyere-Darko said.\"Detty\", West African Pidgin for \"dirty\", is used to express unrestricted fun when it comes to seeing the year out.The celebrations are thought to be a huge boost to Ghana's economy. Last December more than 125,000 international visitors, many of whom were diasporans, flocked to Ghana.It was a notable increase from the number of people arriving during any other month - and the same can be said for the three years before that.Government branding avoids the term Detty December instead choosing to push a tourism initiative named December in Ghana, Mr Okyere-Darko, who oversees his country's relationship with its sizeable diaspora, told the BBC at the Ghana Diaspora Summit in capital city, Accra.\"The young people somehow prefer 'Detty December', but officially, that's not the name,\" he said.\"I don't think December is what attracts people to Ghana. People started coming to Ghana a long time ago. I remember December in Ghana at the turn of the millennium, with initiatives like Akwaaba UK.Mr Okyere-Darko responded positively to suggestions that the season could be rebranded in a way that still appeals to younger audiences, saying that December in Ghana could be shortened to the initials \"D.I.G.. Let's dig it!\"The phrase Detty December gained popularity roughly eight years ago, after Nigerian musician Mr Eazi launched his Detty Rave festival in Accra.This December, festivals, parties and concerts have Accra teeming with diasporans and other tourists. They are mostly from the US and Europe, with ages ranging from early 20s and mid-40s, and are out socialising seven days a week.US hip-hop legend Busta Rhymes performed in Accra as part of the Rhythm and Brunch concert on Saturday, while popular UK rapper Giggs is playing at the Afro Paradise festival on 31 December.Local stars such as Samini - considered to be the \"godfather\" of Ghanaian dancehall - and Reggie Rockstone will also play at major events later this month.Ghana in recent years has been promoting itself as a destination for people from the continent and the African diaspora to visit. In 2019, the government launched the Year of Return - an initiative encouraging those with African roots to invest in the country.The influx of foreign visitors in December is seen as a positive by many, but some locals complain of price gouging, overcrowding and intense traffic during this period.This year has proven that December in Ghana no longer revolves around non-stop partying. Alongside the expected concerts and festivals, there is a growing calendar of investment seminars, networking sessions and cultural showcases, offering the diaspora routes into property, minerals, fashion and textiles.",

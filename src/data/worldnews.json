    "body": "Trump's grand plan to reshape the world order leaves Europe with a difficult choice to make16 hours agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCFor 80 years, what bound the United States to Europe was a shared commitment to defence and a common set of values: a commitment to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.That era was inaugurated in March 1947 in an 18-minute speech by President Harry Truman, in which he pledged US support to defend Europe against further expansion by the Soviet Union.America led the creation of Nato, the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations. And it bound itself into what became known as the \"rules-based international order\", in which nation states committed to a series of mutual obligations and shared burdens, designed to defend the democratic world against hostile authoritarian powers.Now, the new US National Security Strategy (NSS), published in December, signals that, for the White House, that shared endeavour has ended; that much of what the world has taken for granted about America's role is over.The review refers to the \"so-called 'rules-based international order'\", putting the latter phrase in inverted commas: a kind of delegitimisation by punctuation mark.AFP via Getty ImagesJD Vance said that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within Vice-President JD Vance warned America's European allies that this was coming in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025.He told them bluntly that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within - from those censoring free speech, suppressing political opposition and therefore undermining European democracy. And he was damning about the \"leftist liberal network\".The French newspaper Le Monde said the speech was a declaration of \"ideological war\" against Europe.Last month's NSS codifies Vance's remarks, and, in black and white, elevates them to the status of doctrine.\"Certainly America is no longer the country that promoted the global values that have been in place since the end of the Second World War,\" says Karin von Hippel, who previously held senior positions in the US State Department and is a former Director of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank.\"It is shifting to a very different place.\"So, if the world is indeed moving away from that order, what is it moving towards? And what does it mean for the rest of the world and in particular for Europe?'We have a different world today'\"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment, and have not served our or any other particular purpose,\" says Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in Washington.In the eyes of Coates - who was previously the Deputy National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump - change to the international order is inevitable in a changing world.\"The other issue we face here is that when that so-called rules-based international order was established after the Second World War, 80 short years ago, China wasn't a major concern.\"We just have a different world today.\"Getty ImagesPresident Truman watches on as a US representative signs the United Nations Charter in 1945This rules-based international order, built in the years after World War Two, was created by a generation that had come of age during an era of Great Power geopolitics, and had seen that system descend, twice, into catastrophic global conflict.That international order, flawed and incomplete though it undoubtedly was, was the legacy of that experience.But the NSS directly argues that American strategy went astray in the years since - and it blames what it calls \"American foreign policy elites\".\"They lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty,\" it says.It suggests that in future, the US will seek to roll back the influence of supranational bodies. Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe National Security Strategy says: 'We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations'\"The world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state… We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations…\"Elsewhere in the document, reflecting on the \"balance of power\", it states: \"The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.\"The Kremlin responded to the review with praise, saying much of it aligned with Moscow's own thinking.\"I think Trump, Xi, Putin and their more authoritarian acolytes are seeking to return us to an era of Great Power politics,\" says Field Marshal Lord Richards, who, as General Sir David Richards, was the head of the UK's armed forces from 2010 till 2013.Yet Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London, believes the new Security Strategy is not as radical a break with the past as it may appear.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin said much of the review aligned with Moscow's own thinking\"We need to be careful about the rules-based international order, which is a term that came into general use in the last decade or so,\" he argues.\"Look back and you find plenty of violations of the rules, Vietnam for example. So there's a sort of rosy glow about the past at times and everyone should be careful about nostalgia for what was a complex past.\"Muscular reassertion of the Monroe doctrineWashington's military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas that led to the capture of the country's leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is an early example of this more muscular assertion of sovereign unilateralism.Some international law experts have questioned the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argued the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. The US maintains its actions were legally justified.\"Under American law it certainly was [legal]\" Robert Wilkie, who served as an Undersecretary of Defense in the first Trump administration, has previously told the BBC.\"Maduro - most of our European partners have not recognised his regime so he is an illegitimate figure. Because of that he is stripped of the normal protections that heads of state would have [...]particularly when were are looking at constitutional provisions that exist in the United States, that would supersede anything the UN says.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia FloresThe NSS claims, for the United States, the right to be the pre-eminent power in the Western Hemisphere, and to bend its Latin American and Caribbean neighbours into alignment with Washington's interests.This is a muscular reassertion of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the Western hemisphere.Colombia, Panama and Cuba are all also in the President's sights.\"This starts primarily with the Panama Canal,\" says Victoria Coates. \"The degree to which control of the canal is necessary to the United States cannot be overstated.\"China is now Latin America's biggest trading partner and a major infrastructure investor there. The NSS aims to roll back Chinese influence in Washington's backyard.When the canal was handed over to Panama in 1999, says Coates, \"we were in the assumption that China was a reasonable actor… That turned out not to be true…\"So making sure that the United States retains a prime position over the canal is critical, and I think Panama is for the first time getting that message from the United States.\"But Sir Lawrence Freedman is among those who argue that the US's ability to control its neighbours is not unlimited.\"The Strategy Review might say this is our hemisphere and we can do what we want, but there are still constraints. They may have extricated Maduro and his wife, but they're still dealing with the old regime.\"They're not running the country, despite what Trump says.\"Under the new strategy, the United States will no longer pressure authoritarian regimes to improve their human rights records.In a phrase taken from the US Declaration of Independence of 1776, the review declares, \"All nations are entitled by 'the laws of nature and nature's God' to a 'separate and equal station' with respect to one another.\"Getty ImagesXi Jinping and Nicolas Maduro pictured in 2015 in Beijing, ChinaIn the Middle East, for example, the US says it will abandon the \"misguided experiment with hectoring these nations - especially the Gulf monarchies - into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government\".\"The key to successful relations with the Middle East,\" it adds, \"is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as they are while working together on areas of common interest.\"But it seems the same level of respect for traditions and historic forms of government is not extended to the democratic and allied nations of Europe.Whilst it refers to an American sentimental attachment to the European continent - and to Britain and Ireland - what's striking about this paper is that it seeks to redefine what is worth defending in the Western world.This review is civilisational in its reach, and argues for a civilisation that is no longer built on the shared values of the Truman Doctrine, but instead on the primacy of the sovereign nation-state.Where does this leave Europe?The review is damning about Europe's \"current trajectory\" and raises questions about whether some European nations can be regarded as dependable allies in the future.It talks about \"economic decline\" but adds that this is \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\".Elsewhere in the document, it states: \"It is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,\" which raises doubts about their viability as long-term security partners, the strategy suggests.\"It's a very nativist document,\" argues Karin von Hippel. \"It's very ideological. The underlying message is that the Christian white male is no longer running many of the countries [in the West] and we're seeing a threat to the dominance that the Christian white male has had in the United States and Europe.\"They're very careful not to say any of that explicitly but I think that's what's implied.\"Getty ImagesThe new US National Security Strategy, which was published in December, is damning about Europe's 'current trajectory'But Victoria Coates argues that, in her view, the \"larger struggle we find ourselves in\" is indeed civilisational.\"Sovereignty is also a critical issue,\" she says. \"Looking at the European Union project, especially after Brexit, I think a lot of countries are wondering if subverting the national interest to Brussels is a winning strategy.\"I do think that is one of the institutions that the NSS does call into question.\"This chimes with the interests of the American tech giants that oppose EU efforts to regulate their activities on the European continent.Last month Elon Musk posted on X that the European Union should be abolished and sovereignty returned to the individual nation states.'Cultivating resistance to Europe's trajectory'The review is clear about how Europe can regain its \"self-confidence\".It says: \"The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism. Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete.\"And one of its policies for doing this is by \"cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".What is meant precisely by \"cultivating resistance\" raises many questions.In Europe, some have already concluded that the USA may no longer be a reliable ally, at a time when Russia poses a growing threat. After Vice-President Vance's speech in Munich, Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" from America with a reshaped Nato.But this takes time.\"It's not achievable in the short term,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Europeans have become very dependent upon the United States, and this was a matter of choice: it was cheaper and simpler.\"Though in practice it would be desirable to be able to act without the Americans… in practice it's going to take years to disentangle ourselves. And it'll be extremely expensive.\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFriedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"'A popular revolt against the establishment'But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.\"European nations are going to have to spend much more on their own defence. This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money. Indeed this year the armed forces are being required to save money rather than spend more.\"The US has been pushing Europe to increase defence spending for years, notes Sir Lawrence.\"The message that Europe needs to do more for its own defence has been around a long time. It was pushed by both Obama and Biden.\"Last year Trump secured from the European allies a commitment to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP - and in doing so may have done Europe a security favour, by pushing it, in the long term, towards greater operational independence from Washington.\"Spending has gone up quite significantly,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Germans have been making quite impressive strides. So there is movement, not as fast as many would wish, but it's happening.\"The review is clear about how America thinks it can \"help\" Europe. \"We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness,\" it says.Getty ImagesVictoria Coates says: \"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment...\"Ultimately, what the report reveals is not so much an ideological divide that separates the US and Europe, but one that slices through both continents.Both sides of the Atlantic have certain concerns in common, argues Victor Mallet, a Paris-based journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Far Right France: Le Pen, Bardella and the Future of Europe.\"Concerns about immigration, concerns about the economy… and there's an extraordinary cultural gulf between supporters of people like Donald Trump, the National Rally in France, the AfD in Germany, and the intellectual, metropolitan, educated liberal elite.\"It's definitely a popular revolt against the establishment.\"He believes that one of the problems is inequality. \"America has, on average, the richest group of consumers the world has ever seen and yet many ordinary Americans find it hard to make ends meet and the same applies in Western Europe.\"More from InDepthIn the NSS, the US commits to scrapping certain practices, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that are derided by many in Trump's base.In this document, the culture wars that shape America's bitter public discourse now to a degree also shape its in foreign policy, and - by extension, affect the security of the Western world.Russia is not mentioned as a hostile power, despite its invasion of Ukraine, a Western ally. For in the culture wars, some in Trump's Maga base see in Vladimir Putin not a foe but a natural ally in the defence of white, Christian nationalist civilisation: a man who proudly defends his country, its traditions and identity - the very attributes, after all, that they value and admire in Donald Trump.Update: This article was updated to remove an incorrect reference to President George HW Bush having handed over the Panama Canal.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "16 hours agoJiyar GolBBC News PersianTehran has witnessed its largest anti-government demonstrations in decades, as protests swept through dozens of districts across the capital and its wider metropolitan area of nearly 16 million people. For several hours there on Thursday night, security forces appeared unusually restrained. In areas where crowds were especially large, police and security units largely avoided direct confrontation, raising questions about whether the authorities were deliberately holding back.That restraint, however, appears selective and strategic rather than absolute. While Tehran has seen a comparatively cautious approach, reports from smaller cities and provinces around the country tell a far more violent story.According to multiple Iranian human rights organisations, including the Germany-based Kurdish Iranian human rights group Hengaw and US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (Hrana), more than 40 people have been killed since the protests began nearly two weeks ago. BBC Persian's verification team has confirmed the identities of at least 21 victims through interviews with relatives, many of whom were killed in Lorestan and Kurdish-majority regions of Illam and Kermanshah provinces. Video evidence obtained by the BBC shows security forces firing directly at protesters. At least four security forces have also been killed.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has issued a firm warning, declaring that the Islamic Republic \"will not back down in the face of vandals\". In a speech on Friday addressing the unrest, he framed the protests as foreign-inspired sabotage. Referring to property damage in Tehran, he said demonstrators had destroyed their own buildings \"just to please the president of the United States\".Following the seizure by the US of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, many within Iran's leadership are increasingly concerned that the United States may be serious about its threats, particularly after a 12-day war with Israel last June, during which the US bombed Iran's nuclear sites, and the weakening of Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. It is possible these developments could embolden Washington to strike Iran without fear of significant retaliation.President Donald Trump has loomed large over the regime's calculations. Since almost the start of the protests, Trump has issued repeated warnings to Tehran, stating that the US would respond forcefully if peaceful protesters were killed.In a recent US radio interview, Trump said Iran would \"get hit very hard\" if it repeated the mass killings seen during previous uprisings. He downplayed responsibility for deaths so far by attributing some to \"stampedes\", but stressed that Iranian authorities had been \"told very strongly\" where the red lines lay.It is not clear whether these warnings may be behind the regime's response. In Tehran, where symbolically the costs are greatest, security forces appear to be exercising restraint to avoid images of mass bloodshed. Gunshots were reportedly heard late Thursday night in Tehran, but due to the near blackout of the internet it is difficult to verify exactly what is happening in the city.Outside the capital, however, repression has been swift and lethal.During the mass protests in Iran in 2022 following the death of the Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini in police custody in Tehran, more than 500 people were killed, human rights groups say. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), along with its affiliated militias and anti-riot police, played a pivotal role in violently suppressing those protests.Historically, the Islamic Republic has relied on a layered security apparatus to suppress mass protests. Alongside riot police, the regime deploys the Basij militia - a volunteer paramilitary force under IRGC control - often operating in plain clothes. In more intense situations, command shifts from police to IRGC commanders, signalling that unrest is being treated as a national security threat rather than a civil disturbance. This escalation typically precedes harsher crackdowns, including mass arrests and lethal force.Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian has called for tolerance of what he described as \"legitimate protests,\" but his authority is limited. Ultimate control over security policy rests with the supreme leader, not the presidency. The current approach suggests the regime is buying time, attempting to exhaust protesters, limit casualties in visible areas, and avoid crossing thresholds that could provoke direct foreign retaliation.",

    "body": "A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said.Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised.Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site.\"All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons,\" Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday.\"This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse,\" he said, ABS-CBN reported.Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris.One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning.\"I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there,\" Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN.The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "13 hours agoLucy HookerandRachel Clun,business reportersThe EU has reached a free trade agreement with South American countries, 25 years after talks began and despite opposition from farmers in several European countries.The deal with the Mercosur trading bloc - which includes Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay - will require the approval of the European parliament within the next few monthsBrazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hailed it as a \"historic day for multilateralism\" after the four South American countries put the final touches to the deal in Brussels.It comes against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries around the world and his recent military intervention in Venezuela.The EU heralded what will be its largest free trade accord to date as a \"win-win\", although critics have argued that cheap imports may undercut European farmers in products including beef, poultry and sugar. \"In an international scenario of growing protectionism and unilateralism, the agreement is a signal in favour of international trade as a driver of economic growth, with benefits for both blocs,\" President Lula posted on X.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the deal will \"bring meaningful benefits to consumers and businesses, on both sides\".Farmers in several countries in Europe held last-ditch protests against the deal, with marches and demonstrations using tractors in France and Belgium.\"There is a lot of pain,\" Judy Peeters, a representative for a Belgian young farmers' group, told AFP at a protest on a motorway south of Brussels. \"There is a lot of anger.\"Von der Leyen said the Commission had listened to the concerns of farmers, and had acted on them including through introducing \"robust safeguards\" to protect their livelihoods in the agreement.As well as boosting trade and political ties, the European Commission said the deal would help fight climate change, through commitments to halt deforestation and ensure a \"reliable\" flow of raw materials, critical for the global green transition.The Commission expects the deal to save local companies €4bn ($4.7bn, £3.5bn) a year in export duties.South American countries boast deposits of gold, copper and some of the critical minerals required for renewable and battery technology.Cecilia Malmström, a former European commissioner for trade who led EU trade negotiations for five years, told World Business Express on BBC World Service that parts of the trade agreement could be suspended if Mercosur countries failed to stick to their commitments around environmental protection.\"[This agreement] is also a very strong geopolitical signal today to other powers who do not appreciate rule-based trade in the same way as we do,\" she said.On Friday afternoon a broad majority of EU member states confirmed their support for the free trade agreement, but it will still require approval from the European Parliament before it can take effect.Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief Euro-zone economist for Capital Economics, said voting was expected to be close in the parliament.However, he said the larger issue was how much of an impact the deal would have, and pointed to the Commission's own estimate that it would raise EU economic output by just 0.05%.\"The bigger point though is that even if the agreement is eventually implemented, it will be macroeconomically insignificant,\" he said.\"And because it will be phased in over 15 years, these benefits won't arrive until 2040 at the earliest.\"",

Trump, meanwhile, said Iran was \"in big trouble\".The protests, in their 13th day, erupted over the economy and have grown into the largest in years - leading to calls for an end to the Islamic Republic and some urging the restoration of the monarchy. At least 48 protesters and 14 security personnel have been killed, according to human rights groups. An internet blackout is in place.\"We will be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday, adding that his administration was watching the situation in Iran carefully and that any US involvement does not mean \"boots on the ground\".\"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,\" he said. These remarks echo ones the US president made about the Iranian government on Thursday, where he pledged to \"hit them very hard\" if they \"start killing people\". Khamenei remained defiant in a televised address on Friday.\"Let everyone know that the Islamic Republic came to power through the blood of several hundred thousand honourable people and it will not back down in the face of those who deny this,\" the 86-year-old said.Later, in remarks made to a gathering of supporters and broadcast on state television, Khamenei doubled down, saying Iran \"will not shirk from dealing with destructive elements\".Iran's United Nations ambassador accused the US of \"interfering in Iran's internal affairs through threats, incitement, and the deliberate encouragement of instability and violence,\" in a letter to the Security Council. Since protests began on 28 December, in addition to the 48 protesters killed, more than 2,277 individuals have also been arrested, the US-based Human Rights Activist News Agency (HRANA) said.The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHRNGO) said at least 51 protesters, including nine children, had been killed.BBC Persian has spoken to the families of 22 of them and confirmed their identities. The BBC and most other international news organisations are barred from reporting inside Iran.In a joint statement, the leaders of the UK, Germany and France said they were \"deeply concerned about reports of violence by Iranian security forces, and strongly condemn the killing of protesters\".\"The Iranian authorities have the responsibility to protect their own population and must allow for the freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisal,\" French President Emmanuel Macron, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric said the United Nations was very disturbed by the loss of life. \"People anywhere in the world have a right to demonstrate peacefully, and governments have a responsibility to protect that right and to ensure that that right is respected,\" he said.Meanwhile the Iranian security and judicial authorities issued a series of coordinated warnings, hardening their rhetoric and echoing an earlier message of \"no leniency\" by Iran's top security body, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC).Iran's National Security Council - responsible for domestic security and not to be confused with the SNSC - said \"decisive and necessary legal action will be taken\" against protesters, which it described as \"armed vandals\" and \"disruptors of peace and security\".In a brief statement, it warned against \"any form of attack on military, law-enforcement, or governmental facilities\". The intelligence arm of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) said it would not tolerate what it described as \"terrorist acts\", asserting that it would continue its operations \"until the complete defeat of the enemy's plan\".Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah who was overthrown by the 1979 Islamic revolution, called on Trump on Friday to \"be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran\". Pahlavi, who lives close to Washington DC, had urged protesters to take to the streets on Thursday and Friday.Protests have taken place across the country, with BBC Verify verifying videos from 67 locations.On Friday, protesters amassed after weekly prayers in the south-eastern city of Zahedan, videos verified by BBC Persian and BBC Verify show. In one of the videos, people can be heard chanting \"death to the dictator\", referencing Khamenei.In another, protesters gather near a local mosque, when several loud bangs can be heard.Another verified video from Thursday showed a fire at the office of the Young Journalists Club, a subsidiary of state broadcaster Irib, in the city of Isfahan. It is unclear what caused the fire and if anyone was injured.Photos received by the BBC from Thursday night also show cars overturned and set alight at Tehran's Kaaj roundabout.The country has been under a near-total internet blackout since Thursday evening, with minor amounts of traffic returning on Friday, internet monitoring groups Cloudfare and Netblocks said. That means less information is emerging from Iran.IHRNGO director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam said in a statement that \"the extent of the government's use of force against protesters has been increasing, and the risk of intensified violence and the widespread killing of protesters after the internet shutdown is very serious\".Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi has warned of a possible \"massacre\" during the internet shutdown.One person who was able to send a message to the BBC said he was in Shiraz, in southern Iran. He reported a run on supermarkets by residents trying to stock up on food and other essentials, expecting worse days to come.The shutdown of the internet has meant that cash machines are not working, and there is no way to pay for purchases in shops where debit cards cannot be used due to the lack of internet.Mahsa Alimardani, who works for the human rights NGO Witness, told the BBC in London that she had not been able to make contact with her family since Thursday evening.\"It's very anxiety-inducing, not having access to information, not knowing if your loved ones participated [in the protests] or if they're okay,\" she said.The protests began nearly two weeks ago with shopkeepers in Tehran angry about the collapsing currency, before spreading to students and street demonstrations.The last major protests were in 2022, when demonstrations erupted after the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a young Kurdish woman who was detained by morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. More than 550 people were killed and 20,000 detained by security forces over several months, according to human rights groups.Additional reporting by Reha Kansara, Kasra Naji and Soroush Negahdari",

    "body": "US forces have seized another tanker in the Caribbean Sea, officials say, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to control exports of Venezuelan oil. The tanker, the Olina, is on multiple countries' sanctions lists and the fifth vessel to be seized by the US in recent weeks.The US is using the seizures to pressure Venezuela's interim government and remove the so-called dark fleet of tankers from service.  Officials say this fleet consists of more than 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil.\"Once again, our joint interagency forces sent a clear message this morning: 'there is no safe haven for criminals,'\" said the US military's Southern Command on Friday.The vessel reportedly left Venezuelan waters late on Sunday, after the US seized  President Nicolás Maduro in an early morning raid.Officials said Friday's operation was carried out before dawn by Marines and sailors in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security, and that it was seized after it \"departed Venezuela attempting to evade US forces\".  Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on X that it was \"another 'ghost fleet' tanker ship suspected of carrying embargoed oil\".Noem also shared a video appearing to show troops dropping onto a ship from a helicopter, and described the operation as \"safe\" and \"effective\".Maritime risk company Vanguard Tech said the vessel was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean. It had been sailing under a false flag registered to Timor-Leste, according to the International Maritime Organization.Vanguard Tech added that the vessel's location tracker was last active 52 days ago, northeast of Curacao, and that \"the seizure follows a prolonged pursuit of tankers linked to sanctioned Venezuelan oil shipments in the region\".The US had sanctioned the Olina last January, then named Minerva M, accusing it of helping finance Russia's war in Ukraine by moving Russian oil to foreign markets.Earlier this week, the US said it seized two other tankers linked to Venezuelan oil exports in \"back-to-back\" operations in the North Atlantic and Caribbean.One of them was the Russian-flagged Marinera seized with the help of the UK Royal Navy, which gave logistical support by air and sea.The Marinera is allegedly part of shadow fleet carrying oil for Venezuela, Russia and Iran, breaking US sanctions. US officials said that Marinera was falsely flying the flag of Guyana last month, which made it stateless.US authorities alleged the second tanker - the M/T Sophia - was \"conducting illicit activities\".Experts have told BBC Verify that under UN international maritime law, authorities can board a stateless vessel.President Donald Trump  says Venezuela - which has the world's largest proven oil reserves - \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil worth some $2.8bn (£2.1bn) to the US.The oil, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, would be sold \"in the marketplace at market rates\" and that the US would control how the proceeds were dispersed \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people\".Meanwhile on Friday, US diplomats visited the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, to assess the possibility of re-opening an embassy in the Latin American country. Diplomatic ties between the US and Venezuela were severed by Maduro in 2019. The new Venezuelan authorities have said they're engaged in exploratory talks on restoring relations.",

    "body": "7 hours agoSarah SmithNorth America editorPresident Donald Trump says the US needs to \"own\" Greenland to prevent Russia and China from doing so. \"Countries have to have ownership and you defend ownership, you don't defend leases. And we'll have to defend Greenland,\" Trump told reporters on Friday, in response to a question from the BBC.We will do it \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\", he added. The White House said recently the administration is considering buying the semi-autonomous territory of fellow Nato member Denmark, but it would not rule out the option of annexing it by force. Denmark and Greenland say the territory is not for sale. Denmark has said military action would spell the end of the trans-Atlantic defence alliance.In a joint statement on Friday night, Greenland's party leaders, including the opposition, reiterated their call for the \"US's disregard for our country to end\".\"We do not want to be Americans, we do not want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" they said. \"The future of Greenland must be decided by the Greenlandic people.\"Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US president has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, claiming without evidence that it was \"covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place\".The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.But speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said a lease agreement was not good enough.\"Countries can't make nine-year deals or even 100-year deals,\" he said, adding that they had to have ownership. \"I love the people of China. I love the people of Russia,\" Trump said. \"But I don't want them as a neighbour in Greenland, not going to happen.\"\"And by the way Nato's got to understand that,\" the US president added.Denmark's Nato allies - major European countries as well as Canada - have rallied to its support this week with statements reaffirming that \"only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations\".Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, they have said this must be achieved by allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its president, Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks with Denmark next week.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.",

    "body": "5 hours agoSarah RainsfordSouthern Europe correspondent in Crans-Montana'In this shared grief we stand united': Day of mourning for New Year's Eve fire victims in SwitzerlandTragedy brought people together in Crans-Montana and brought the country to a standstill.On Friday, just down the road from the bar where 40 young people were killed by fire on New Year's Eve, church bells rang in their memory.They tolled right across Switzerland, to mark a national day of mourning.Then, moments after the last notes of a special memorial service had faded, came the news that one of the bar's owners had been detained.Swiss prosecutors said Jacques Moretti, a French national, was a potential flight risk. He and his wife Jessica, who is also French, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.Many of the victims' families had demanded action like this from the start: more than a week after the fire, the anger in this community has been increasing.At the main ceremony in Martigny, down in the valley, relatives of the dead were joined by survivors. Some had come from hospital for the memorial. People held white roses in their laps and gripped each other's hands for support.\"The images we faced were unbearable. A scene worse than a nightmare. Screams ringing out in the icy cold, the smell of burning. It was apocalyptic,\" a young woman called Marie told the audience. She had been in a bar opposite Le Constellation when the fire broke out and suddenly found herself helping the injured as they ran from the flames.She said she would never forget what she'd seen.Listening in the front row were the presidents of France and Italy, whose citizens were among those killed and injured in the fire. Both countries have opened their own investigations.Back in Rome, Italy's prime minister vowed to make sure all those responsible were identified.\"This was no accident. It was the result of too many people who did not do their jobs,\" Giorgia Meloni said. She wants to know why the music wasn't cut as soon as the fire started.\"Why did no-one tell the young people to get out? Why did the council not make the proper checks? There are too many whys.\"In Crans-Montana people have the same questions and many more.For now, the only two formal suspects are the co-owners of Le Constellation, Jacques and Jessica Moretti. Early on Friday, the pair were called in by prosecutors.  They are being investigated for causing death and injury through negligence but have not been charged. Now Jacques Moretti has been remanded in custody. In a statement, the public ministry said the move followed a \"new assessment of the flight risk.\"\"I constantly think of the victims and of the people who are struggling,\" his wife told a crush of TV cameras after several hours of questioning at the ministry.It was her first public comment since the fire.\"It is an unimaginable tragedy. It happened in our establishment, and I would like to apologise.\"Nine days on, Le Constellation is still obscured from view behind white plastic sheets. A lone policeman stands guard, his face covered against the relentless snow.What unfolded inside the building's basement has gradually become clearer – and it's the story of a disaster that should never have happened.Mobile phone footage shows a sparkler tied to a champagne bottle apparently starting the fire as it brushes the ceiling. Covered with soundproofing foam that was never safety tested, it ignites quickly.When the crowd eventually rush for the exit in panic, there is a crush on the stairs. It seems the emergency doors were blocked.But another video, from six years ago, suggests the risk was well known. On the footage, a waiter can be heard warning that the material on the ceiling is flammable.\"Be careful with the foam,\" the voice shouts, as people wave the same sparklers.But the questions here are not just for the owners.This week the local authorities in Crans made the shocking admission that they hadn't carried out mandatory safety checks of the bar for five years.They offered no explanation.\"It was a hell inside that bar. More than 1,000 degrees of temperature. There was no way to escape,\" Italy's ambassador to Switzerland, Gian Lorenzo Cornado, told the BBC, citing a long list of safety violations.  Six Italians were killed as a result.\"Italy wants justice, the Italian government wants justice and the Italian people want justice, for sure. The families want justice,\" the ambassador stressed.That includes for those with life-changing injuries.The regional hospital in Sion took the first major influx of patients. The stress was compounded by the fact that many doctors' own children were partying in Crans for the New Year.\"They were all scared the next stretcher to arrive would be carrying their own child,\" hospital director Eric Bonvin remembers.But he's proud of how his team coped.Some casualties were unconscious and so badly burned, it took time to identify them.The most serious cases were moved to specialist burns centres elsewhere in Switzerland and in Europe where some are still in a critical condition.All face a long, tough path to recovery which the doctor likens to a \"rebirth\" because many of his young patients have severe burns to the face.\"First the body needs to be protected, like the foetus in a mother's womb. That's what's happening for many now. Then they will have to re-enter the world and find their identity,\" Professor Bonvin says.\"It will take a lot of work and resilience.\"Add to that the anguish of surviving.\"They came round and at first they felt lucky to be alive. But some now feel this guilt, wondering why they are here, but not their friend or brother,\" Bonvin explains.\"It is a delicate moment.\"In central Crans, the heap of tributes for the dead is still growing, protected from the elements by a canvas.After leaving their own fresh flowers on Friday, many people then stood in front of the ruins of the bar itself for a moment. Remembering, in silence.",

    "body": "Video emerges of Minneapolis shooting filmed by ICE agent who opened fire5 hours agoElaine OkyereWatch: Video filmed by ICE agent who shot Minneapolis woman has emergedA video filmed by the US immigration agent who fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis on Wednesday has emerged, showing the moments before gunfire rang out.The 47-second footage, obtained by Minnesota-based outlet Alpha News, shows Renee Nicole Good sitting behind the wheel of her car and speaking to the officer. US Vice-President JD Vance shared the clip on social media, commenting that the agent had acted in self-defence. Local officials have insisted the woman posed no danger.Good's wife has paid tribute to the 37-year-old, saying the pair were trying to support their neighbours when she was shot. Her death has sparked protests across the US. President Donald Trump's administration says Good tried to run over the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in an act of \"domestic terrorism\" after blocking the road and impeding the agency's work.Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has described that account as \"garbage\" based on the video footage.The BBC has asked the homeland security department and the White House for comment on the new video that emerged on Friday.The footage starts with the officer getting out of his car and filming Good's vehicle and registration plate while he walks around the Honda SUV. A dog is in the backseat. Good says: \"That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you.\"Her wife, Becca Good, is standing on the street filming the interaction with her mobile phone. She tells the ICE agent: \"That's OK, we don't change our plates every morning just so you know. It will be the same plate when you come talk to us later.\"She adds: \"You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy.\"Another agent approaches Good on the driver's side and uses an expletive as he says: \"Get out of the car.\" The agent filming the clip moves in front of Good's car as she reverses.In a chaotic couple of seconds, she turns the wheel to the right and pulls forwards.The camera jerks up to the sky. \"Woah, woah!\" a voice says, as bangs are heard.In the final part of the video the car is seen veering down the road. The ICE agent swears.Other clips released previously from the scene show the maroon SUV crashed into the side of the road after the woman was shot by the agent.The officer appears to stay on his feet, and is later seen in other videos walking towards Good's crashed car. Federal officials say the agent was injured and treated in hospital. The FBI is investigating the incident.An earlier video shows the incident from another perspectiveThe officer who fired on Good is Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent who was previously injured in the line of duty when he was struck by a car. When asked about the video at the White House on Friday, President Trump said: \"You have agitators and we will always be protecting ICE, and we're always going to be protecting our border patrol and our law enforcement.\"On Friday, Vance reposted the video on X, and defended the agent's actions, saying: \"The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence.\"White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also reposted the video, saying the media had smeared an ICE agent who had \"properly defended himself from being run over\". Good's wife told local media the pair had gone to the scene of immigration enforcement activity to support neighbours. \"We had whistles,\" Becca Good said. \"They had guns.\"When speaking about Good - a mother-of-three, including a six-year-old son - she said \"kindness radiated out of her\".\"We were raising our son to believe that no matter where you come from or what you look like, all of us deserve compassion and kindness,\" she added.On Friday, Minnesota officials said they would open an inquiry into the shooting after saying they had been frozen out of the federal investigation.Trump was asked by a reporter at the White House on Friday whether the FBI should share its findings with Minnesota, and said: \"Well normally I would, but they're crooked officials.\"Hennepin County's top prosecutor Mary Moriarty and the state's Democratic attorney general, Keith Ellison, said they were launching their own probe.It came a day after the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI had initially pledged a joint investigation, then reversed course.One federal agency that is not looking into the shooting is the US justice department's Civil Rights Division, which has in the past investigated alleged excessive use of force by law enforcement.But prosecutors have advised its criminal section that there will be no investigation in this case, sources told the BBC's US media partner CBS News. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, has accused the Trump administration of blocking state officials, but Vice-President Vance said it was a federal matter. Demonstrators turned out for a second night of protests on Thursday over the killing of Good. Governor Walz said he had activated the state's National Guard to help with security of the protests.",

    "body": "8 hours agoNatalie ShermanBusiness reporterWatch: Trump outlines plan for Venezuela oil after Maduro ousterUS President Donald Trump has asked for at least $100bn (£75bn) in oil industry spending for Venezuela, but received a lukewarm response at the White House as one executive warned the South American country was currently \"uninvestable\".Bosses of the biggest US oil firms who attended the meeting acknowledged that Venezuela, sitting on vast energy reserves, represented an enticing opportunity.But they said significant changes would be needed to make the region an attractive investment.  No major financial commitments were immediately forthcoming.Trump has said he will unleash the South American nation's oil after US forces seized its leader Nicolas Maduro in a 3 January raid on its capital.\"One of the things the United States gets out of this will be even lower energy prices,\" Trump said in Friday's meeting at the White House.But the oil bosses present expressed caution.Exxon's chief executive Darren Woods said: \"We have had our assets seized there twice and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state.\" \"Today it's uninvestable.\"Venezuela has had a complicated relationship with international oil firms since oil was discovered in its territory more than 100 years ago. Chevron is the last remaining major American oil firm still operating in the country. A handful of companies from other countries, including Spain's Repsol and Italy's Eni, both of which were represented at the White House meeting, are also active.Trump said his administration would decide which firms would be allowed to operate. \"You're dealing with us directly. You're not dealing with Venezuela at all. We don't want you to deal with Venezuela,\" he said. The White House has said it is working to \"selectively\" roll back US sanctions that have restricted sales of Venezuelan oil. Officials say they have been coordinating with interim authorities in the country, which is currently led by Maduro's former second-in-command, Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez.But they have also made clear they intend to exert control over the sales, as a way to maintain leverage over Rodríguez's government. The US this week has seized several oil tankers carrying sanctioned crude. American officials have said they are working to set up a sales process, which would deposit money raised into US-controlled accounts.\"We are open for business,\" Trump said. Watch: Mixed reactions among some Trump supporters to Venezuela operationVenezuela's oil production has been hit in recent decades by disinvestment and mismanagement - as well as US sanctions. At roughly one million barrels per day, the country accounts for less than 1% of global supply.Chevron, which accounts for about a fifth of the country's output, said it expected to bolster its production, building on its current presence, while Exxon said it was working to send in a technical team to assess the situation in the coming weeks. Repsol, which currently boasts output of about 45,000 barrels per day, said it saw a path to triple its production in Venezuela over the next few years under the right conditions. Executives at other firms also said Trump's promises of change would encourage investment and they were hoping to seize the moment.\"We are ready to go to Venezuela,\" said Bill Armstrong, who leads an independent oil and gas driller. \"In real estate terms, it is prime real estate.\"But analysts say meaningfully increasing production would take significant effort.\"They are being as polite as humanly possible, and being as supportive as they can, without committing actual dollars,\" said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies and former US state department special envoy for international energy affairs.Watch: How the US attack on Venezuela unfoldedExxon and Shell are \"not going to invest single-digit billions of dollars, much less tens of billions of dollars\", without physical security, legal certainty and a competitive fiscal framework, Goldwyn said.\"It's not really welcome from an industry point of view,\" he said. \"The conditions are just not right.\"While smaller companies might be more eager to jump in and help boost Venezuela's oil production over the next year, he said those investments would likely hover in the $50m range - far from the \"fantastical\" $100bn figure that Trump has floated.Rystad Energy estimates it would take $8bn to $9bn in new investments per year for production to triple by 2040.Trump's suggested $100bn of investment into Venezuela could have a major impact on production - if it were to materialise, said the firm's chief economist, Claudio Galimberti.He said companies would only be likely to invest on that scale with subsidies - and political stability. Americans should not expect the situation in Venezuela to lower oil prices anytime soon, he added. \"It's going to be difficult to see big commitments before we have a fully stabilised political situation and that is anybody's guess when that happens,\" he said.

    "body": "US film stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors to become Guinea citizens after DNA tests14 hours agoMakuochi OkaforBBC AfricaMohamed Finando / Oxygen AfricaThe celebrity couple were greeted with great fanfare at the airportHusband and wife movie stars Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have travelled to Guinea, where the US couple are due to be granted citizenship after tracing their ancestry to the West African nation through DNA testing.\"We are just happy to be here,\" said Good, best known for the film Think Like a Man, and who went on to explain that it was her first visit to Guinea.Majors, a star of Creed and Ant-Man, added: \"I am excited to meet the people and go around the town with my wife.\"Their citizenship ceremony has been organised by the ministry of culture - and is similar to other initiatives in the region to encourage people of African descent to reclaim their heritage and invest in the continent.The event - a private cultural ceremony - is to take place at a new tourist garden on the outskirts of the capital, Conakry later on Friday.Good, 44, and Majors, 36, began dating in May 2023 and tied the knot last year.They married following a turbulent period in Majors' life. In 2024, he was sentenced in the US to probation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend, British choreographer Grace Jabbari. He was mandated to complete a 52-week domestic violence intervention programme.The actors landed at Conakry's Gbessia International Airport in the early hours of Friday morning and were welcomed with great fanfare by officials and musicians.During their stay in Guinea, the pair are scheduled to tour Boké, a coastal region with historic slave trade sites. It is not clear if they plan to invest in or move to Guinea.Mohamed Finando / Oxygen AfricaThe stars were presented with kola nuts - a culturally symbolic gift of welcomeIn recent years, several celebrities have taken up citizenships of countries in Africa.It largely began in 2019 when Ghana launched \"The Year of Return\", inviting those with African heritage to come home and invest. One of the most prominent stars to do so was Stevie Wonder in 2024.Other notable examples have been US singer Ciara, who took Beninese citizenship last year, and Hollywood actor Samuel L Jackson, who acquired a Gabonese passport in 2020.Guinea itself has a long history of welcoming activists and people from the African diaspora.In the 1960s, South African singer Miriam Makeba and her husband, US civil rights activist and Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael, moved to Guinea.Makeba had been made stateless for her opposition to apartheid and after her marriage to Carmichael, who popularised the slogan \"black power\", her US visa was revoked.She was treated as an honorary Guinean citizen and cultural ambassador, while Carmichael, who took the name Kwame Ture, remained in Guinea even after their divorce, dying there in 1998.Guinea has experience political turmoil in recent years - and under the junta that seized power in 2021 the country has become less open to dissent. Coup leader Gen Mamady Doumbouya restricted the media and suppressed protests.The country has recently returned to civilian rule following elections last month, won by Doumbouya with 87% of the vote. Unlike other countries in the region that have experienced recent coups, Guinea has maintained relations with Western governments, particularly France.The country is rich in minerals, including bauxite, iron ore, diamonds, gold and uranium, yet its people remain among the poorest in West Africa.You may also be interested in:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Russia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine.Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions.It is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024.Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.While the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv.President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border.The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. \"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit - in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.The morning after, as the clean-up got underway, the businesses that hadn't been damaged were open. A coffee shop just a few floors down from a destroyed apartment was serving customers. Wreckage from a Russian drone, including its wings and engine, were still scattered over the pavement outside.At another site, the round, charred entry hole of a missile was visible on the 11th floor of an apartment block in a quiet residential area.The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. \"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.Kyiv's streets now relentless hum with the buzz of the diesel generators that businesses rely on for power, but many residential buildings are reliant on central heating and restoring it can be a longer task.The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. ",

    "body": "22 hours agoWill Grant,Central America correspondentandOlivia IrelandThe Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture.Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media.The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the release of political prisoners - which has been a long-held US demand - was \"a very important and smart gesture\" from Venezuela.Trump added that Venezuela released the prisoners as a sign of \"seeking peace\" and as a result, he had cancelled a \"previously expected second wave of attacks\" on the country.Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of \"national unity and peaceful coexistence\".Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas.Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential \"enforced disappearance\" by the UN Human Rights Office.Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future.Watch: BBC reports from outside Venezuela prison \"El Helicoide\" as detainees releasedAbout 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had \"given orders to close that prison,\" which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US \"next week sometime\". Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said \"that would be a great honour\". Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

    "body": "2 hours agoImogen FoulkesGeneva correspondentIn the wake of the devastating fire at a bar in Crans-Montana, many Swiss citizens are asking themselves if their political system is fit for purpose. Switzerland, often praised for its efficiency, has a very devolved system of government, in which villages and towns are run by local officials elected from and by the community.It is a system the Swiss cherish, because they believe it ensures accountability. But there are inherent weaknesses: hypothetically, the official approving a bar license or passing a fire-safety check is the friend, neighbour, or maybe even cousin of the bar owner.When the news of the fire emerged on New Year's Eve, first there was shock. Such devastating fires are not, people thought, supposed to happen in Switzerland.Then there was grief - 40 young people lost their lives, 116 were injured, many of them very seriously. Questions followed - what caused such a catastrophe?And finally, this week - fury when Crans-Montana's Mayor, Nicolas Feraud, revealed that Le Constellation bar had not been inspected since 2019.Crans-Montana is in the Swiss canton of Valais, where fire-safety inspections are the responsibility of Mayor Feraud and his colleagues, and they are supposed to happen every 12 months.Not only had the checks not taken place, the mayor said, he had only become aware of this after the fire.  And, he revealed, of 128 bars and restaurants in Crans-Montana, only 40 had been inspected in 2025. Asked why, Feraud had no answer, though he did suggest Crans-Montana had too few inspectors for the number of properties that needed checking.This was echoed by Romy Biner, the mayor of neighbouring upmarket resort Zermatt, who told local media that many communities in the canton of Valais did not have the required resources to inspect so many premises. This is not a line that plays well with many Swiss, who know that Crans-Montana and Zermatt are two of the richest winter resorts in the country.So when Feraud faced the press, there were pointed questions from Swiss journalists: How well did the mayor know the bar's owners? Had he ever been to the bar? And, was there any possibility of corruption?\"Absolutely not,\" was his indignant answer to the last question.The mother of two brothers who survived the fire also had questions. \"We urgently need complete, transparent answers,\" she wrote on social media.When they escaped the burning bar, each of her sons had thought at first that the other was dead. \"They escaped, but they are deeply traumatised. They will carry the emotional scars forever.\"Those questions, from journalists and families, reveal the problems of Switzerland's devolved political system.Elected officials in towns like Crans-Montana have many responsibilities as well as fire safety - running schools and social services, even collecting taxes.Most of these officials work part-time and, once elected, continue with their day jobs.Nowadays some communes may be over-challenged trying to supply and oversee all the services a 21st-Century population expects, but Swiss voters expect better than what they heard from Mayor Feraud.The headlines after his press conference were savage. Many demanded Mayor Feraud and his colleagues resign. Feraud ruled this out, saying, \"we were elected by the people. You don't abandon ship in the middle of a storm\".\"A failure right across the board\", wrote the broadsheet Tagesanzeiger. \"Now Switzerland's reputation is on the line.\"\"An utter disaster\", wrote the tabloid Blick, \"a total failure of fire safety checks.\"Reputational damage is something the Swiss both hate and fear. Switzerland is a rich country, in part because of its reputation for safety, stability, reliability, and, among its own citizens, accountability.If those in charge damage that reputation, and put the country's success at risk, the Swiss are unforgiving.Heads rolled two decades ago when Swissair, the much-loved national airline, went bankrupt.Once nicknamed affectionately \"the flying bank\", Swissair's management had made a series of risky financial investments that left the airline dangerously over-extended.In 2008, banking giant UBS, in which many Swiss, especially pensioners, had shares, had to be bailed out by Swiss taxpayers to prevent not just its own downfall, but disastrous consequences for the global economy.When the bank's reckless over-exposure to subprime mortgages was revealed, there was outrage. At the bank's annual general meeting that year, normally sedate elderly shareholders hissed and booed. One even jumped on to the stage, demanding the management give up their generous bonuses, ironically waving a string of Swiss bratwursts under their noses \"in case you go hungry\".Crans-Montana, too, has aroused that same angry feeling of trust betrayed. But this is much worse than Swissair or UBS. Forty people, many of them teenagers, are dead. Dozens more have suffered life-changing injuries.The Swiss authorities know there must be answers, quickly. At Friday's memorial service, the president of Valais, Matthias Reynard, was close to tears as he promised a \"strict and independent\" investigation, warning that \"relevant political authorities\" would be held accountable. Switzerland's president Guy Parmelin said he expected justice \"without delay and without leniency\".The owner of the bar is now in custody, subject to a criminal investigation, but the role of the local government is sure to be examined, too. There are already calls for fire-safety inspection in Valais canton to be taken away from local town councils and given to the cantonal authorities.Romain Jourdan, a lawyer acting for some of the families, has announced plans to file a case against Crans-Montana's town council. The families, he said, \"are demanding that all local officials be questioned, so that such a tragedy never happens again\".There is a deeper, nationwide soul-searching going on as well. The Swiss want to know why their beloved devolved system, which many, perhaps complacently, believed to be near perfect, went so catastrophically wrong.In the first hours after the fire, many people, along with their shock and grief, felt a certain quiet pride that their emergency services had responded so quickly.Firefighters, ambulances crews, and even helicopters were at the scene within minutes. The emergency services were present at the memorial service. Many openly wept.The shock and grief still sits deep, but the pride has evaporated. What good are top-of-the-range, highly professional emergency services, the Swiss are asking themselves, if basic fire safety checks are neglected?Switzerland's government says finding answers is a moral responsibility - to the families above all, but also to its own voters.",

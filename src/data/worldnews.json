    "body": "German police have arrested a Lebanese national on suspicion of being a member of Hamas and planning attacks in Europe.The man, named as \"Mohammad S\", was stopped at Berlin's Brandenburg Airport after arriving from Beirut on Friday evening.Federal prosecutors said that in August 2025 he helped procure 300 rounds of ammunition and was involved in an alleged plot to attack Jewish and Israeli institutions.He is due to be brought before a federal judge who will decide on a pretrial detention.Hamas, which controlled Gaza but has been severely weakened by Israeli operations in the territory, is considered a terrorist organisation by the US, UK, Israel and many other countries.The militant Palestinian group carried out the attacks on Israel in October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 people taken hostage.Since then, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, more than 70,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israeli military action.German authorities say \"Mohammad S\" colluded with \"Abed Al G\", one of three alleged Hamas members arrested last October over planned attacks on Jewish and Israeli institutions.The three were reportedly arrested while meeting for a weapons handover in Berlin. Two of them are Germany nationals, another is from Lebanon.Around the time of the arrests, police searches also took place in the German cities of Leipzig and Oberhausen, Der Spiegel reported.Separately, in November, German authorities arrested another suspected member of Hamas - also a Lebanese national - near the border with the Czech Republic.",

    "body": "6 hours agoReutersZhang Youxia was widely seen as President Xi's closest military allyChina's defence ministry says it has opened an investigation into the country's highest-ranking general over \"grave violations of discipline and the law\".The ministry gave no further details about accusations against General Zhang Youxia, who has widely been seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally. However in China the accusation of wrongdoing is usually a euphemism for corruption.In its announcement, the ministry said another senior military officer, General Liu Zhenli, was also under investigation.Their removal follows the expulsion of nine top generals in October - one of the largest public crackdowns on the military in decades. Zhang, 75, is a vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) - the Communist Party group headed by President Xi which controls the armed forces.Zhang also sits on the party's top decision-making body, the 24-person Politburo.His father was one of the founding generals of the Chinese Communist Party.Zhang joined the army in 1968 and is one of only a few senior leaders with combat experience. He was kept in office beyond the customary retirement age for China's military, suggesting President Xi's confidence in him until now.The announcement comes days after rumours appeared that Zhang and Liu could be facing an investigation as they were not present at a high-level party event in December.ReutersPresident Xi has been accused of using corruption investigations to purge political rivalsSince coming to power, President Xi has launched waves of anti-corruption drives through various departments and this campaign has recently focused heavily on the military.He has called corruption \"the biggest threat\" to the Communist Party and said the fight against it  \"remains grave and complex\".Advocates say the policy promotes good governance, but others believe it has been used as a tool to purge political rivals.With the probe into Zhang and Liu, the CMC is now down from the original seven members to just two: Xi, who is the chairman, and Zhang Shengmin, who is responsible for the military's disciplinary affairs.More from the BBC",

    "body": "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has weighed in on a separatist movement in Alberta, saying the western Canadian province is a \"natural partner for the US\". \"Alberta has a wealth of natural resources, but they won't let them build a pipeline to the Pacific,\" Bessent told an American right-wing commentator in an interview on Thursday. \"I think we should let them come down into the US, and Alberta is a natural partner for the US. They have great resources. The Albertans are very independent people.\" The top US official's comments come amid strained ties between US and Canada, and as signatures are being collected in the province seeking an independence referendum. In comments to conservative host Jack Posobiec, Bessent went on to say there is a \"rumour that they may have a referendum on whether they want to stay in Canada or not\". A group in Alberta has until May to collect at least 178,000 signatures - or 10% of eligible voters - for a referendum campaign. Asked about Bessent's remarks on Friday, federal Finance Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he'd tell him \"thanks but no thanks, we will do our own things\".He said Canadians are \"able to develop our natural resources at home\" and pointed to a deal recently inked by Prime Minister Mark Carney with Alberta that opens the door for an oil pipeline to the Pacific. It's a project long pushed for by Canada's oil heartland but one which faces significant hurdles.A spokesman for Alberta Premier Danielle Smith said in a statement to the BBC that the province supports new pipelines \"west, east, north, and south, and we will continue to work with our US partners on building more pipeline capacity to US markets\". \"But the premier also believes the overwhelming majority of Albertans are not interested in becoming a US state\".Late last year over 430,000 signatures were gathered for a petition calling for a united Canada to counter the separatist push, and polls indicate a majority of Albertans want to stay in Canada. Many supporters of separatism have also told media they are seeking independence from Canada - not to join the US. Mitch Sylvestre, who is spearheading the referendum petition, told the CBC on Friday he doesn't think anyone in his movement is eyeing the US.He said he thought Bessent's comment on Alberta and the US being \"natural partners\" was obvious given the energy trade between them.Still, some organisers of the movement have said they have travelled to Washington to meet officials from the Trump administration.Meanwhile, trade talks between the US and Canada are on ice, and President Donald Trump has expressed irritation with the prime minister over a blunt speech he delivered at the World Economic Forum in Davos calling out \"great powers\" for weaponising their economic might.Trump responded in his own speech with: \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\"Other US officials have also criticised Carney's speech, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who this week accused Canada of being \"arrogant\" and Carney of pandering to a domestic audience by adopting an anti-US stance.",

    "body": "15 hours agoKaty Watson,Australia correspondentandHarry SekulichA young boy who was bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour last week has died in hospital. Twelve-year-old Nico Antic had been jumping off a rock ledge with friends on 18 January when he was attacked by what authorities suspected was a bull shark.\"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico has passed away,\" his parents Lorena and Juan said in a statement. The incident was one of four reported shark attacks along the New South Wales coast over two days.\"Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that's how we'll remember him,\" his family, who were originally from Argentina, added.Nico's friends were praised for their bravery after jumping into the water to help him after he was attacked last Sunday afternoon.However he suffered serious leg injuries and was taken to Sydney Children's Hospital in a critical condition. He was placed in an induced coma after undergoing surgery.An online fundraiser set up for Nico's family has raised $240,000 (£121,308).There has been a spate of reported shark attacks along Australia's east coast in the past week, three of them in Sydney. On Monday, a surfer on Sydney's northern beaches escaped a lurking shark without physical injury, while hours later a 27-year-old man suffered \"life-changing\" injuries in a shark attack at a nearby beach. One day later, a man on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales was pulled from the water after surviving a shark bite.The man, 39, sustained a chest wound and was taken to hospital. The attacks followed several days of heavy rain, which experts say created a \"perfect storm\" of conditions for bull sharks who prefer murky water. They also say rain flushes nutrients into the water, which can draw sharks closer to shore.Beaches across Sydney were closed to protect the public until weather improved, many of which have reopened for the Australia Day public holiday long weekend.",

    "body": "5 hours agoDearbail JordanGetty ImagesAlex Honnold was the first climber to perform a rope-free ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite National ParkAn American climber has postponed scaling the Taipei 101, one of the world's tallest buildings, rope-free for another 24 hours due to wet weather.     Alex Honnold, who scaled El Capitan in California's Yosemite National Park without a rope in 2017, said on Saturday: \"Sadly it's raining in Taipei right now so I don't get to go climbing.\" The skyscraper in Taiwan's capital measures 508m (1,667ft) and is made of steel, glass and concrete. It contains eight sections, each with a slight overhang designed to resemble joints on a bamboo stick.Netflix - which will stream the event - says there will be a delay on the live feed should the worst happen.\"It's obviously a conversation that everybody has,\" Netflix executive Jeff Gaspin told Variety magazine. \"We'll cut away. We have a 10-second delay. Nobody expects or wants to see anything like that to happen.\"The climb is now due to take place on Sunday.  Announcing the delay, Netflix said: \"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding.\"Taipei 101 has been conquered before. In 2004, France's Alain Robert, who called himself Spiderman, climbed it in four hours using a safety belt and rope.Netflix said there will be three stages to Honnold's rope-free climb. First, there is an initital 113m section of sloping steel and glass followed by the eight \"bamboo\" boxes before reaching the final stage which includes scaling the spire at the very top of the tower. Getty ImagesTaipei 101's surfaces were deemed too wet for a climb on Saturday Honnold, 40, who is married with two children, said it was \"a lifelong dream\" to scale a skyscraper.His historic 2017 ascent of El Capitan without a rope was documented in the film Free Solo, which won an Academy Award.An enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915m), El Capitan is a major landmark in Yosemite and entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world.More from the BBC",

Two teenagers are among those who remain unaccounted for, with the youngest aged 15 years old. Search teams located human remains beneath dirt and debris on Friday evening,  Police Superintendent Tim Anderson said, after a landslide hit a popular campsite in Mount Maunganui. \"This is heartbreaking news for the families and the dozens of people who have been working day and night, hoping for a positive outcome,\" Anderson said. In a separate incident, two people died - a grandmother and her grandchild - in a different landslide at Welcome Bay, nearby Mount Maunganui, public service broadcaster Radio New Zealand (RNZ) reported. Heavy rain has fallen on New Zealand's North Island for days, with more wet weather forecast for the area over the weekend.Police said conditions have added to the difficulty of rescue efforts, and described the scene at Mount Maunganui as \"incredibly challenging... to work through\". Watch: Footage captures moment landslide starts in Mount Maunganui in New ZealandFire and emergency services worked through the night to locate those unaccounted for at the campsite before the operation was formally handed over to police on Saturday. The safety of workers on the ground is of \"upmost importance\", Anderson said. Police have confirmed the names of the six individuals unaccounted for as Lisa Anne Maclennan, 50, from Morrinsville, Måns Loke Bernhardsson, 20, from Sweden, Jacqualine Suzanne Wheeler, 71, from Rotorua, and Susan Doreen Knowles, 71, from Ngongotaha. The youngest victims have been identified by police as Sharon Maccanico, 15, from Auckland and Max Furse-Kee, 15, from Auckland.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visited the site on Friday. He said it was \"inspiring\" to see the show of community support as locals helped clear debris in flood-hit areas. Mount Maunganui is a sacred Māori site and one of the most popular campgrounds in New Zealand. It has been repeatedly hit by landslides in recent years.",

    "body": "17 hours agoLily JamaliNorth America Technology correspondent, San FranciscoTikTok's new US joint venture has made changes to its privacy policy that include expanding the type of location data the company can collect from its 200 million American users.The new policy was published after investors closed a deal with TikTok's Chinese owner ByteDance on Thursday to run the popular short-form video app's business in the US.The new joint venture said in its updated privacy terms that it may now \"collect precise location data, depending on your settings\" -  a change from the previous policy which allowed for the collection of \"approximate\" location data.TikTok did not immediately respond to the BBC's request for comment on the change. The company policy added that the sensitive personal information would be processed \"in accordance with applicable law\" and that users can turn off location services in their device settings at any time.Even before the new venture was established, TikTok collected location information based on a user's SIM card or IP address, or both.But it stopped short of collecting even approximate GPS information from American users operating the most updated version of the app, according to a 2024 version of its privacy policy.Precise location sharing hasn't yet been enabled in the US, where it is expected to be optional and turned off by default so users will be asked to opt in with a pop-up message. TikTok has not said when the update is due to reach American users.TikTok already collects similar data from users in the UK and Europe as part of a new \"Nearby Feed\" feature that lets users find events and businesses near them.The new American TikTok joint venture is also extending its permissions for gathering information about users interactions with TikTok's artificial intelligence (AI) tools.This includes prompts and questions submitted by users, as well as information about how, when, and where AI content was prompted or created.TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC is comprised of three managing investors including cloud computing giant Oracle, which is investing heavily in AI infrastructure and has taken on significant debt to finance its ambitions in the burgeoning space.Oracle is chaired by Larry Ellison, a Republican megadonor and longtime ally of US President Donald Trump, whose administration helped broker the US TikTok deal.The agreement follows years of tussling between Washington and Beijing that began in Trump's first presidential term, when he tried unsuccessfully to ban the app over national security concerns.In 2024, the US passed a law that required the platform to be banned in the US by January 2025 if ByteDance failed to sell its US operations to American investors.Trump repeatedly postponed the enforcement of legislation until the joint venture was finalised this week.The 2024 law was prompted in part by concerns about the possibility that Beijing might access the data of TikTok's American users.In a statement onThursday, the new joint venture said its mandate was \"to secure U.S. user data, apps and the algorithm through comprehensive data privacy and cybersecurity measures\".Oracle will oversee the retraining of TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm on existing American user data, the joint venture said in its statement, adding that the algorithm \"will be secured in Oracle's U.S. cloud environment.\"ByteDance retains a minority stake just shy of 20% in the joint venture.Other managing investors include the US tech investment firm Silver Lake and Abu-Dhabi state-owned investment fund MGX, which has done business with the Trump family's crypto venture World Liberty Financial.On Friday, Republican Representative John Moolenaar, who chairs the House Select Committee on China, expressed concern about ByteDance's ongoing involvement in TikTok's US operations.\"Does this deal ensure China does not have influence over the algorithm? Can the parties involved assure Americans their data is secure?\" he said in a statement. \"Those are questions that need to be answered as the Select Committee does oversight of this deal.\"",

    "body": "4 hours agoSakshi VenkatramanUS reporterUS President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 100% tariff on all Canadian goods if the country's prime minister strikes a trade deal with China. \"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday. Tensions between Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have escalated in recent days, after Carney gave a speech in Davos, Switzerland, pushing against the world's great powers.He recently met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and announced their countries had reached a trade deal that included electric vehicles.At the time, Trump hailed the potential deal as \"a good thing\". It is unclear if that deal has come into effect, or if Trump was referring to it specifically. The BBC has reached out to the White House, Carney's office and Canada's minister responsible for US-Canada trade for comment.In his Saturday post, Trump referred to the prime minister as \"Governor Carney\" and  wrote that if \"thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken.\"Trump did not provide a timeline or more information about the threatened tariff. Last year, when he first threatened new tariffs on the US northern neighbour, Trump began calling Canada the US's \"51st state\" with Carney as its \"governor\", and suggested he may try to acquire the country entirely. While the countries' relationship had been improving in recent months, Trump's push to take control of Greenland and his comments about Nato have put him at odds with Canadian and European leaders. Carney did not mention the president by name in his speech at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland this week, but he warned of a \"rupture\" in US-led world order, which seemed to anger Trump.\"Canada lives because of the United States,\" Trump said in his own address, which followed Carney's.Trump then on Friday withdrew Canada's invitation to join his newly constituted Board of Peace, which is being billed by the US as a new international organisation for resolving conflicts. At the same time, he blasted Canada in a social media post for being \"against The Golden Dome being built over Greenland\", referring to the anti-missile shield he has planned, and for \"doing business with China\".In discussing the deal with China, where Canada would ease tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and China would lower levies on Canadian agricultural products,  earlier this month, Carney told reporters that  \"the world has changed\" and progress made with China sets Canada up \"well for the new world order\".He added that Canada's relationship with China has become \"more predictable\" than its relationship with the US under the Trump administration.Experts told the BBC Canada's policy on China has undergone a significant shift, one that is shaped by ongoing uncertainty with the US, its largest trade partner.When he returned to office last year, Trump put new tariffs on goods from Canada, including a 35% tax on all items that don't fall under a free trade agreement between the two countries that is currently under mandatory review.Carney pushed back on Trump son Thursday saying that Canada and the US \"have built a remarkable partnership\" over many decades.\"But Canada doesn't live because of the United States,\" he said. \"Canada thrives because we are Canadians.\"",

    "body": "1 day agoFrank GardnerBBC Security CorrespondentPA MediaBlast walls, rocket attacks, Forward Operating Bases (FOBs), Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs)... and long queues in the canteen. Anyone who deployed to Afghanistan, in whatever role, between 2001-2021 will have their own vivid memories of that time. It started with the flight in – to Kandahar, Kabul or Camp Bastion. It could be a long, slow descent with the lights out on an RAF jet, or a rapid, corkscrew down in a C-130 transport plane. In both cases the aim was to avoid being blown out of the air by a Taliban surface-to-air missile.Over the course of 20 years thousands of servicemen and women, as well as civilians, from dozens of countries deployed to Afghanistan, answering the US call for assistance. That call came in the form of invoking Nato's Article 5 of its charter – the only time it has ever happened in Nato's 77-year history – which states that an attack on one member shall be deemed an attack on all.America was reeling from the devastating 9/11 attacks when al-Qaeda, which was being sheltered by the Taliban in Afghanistan, murdered nearly 3,000 people by flying packed airliners into New York's Twin Towers and the Pentagon in Washington.The Taliban were swiftly driven from power in a joint effort by the US military, the CIA and Afghanistan's Northern Alliance. Then it was all about trying to hunt down the remnants of al-Qaeda as Britain's Royal Marines, together with UK Special Forces, pursued them over the mountains but many escaped to safety to regroup in Pakistan. It was not until ten years later that the US Navy's Seal Team Six commandos tracked down the al-Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, in a villa in Abbottabad, Pakistan.The first two years of the US-led \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" as it was called, were relatively quiet. By late 2003, as America's attention switched to Iraq, US servicemen we met even started referring to Afghanistan as \"Op Forgotten\". But it was still dangerous. From a rain-soaked Kandahar airbase we watched Romanian troops edge nervously out on patrol in their Soviet-era armoured vehicles, wary of the next ambush. Flying into a remote US-manned firebase in the mountainous Paktika province in a Blackhawk helicopter, my BBC crew and I were told cheerfully: \"You've come to the worst place in the world\". Sure enough, the Taliban launched Chinese-made rockets at the base after dark, planted there, we were told, by farmers who had been either bribed or coerced into doing so.Everything changed after 2006, when the UK deployed in force to Helmand province, a part of Afghanistan that had been relatively peaceful until then. The Taliban made their intentions clear. If you come, they said, then we will fight you. And yet the UK government at the time appeared shocked at the ferocity of the fighting 3 Para now found themselves engaged in, with British paratroopers calling in mortar and artillery fire so close to their positions it was termed \"danger close\", in an effort to stop their bases from being overrun.Over the next eight years, until the end of combat operations in 2014, it was not just Americans who were risking life and limb to serve in Afghanistan. Brits, Canadians, Danes and Estonians were among those who saw the toughest fighting in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. It would also be churlish to ignore the bravery and sacrifice of so many Afghans who fought and died over two decades.I say \"fighting\" but most soldiers' biggest fears stemmed from the hidden IEDs, those expertly concealed Improvised Explosive Devices. The Taliban, who of course knew every inch of their terrain, were often able to guess correctly exactly where troops would need to cross an irrigation ditch or canal and so place the bomb accordingly. In the space of a split second, in a blinding flash and puff of black smoke, a fit, healthy, 20-something individual would have their life either ended or catastrophically changed, facing amputation and a host of other complications. So prevalent were these IEDs that soldiers were going out of the gates of their FOBs - Forward Operating Bases - on patrol praying that if they got hit it would result in a below-the-knee amputation, not one above the knee.The courage and resilience of the people I have met since, who have managed, despite terrible loss and adversity, to turn their shattered lives around, is both humbling and awe-inspiring. These are just some of the people who answered America's call for help after the 9/11 attacks. It is little wonder there has been such nationwide outrage at that country's president's suggestion that they somehow dodged the fighting.",

    "body": "20 hours agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseCanada's Arctic is a massive, treacherous, and largely inhospitable place, stretched out over nearly 4 million square kilometres of territory - but with a small population roughly equal to Blackburn in England or Syracuse, New York.\"You can take a map of continental Europe, put it on the Canadian Arctic, and there's room to spare,\" Pierre Leblanc, the former commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area told the BBC. \"And that environment is extremely dangerous.\"Standing at the defence of that massive landmass is an aging string of early warning radars, eight staffed military bases and about 100 full-time Coast Guard personnel covering 162,000km of coast, about 60% of Canada's total oceanfront.The Arctic region is the scene of intense geopolitical competition, bordered by Russia and the US on either side of the North Pole - and increasingly attractive to China, which has declared itself a \"near Arctic state\" and vastly expanded its fleet of naval vessels and icebreakers. Standing in the middle is Canada, whose population is a small fraction of the larger Arctic players. Nearly four years after Arctic security was thrust into the headlines following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the defence of Canada's far north has again been brought to the forefront of public consciousness by Donald Trump's designs on Greenland, a self-governing part of the Kingdom of Denmark that the White House says is vital to safeguarding the US from would-be enemies abroad.Canada's Arctic has not gone unnoticed by the Trump administration, which has reportedly become increasingly concerned by perceived vulnerabilities to US adversaries, and in April signed an executive order underscoring American \"commitment to ensuring both freedom of navigation and American domination in the Arctic waterways.\"The Canadian government, for its part, has sought to reassure the US and Nato allies that it is doing its part to protect the region.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Canada is working to secure \"our shared objectives of security and prosperity in the Arctic\" through \"unprecedented\" investments in radar systems, submarines, aircraft and \"boots on the ground\" in the region.Col Leblanc, who spent a total of nine years in the Canadian Arctic, said those investments have marked a \"major shift\" in Arctic security, noting that increases in Canadian defence expenditure  - from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035 - have meant \"real action\" in terms of additional over-the-horizon radar and aircraft dedicated to the Arctic.Much of this focus, he added, has been prompted by the Trump administration's renewed focus on the Arctic and Greenland.\"[That] certainly helps the Canadian government move in the right direction,\" Leblanc added. Still, challenges persist, including limited port facilities and difficulties resupplying far-flung bases that are sometimes thousands of cold, empty miles apart.While Canada and other US Nato allies have opposed the Trump's administration bid to \"take over\" Greenland to protect the Arctic, several experts who spoke to the BBC agreed with the administration's broad assessment that additional defences in the region are urgently needed.Troy Bouffard, the director of the Fairbanks, Alaska-based Center for Arctic Security and Resilience, said that while on-the-ground cooperation between the US and Canada in the Arctic \"remains the envy of the world\", much of the existing defence infrastructure was designed to combat Cold War-era threats, rather than existing ones.In particular, he warned of the prospect of hypersonic missiles that travel at least five times the speed of sound, making them much harder to detect and intercept than traditional ballistic missiles, which would follow predictable arcs over the North Pole.Such a threat is no longer theoretical. Russia has used hypersonic missiles in combat in Ukraine, including a January strike that saw the first operational use of the nuclear-capable \"Oreshnik\" missile that carries multiple warheads at approximately 10 times the speed of sound.\"That technology has changed everything for us. We have to relook at the entire North American defence system and re-do it,\" he said. \"What exists right now cannot defend against hypersonic cruise missiles, at all. Like 0%.\"Traditional ground-based radar systems, he added, \"are not going to work\" against these emerging technologies. Space-based satellites must also contend with coverage gaps in high latitudes, prompting a renewed focus and investments in over-the-horizon radar.Notably, over-the-horizon technology - along with space-based sensors - form a key part of the Trump administration's planned Golden Dome missile defence system for North America.For now, it is unclear what role Canada will play in the Golden Dome, a project Trump said at Davos Canada should \"be thankful for\".On Friday, Trump posted on Truth Social that Canada was opposed to having the Golden Dome over Greenland \"even though The Golden Dome would protect Canada. Instead, they voted in favor of doing business with China, who will 'eat them up' within the first year!\". The BBC has contacted Carney's office for comment.Those negotiations have been strained by the often antagonistic relationship between the US and Canada, with Trump in May posting that Canada could pay $61bn to join the programme or become the 51st US state and join for free.Trump's remarks prompted Canada's ambassador to the UN, Bob Rae, to compare it to a \"protection racket\". Despite tensions, Michael Byers, an expert in Arctic security at the University of British Columbia, said that American concerns over Arctic security, and their threats of tariffs, have helped prompt Canada's government to re-focus on the Arctic.\"Whether or not American concerns are justified, there is a feeling in Ottawa that we have to satisfy [them],\" he said. \"No one takes the 51st state issue seriously, but what we do take seriously are the economic pressures that the US is able to impose.\"\"The Canadian government is very aware of that possibility,\" he added.High level tensions between Ottawa and Washington, however, have yet to turn into tensions on-the-ground in the Arctic - with those there expressing confidence that the US and Canada are cooperating for the time being.\"That's the business of politicians,\" Bouffard said. \"It has complicated things, but the practitioners are still going to work together until they're not allowed to. Everyone's going to have to rise above the rhetoric.\"",

    "body": "Four attacks in 48 hours: How east Australia's beaches became a 'perfect storm' for sharks15 hours agoGavin ButlerGetty ImagesThere are manifold reasons why recorded shark encounters are rising in Australia's oceans - but fatalities are relatively rareIt's \"extraordinary\", says shark researcher Chris Pepin-Neff: four shark bites within 48 hours, and three of them within a 15km (9-mile) stretch of Australia's east coast.On 18 January, a 12-year-old boy was taken to hospital with critical injuries and later died after being attacked while swimming in Sydney Harbour. The next day, an 11-year-old's surfboard was bitten at Dee Why beach, hours before a man was attacked at nearby Manly and taken to hospital in critical condition.Then, on 20 January, a fourth surfer \"sustained a wound to his chest\" after a shark bit his board some 300km up the coast.\"This is the closest - in both proximity and in time - series of shark bites that I've ever seen in my 20 years of research,\" says Pepin-Neff, who is an associate professor of public policy at the University of Sydney.The succession of incidents caused alarm and dozens of beaches have been closed because of fears of more attacks. Calls for shark culls have gathered momentum.Experts, however, have cautioned against such measures, advocating instead for a greater awareness of shark behaviour and urging a rethink of humans' relationship to these fish.Many factors may have contributed to the recent series of incidents, they say – and the sharks are not the problem.Why suddenly so many shark attacks in Australia?Non-provoked shark attacks are usually precipitated by environmental conditions, attractants in the water, or both.The three recent incidents in Sydney - all of which are thought to have involved bull sharks – followed several days' worth of heavy rain, during which the city's official weather station recorded 127mm of downpour within 24 hours – its wettest January day in 38 years.That rainfall would have created \"perfect conditions\" for bull sharks, according to Rebecca Olive, senior research fellow at RMIT University.\"Bull sharks thrive in warm, brackish water, which most other sharks flee,\" she told the BBC. \"They love river mouths and estuaries, so the freshwater that flooded off the land following the recent rain events was perfect for them.\"Olive and other experts further note that this freshwater would have likely flushed sewage and nutrients into the sea, thus drawing in bait fish and, in turn, sharks.\"There's clearly an attractant in the water,\" Pepin-Neff says, suggesting that a \"perfect storm\" of low salinity freshwater could have created a \"biodiversity explosion\".\"The bait fish come to the surface, the bull sharks come to the surface, everybody's in the near shore area – and now we have a problem.\"Are shark attacks increasing overall?Official statistics show that shark bite incidents in Australia have gradually increased over the past 30 years – rising from around eight to 10 per year in the 1990s, to yearly averages in the mid-20s from the 2010s onwards.That doesn't mean sharks are becoming more aggressive, though. More likely is that the higher numbers reflect better data collection, as well as a number of compounding human factors.These include a growing coastal population, an increased uptake of water sports and thicker wetsuits that allow swimmers to stay in the ocean for longer.\"The number of total encounters is definitely much higher than it was, just because the population of people who go in the water and do all these things is really high,\" Pepin-Neff explains.They also point out, however, that the rate of shark bites \"doesn't tick up at the amount it should for the proportion of people who are going in the water and doing more things\".Getty ImagesDozens of beaches were closed amid the recent spate of attacks on Australia's east coastOlive echoes this point, noting that \"given how many people use the ocean each day, incidents and attacks are relatively uncommon, and fatalities are even less common\".If it seems as though sharks are becoming more prolific or dangerous, Olive suggests this may just be a result of them being more visible to members of the community – whether because of better reporting systems, the proliferation of drone footage or the outsized attention that shark encounters receive from the media.Pepin-Neff adds that broad, imprecise language around encounters is likely fuelling fears and distorting people's understanding of the risk.When shark sightings, encounters and bites all get conflated under the catchall umbrella of an \"attack\", the danger seems greater than it is.\"There is a problem in being able to meaningfully describe what happened without using the words 'shark attack',\" they explain. \"And that creates a more emotional community experience that is slightly different to what actually happened.\"Do shark culls work?In the wake of Sydney's recent flurry of shark attacks, heightened fears have reinvigorated calls for a cull. Typically, this would involve using nets or baited drumlines to catch and kill sharks near popular beaches.Experts reject the suggestion.\"I can understand when there are calls for culls in response [to an attack]... but I'm strongly opposed to culling sharks in order that we can maintain an illusion of safety while surfing or swimming in the ocean,\" says Olive.Pepin-Neff, meanwhile, stresses that scientific research does not support shark culls as an effective method of reducing the danger of an attack.\"It just doesn't work,\" they say. \"It makes politicians feel better, and it makes activists feel better, and it makes nobody in the water any safer.\"In cases of shark encounters, they add, the variable is not the sharks themselves, but rather the attractant that's drawing them to the area.\"It doesn't matter if you kill all the sharks in Sydney Harbor – if there's a shark up the coast and the attractant is still in the water, then the shark's going to come in.\"How can people avoid shark attacks?Both Olive and Pepin-Neff suggest that the best way to minimise risk is to be more conscious and wary of the factors that exacerbate the likelihood of a shark encounter. On an individual level, this might mean avoiding swimming and surfing after heavy rain. For councils it might mean creating more shark enclosures where people can swim safely.More broadly, however, they emphasise the need for beach-goers to adopt a less idyllic and more pragmatic attitude towards the ocean.\"In Australia we've got to treat the beach like the bush,\" says Pepin-Neff. \"Australians know how to navigate the wild. We just need to reinforce that the ocean is still the wild.\"This will require a rethink not only of our relationship with the water, they add, but also our relationship with sharks.\"This idea that the ocean is always safe but the sharks are always dangerous – it's the opposite,\" they say. \"The ocean is never safe, and the sharks are not always dangerous.\"We're in the way, not on the menu.\"",

    "body": "Trump covets mineral-rich Greenland, but what natural resources does it actually have?1 day agoArchie MitchellandDanielle Kaye,Business reportersGetty ImagesDonald Trump has made clear he covets Greenland.Now he claims to have secured the \"framework\" of a future deal, to address defence on the island - a deal that he says includes rights to rare earth minerals.So what natural resources does Greenland have?Greenland is believed to sit on top of large reserves of oil and natural gas.It is also said to be home to the vast majority of raw materials considered crucial for electronics, green energy and other strategic and military technologies – to which Trump has been pushing to secure America's access.Overall, 25 of 34 minerals deemed \"critical raw materials\" by the European Commission are found in Greenland, including graphite, niobium and titanium, according to the 2023 Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.Greenland's strategic importance is \"not just about defence\", Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said at a Senate hearing last year about the potential acquisition of Greenland, pointing to the island's \"vast reserves of rare earth elements\".Trump has sometimes downplayed the importance of those resources, pointing to what he claims is rising Russian and Chinese influence in the region to justify his claims that the US has to \"have\" the island.\"I want Greenland for security - I don't want it for anything else,\" he told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, pointing in part to the difficulty of exploring in the Arctic region. \"You have to go 25ft down through ice to get it. It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\"But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority.   Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is \"primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access\", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic.Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority.\"This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,\" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year.And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a \"business president\" who believed the island represented \"a more robust trading opportunity\".Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China.Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to \"shift the dial\" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration.But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done.Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said.While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland.\"Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,\" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.\"It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals.\"But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff.\"Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,\" he told the BBC.\"With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect.\"Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, \"it's all still about potential\". Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. \"His logic is that there's a national security imperative,\" Spence said. \"My belief is that this is much more economically driven.\"Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman",

Vizsla Silver Corp said it had been informed by family members of some of the kidnapped workers that their relatives were found deceased.The mining firm says it is \"awaiting confirmation from the Mexican authorities and will provide further updates as appropriate.\"\"We are devastated by this outcome and the tragic loss of life,\" Vizsla president and CEO Michael Konnert said. Konnert offered condolences to the families of the dead, and said \"our focus remains on the safe recovery of those who remain missing\".One family member told CBC News that he identified the body of his 43-year-old brother on Sunday. He said his brother, José Manuel Castañeda Hernández, worked as a geologist. \"In truth, this has been very painful to be here, in a place where we don't want to be,\" his brother Jaime Castañeda told CBC, adding later: \"There's no justice with what's happening.\"",

Attempts by Kim to defuse the outrage with an apology a day after the town hall appear to have failed.The town hall had been called to discuss a potential merger between the province where Jindo County is located and a nearby city - something regions with shrinking  populations are looking at for administrative reasons.Kim said his comment had been intended to highlight population issues in rural regions but admitted the language he had used was \"inappropriate\", local media reported.South Jeolla Province also issued a formal apology for Kim's \"inappropriate remarks\", which it said \"has caused deep pain to Vietnamese people and to women\", local media reported.The Vietnamese Embassy in Seoul had condemned Kim's remarks, saying in a statement on Facebook that his words were \"not simply a matter of expression but a matter of values and attitudes towards migrant women and minority groups\".Sri Lanka authorities have not publicly addressed the controversy.The Democratic Party's Supreme Council had voted unanimously to expel Kim, a party spokesperson told reporters on Monday.Meanwhile, activists for women and migrant rights are reportedly planning to hold a rally in front of Jindo County Office on Tuesday over Kim's comments.",

    "body": "Fifteen killed in latest Lebanon building collapse, as warnings of neglect grow16 hours agoSamantha GranvilleBeirutReutersAll residents have been accounted for but officials have warned other people could still be missingThe death toll from the collapse of two residential buildings in the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli has risen to 15, state media say.Eight people were rescued alive, Civil Defence director general Imad Khreiss said.Khreiss said the two adjoining buildings were home to 22 residents, but local municipal authorities warned people could still be missing.Social media footage captured the moment the buildings collapsed, with one side giving way at the lower floors before both structures fell almost simultaneously.The latest disaster is the fifth residential building collapse in Tripoli this winter, highlighting growing concerns over old and undermaintained buildings in Lebanon's poorest city.The footage shows a thick cloud of dust and debris engulfing the street as the buildings folded in on one another.After the collapse, large crowds gathered around the site of a crater where the buildings had stood.Tripoli's mayor, Abdel Hamid Karimeh, said the city had suffered long-term dereliction.\"Thousands of our people in Tripoli are threatened due to years of neglect,\" he said. \"The situation is beyond the capabilities of the Tripoli municipality.\"He later announced he had submitted his resignation to the interior minister, describing Tripoli as \"disaster-stricken.\"President Joseph Aoun said he was \"monitoring developments\" and called on rescue workers across the country to mobilise. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam described the buildings collapse as a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" and said the government was ready to help.\"The government is fully prepared to provide accommodation for all residents of buildings that need to be evacuated,\" he said, adding that the disaster was the \"results of years of accumulated neglect\".The collapse comes days after residents were evacuated from a nearby building following structural cracking, and two weeks after another deadly collapse, where a father and daughter were killed.Tripoli is Lebanon's second-largest city and has seen repeated building failures amid years of economic crisis, lack of maintenance, and weak regulation.Last month, the head of the Higher Relief Authority said more than 100 buildings in the city required evacuation warnings.Many residential blocks across Lebanon were built illegally or without permits, especially during the 1975-1990 civil war, while others have been expanded with additional floors without proper oversight, authorities say, leaving thousands at risk, especially during the cold and wet winter months.In a statement, the national syndicate for property owners said the collapse was the result of \"blatant negligence and shortcomings of the Lebanese state toward the safety of citizens and their housing security,\" and urged the government to carry out a nationwide assessment of buildings at risk of collapse.",

    "body": "13 hours agoYang TianGetty ImagesVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado said her opposition colleague Juan Pablo Guanipa has been kidnapped just hours after being released from detention.The Nobel Peace Prize winner said on Sunday that Guanipa, leader of the Justice First party, was taken in the Los Chorros neighbourhood of the capital, Caracas.\"Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,\" she wrote on social media early on Monday. A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and was among several political prisoners released since the US seized Venezuela's then-president Nicolás Maduro in January.Guanipa's centre-right party said he had been kidnapped by the \"repressive forces of the dictatorship\" while he was moving between locations.They added that those accompanying him said weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.\"We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,\" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively. The party also called on the international community to demand the \"immediate release\" of Guanipa and an end to the Venezuelan government's \"persecution of the opposition\".Another key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, demanded proof of life, saying on X that the \"absence of information\" on Guanipa's whereabouts \"constitutes a forced disappearance\".Just hours earlier, Guanipa's son Ramón was celebrating his father's release on social media: \"Our entire family will be able to hug again soon.\" He subsequently posted a video online, in which he demanded immediate proof that his father was still alive.\"I hold the regime responsible for anything that happens to my father. Enough of this repression,\" Ramón Guanipa said in the video.Guanipa was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in Venezuela.The leader of the Justice First party, he was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017 but was barred from taking office after he refused to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.Guanipa went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.He was tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025. Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.",

    "body": "3 hours agoNardine SaadAFP via Getty ImagesThe Gordie Howe International Bridge will connect southern Detroit, Michigan, USA, and Windsor, Ontario, Canada when completedPresident Donald Trump has threatened to block the opening of a bridge connecting the US and Canada until Washington is \"fully compensated for everything\" it has given to its northern neighbour.The Gordie Howe International Bridge, connecting the Canadian province of Ontario to the US state of Michigan, would not open until Ottawa \"treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve\", Trump wrote on social media.According to the project's website, the bridge is being funded by the Canadian government but will be publicly owned by both Canada and Michigan.It is not clear how Trump could block its opening but he said negotiations would begin immediately, without elaborating.Spanning the Detroit River, the bridge is expected to open to traffic pending formal tests and approvals in early 2026. Construction began in 2018, but the project has been a point of contention between the countries for more than a decade.It is estimated to have cost $6.4bn CAD (£3.4bn), according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In the statement on his Truth Social platform, Trump said that the US should own \"at least one half of this asset\". He also suggested that Canada owned both the Canadian and US sides of the bridge.The organisation developing the bridge, the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, is wholly owned by the Canadian government, according to the project's website.Trump wrote: \"The Canadian Government expects me, as President of the United States, to PERMIT them to just 'take advantage of America!'\"\"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" he added.The Moroun family - the American owners of the neighbouring Ambassador Bridge that also connects Detroit to Canada - appealed to Trump during his first term to stop construction of the new bridge, arguing that it infringed on their exclusive ability to collect tolls. In response, Trump and then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued a joint statement saying the bridge was a \"vital economic link\" between the countries. Trump on Monday pointed to recent trade disputes between the two countries, saying that \"the Tariffs Canada charges us for our Dairy products have, for many years, been unacceptable\". Trump continued: \"The first thing China will do is terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada, and permanently eliminate The Stanley Cup.\"Canada's bridge authority, the Ontario premier's office and the Detroit mayor's office did not immediately response to requests for comment.

    "body": "8 hours agoTom McArthurLev Radin/Pacific Press/LightRocket via Getty ImagesPolice in Norway have opened an investigation into a high-profile diplomat and her husband over their links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Mona Juul resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq on Sunday, days after she was suspended following Norwegian media reports that each of her children would receive $5m (£3.6m) in a will allegedly signed by Epstein days before he died.Emails released in the so-called Epstein files also appear to show that Juul's husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, had dinner with Epstein in Paris in June 2019, weeks before Epstein's arrest in the US on sex trafficking charges.Juul's lawyer has said she \"does not recognise the accusations made against her\" and Rød-Larsen's lawyer said he is confident the investigation will clarify \"there is no basis for criminal liability\".Appearing in the files is not an indication of wrongdoing.Norway's foreign ministry has said Juul's contact with Epstein revealed a \"serious lapse in judgement\".An \"aggravated corruption\" inquiry has been launched by the Norwegian economic crime unit Økokrim, police announced on Monday.\"Økokrim will, among other things, investigate whether benefits were received in connection with her position,\" police said in a statement, referring to Juul.A property in Oslo has been searched in connection with the investigation.Juul and Rød-Larsen were part of a small group of diplomats that negotiated the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, which at the time were seen as a breakthrough in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.Norwegian media reports Rød-Larsen had extensive communication with Epstein and arranged to meet him with Juul more than once.The wider Epstein documents, released by the US Department of Justice last month, contain millions of private emails, images and FBI reports into the late sex offender - who died in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.Juul is the latest prominent public figure from the Nordic country to be drawn into the widening scandal surrounding the contents of the files, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, and chief executive of the World Economic Forum (WEF), Borge Brende.The WEF ordered an independent review into Brende – who also served as the Norwegian foreign minister - over his interactions with the paedophile.Brende has acknowledged dining with Epstein three times in 2018 and 2019 and communicating with him by email and text. He said he welcomes the WEF's decision to launch a review.Correction 9 February: An earlier version of this article carried a picture of Danish politician Mona Juul, who is not the subject of this story.",

    "body": "16 hours agoJack BurgessWorld Without ExploitationSurvivors appeared in the advert with black redaction marks over their mouthsSurvivors of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have appeared in an advert calling for the release of more files related to him.In the 40 second video from the World Without Exploitation group, released in the US on Super Bowl Sunday, survivors held up photographs of their younger selves and said \"we all deserve the truth\".The US Department of Justice (DOJ) was required by law to make all the files public in December last year. However, only some have been released - many with redactions.The DOJ said files not published were either unrelated, duplicates, or had been withheld under deliberative process or attorney-client privilege, or because they depicted violence.Deliberative process privilege allows US government agencies to withhold documents which reflect decision-making processes, while attorney-client privilege is intended to protect the confidentiality of communications between lawyers and clients.Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche said last month that the most recent release of material, on 30 January, \"marks the end of a very comprehensive document identification and review process\".Blanche also said there was a \"built in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about that we're covering up or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute\", before adding \"that is not the case\".Sunday's advert featuring the survivors began with a text slate on screen that said: \"On November 19, 2025, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was signed into law.\" It continued with a statement that said: \"3 MILLION FILES Still Have Not Been Released.\"The survivors appeared with black redaction marks over their mouths, addressed the camera directly and each said \"we're standing together\". The advert concluded with a call for people to \"stand with us\" and \"Tell Attorney General Pam Bondi IT'S TIME FOR THE TRUTH\".While the video was released on the day of the Super Bowl it was not aired on television during the match, which traditionally has the largest television audience in the US.The group told the Reuters news agency it could not afford to air a commercial during the game, noting that a 30-second Super Bowl advertisement can cost \"more than $8 million (£5.9m)\".The DOJ's release of documents has shed light on the disgraced financier's close association with many prominent people. However, the justice department has faced heavy scrutiny after missing the 19 December deadline to release all files as mandated in the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed Congress and was signed into law in November.Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is scheduled to appear before the congressional committee investigating the federal government's handling of the Epstein files on Monday.She has agreed to testify under oath but her legal team previously said she would decline to answer questions under her constitutional right to remain silent unless she is granted legal immunity.",

    "body": "US to exempt some Bangladeshi clothes from tariffs2 hours agoOsmond ChiaBusiness reporterGetty ImagesBangladesh is a major producer of clothesBangladesh has secured exemptions for some clothes and textiles that are made with US-produced materials, as part of a new agreement announced on Monday.As part of the deal, Washington will also cut its tariffs on Bangladesh from 20% to 19%, in exchange for Dhaka to open its markets to a wider range of American goods.The apparel industry forms the backbone of Bangladesh, which is the world's second largest exporter of clothes after China.The South Asian country has been in long-drawn talks with the White House after President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on global trading partners in April last year.The White House said in a joint statement between the sides that the agreement will strengthen the countries' economic ties and offer both \"unprecedented access\" to each market.It said the US will lower its tariff rate on Bangladesh and will also identify certain clothing and textile goods from the country to enter the US free of tariffs. The goods include those produced with American cotton and man-made textiles, the statement said. The volume of these will be determined by how much textiles the US exports to Bangladesh. The clothing sector accounts for more than 80% of Bangladesh's total export revenue and employs around four million workers.In exchange, Bangladesh has agreed to provide \"significant preferential market access\" to a host of American agricultural and industrial goods. These include opening up its markets to more US chemicals, medical devices, car parts, soy products and meat, said the White House.The BBC has contacted the Bangladeshi government for comment.As part of the agreement announced on Monday, Dhaka will recognise American food and drug and vehicle safety and emission rules, making it easier for US goods to enter the country.Bangladesh also committed to observe internationally recognised labour rights, ramp up its environmental protection efforts, and uphold its agreement to buy billions of dollars of American agriculture, aircraft and energy products, according to the statement.Bangladesh is set to head to the polls on Thursday for general elections.The country has been led by an interim government since 2024, when former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India after being ousted over the fatal crackdown on student-led protests.The US's newly announced tariff cut puts Bangladesh nearly level with its neighbour and regional competitor India, which faces an 18% levy from the US.Both South Asian countries compete to export clothes, footwear, along with agricultural goods.India was initially hit with 25% US levies when Trump announced his first round of reciprocal tariffs in April 2025. Bangladesh, on the other hand, was given a 37% tariff.",

    "body": "'We are at an hour of desperation' - Savannah Guthrie pleads for help for missing mother4 hours agoMax MatzaWatch: \"We are at an hour of desperation\", says Guthrie in new plea for missing motherUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie issued a fresh plea for help just hours before the reported ransom deadline for her mother's safe return passed on Monday.\"We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help,\" she says in the video posted on Instagram.Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, and was last seen on 31 January. Authorities believe she was taken against her will. The FBI is offering a $50,000 (£36,000) reward for information. The Monday deadline of 17:00 local time (00:00 GMT) has since passed, and the FBI says they are not aware of \"any continued communication between the Guthrie family and suspected kidnappers\".ReutersA previous alleged deadline for ransom, which is meant to be paid in Bitcoin, passed on  5 February. Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing when she did not attend a Sunday church service on 1 February and other members grew concerned.The family has released three previous videos saying they were willing to speak to the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.The family had earlier indicated that they would be willing to pay for her safe return.\"I just want to share a few thoughts as we enter another week of this nightmare,\" Guthrie says, appearing alone in the latest video, in contrast to previous recordings where she has appeared with her siblings.   \"She was taken, and we don't know where. And we need your help,\" Guthrie says.She thanks the public for their prayers, saying that her mother is also feeling them \"even in this darkest place\".She requests people everywhere, \"even if you're far from Tucson\", to report anything suspicious that could lead to clues about her mother.She asks, \"if you see anything, if you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement\".Investigators say that no suspects, persons of interest or vehicles had been identified in the case.In an update just before Monday's deadline, the Pima County Sheriff's Office said it did not have any new information to release publicly. The sheriff's statement added that the \"investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains active and ongoing\", and that \"the FBI is handling all aspects related to any ransom note(s) or communications involving the Guthrie family\".The FBI also released a statement, saying that FBI agents from around the country \"continue to deploy to Tucson\".\"We are currently operating a 24-hour command post that includes crisis management experts, analytic support, and investigative teams. But we still need the public's help,\" the FBI statement added, including the number for the FBI's tip line.'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's new message about missing motherAt a news briefing last week, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing a ransom note sent to several media outlets.The note gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday.On Monday, FBI Director Kash Patel arrived in Tucson, on a trip that was scheduled prior to Guthrie's disappearance.

The boat was carrying migrants and refugees from various African countries, it said.The boat sank after taking on water approximately six hours after departing from the coastal city of al-Zawiya in north-western Libya.The IOM says that almost 500 migrants have been reported dead or missing trying the cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya so far in 2026.Libya has become a staging point for migrants from sub-Saharan Africa seeking to reach Europe since long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi was killed in 2011.Survivors told IOM that the rubber dinghy had departed at around 23:00 local time from al-Zawiya, west of Tripoli. It overturned several hours later in the early hours of Friday north of Zuwara.It is not immediately clear why it has taken so long for the news to emerge.One of the two survivors said she had lost her husband, while the other reported that her two babies had died, the agency said. IOM teams provided both women with emergency medical care.IOM says at least 375 migrants were reported dead or missing in January alone after a series of \"invisible\" shipwrecks in the central Mediterranean during periods of extreme winter weather. The true toll is feared to be higher.Despite the repeated tragedies, migrants continue to attempt the crossing. IOM says traffickers and smuggling networks profit by forcing people onto overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels, contributing to the mounting death toll.The agency has urged stronger international cooperation to dismantle smuggling and trafficking networks, alongside the creation of safe and legal migration pathways to reduce deaths at sea.Many vessels that sink are never reported by the people smugglers who operate them. Those who die simply vanish, their families left without ever knowing what happened to them.Several countries, including the UK, Spain, Norway and Sierra Leone, have called on Libya to shut down detention centres where rights groups say migrants have been tortured, abused or killed.More about migrants from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "19 hours agoDamian ZaneBBCThere are fears that a conflict between Ethiopia and Eritrea could break out once againEritrea has hit back at its neighbour Ethiopia describing accusations that its troops were on Ethiopian territory as \"false\".On Saturday, a letter sent from Ethiopia's foreign minister to his Eritrean counterpart demanded that the soldiers withdraw.It also accused Eritrea of \"outright aggression\" saying it was conducting joint manoeuvres with Ethiopian rebels in the north and supplying them with weapons. In its response Eritrea said this was part of a \"spiral of hostile campaigns against Eritrea for more than two years\".There has long been a history of tension between Ethiopia and Eritrea, which split off from its larger neighbour three decades ago, and there are fears of a renewed conflict.The countries fought a border war between 1998-2000 in which more than 100,000 people died. A peace deal was never fully implemented and relations only eased after Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who later won the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts, travelled to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, in 2018.The two had been allies in Ethiopia's recent civil war when Eritrea supported its army against Tigrayan forces, but things have once again soured.\"Developments over the last few days indicate that the Government of Eritrea has chosen the path of further escalation,\" Ethiopia Foreign Minister Gedion Timothewos's letter alleged.\"The incursion of Eritrean troops further into Ethiopian territory in our north-eastern borders and the joint military manoeuvres being carried out by Eritrean forces with rebel groups in our north-western borders are not just provocations but acts of outright aggression.\"One of the points of tension is the call from landlocked Ethiopia for access to the sea, which Abiy has described as an existential matter. He said that losing a port as a result of Eritrean independence was a \"mistake\".In his letter, the foreign minister said that if Eritrea's soldiers withdraw then the two countries could start talks including over \"the issue of access to the sea through the port of Assab\".In its response, Eritrea's information ministry said the \"patently false and fabricated accusations... [were] astounding in its tone and substance, underlying motivation, and overarching objective.\"As underlined before, the Government of Eritrea has no appetite for, or desire to, engage in meaningless acrimony to add fuel and exacerbate the situation.\"Last week, in a further sign of deteriorating relations, Abiy said for the first time that during to the 2020-2022 civil war in Tigray Eritrean troops had massacred people in the Ethiopian city Aksum. These were allegations Eritrea had previously denied following reports of mass killings that took place in the historic city in November 2020.In shifting alliances, Ethiopia now says that Eritrea is supporting rebels in Tigray who oppose the peace deal that ended the civil war. Eritrea denied the allegation and accused Ethiopia of \"floating false flags to justify the war that it has been itching to unleash for two long years\".More about Ethiopia from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

    "body": "Japan has given Takaichi a landslide win - but can she bring back the economy? 6 hours agoSuranjana TewariAsia Business CorrespondentAnadolu via Getty ImagesJapan's prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, rolled the dice on a snap election - and it paid off. She and her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) have the kind of decisive majority - 316 out of 465 seats - that few leaders have enjoyed recently. Rather, Japan has had a revolving door of prime ministers.Now the question is what Takaichi does with it. Can she deliver what has eluded the Japanese economy for decades: faster growth?Japan has a long list of problems: sluggish growth, public debt that is the largest in the world, and a working population that is both ageing and shrinking.Takaichi, some observers believe, has the chance to change this, reshaping how Japan runs what is the world's fourth-largest economy - and how the markets see it.  She will steer Japan in the right direction, says Tomohiko Taniguchi, a policy adviser and former speechwriter for late prime minister Shinzo Abe.  \"If successful, it will serve as a premier case study for ageing societies worldwide.\"Where will the money come from?Takaichi had campaigned on the promise that she will spend more, including investment in key industries, to boost growth.  This was a pivot from her predecessors. She vowed to cut taxes so people can spend more, and said growth rather than savings was the priority. But markets were rattled with doubt over how she would fund these plans. Her overwhelming majority seems to have assured investors - and it showed in the positive market reaction to her Sunday night win. Investors have been placing what they call the \"Takaichi trade\", buying Japanese shares while selling the yen and government debt. Crucially, the yen has also gone up in value - for some investors, a stronger currency is a good thing. Getty ImagesMarkets have cheered Sanae Takaichi's winBut it's more complicated than that. When Takaichi came into office in October, government bond yields - effectively the interest Japan pays to borrow money - jumped. That's a major concern for investors because of Japan's steep public debt. More spending and lower taxes - which Takaichi has been promising - means the government needs to borrow more money. Japan's bond market is one of the largest in the world, so even small changes in Tokyo can ripple across global markets, affecting borrowing costs, investment decisions, and currencies.Investors are also watching interest rates because the Bank of Japan is trying to move away from decades of ultra-low rates to control inflation. The cost of rice, for example, doubled in 2025. Rising prices are a shock for a country that has become accustomed to stable or falling prices.This was central to the message that powered Takaichi's rise: voters feel poorer and prices feel higher. After all, it was one of the issues that cost her predecessor his job. Takaichi's proposed tax cuts may ease the pain for households in the short term.But Keiichiro Kobayashi, professor of economics at Keio University, warns that this is a dangerous path: \"An increase in spending would just stimulate inflation and increase the cost of living.\"Instead, he says, the government should allow the Bank of Japan to continue raising interest rates to fight inflation, while tightening government spending, which would also satisfy investors. Because Japan is less attractive to foreign investors when interest rates are low and government spending is high, that reduces demand for the currency and weakens it.A weaker yen pushes up the cost of imports, especially energy and food, but it can help exporters competing with cheaper Chinese goods. It's an incredibly delicate balancing act that Takaichi cannot escape if she wants the growth she has promised.  But the challenges go beyond markets.   A missing piece of the puzzleEPAJapan has an ageing population, but is resistant to foreign workers Japan's population - and its workforce - has been shrinking for years. It is now one of the oldest societies in the world, putting immense pressure on public services such as healthcare and social care.It is already facing acute labour shortages in construction, care work, agriculture and hospitality. Fewer workers mean less output and, therefore, weaker growth. Immigration could ease this strain. Official data shows the government has quietly relaxed some rules in recent years and the number of foreign workers has risen. But there are still far fewer foreign workers in Japan compared to Europe or North America.Takaichi has signalled she is unlikely to do much to change this because immigration is hugely sensitive, especially among her conservative base.She and her allies say Japan should instead lean on technology, automation and higher participation by women and older workers to lift productivity.Economists warn that may not be enough. Japan still needs more foreign workers - just as other advanced economies have long relied on them to keep their economies running.Observers say the resistance to immigration is also part of a wider reluctance to change, which has stood in the way of innovation and reforms in the past.  What about China? But Japan needs to change - and fast, because China has already overtaken it in scale and industrial capacity, while Vietnam and other Asian economies are catching up.Beijing is also Tokyo's biggest trading partner. And that is important for Takaichi's plan because a rebound of domestic demand will take time - until then Japan will have to rely on trade to boost growth.But ongoing tensions with Beijing, including a dispute over rare earth exports,  have exposed Japan's vulnerability in strategic supply chains. These tensions could unsettle production in electric vehicles and defence equipment too, says Naoki Hattori, chief Japan economist at Mizuho. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Takaichi has made reducing Japan's dependence on China in critical sectors like rare minerals and pharmaceuticals a priority. She has also been actively courting Trump, agreeing to raise the defence budget, a contentious move under Japan's pacifist constitution.  She has thanked Trump for his \"warm words\" endorsing her, saying she looked forward to visiting the White House this spring and that \"the potential of our Alliance is LIMITLESS\".Takaichi rejects \"equidistance\" between the US and China, seeing the alliance with Washington as central to Japan's security and economic resilience, says Taniguchi. But Japan cannot afford to choose sides outright.Prof Kobayashi says that deepening ties with both powers is prudent, particularly as China's property crisis and slowing domestic growth could reshape Beijing's influence in the region.Takaichi's approach seems to follow the playbook of her mentor, Shinzo Abe: big spending to stimulate growth and low interest rates to support investment.Abe was dealing with falling prices, a stronger yen, and a far less powerful China.Takaichi's challenges are graver: Japan is older, its economy is still growing too slowly and the world is in a very different place.",

    "body": "12 hours agoFarzad SeifikaranBBC News PersianMamlekateVerified images showing weaponry used by security forces against protesters Warning: The following story contains graphic details of violence which some readers might find upsetting.A BBC News Persian analysis of hundreds of videos and photographs taken during recent protests in Iran confirms the security forces' use of a wide range of weaponry, including machine guns, snipier rifles and shotguns.Protesters were reportedly killed in many of the more than 200 cities where protests had been recorded. While the exact death toll remains unclear, the level of brutality and the deployment of lethal weaponry evidenced in pictures, witness accounts and reports by human rights groups and the media show thousands have been killed across the country.The crackdown on protests  - which began over the economy but rapidly escalated - employed a level of violence unprecedented in modern Iranian history.\"This is the largest mass killing in contemporary Iranian history and one of the largest in the world,\" Payam Akhavan, an Iranian Canadian former UN prosecutor at the International Criminal Court, in The Hague, told BBC News Persian.The Iranian government has blamed the killings on \"rioters and terrorists\".But BBC News Persian analysis shows security forces used a number of different weapons on protesters, including:machine gunssniper riflesassault riflesshotgunshandgunspellet-firing paintball gunstear gasmachetesknivesbatonslarge wooden clubsgreen laser sights and pointers (for blinding and targeting)Machine gunsVahid Online / Fars News AgencyBBC News Persian cross-referenced photographs of Tehran's Sadeghiyeh Square with those of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard CorpsFootage from cities such as Tehran, Isfahan, Yazdanshahr, and Shahsavar, verified by BBC News Persian, shows both heavy - such as the DShK - and medium - such as the PK - machine guns mounted on military pickup trucks.The security forces reportedly used these for crowd control and to impose a state of siege.The Vahid Online Telegram channel shared two photographs of a black pickup truck with a machine gun mounted in the back in Tehran's Sadeghiyeh Square on the night of 8 January.BBC News Persian cross-referenced these with photos, published by Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency, of a 2025 military parade, showing nearly identical Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) pickups equipped with the same weapon. Weapons expert Amael Kotlarski, of Janes defence-intelligence company, has identified it as the DShKM model, produced under licence in Iran.Iran InternationalA video of protests in Yazdanshahr shows the muzzle fire of a machine gun mounted on the back of a pickup truckA video of the 9 January protests in Yazdanshahr, published by the Iran International television network, clearly shows protesters coming under sustained machine-gun fire. The gun's massive muzzle fire is visible at the 46-second mark.A representative of Thames Valley Guns, a UK-based company specialising in the expert analysis of military firearms, also told BBC News Persian vehicles equipped with DShK machine guns could be seen in the videos of the protests.MamlekateIn one verified video, someone displays spent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and a 20mm automatic cannon round, saying security forces had fired them at protestersIn one verified video, someone displays two spent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifle and one large spent shell, explaining security forces had fired them at protesters in Tehran's Behesht Square.Thames Valley Guns confirmed the large black projectile was a 20mm automatic cannon round designed to be used against military hardware. And rifling marks on its driving band confirm it had been fired.\"Ammunition of this nature is intended to defeat structures, vehicles and hardened targets, including lightly armoured personnel carriers,\" the representative said.\"They are not engineered for use against personnel, though the consequences of such a strike on a human would be catastrophic.\"Sniper riflesObtained by BBC News PersianA video from the city of Mashhad, verified by BBC News Persian, shows figures in IRGC-style uniform, on a rooftop, with a Dragunov sniper rifleWitnesses have told BBC News Persian sniper rifles were widely used during the January protests and this is confirmed by the verified footage.One of the videos verified by BBC News Persian, of the 9 January protests in the north-eastern city of Mashhad, shows two figures in black tactical uniforms of the type worn by several branches of the security forces, including the IRGC, on a hotel rooftop. And one of them has a Dragunov sniper rifle (SVD) leaning against a wall next to him.In an interview with Iranian state television, a forensic expert confirmed snipers had killed protesters. On 8 January, a relative of Ebrahim Pourahmadian, from Saqqez, in the western province of Kurdistan, who was in Tehran, working as the caretaker of a building, told BBC News Persian a sniper had shot him in the head, right in front of his child. And photographs obtained by BBC News News Persian of Pourahmadian's body confirm a single precision gunshot wound, in the middle of his forehead.The Thames Valley Guns representative explained the profound psychological impact of a well positioned sniper. \"For untrained civilians, the effect is even more severe,\" the representative said. \"Most people have no understanding of how to respond to a distant, unseen threat — and the resulting fear certainly triggers mass panic.\"Assault riflesSpent cartridge casings from a Kalashnikov-type assault rifle were found on the streetsThe Kalashnikov assault rifle is the standard-issue weapon for all military and law-enforcement branches in Iran. And BBC News Persian has analysed numerous videos showing members of both the police and the IRGC using using AK-47 Kalashnikovs and the Iranian-produced KL variants.One, from the northern city of Amol, on 9 January, shows a security officer aiming and firing a Kalashnikov directly at protesters. And after analysing exclusive images obtained by BBC News Persian of spent casings recovered from the streets, Kotlarski confirmed they were 7.62x39mm rounds - the specific calibre for Kalashnikov-type rifles.ShotgunsVahid OnlineVerified footage from Abadan, western Iran, on 7 January, shows police officers with shotguns deployed on streets during protestsBBC News Persian's investigation confirms the extensive use of shotguns.Verified footage from the western city of Lordegan, on 1 January, and Abadan, also in the west, on 7 January, shows police officers with shotguns deployed on streets during protests. And Kotlarski identified several models, including the Iranian-made Maher shotgun in both standard and short-barrelled configurations.Obtained by BBC News PersianAn exclusive CT-scan image obtained by BBC News Persian shows a metal pellet embedded in a Mashad protester's right eyeball​​As we saw during the crackdown on the 2022 Woman, Life, Freedom protests, the widespread use of shotguns in January resulted in the killing of many protesters and left hundreds, if not thousands, more with permanent eye injuries.Between 9 and 10 January, about 1,000 patients needing emergency surgery for ruptured eyeballs caused by metal pellets arrived at a single eye hospital alone, its head, Dr Ghasem Fakhraei, told the semi-official Iranian Students' News Agency. And BBC News Persian has obtained CT scans and medical records of several wounded protesters from Mashhad, one of which clearly shows a metal pellet embedded in the eye tissue.HandgunsIn two videos from Kermanshah, on 8 January, plainclothes security forces agents are seen wielding at least two types of pistols, which, analysts suggest, resemble the Beretta Model 50 or CZ 75.MachetesVahid OnlineCCTV footage from Tehran shows a plainclothes security agent wielding a machete attacking a female protester, on 8 JanuaryNumerous protesters have told BBC News Persian they were attacked with knives and machetes. Photographs obtained by BBC News Persian of the bodies also reveal machete as well as bullet woundsCCTV footage from Tehran clearly shows plainclothes agents attacking protesters seeking refuge in a block of flats with machetes. Another video from the capital, on 8 January, shows a plainclothes officer hitting a female protester in the head with a machete. Several other security personnel in military uniforms are also visible.BatonsVideos and interviews carried out by BBC News Persianwith the survivors show people being beaten with batons. BBC News Persian verified that one protester, Saghar Seifollahi Fars, was killed in this way and another, Ali Taherkhani, who was first shot, died not because of bullet wounds but from being beaten afterwards by batons and gun butts.",

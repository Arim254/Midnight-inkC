    "body": "18 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykReutersA South Korean cryptocurrency exchange accidentally gave away more than $40bn (£32bn) worth of bitcoin to customers, briefly making them multi-millionaires.It had planned to give customers a small cash reward of 2,000 won - $1,37 - but instead gave them 2,000 bitcoins on Friday.The platform, Bithumb, apologised for the error, adding that it quickly had realised its mistake and recovered almost all the missing tokens. It said it had restricted trading and withdrawals for the 695 affected customers within 35 minutes of the glitch.The company said it had recovered 99.7% of the 620,000 bitcoins mistakenly sent. \"We want to make it clear that this matter has nothing to do with external hacking or security breaches, and there is no problem with system security or customer asset management,\" Bithumb said in a statement on Friday. In an emergency meeting on Saturday, South Korea's financial regulator said it would look into the incident. Any sign of illegal activity would prompt formal investigations, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS).Bithumb vowed to co-operate with regulators. \"[We] will take this accident as a lesson and prioritise 'customer trust and peace of mind' rather than external growth,\" CEO Lee Jae-won said. The company plans to  pay 20,000 won ($13,66) in compensation to all customers who were using the platform at the time, and will waive trading fees, among other measures.Bithumb said it would improve verification systems and introduce AI to detect abnormal transactions.The incident is likely to spark discussion around tighter regulatory controls in finance. In April 2024 Citigroup, a US bank, mistakenly credited $81 trillion, instead of $280, to a customer's account. Two employees failed to spot the error before it was processed, but the bank reversed the transaction within hours after a third employee caught the mistake, the Financial Times reported.",

    "body": "14 hours agoIan AikmanReutersThousands gathered in Islamabad to mourn the 32 victims of Friday's attackFour people have been arrested on suspicion of facilitating a suicide bombing that killed more than 30 people on Friday, Pakistan's interior minister has said.Mohsin Naqvi said an Afghan national who is alleged to be the mastermind behind the attack was among those detained. One counter-terrorism officer was killed and three more were wounded in the raids to arrest the suspects, he added.The Islamic State group has claimed responsibility for the bombing that targeted Friday prayers at the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area, when it was packed with worshippers.More than 160 people were injured in the blast, which was the deadliest in the capital for more than a decade.Huge crowds were seen in the city on Saturday, as thousands of mourners gathered for the funerals of the bombing's 32 victims.Funeral prayers took place amid tightened security, with soldiers standing guard and police checkpoints set up in key areas.Ashiq Hussain, who lost his 21-year-old nephew Mujtaba Ali in the attack, told the Reuters news agency his family was \"broken\".Condemning the attack on Friday, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed \"deep grief\". The country's President, Asif Ali Zardari, said \"targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity\".Eyewitnesses and survivors of the blast have told the BBC how the attack unfolded, with one saying he \"lost his senses\" in the moments after the explosion and another saying he saw bodies \"lying everywhere\". Pakistan mosque explosion: where the attack unfoldedAnnouncing the arrests on Saturday, Naqvi accused India of funding those behind the attack and giving them targets. The Indian foreign ministry has condemned the bombing, and rejected accusations of its involvement as \"baseless\".Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday suggested Afghanistan had been involved in the attack. The Afghan Taliban government described Asif's comments as \"regrettable\", saying he alleged its involvement \"without presenting any credible evidence\".Naqvi has pledged to increase security in Islamabad, including by recruiting thousands of new police officers and improving the city's smart security systems.The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response.",

    "body": "5 hours agoChris GrahamReutersSussan Ley said it was time to look to the future. Australia's Liberal-National Coalition, the country's main opposition, reunited on Sunday, more than two weeks after the centre-right partners split in a row over hate speech laws. \"The Coalition is back together and looking to the future, not to the past,\" Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said, appearing alongside National Party leader David Littleproud in Canberra.The Coalition split on 22 January after the Nationals, citing free speech concerns, refused to back reforms moved by the government after two gunmen targeted a Jewish festival at Bondi Beach in December, killing 15 people.\"It's been disappointing, we've got to where we are but it was over a substantive issue,\" Littleproud said.The Coalition suffered a heavy election loss last year and the split last month was the second in less than 12 months.  Last year's separation in May - largely over climate and energy policy - was resolved within a week.This time the divisions were sown by hate speech reforms introduced by the centre-left Labor government after the Bondi Beach attack.While the Liberals sided with the government, their National colleagues abstained from the vote in the lower house and voted against the measure in the senate, saying the measures had been rushed and posed a threat to free speech.The legislation includes provisions that will ban groups deemed to spread hate and introduce tougher penalties for preachers who advocate violence.Ley said the coalition had a responsibility to find a way back to government.\"I acknowledge this has been a difficult time. It has been a difficult time for millions of our Coalition supporters, and many other Australians who rely on our two great parties to provide scrutiny and leadership,\" she said.The Liberal Party leader said both parties had struck an agreement that neither party could overturn decisions taken by the Coalition's joint \"shadow cabinet\".Dating back to the 1940s, the Coalition had not split since 1987 before the brief separation last year. The National Party mainly represents regional communities and often leans more conservative than the Liberals.The Coalition is facing pressure from populist Senator Pauline Hanson's anti-immigration One Nation party, which has surged in polling, while the Liberal Party lost a swath of seats at last year's federal election.",

    "body": "9 hours agoKayla EpsteinGetty ImagesThe lead singer and songwriter of 3 Doors Down, Brad Arnold, has died after a battle with cancer, the rock band announced on X. He was 47.\"He will be deeply missed and forever remembered,\" the band said in a statement on Saturday. The band is best known for 2000s rock hits like Kryptonite, Here Without You, When I'm Gone, and Loser.In May 2025, Arnold announced that he was ill, and had received a diagnosis of stage 4 clear cell renal carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer, which had metastasised into his lung. \"I have no fear, I really sincerely am not scared of it at all,\" the frontman said, adding that he was disappointed that the band would have to cancel an upcoming tour.\"I'd love for you to lift me up in prayer every chance you get,\" he said.In its statement, 3 Doors Down said that, as a founding member, vocalist, and original drummer, \"Brad helped redefine mainstream rock music, blending post-grunge accessibility with emotionally direct song writing and lyrical themes that resonated with everyday listeners\".  The original band was formed in Mississippi in the mid-1990s. Another founding member of the original trio, Matt Roberts, died in 2016 at the age of 38.Arnold wrote Kryptonite, the band's breakout 2000 hit, \"in his math class when he was just 15 years old\", the statement continued.Those closest to Arnold will \"remember not only his talent, but his warmth, humility, faith, and deep love for his family and friends\", it said. He is survived by his wife, Jennifer.The band was regularly heard on rock and pop radio throughout the 2000s and 2010s. They have won three Billboard Music Awards.Their debut album The Better Life was the 11th biggest-selling album of the year in their home country.Arnold had spoken openly about hit battle with alcoholism and his recovery, having been sober since 2016.\"I used to think it was a way to calm myself prior to a show or to chase loneliness,\" he told Charleston.com in 2023.The band performed for the inauguration of President George W Bush as well as the first inauguration of President Donald Trump, which received some criticism from fans.Their manager, Angus Vail, defended the decision to perform for the 2017 Trump presidential celebration, telling Vice: \"They are good Mississippi and Alabama boys—they come from conservative families.\"In 2004, 3 Doors Down established a charity, the Better Life Foundation, to create \"positive change in the lives of children in need of food, shelter and medical assistance\". The band hosts a yearly concert to raise funds for the organisation.\"All the money that goes into that [charity] comes from fans, and people, that they give to us,\" Arnold told Antihero magazine in 2021.\"But being able to see what that's done over the years has definitely enriched my life.\"",

    "body": "16 hours agoRachel Muller-HeyndykNurPhotoSuspected attacks on northern Italy's railway network have led to severe travel disruption in the region, the authorities say, as thousands gathered for the start of the Winter Olympic Games. Police reported three separate incidents involving damage to railway lines that they believe are connected to the Games. A fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, triggering delays of up to two-and-a-half hours, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.The Ministry of Transport called the incidents an act of \"serious sabotage\", which they said mirrored vandalism during the Paris Olympics in 2024. Police said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro, on the Adriatic coast. Several hours later, police discovered severed electric cables near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track nearby. Bologna's rail station is a major transport hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines. \"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling and positive,\" said Deputy Prime Minister and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini. A police spokesperson earlier said that they were investigating the incidents and that no one had claimed responsibility. Salvini compared the events to the Paris Summer Olympics, when saboteurs damaged France's high speed rail network. \"There are similarities in action and timing to the French incident,\" he told AFP.Bologna's high speed, state-owned railway had to temporarily close, but traffic was returning to normal by Saturday afternoon. The opening ceremony of the Games took place on Friday evening in Milan, in Cortina in northeastern Italy and two other locations. Milan and Cortina are both reachable by train from Venice.Events are spread over hundreds of miles of northern Italy, in locations including the Alps and Dolomite mountains.",

In a message to staff, William Lewis said it was the right time to leave and that \"difficult decisions\" had been made to ensure the paper's future.On Wednesday the newspaper announced it was cutting a third of its workforce, dramatically scaling back its coverage of sport and international news. The decision was condemned by many journalists and prompted criticism of the Post's billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos. Executive editor Matt Murray said the cuts would bring \"stability\".Jeff D'Onofrio, who joined as chief financial officer of the newspaper last year, will serve as acting publisher and CEO, the Post said as it announced Lewis's departure.A former Dow Jones chief executive and publisher of the Wall Street Journal, Lewis was appointed to the role at the Washington Post in 2023.He has faced criticism from subscribers and employees as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily.Hundreds protested in front of the paper's headquarters in Washington DC on Thursday after the mass lay-offs, which included the paper's entire Middle East staff and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor until 2021, said the cuts ranked \"among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organisations\".The departure of Lewis marks the latest upheaval for the leading US newspaper, which has seen a series of staff cuts and controversial editorial decisions in recent years.ReutersJeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, acquired the Washington Post in 2013.The newspaper had endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s - all of whom had been Democrats. The move caused widespread criticism and led to the loss of tens of thousands of subscribers. Meanwhile, the opinion editor resigned in February last year when Bezos decided to focus the paper's comment section on \"personal liberties and free markets\". Bezos, who acquired the newspaper in 2013, said pieces opposing those views would not be published.",

    "body": "14 hours agoHenri AstierAFP via Getty ImagesFinancial crime prosecutors in France say they have opened a preliminary inquiry into former Culture Minister Jack Lang over his links to Jeffrey Epstein.Lang, a major figure in French socialist governments between the 1980s and 2000s, is being investigated for suspected \"laundering of tax fraud proceeds\". It follows the US Department of Justice's release of the Epstein files, which have documented links between the Lang family and the late American sex offender.Lang, now 86, denies wrongdoing and on Saturday described the allegations against him as \"baseless\". He told AFP the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour\".Hours after the investigation was announced, Lang offered to resign as head of the Arab World Institute, a body that promotes cooperation and exchanges between France and Arab nations.In a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, seen by AFP, Lang said he would submit his resignation at the next board meeting. Barrot, who had summoned Lang for talks on Sunday, said he had acknowledged the resignation offer and planned to start the process of looking for a successor. Lang's daughter Caroline, 64, is also being investigated in the case. Earlier this week she stepped down as head of a French film producers' union.On Tuesday, he told broadcaster BFMTV he had known nothing about Epstein's crimes when he met him \"some 15 years ago\". The US financier was convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution.Lang - who served as culture minister between 1981 and 1993 and later as minister of education - says he was introduced to Epstein by US actor-director Woody Allen.He said he had found Epstein \"passionate about art, culture and cinema\".In a separate interview on Tuesday, he told RTL radio that Epstein had been \"generous\" and \"courteous\", adding: \"When I meet people I don't ask to see their criminal record.\"Details from the files revealed by French media suggest Lang appealed to Epstein for funds or favours on several occasions - including the use of Epstein's car and private plane for himself and his family.Caroline Lang told French news website Mediapart that she met Epstein in 2012, when he told her he wanted to \"invest in young French and international artists\".She said his lawyers had set up a company, Prytanee LLC, based in the US Virgin Islands. Mediapart said Caroline Lang had received half of the shares, but she said she had not invested in it or received any funds from it.An email in the Epstein files suggested she contributed her art knowledge, Mediapart reports. She told the website she had been \"incredibly naive\".Resigning from her post in the Independent Production Union, she said: \"I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union.\"The files do not suggest either Lang or his daughter were implicated in Epstein's sexual crimes.Epstein died in prison in New York in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.AFP via Getty ImagesLang (right) made his name in the 1980s, under the presidency of François Mitterrand (left)",

    "body": "1 day agoMax MatzaCBSThe co-owner of a Colorado funeral home where nearly 200 decaying bodies were found has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for corpse abuse.Before Jon Hallford was sentenced, he apologised in court and listened to family members describe having nightmares about their loved ones decomposing in his care. They called him a \"monster\" who should rot in jail.His ex-wife and co-owner Carie Hallford has pleaded guilty to similar charges and is awaiting sentencing.The Return to Nature home, in the town of Penrose, Colorado, had given fake ashes to grieving relatives instead of their loved-ones' remains. Prosecutors said 189 bodies were improperly stored in the building over four years.The courthouse was packed with family members on Friday, who asked the judge to impose the maximum 50-year sentence.\"I'm a daughter whose mother was treated like yesterday's trash and dumped in a site left to rot with hundreds of others,\" Kelly Mackeen told the court.\"I'm heartbroken, and I ask God every day for grace.\"The bodies were found in piles inside non-refrigerated areas of the funeral home. Victims included children and foetuses.\"It is my personal belief that every one of us, every human being, is basically good at the core,\" Judge Eric Bentley said.\"But we live in a world that tests that belief every day, and Mr Hallford, your crimes are testing that belief.\" Hallford, who had pleaded guilty in the hopes of a reduced sentence, apologised for his actions ahead of sentencing.\"I had so many chances to put a stop to everything and walk away, but I did not,\" he said. \"My mistakes will echo for a generation. Everything I did was wrong.\"Prosecutors say the couple was driven by \"greed\", and were earning enough money from the business to properly care for the bodies.Located about 30 miles (48km) south of Colorado Springs, the funeral home specialised in burials where no chemicals, including embalming fluid, were used and where remains were buried in a biodegradable casket.The business came under investigation after reports of a foul odour coming from the property. Officials discovered 115 bodies there early last October.Jon Hallford was accused by officials of attempting to conceal the \"improper storage of human remains\".Green funerals are allowed in the state but remains must be buried within 24 hours or be properly refrigerated.Funeral home operators in Colorado are currently not required to be licensed, have a degree in mortuary science or even graduate high school.Tougher legislation has been passed since the scandal erupted.",

    "body": "Savannah Guthrie tells mother's possible kidnappers 'we will pay' in plea for her return6 hours agoKayla Epstein'We will pay': Savannah Guthrie's new message about missing motherUS news anchor Savannah Guthrie and her family have released a new video pleading for the safe return of their mother. \"We received your message, and we understand,\" Guthrie said in the video posted to Instagram on Saturday evening, as she is flanked by her two siblings. \"We beg you now to return our mother to us so that we can celebrate with her.\"\"This is the only way we will have peace,\" she continued. \"This is very valuable to us. And we will pay.\" Her video did not provide any details about the message she referenced.Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend and authorities believe she was taken against her will. Earlier this week, authorities said they had yet to identify a person of interest or suspect in the case.They are offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information.Nancy Guthrie was discovered missing when members of her church grew concerned when she did not attend Sunday services. Authorities say that early on Sunday morning, a doorbell camera in her home was disconnected and removed. At about 02:28 local time, the app connected to her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, was disconnected from her phone.FBI Special Agent Heith Janke has said the bureau is looking into a potential ransom note sent to several media outlets.ReutersAuthorities on Friday said they were \"aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie\". They are \"inspecting the information provided in the message for its accuracy\".Janke said the note \"had facts associated with a deadline with a monetary value they were asking for\", NBC News reported.A presenter for a local CBS News affiliate told the BBC that her channel had received the \"message\" but did not detail its contents.According to news website TMZ, which reportedly received one of the letters, the kidnappers were demanding millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency, which is popular with criminals and often difficult to trace.BBC NewsThe family has released two previous videos saying they are willing to speak with the potential kidnapper, and asking to provide proof that her mother was alive.In a Thursday video, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - confirmed  the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers.\"We have to know that you have our mum,\" Camron said in the family's latest video message. \"We want to talk to you.\"The FBI did arrest one individual regarding a fake ransom note on Thursday.Family, and law enforcement, have warned that Nancy Guthrie may be at risk without her medication.\"She is without any medicine,\" Savannah Guthrie said in a previous announcement. \"She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer.\"US President Donald Trump said last week he had spoken to Guthrie and offered federal law enforcement help.\"I think we're doing very well, meaning we have some clues, I think that are very strong and I think we could have some answers coming up fairly soon,\" Trump told reporters on Friday.Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive.\"Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,\" he said. \"Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes.\"Savannah Guthrie, 54, is an American broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' TODAY since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage.

    "body": "16 hours agoIan AikmanRussian Defence MinistryLt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was attacked in his apartment building on FridayA Russian general who was shot several times in Moscow on Friday has regained consciousness after successfully undergoing surgery, according to reports in Russian media. Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev, who is Russia's deputy head of military intelligence, was rushed to hospital in serious condition on Friday morning after the attack in the north-western outskirts of the capital.Two suspects have reportedly been arrested and will soon be taken in for questioning. Russian officials have blamed Kyiv for the shooting, but Ukraine's foreign minister denied involvement, according to Reuters.Doctors said on Saturday it can be \"cautiously stated that the threat to [Alexeyev's] life has passed\", Russia's state news agency Tass has reported.  The highly decorated general was ambushed on the landing inside his apartment block, where a gunman inflicted three bullet wounds, a source close to the investigation told the Kommersant newspaper.He was reportedly hit in the chest or abdomen before the attacker and an accomplice fled the scene.A neighbour in the building on Volokolamsk Highway told Reuters she had been woken by the sound of \"several\" shots and had then heard another neighbour screaming for help.Alexeyev was taken to a Moscow hospital with injuries where he reportedly underwent successful surgery.\"Afterwards, Alexeyev was placed in a medically induced coma. He has now regained consciousness. At this point, it can be cautiously stated that the threat to his life has passed,\" medical sources said, according to Tass.Investigators on Friday said they had opened a criminal case for attempted murder.Two suspects will be taken for questioning and a court hearing could take place on Sunday to determine their pretrial detention, Kommersant reported.Watch: BBC on the scene of Russian general shooting in MoscowAlexeyev, 64, is the latest high-ranking military figure to be targeted near Moscow since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As number two in the main directorate of Russia's GRU military intelligence, he has played a significant role in the war in Ukraine and was previously awarded the Hero of Russia title for his part in Moscow's military intervention in the Syrian civil war.He was placed under European Union and UK sanctions after the GRU was accused of being behind the 2018 nerve agent attack in Salisbury in the UK.He was also sent to negotiate with the head of the Wagner mercenary group, Yevgeny Prigozhin, who led a short and bloody mutiny in June 2023.His boss at the GRU, Igor Kostyukov, has been in charge of Russia's negotiating team at peace talks with Ukrainian and US teams in Abu Dhabi. The latest round ended on Thursday without a major breakthrough.No-one has so far claimed Friday's attack, but Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov was quick to point the finger at Ukraine, saying it was an attempt at \"disrupting the negotiation process\".Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha told Reuters that Kyiv had nothing to do with Friday's shooting. Kyiv has claimed responsibility for some attacks on Russian military figures in the past.Russian intelligence officials claimed they had thwarted an attempted attack on a Russian soldier in St Petersburg at the end of last month.Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that the US had proposed talks between negotiators from Moscow and Kyiv for the first time on American soil, \"probably in Miami\".He added that the US wants the war to end by June. There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow. ",

    "body": "18 hours agoKathryn ArmstrongState Emergency Service of UkraineA fire broke out at a warehouse in the city of Yahotyn as a result of a Russian drone strikeUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, adding both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week.\"America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams – Ukraine and Russia – meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,\" he said.There was no immediate comment from Washington or Moscow, but US President Donald Trump has been pushing for an end for the conflict since he took office again more than a year ago. Meanwhile, Russia has continued its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure - causing further widespread blackouts during freezing conditions.In comments released on Saturday, Zelensky told reporters what had taken place during the second round of US-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi, which ended on Friday with no reports of a breakthrough. Zelensky said \"difficult issues remained difficult\", including territorial concessions that Ukraine is under pressure to make.He said the parties discussed, for the first time, the possibility of a trilateral meeting between leaders, not simply representatives, but cautioned \"preparatory elements are needed for this\". Asked whether a time frame had been given for an agreement, the Ukrainian leader replied: \"The Americans say that they want to do everything by June.\" \"Why before this summer?\" he added. \"We understand that their domestic issues in the US will have an impact.\" These issues include the November midterm elections, which could affect the balance of power in the US government.As the diplomacy continues, so too are Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy facilities. \"Russian criminals carried out another massive attack on Ukraine's energy facilities,\" Ukraine's energy minister, Denys Shmyhal, wrote on Telegram. Substations, which control the flow of electricity, and overhead power lines that \"form the backbone of Ukraine's power grid\" were targeted, Shmyhal said. Power plants were also struck.Ukraine's state-owned energy operator, Ukrenergo, said \"the power deficit in the power system of Ukraine significantly increased\" as a result of the latest attacks. Shmyhal said neighbouring Poland had been asked for emergency power supplies.Zelensky wrote on social media that Friday night's attack involved more than 400 drones and 40 missiles. Air-defence systems intercepted most, but not all, of them, the Ukrainian military said.\"The main targets were the energy grid, generation facilities, and distribution substations,\" he said, adding that damage had been reported in at least four regions.In the western region of Lviv, the Dobrotvir power plant came under attack, leaving thousands of people without electricity, according to the regional head, Maksym Kozytskyi. At least 6,000 people were without power as a result of hourly power outage schedules, he added.AFP via Getty ImagesKyiv residents have been sleeping in metro stations to avoid Russian air strikesThe Burshtyn power plant was also struck in the nearby Ivano-Frankivsk region.  DTEK, which runs both the Dobrotvir and Burshtyn plants said it was the tenth \"massive attack\" on its power plants since October 2025.\"In total, DTEK thermal power plants have been attacked by the enemy more than 220 times since the beginning of the full-scale invasion,\" the company added on Telegram. This was launched by Russia nearly four years ago. One person was reported dead in the Rivne region and several were injured in Zaporizhzhia. Rivne's head, Oleksandr Koval, said there was also damage to homes and \"critical infrastructure\".In Kyiv, residents once again took shelter in metro stations. Among them, Oksana Kykhtenko, told the Reuters news agency: \"They [Russians] make us live in inhumane conditions. Without heating, without electricity.\" A drone strike in the city of Yahotyn, about 10km (6.2 miles) away, caused a fire at a warehouse complex, the Ukrainian emergency services said. Ukraine has also attacked Russia, striking a factory that makes missile fuel components in the western Tver region, according to media reports quoting Ukrainian security officials. Further south, in the Saratov region, an oil depot was also hit, Ukraine said. Russia has not commented on any of the latest attacks.  Moscow renewed its attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Monday after a pause US President Donald Trump had asked Vladimir Putin to observe due to the fierce cold in Ukraine. Trump said the pause lasted for a week until last Sunday but Kyiv disputed the timeline.DTEK said the combined missile and drone strikes caused \"the most powerful blow\" to infrastructure so far this year. \"Moscow must be deprived of the ability to use the cold as leverage against Ukraine,\" Zelensky wrote on X on Saturday, responding to the latest strikes.It is not yet known who was behind the shooting.Some 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky said earlier this week. The BBC has confirmed the names of almost 160,000 people killed fighting on Russia's side in Ukraine.",

    "body": "Japanese people brave snow to vote in snap election 23 minutes agoKelly NgandShaimaa Khalil,Tokyo correspondentWatch: Tokyo residents head to the polls amid rare city snowfallJapanese people are braving the snow to vote in a snap election called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, whose coalition is predicted to clinch a decisive win.Takaichi called the country's first mid-winter poll in 36 years to seek a public mandate soon after winning her party's leadership race last October.  Some called the move a gamble given her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had lost its majority in both houses of parliament, and its decades-old coalition with the Komeito party had collapsed. An LDP-led coalition has governed Japan for much of its post-war history due to the lack of a strong opposition. But recent corruption scandals had pummelled its image before Takaichi took office.Getty ImagesJapan is holding a rare mid-winter electionHer personal popularity appears to have helped the party, with approval ratings for her government mostly hovering above 70%. And the polls have given the LDP's current coalition with the Japanese Innovation Party up to 300 of the 465 seats in the lower house.This is a turnaround for a party whose last two leaders had to step down before finishing their terms as prime minister after a fundraising scandal, plummeting ratings and election losses.\"People want their lives to be better and more comfortable because we are so accustomed to not having inflation [costs rising]... so people are very worried. I think we need a long-term solution rather than short-term fixes,\" Ritsuko Ninomiya, a voter in Tokyo  told the BBC. Japanese voters have been frustrated with the recent political scandals in the LDP, especially as costs soared.  \"Housing is very expensive,\" says Rumi Hayama. \"Our son is getting bigger and we need a bigger place but it is not affordable although we have decent jobs. Prices are getting higher and [it is] getting hard to live in Japan. It was not like this before.\"Chika Nakayama/BBCRumi and Daniel Hayama with their son  Takaichi's enthusiasm, populist spending promises and nationalist rhetoric appear to have energised some voters. But critics, including businesses, are sceptical that  her pledge to spend more can revive the sluggish Japanese economy. The country's government debt is already one of the highest among developed nations. They also worry that her conservative stance on immigration will not help the ageing country which is already facing labour shortages.  \"I think this election is more important for the younger generation, people like us,\" Daniel Hayama says, adding that the cold weather is not a hurdle for young people who want to vote.But snow is expected to disrupt voter turnout, especially in the northern and eastern regions. Turnout for early voting this time, which was reported to be nearly 4.6 million people, was down 2.5% from the last election in 2024. The drop has been attributed to the weather.Several areas, including Niigata Prefecture in central Japan, reported heavy snow on Sunday. Japan's transport ministry said 37 train lines and 58 ferry routes were closed and 54 flights cancelled as of Sunday morning. There was rare snowfall in Tokyo as people headed out to vote.Getty ImagesTakaichi and the LDP face a more unified opposition than before. LDP's former coalition partner Komeito has joined forces with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan to form the largest opposition bloc in the lower house.And not everyone is convinced Takaichi's popularity will translate into votes. \"This is not a presidential election but a parliamentary election, in which the LDP's candidates are mostly men tainted by past scandals,\" political science professor Koichi Nakano, from Sophia University, told the BBC.The government's policy package may offer households short-term relief, but \"fails to address the underlying problems of weak productivity and stagnant real wages\", Masahiko Takeda, a senior fellow focusing on Asia at the Australian National University, wrote in an article this week.Moreover, Takaichi has dug herself into \"a deep hole in foreign and security policy by antagonising China\", Nakano added.Takaichi angered Beijing, Tokyo's largest trading partner, late last year with her suggestion that Japan could respond with its own self-defence force if China attacked Taiwan. Tokyo's relationship with Washington, its closest ally, is also facing uncertainty under an predictable Trump presidency, although the US has lowered the 25% tariffs it initially threatened to impose to 15%. Chika Nakayama/BBCSome voters like Yuko Sakai are voting with Trump on their mind \"I think the world is changing so much with Trump in office and all... so peace is even more important now,\" Ms Hattori told the BBC.   Takaichi has courted Trump and has even been publicly endorsed by him - an unusual move by a US president - and they both seem to agree that Japan should spend more on defence. That relationship too was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on Sunday.   \"I am concerned with what President Trump is doing as well as the national defense issues.  I am not sure where the money is coming from to cover that. So balancing budget spending between defence and people's life is a major concern for me,\" Yuko Sakai says.

    "body": "1 day agoBernd Debusmann Jrat the White HouseWatch: Trump says he 'didn't see' racist clip depicting Obamas as apesUS President Donald Trump has said he \"didn't see\" the part of a social media video which showed a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The video was later removed.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said \"I didn't make a mistake\" when asked whether he was going to apologise.He added he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted by a staff member and didn't know it contained that depiction of the Obamas. Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - described it as \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".The White House initially defended the clip as an \"internet meme video\" and told critics to \"stop the fake outrage\".But after fierce backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had \"erroneously\" made the post.The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. The video was one of dozens posted to Trump's Truth Social account overnight.\"I look at a lot of thousands of things,\" the president said while aboard Air Force One on Friday, adding that after watching only part of the video he \"gave it to the people who generally, they look at the whole thing\".He says he liked the video's message on voter fraud, but that if his staff had looked at the whole thing, \"probably they would have had the sense to take it down\".\"We took it down as soon as we found out about it,\" he added. ReutersSome criticism came from within Trump's own party. Senator Scott, a South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was \"praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House\".\"The President should remove it,\" he added. Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post \"wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake\" and said it \"should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.\" The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican Senator from Utah, posted on social media that the video was \"blatantly racist and inexcusable\". \"It should never have been posted or left published for so long,\" he wrote. According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who \"let the president down\". The BBC has contacted the White House for clarification on how many people have access to the president's account and what the approval process is for posts. In a statement sent to the BBC earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the clip is from \"an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King\". \"Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,\" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, called the video \"disgusting and utterly despicable\" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a \"rapidly failing economy.\" Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: \"Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country.\" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that \"Donald Trump is a racist\". \"Disgusting behaviour by the president,\" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. \"Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a moustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a \"vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder\". \"Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,\" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil legal actions against some media companies.Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama.Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president.He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US.",

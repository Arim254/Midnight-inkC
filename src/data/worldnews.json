    "body": "Trump's grand plan to reshape the world order leaves Europe with a difficult choice to make18 minutes agoAllan LittleSenior correspondentBBCFor 80 years, what bound the United States to Europe was a shared commitment to defence and a common set of values: a commitment to defend democracy, human rights and the rule of law.That era was inaugurated in March 1947 in an 18-minute speech by President Harry Truman, in which he pledged US support to defend Europe against further expansion by the Soviet Union.America led the creation of Nato, the World Bank, the IMF and the United Nations. And it bound itself into what became known as the \"rules-based international order\", in which nation states committed to a series of mutual obligations and shared burdens, designed to defend the democratic world against hostile authoritarian powers.Now, the new US National Security Strategy (NSS), published in December, signals that, for the White House, that shared endeavour has ended; that much of what the world has taken for granted about America's role is over.The review refers to the \"so-called 'rules-based international order'\", putting the latter phrase in inverted commas: a kind of delegitimisation by punctuation mark.AFP via Getty ImagesJD Vance said that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within Vice-President JD Vance warned America's European allies that this was coming in a speech at the Munich Security Conference in February 2025.He told them bluntly that the real threat to Europe did not come from Russia but from within - from those censoring free speech, suppressing political opposition and therefore undermining European democracy. And he was damning about the \"leftist liberal network\".The French newspaper Le Monde said the speech was a declaration of \"ideological war\" against Europe.Last month's NSS codifies Vance's remarks, and, in black and white, elevates them to the status of doctrine.\"Certainly America is no longer the country that promoted the global values that have been in place since the end of the Second World War,\" says Karin von Hippel, who previously held senior positions in the US State Department and is a former Director of the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), a Whitehall think tank.\"It is shifting to a very different place.\"So, if the world is indeed moving away from that order, what is it moving towards? And what does it mean for the rest of the world and in particular for Europe?'We have a different world today'\"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment, and have not served our or any other particular purpose,\" says Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank in Washington.In the eyes of Coates - who was previously the Deputy National Security Adviser to US President Donald Trump - change to the international order is inevitable in a changing world.\"The other issue we face here is that when that so-called rules-based international order was established after the Second World War, 80 short years ago, China wasn't a major concern.\"We just have a different world today.\"Getty ImagesPresident Truman watches on as a US representative signs the United Nations Charter in 1945This rules-based international order, built in the years after World War Two, was created by a generation that had come of age during an era of Great Power geopolitics, and had seen that system descend, twice, into catastrophic global conflict.That international order, flawed and incomplete though it undoubtedly was, was the legacy of that experience.But the NSS directly argues that American strategy went astray in the years since - and it blames what it calls \"American foreign policy elites\".\"They lashed American policy to a network of international institutions, some of which are driven by outright anti-Americanism and many by a transnationalism that explicitly seeks to dissolve individual state sovereignty,\" it says.It suggests that in future, the US will seek to roll back the influence of supranational bodies. Anadolu via Getty ImagesThe National Security Strategy says: 'We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations'\"The world's fundamental political unit is and will remain the nation-state… We stand for the sovereign rights of nations, against the sovereignty-sapping incursions of the most intrusive transnational organizations…\"Elsewhere in the document, reflecting on the \"balance of power\", it states: \"The outsized influence of larger, richer, and stronger nations is a timeless truth of international relations.\"The Kremlin responded to the review with praise, saying much of it aligned with Moscow's own thinking.\"I think Trump, Xi, Putin and their more authoritarian acolytes are seeking to return us to an era of Great Power politics,\" says Field Marshal Lord Richards, who, as General Sir David Richards, was the head of the UK's armed forces from 2010 till 2013.Yet Sir Lawrence Freedman, Emeritus Professor of War Studies at King's College London, believes the new Security Strategy is not as radical a break with the past as it may appear.AFP via Getty ImagesThe Kremlin said much of the review aligned with Moscow's own thinking\"We need to be careful about the rules-based international order, which is a term that came into general use in the last decade or so,\" he argues.\"Look back and you find plenty of violations of the rules, Vietnam for example. So there's a sort of rosy glow about the past at times and everyone should be careful about nostalgia for what was a complex past.\"Muscular reassertion of the Monroe doctrineWashington's military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas that led to the capture of the country's leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, is an early example of this more muscular assertion of sovereign unilateralism.Some international law experts have questioned the legality of the Trump administration's actions, and argued the US may have violated international statutes governing the use of force. The US maintains its actions were legally justified.\"Under American law it certainly was [legal]\" Robert Wilkie, who served as an Undersecretary of Defense in the first Trump administration, has previously told the BBC.\"Maduro - most of our European partners have not recognised his regime so he is an illegitimate figure. Because of that he is stripped of the normal protections that heads of state would have [...]particularly when were are looking at constitutional provisions that exist in the United States, that would supersede anything the UN says.\"AFP via Getty ImagesThe military operation in the Venezuelan capital Caracas led to the capture of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Cilia FloresThe NSS claims, for the United States, the right to be the pre-eminent power in the Western Hemisphere, and to bend its Latin American and Caribbean neighbours into alignment with Washington's interests.This is a muscular reassertion of the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and its promise of US supremacy in the Western hemisphere.Colombia, Panama and Cuba are all also in the President's sights.\"This starts primarily with the Panama Canal,\" says Victoria Coates. \"The degree to which control of the canal is necessary to the United States cannot be overstated.\"China is now Latin America's biggest trading partner and a major infrastructure investor there. The NSS aims to roll back Chinese influence in Washington's backyard.When the canal was handed over to Panama, in 1999, by President George HW Bush, says Coates, \"we were in the assumption that China was a reasonable actor… That turned out not to be true…\"So making sure that the United States retains a prime position over the canal is critical, and I think Panama is for the first time getting that message from the United States.\"But Sir Lawrence Freedman is among those who argue that the US's ability to control its neighbours is not unlimited.\"The Strategy Review might say this is our hemisphere and we can do what we want, but there are still constraints. They may have extricated Maduro and his wife, but they're still dealing with the old regime.\"They're not running the country, despite what Trump says.\"Under the new strategy, the United States will no longer pressure authoritarian regimes to improve their human rights records.In a phrase taken from the US Declaration of Independence of 1776, the review declares, \"All nations are entitled by 'the laws of nature and nature's God' to a 'separate and equal station' with respect to one another.\"Getty ImagesXi Jinping and Nicolas Maduro pictured in 2015 in Beijing, ChinaIn the Middle East, for example, the US says it will abandon the \"misguided experiment with hectoring these nations - especially the Gulf monarchies - into abandoning their traditions and historic forms of government\".\"The key to successful relations with the Middle East,\" it adds, \"is accepting the region, its leaders, and its nations as they are while working together on areas of common interest.\"But it seems the same level of respect for traditions and historic forms of government is not extended to the democratic and allied nations of Europe.Whilst it refers to an American sentimental attachment to the European continent - and to Britain and Ireland - what's striking about this paper is that it seeks to redefine what is worth defending in the Western world.This review is civilisational in its reach, and argues for a civilisation that is no longer built on the shared values of the Truman Doctrine, but instead on the primacy of the sovereign nation-state.Where does this leave Europe?The review is damning about Europe's \"current trajectory\" and raises questions about whether some European nations can be regarded as dependable allies in the future.It talks about \"economic decline\" but adds that this is \"eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure\".Elsewhere in the document, it states: \"It is more than plausible that within a few decades at the latest, certain Nato members will become majority non-European,\" which raises doubts about their viability as long-term security partners, the strategy suggests.\"It's a very nativist document,\" argues Karin von Hippel. \"It's very ideological. The underlying message is that the Christian white male is no longer running many of the countries [in the West] and we're seeing a threat to the dominance that the Christian white male has had in the United States and Europe.\"They're very careful not to say any of that explicitly but I think that's what's implied.\"Getty ImagesThe new US National Security Strategy, which was published in December, is damning about Europe's 'current trajectory'But Victoria Coates argues that, in her view, the \"larger struggle we find ourselves in\" is indeed civilisational.\"Sovereignty is also a critical issue,\" she says. \"Looking at the European Union project, especially after Brexit, I think a lot of countries are wondering if subverting the national interest to Brussels is a winning strategy.\"I do think that is one of the institutions that the NSS does call into question.\"This chimes with the interests of the American tech giants that oppose EU efforts to regulate their activities on the European continent.Last month Elon Musk posted on X that the European Union should be abolished and sovereignty returned to the individual nation states.'Cultivating resistance to Europe's trajectory'The review is clear about how Europe can regain its \"self-confidence\".It says: \"The growing influence of patriotic European parties indeed gives cause for great optimism. Our goal should be to help Europe correct its current trajectory. We will need a strong Europe to help us successfully compete.\"And one of its policies for doing this is by \"cultivating resistance to Europe's current trajectory within European nations\".What is meant precisely by \"cultivating resistance\" raises many questions.In Europe, some have already concluded that the USA may no longer be a reliable ally, at a time when Russia poses a growing threat. After Vice-President Vance's speech in Munich, Germany's Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" from America with a reshaped Nato.But this takes time.\"It's not achievable in the short term,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Europeans have become very dependent upon the United States, and this was a matter of choice: it was cheaper and simpler.\"Though in practice it would be desirable to be able to act without the Americans… in practice it's going to take years to disentangle ourselves. And it'll be extremely expensive.\"So Europe has a difficulty: it can't rely on the Americans, but it can't operate easily without them.\"AFP via Getty ImagesFriedrich Merz has said Europe would need to \"achieve independence\" As to the pressing question of what it means for Europe - and the EU - in the near future, Lord Richards issues a stark warning: \"[It] risks falling between the cracks.\"\"The EU cannot be a Great Power, nor can any of its constituent nations,\" he argues. \"[So] the UK/EU must decide under whose sphere of influence they should shelter?\"The answer is they are likely to remain in the USA's - and within a reshaped Nato.\"'A popular revolt against the establishment'But Lord Richards also believes that increased spending commitment is long overdue.\"European nations are going to have to spend much more on their own defence. This has long been coming but in the UK it is not yet translating into any fresh money. Indeed this year the armed forces are being required to save money rather than spend more.\"The US has been pushing Europe to increase defence spending for years, notes Sir Lawrence.\"The message that Europe needs to do more for its own defence has been around a long time. It was pushed by both Obama and Biden.\"Last year Trump secured from the European allies a commitment to increase defence spending to 5% of GDP - and in doing so may have done Europe a security favour, by pushing it, in the long term, towards greater operational independence from Washington.\"Spending has gone up quite significantly,\" says Sir Lawrence. \"The Germans have been making quite impressive strides. So there is movement, not as fast as many would wish, but it's happening.\"The review is clear about how America thinks it can \"help\" Europe. \"We want to work with aligned countries that want to restore their former greatness,\" it says.Getty ImagesVictoria Coates says: \"International institutions, notably the United Nations, have been marked by dramatically anti-American sentiment...\"Ultimately, what the report reveals is not so much an ideological divide that separates the US and Europe, but one that slices through both continents.Both sides of the Atlantic have certain concerns in common, argues Victor Mallet, a Paris-based journalist and author of a forthcoming book, Far Right France: Le Pen, Bardella and the Future of Europe.\"Concerns about immigration, concerns about the economy… and there's an extraordinary cultural gulf between supporters of people like Donald Trump, the National Rally in France, the AfD in Germany, and the intellectual, metropolitan, educated liberal elite.\"It's definitely a popular revolt against the establishment.\"He believes that one of the problems is inequality. \"America has, on average, the richest group of consumers the world has ever seen and yet many ordinary Americans find it hard to make ends meet and the same applies in Western Europe.\"More from InDepthIn the NSS, the US commits to scrapping certain practices, such as Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, that are derided by many in Trump's base.In this document, the culture wars that shape America's bitter public discourse now to a degree also shape its in foreign policy, and - by extension, affect the security of the Western world.Russia is not mentioned as a hostile power, despite its invasion of Ukraine, a Western ally. For in the culture wars, some in Trump's Maga base see in Vladimir Putin not a foe but a natural ally in the defence of white, Christian nationalist civilisation: a man who proudly defends his country, its traditions and identity - the very attributes, after all, that they value and admire in Donald Trump.Top picture credit: AFP / Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "A mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill in the central Philippines on Thursday, killing a 22-year-old woman and leaving more than 30 people missing, authorities have said.Rescuers pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from debris at the Binaliw Landfill in Cebu City, who were later hospitalised.Many of the missing are believed to be workers at the landfill. The mayor of Cebu told news outlet ABS-CBN that it may be difficult to reach survivors because of the potential for further collapse. The cause of the collapse is still unclear, but Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said it was likely the result of poor waste management practices. Some 300 people from various government agencies and civilian groups have been deployed to the privately-owned landfill. Several excavators, ambulances and fire trucks have also been seen on site.\"All response teams remain fully engaged in search and retrieval efforts to locate the remaining missing persons,\" Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival said in a Facebook post on Friday.\"This is not like other landslides that you can just excavate. If you pull from the top, the bottom is soft. Let's say there is a person there, when you get the debris, it might get worse,\" he said, ABS-CBN reported.Cebu City councillor Joel Garganera said the incident may have happened suddenly, but was likely a result of poor waste management practices.Operators had been cutting into the mountain, mining the soil, and then piling garbage to form another mountain of waste, Garganera told local newspaper The Freeman.\"It's not a sanitary landfill. It's already an open dumpsite,\" he said.Families are waiting for updates on their loved ones trapped in the debris.One Binaliw resident, Belen Antigua, told Rappler that her son had survived the landslide but she was still waiting for her other relatives to be found. Another said that families had been gathered at the landfill to look for their children since Friday morning.\"I could not understand my emotions. They said those trapped are calling for help, so there is a possibility that my brother is still there,\" Michelle Lumapas, whose brother works at the landfill, told ABS-CBN.The Binaliw landfill is about 15 hectares (37 acres).Landfills are common in major Philippine cities like Cebu, which is the trading centre and transportation gateway of the Visayas, the archipelago nation's central islands.",

    "body": "Tournament chiefs admit errors over viral wildcard Image source, ITFImage caption, Hajar Abdelkader's biography on the ITF website says she started playing tennis at the age of 14ByStewart MacleanBBC News, in NairobiThe organisers of a professional women's tournament which has gone viral on social media because of a wildcard player's dire performance have acknowledged she should not have been allowed to play.Egyptian Hajar Abdelkader, 21, lost 6-0 6-0 and served 20 double faults during the first-round match in Nairobi on Wednesday, with the footage leaving many viewers wondering if she had ever played tennis before.The amateur player won only three points during her 37-minute debut - two double faults by opponent Lorena Schaedel and an unforced error from the bemused German, ranked 1,026th in the world.The match was part of an International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament, hosted by Tennis Kenya, the governing body for the sport in Kenya.Tennis Kenya said it had reached out to both Abdelkader and Schaedel to offer its support \"given the extent and nature of coverage of this match\". Tennis Kenya said Abdelkader had applied to enter the tournament as a wildcard and had been given a space at the last minute following the withdrawal of another player.The organisation said she was permitted to enter to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament, but said that in hindsight she should not have been allowed to play.\"The federation has taken note of this experience and will ensure that such an extremely rare occurrence never happens again,\" the organisation added. \"Tennis Kenya remains committed to fairness, transparency and the integrity of competition, as well as to the continued development of tennis in Kenya, East Africa, and across Africa.\" The Egyptian Tennis Federation confirmed to the BBC Abdelkader has never been registered as an Egyptian player and had not been entered into the tournament on Egypt's behalf.Egyptian Tennis Federation technical director Dia Nabil Loutfy said: \"We would like to clarify that she is not registered with the Egyptian Tennis Federation, nor is she included in any of our official player lists.\"Based on the information available to us, the player was previously residing in Kenya and participated in the ITF tournament in Nairobi through a wildcard granted by the Kenyan Tennis Federation.\"The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no role whatsoever, whether directly or indirectly, in the nomination, approval, or issuance of this wildcard, and we were not involved in the player's entry into the tournament in any capacity.\"The organisation said it had no records relating to Abdelkader, and said she had never been affiliated with the Egyptian Tennis Federation.",

    "body": "20 hours agoDanny Aeberhard,Rachel HaganandMatt McGrath,environment correspondentUS President Donald Trump has withdrawn the US from dozens of international organisations, including many that work to combat climate change.Nearly half of the 66 affected bodies are UN-related, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change - a treaty that underpins all international efforts to combat global warming.Groups working on development, gender equality and conflict - areas the Trump administration had repeatedly dismissed as advancing \"globalist\" or \"woke\" agendas  - are also included. The White House said the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\" and promote \"ineffective or hostile agendas\".The memorandum was signed on Wednesday following a review, with the White House describing the organisations as \"a waste of taxpayer dollars\".\"These withdrawals will end American taxpayer funding and involvement in entities that advance globalist agendas over US priorities,\" it said in a statement.It added that many of the organisations promoted \"radical climate policies, global governance and ideological programs that conflict with US sovereignty and economic strength\".As well as the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the US has also withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the world's leading authority on climate science that pulls together the most respected reports on the science of rising global temperatures.Sources within the organisation told the BBC that they were concerned about the potential impact of the Trump administration's withdrawal on US scientists involved in producing the body's next set of studies.The White House has already blocked US scientists attending a meeting in China.Any restrictions on travel or the participation of US researchers could significantly delay the release of the next set of IPCC reports, including potentially its mitigation report - a key document guiding governments on how to tackle climate change.Non-UN organisations affected by the US withdrawal include those focused on clean energy co-operation, democratic governance and international security, such as the International Solar Alliance, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance and the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum. Trump has already stripped many multilateral organisations he dislikes of funds and previously rejected the scientific consensus of man-made climate change as a \"hoax\".It will take a year for the US to be able to fully withdraw from the UNFCCC - but in reality the US ceased effective participation in the UN's climate change body long ago.It remains unclear whether the move will be challenged in the US courts, as many campaigners are now urging.While the US constitution allows presidents to join treaties \"provided two thirds of Senators present concur\", it does not specify what happens if they were to withdraw. As such, it is uncertain a future president could reverse Trump's decision and opt back in simply by applying.These latest withdrawals come after the president  took the US out of the Paris Climate Agreement for a second time last year, and declined to send a delegation to the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. The US has also already withdrawn from the World Health Organization, the UN Human Rights Council and the UN's cultural agency, Unesco.European leaders have criticised this latest decision, warning it would weaken global co-operation. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the UNFCCC \"underpins global climate action\" and called the US retreat \"regrettable and unfortunate\", while the EU's clean transition vice-president Teresa Ribera said the administration showed little concern for the environment, health or human suffering.A member of a US-based non-profit advocacy group, the Union of Concerned Scientists, described the step as a \"new low\".Senior policy director Rachel Cleetus told news agency AFP that it was another sign the administration, which she described as \"authoritarian\" and \"anti- science\", was determined to sacrifice people's wellbeing and destabilise global co-operation.",

    "body": "2 hours agoLiv McMahonandLaura Cress,Technology reportersElon Musk's platform X has limited image editing with its AI tool Grok to paying users, after it came under fire for allowing people to make sexualised deepfakes.There has been a significant backlash after the chatbot honoured requests from users to digitally alter images of other people by undressing them without their consent.But Grok is now telling people asking it to make such material that only paid subscribers would be able to do so - meaning their name and payment information must be on file.The BBC has approached X for comment.Those who do not subscribe can still use Grok to edit images on its separate app and website.\"Musk has thrown his toys out of the pram in protest at being held to account for the tsunami of abuse,\" said Professor Clare McGlynn, an expert in the legal regulation of pornography, sexual violence and online abuse.\"Instead of taking the responsible steps to ensure Grok could not be used for abusive purposes, it has withdrawn access for the vast majority of users.\"And Hannah Swirsky, head of policy at the Internet Watch Foundation, said it \"does not undo the harm which has been done\".\"We do not believe it is good enough to simply limit access to a tool which should never have had the capacity to create the kind of imagery we have seen in recent days,\" she said.,The charity previously said its analysts had discovered \"criminal imagery\" of girls aged between 11 and 13 which \"appeared to have been created\" using Grok.\"Sitting and waiting for unsafe products to be abused before taking action is unacceptable,\" Swirsky said.It comes after the government urged regulator Ofcom to use all its powers – up to and including an effective ban – against X over concerns about unlawful AI images created on the site.Addressing concerns that sexualised images of adults and children had been generated by Grok, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it was \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting\".He said Ofcom had the government's \"full support\" to act on the content.\"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table,\" he said in an interview with Greatest Hits Radio.Government sources told BBC News: \"We would expect Ofcom to use all powers at its disposal in regard to Grok and X.\"Ofcom's powers under the Online Safety Act include being able to seek a court order to prevent third parties from helping the Elon Musk-owned platform raise money or be accessed in the UK.The BBC has approached the regulator for comment.Grok is a free tool which users can tag directly in posts or replies under other users' posts to ask it for a particular response.But the feature has also allowed people to request it to edit images - and ask it to digitally strip people of most of their clothing.Grok has fulfilled many user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing - something those subject to such requests have told the BBC left them feeling \"humiliated\" and \"dehumanised\".However as of Friday morning, Grok has told users asking it to alter images uploaded to X that \"image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers\".It adds users \"can subscribe to unlock these features\".Some posts on the platform seen by BBC News suggest only those with a blue tick \"verified\" mark - exclusive to X's paid subscriber tier - were able to successfully request image edits to Grok.Dr Daisy Dixon, a female X user who said she had seen an increase in people using Grok to undress her, welcomed the change but said it felt \"like a sticking plaster\".\"Grok needs to be totally redesigned and have built-in ethical guardrails to prevent this from ever happening again,\" she told the BBC.\"Elon Musk also needs to acknowledge this for what it is - yet another instance of gender-based violation.\"Prof McGlynn said X's move echoed its approach to pornographic Taylor Swift deepfakes on the platform last year - where it blocked searches for sexualised material generated of the popstar using a Grok AI video feature.\"He is doing this to stoke free speech arguments,\" she added. \"He will claim regulation is stifling people's use of this technology. But, all the regulation requires is that he takes necessary precautions to reduce harm.\"",

See you out there.\"Unfit Kyrgios gets organisers out of tight spot - analysisByBBC Sport tennis news reporterKyrgios not being fit enough to compete in five-set Grand Slam matches appears to have got tournament director Craig Tiley out of a tight spot.With three wildcard spaces left in the men's singles, somebody had to be left out of the equation and whatever Tiley decided would have been a contentious move.There is no doubt Wawrinka deserves the honour of a farewell appearance given what he has achieved in Melbourne and his career as a whole. The inclusion of the humble, hard-working veteran - and the opportunity to see one of the greatest single backhands in the game again on the biggest stage - will please many people.The divisive Kyrgios might be far from his peak but is undoubtedly still an attractive draw at Melbourne Park - as witnessed by the packed crowd which boisterously cheered him on against Britain's Jacob Fearnley last year.His recent performances showed he was physically short for top-level singles matches. In the much-maligned Battle of the Sexes he played at a pedestrian pace and looked troubled in a quick defeat on his ATP comeback in Brisbane. That paved the way for Jordan Thompson and Chris O'Connell to be awarded two of the spots - fulfilling the expectation of giving a leg-up to Australian players and boosting the home contingent - before Wawrinka was finally rewarded.",

    "body": "Russia hits Ukraine with rarely used Oreshnik missile in fresh strikes1 hour agoLaura GozziKyivReutersFour people were killed in Kyiv and 25 others injured, authorities saidRussia has used the Oreshnik ballistic missile as part of a massive overnight strike on Ukraine.Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv on Thursday night, where loud booms could be heard for several hours, setting the sky alight with explosions.It is only the second time that Moscow has used the Oreshnik, which was first deployed to hit the central city of Dnipro in November 2024.Russia's defence ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Vladimir Putin's residence in late December, which Kyiv denies carrying out.While the ministry did not specify what had been the Oreshnik's target, shortly before midnight (22:00 GMT) videos began circulating on social media showing numerous explosions on the outskirts of the western city of Lviv.President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border.The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It is thought to have a warhead that deliberately fragments during its final descent into several, independently targeted inert projectiles, causing distinctive repeated explosions moments apart.\"Such a strike close to EU and Nato border is a grave threat to the security on the European continent and a test for the transatlantic community,\" Ukrainian foreign minister Andrii Sybiha said. The strike was launched \"in response to [Putin's] own hallucinations,\" he added, referring to the alleged drone attack on the president's residence in December. The EU had immediately cast serious doubt on whether the drone strike ever happened, and last week Donald Trump said he did not think any such attack had taken place.On Friday EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. \"Putin doesn't want peace, Russia's reply to diplomacy is more missiles and destruction. This deadly pattern of recurring major Russian strikes will repeat itself until we help Ukraine break it,\" she wrote on X.Zelensky said in addition to the Oreshnik, 13 ballistic missiles targeted energy facilities and civilian infrastructure overnight, along with 22 cruise missiles and 242 drones.One damaged a building at the Qatari embassy, he added.He accused the attacks of aiming \"against the normal life of ordinary people\" during a cold spell and added everything possible was being done to restore heating and electricity.As Lviv and other western regions were targeted on Thursday night, more than a dozen missiles and hundreds of drones were deployed during the attack on Kyiv.A paramedic was among those killed while arriving at a damaged apartment in Kyiv. The capital's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, and Zelensky said it had been a \"double-tap\" hit – in which the first strike is followed by a second, killing rescuers who have arrived to help the injured.Two apartment buildings along the east bank of the Dnipro River and a high-rise building in the city's central district were also targeted.The power supply was disrupted in several of the city's neighbourhoods in the middle of a particularly harsh winter and as Kyiv braces for -15C (5F) temperatures this weekend.On Friday Klitschko urged Kyiv residents to leave temporarily if they were able to, and find warmth. \"Half of Kyiv's apartment buildings - nearly 6,000 - are currently without heat due to damage to the capital's critical infrastructure caused by a massive enemy attack,\" he wrote on social media.\"I also appeal to residents of the capital who have the opportunity to temporarily leave the city for places with alternative sources of power and heat to do so.\"The targeting of power plants has become a constant feature of this war, with Ukraine increasingly responding in kind to Russia's sustained attacks on energy infrastructure that regularly leave millions without access to electricity or heating.On Thursday night, as Moscow's attack on Ukraine was ongoing, half a million people in the Russian region of Belgorod were left without power following Ukrainian shelling of infrastructure, the local governor said. Authorities also said that a Ukrainian strike on a Russian power plant in the city of Oryol, further north, affected the water and heating systems. ",

    "body": "2 hours agoWill Grant,Central America correspondentandOlivia IrelandThe Venezuelan government has started releasing detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups, in what officials described as a goodwill gesture.Spain's foreign ministry said five of its nationals had been released. Among them is prominent Venezuelan-Spanish rights activist, Rocío San Miguel, her family confirmed to US media.The move comes after the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in a raid on the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, to face drug trafficking charges in New York.US President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social that the release of political prisoners - which has been a long-held US demand - was \"a very important and smart gesture\" from Venezuela.Trump added that Venezuela released the prisoners as a sign of \"seeking peace\" and as a result, he had cancelled a \"previously expected second wave of attacks\" on the country.Jorge Rodríguez, the head of Venezuela's National Assembly and the brother of its interim president Delcy Rodríguez, announced on state television that \"a significant number\" would be released immediately, without specifying the number or identity of prisoners being freed.Hundreds of political prisoners are detained in Venezuelan prisons, with only a handful thought to have been released so far. Jorge Rodríguez said the interim government was releasing them in the interest of \"national unity and peaceful coexistence\".Rocío San Miguel, a vocal critic of Maduro and a defence expert, was the first prisoner confirmed to be freed. Her family told the New York Times that she was taken to the Spanish embassy in Caracas.Arrested in 2024, she was accused of being involved in a plot to kill the then-president and faced charges of treason, conspiracy and terrorism. Her arrest shocked human rights activists and, because her whereabouts were unknown, was labelled as potential \"enforced disappearance\" by the UN Human Rights Office.Venezuelan human rights organisations - some of which have members or their founders in jail - welcomed the news with caution.Despite being a key lieutenant of Maduro, Delcy Rodríguez's interim administration has appeared willing to co-operate with the US since it took its leader and made sweeping declarations about the South American nation's future.Watch: BBC reports from outside Venezuela prison \"El Helicoide\" as detainees releasedAbout 50 to 80 prisoners are believed to be held at the notorious El Helicoide prison, which US President Donald Trump announced would be closed following Maduro's capture. The prison gained international notoriety for detaining alleged political opponents, with reports by human rights groups of torture including beatings and electrocution. The announcement also comes shortly after US President Donald Trump stated that he had \"given orders to close that prison,\" which had become one of the most notorious symbols of political repression in the country.Venezuelan human rights group Provea warned El Helicoide's anticipated closure should not deflect attention from the other detention sites still running across the country. Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies in prison, has repeatedly demanded releases. In a sit-down interview with the Fox News show Hannity, Trump said Machado was expected to come to the US \"next week sometime\". Machado told host Sean Hannity earlier in the week that she wanted to give the US president her Nobel Peace Prize. When asked by Hannity whether Trump would accept the offer, he said \"that would be a great honour\". Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years the government used detentions to stamp out dissent and silence critics. Since the widely disputed 2024 election, the opposition claimed legal proceedings against activists, journalists and political adversaries increased. Attorney General Tarek Saab and others in the government repeatedly denied Venezuela held political prisoners, arguing those detained were arrested for genuine crimes.

    "body": "21 hours agoGuy HedgecoeMadridEPAThe deal is expected to expand the number of victims who can seek compensationSpain's Roman Catholic Church has reached an agreement with the government to compensate victims of sexual abuse by members of the clergy.The accord follows complaints that religious leaders had failed to tackle the issue adequately.It means the government will manage possible compensation in co-ordination with the Church, handling cases where other legal avenues are no longer available because the alleged crime took place too long ago or the individual accused has passed away.Hundreds of thousands of Spaniards are estimated by the government to have suffered sexual abuse at the hands of Church figures. The move follows similar redress schemes in other nations where abuse has been uncovered.\"A democracy should not allow the existence of victims who have never been compensated [and] whose situation, on the contrary, had been covered up,\" said Justice Minister Félix Bolaños after signing the agreement.He added that the agreement sought to \"pay off an historic, moral debt that we had with victims of abuse within the Church\".The other signatories were Luis Argüello, president of the Episcopal Conference and leader of the Spanish Catholic Church, and Jesús Díaz Sariego, president of Confer, which represents Catholic congregations and religious orders.Mr Sariego said the initiative was unprecedented as it tackled crimes that had gone past the statute of limitations.Argüello, who is archbishop of Valladolid, described the accord as \"another step forward along the path that for years we have been travelling\".A 2023 study by the Spanish ombudsman's office, which investigates public complaints, estimated that 1.1% of the population had suffered sexual abuse at the hands of members of the clergy or individuals linked to the Church - the equivalent of 440,000 people.The Church has contested these findings. It set up a reparation scheme that year to manage abuse claims. However, both the Socialist-led government and victims' organisations have been dissatisfied with the scheme's model, which did not allow input or oversight from outside the Church.In November, the Church said that 58 cases had been \"resolved\" under its framework. However, critics accused the institution of a lack of transparency and slowness. Newspaper El País, which has created a database of clerical abuse allegations, has documented cases affecting 2,948 victims dating back as far as the 1940s.Last June, several victims' groups broke off ties with the Spanish Church, alleging that it had excluded them from seeking reparations. The Vatican subsequently appeared to take a more prominent role, with the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors meeting Spanish victims and urging the country's Catholic leaders to bolster and facilitate reparations. Meetings between Justice Minister Bolaños and the Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, appear to have raised the pressure further on the Church authorities in Madrid.EPAPope Francis apologised many times about the scandal that shook the Catholic ChurchUnder the new system, victims will be able to file their cases before a new agency created by the justice ministry, which will then take them before the ombusdman's office, which will draw up a reparation proposal. The Church must then agree to the proposed compensation – if not, the case will be referred back to the ombudsman.Reparation can be symbolic, psychological, or economic, according to the agreement. In each case, the Church is responsible for its execution.The amount of financial compensation that could be paid out is not specified.However, the ombudsman has suggested following the lead of other European countries.In Belgium, an average of €6,000 ($7,000; £5,210) has been paid to victims in such cases, although the late Pope Francis described that amount as \"too small\".Ireland's redress board paid out an average of around €63,000 to victims.Sexual abuse by members of the clergy first received significant attention in the US and Canada in the 1980s.In the 1990s, the issue began to grow, with stories emerging in Argentina, Australia and revelations of widespread historical abuse in Ireland. By the early 2000s, sexual abuse within the Church was a major global story.Spain, a Catholic country, was affected by relatively few scandals in that time. However, investigations by the media have brought the issue to light more recently. In the most recent high-profile case, the bishop of Cádiz, Rafael Zornoza, resigned in November, following an accusation of abuse dating back to the 1990s.Victims' organisations have welcomed the new agreement in Spain.\"This is an endemic, structural evil which has been within the Church and which it should have tackled a long time ago instead of covering up paedophiles,\" said Juan Cuatrecasas, of the Association for Stolen Childhood (Anir), who said he was \"fully satisfied\".",

    "body": "21 hours agoTiffany WertheimerRenee Nicole GoodRenee Nicole Good was an award-winning poetThe woman shot dead by a federal immigration agent in Minneapolis has been identified as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mother of three who had just moved to the city.She was a prize-winning poet and a hobby guitarist, who city leaders have said was there as a legal observer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities.But the Trump administration has called her a \"domestic terrorist\".Good's death has sparked protests across the country, with many people holding signs that read \"Justice for Renee\".Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"probably terrified\" during the confrontation with officers that saw her fatally shot and that she was \"one of the kindest people I've ever known\".\"She was extremely compassionate,\" Ganger told the daily newspaper. \"She's taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving and affectionate. She was an amazing human being.\"Her father, Tim Ganger, told the Washington Post that \"she had a good life, but a hard life\".A fundraiser for Good's family, which was set up with a target of $50,000 (£37,000), raised more than $1.4m a day after it was created.A US citizen, Good was originally from Colorado Springs.In what appears to be her Instagram account, which has now been made private, she  described herself as a \"poet and writer and wife and mom\", who was \"experiencing Minneapolis\".She had two children, who are now teenagers, with her first husband. Speaking to US media on condition that his name was not used, he said that Good was not an activist and that she was a devoted Christian who went to Northern Ireland on youth missions when she was younger.She hosted a podcast with her second husband, Tim Macklin, who died in 2023. They had a son together, who is now six years old, Macklin's father told the Minnesota Star Tribune. Her third marriage was to Rebecca Good, with whom she moved to Minneapolis just last year, from Kansas City, a neighbour told the Washington Post.Renee Good had previously worked as a dental assistant and at a credit union, but had mainly been a stay-at-home mum in recent years, according to the Associated Press.Getty ImagesPeople have left flowers, candles and messages at a make-shift memorial for Good in MinneapolisGood studied creative writing at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2020 she won an undergraduate prize from the Academy of American Poets for her piece entitled On Learning to Dissect Fetal Pigs.\"When she is not writing, reading, or talking about writing, she has movie marathons and makes messy art with her daughter and two sons,\" her biography from the prize reads, as quoted in US media. It seems to have now been removed.Good graduated the same year from the university's College of Arts and Letters with a degree in English.Its president said in a statement that her sudden death was \"yet another clear example that fear and violence have sadly become commonplace in our nation\".\"May Renee's life be a reminder of what unites us: freedom, love, and peace,\" Old Dominion University president Brian Hemphill wrote.Several state leaders have said that Good was at the scene of an ICE raid in the south of Minneapolis as a legal observer - a volunteer who monitors police and security forces at protests and operations. Good's mother told the Minnesota Star Tribune that her daughter was \"not part of anything\" that involved challenging ICE agents.But White House officials, including the president, have said Good was not simply observing, but also interfering in the officers' work.US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Good had been \"stalking and impeding their work\" all day by \"blocking them in\" with her car and \"shouting at them\".Good \"weaponised her vehicle\", Noem told reporters, and then tried to run over one of the officers \"in an attempt to kill or cause bodily harm to agents, an act of domestic terrorism\".The ICE agent feared for his life, Noem said, and \"fired defensive shots\".This account was backed up by Trump, who wrote on Truth Social that \"the woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting\".He called her a \"professional agitator\" who \"violently, willfully, and viciously\" ran over an ICE officer.But the city's mayor said the agent who shot Good had acted recklessly.\"Having seen the video myself, I want to tell everybody directly: that is bullshit,\" Jacob Frey said. \"This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed.\"Good reportedly lived just a few blocks from where she was killed, and the scene is about one mile from where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a city police officer, sparking worldwide anti-racism protests.",

    "body": "US Vice-President JD Vance says Greenland is \"critical\" for the defence of the US and the world against possible Russian or Chinese missile attacks - and that Europe and Denmark have \"not done a good job\" in securing the area.Vance told Fox News that they had not only under-invested in Greenland's defences, but also failed to engage with President Donald Trump's argument over the issue.US officials are \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - the White House said on Wednesday, a day after suggesting military action to annex it to the US was also an option.Denmark, a fellow Nato member, has warned this would spell the end of the alliance.Both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly stressed the island is not for sale.Despite being the most sparsely populated territory, Greenland's location between North America and the Arctic makes it well placed for early warning systems in the event of missile attacks, and for monitoring vessels in the region.The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at its Pituffik base in Greenland's north-western tip - a facility that has been operated by the US since World War Two.Under existing agreements with Denmark, the US has the power to bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland.In recent years, there has also been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources - including rare earth minerals, uranium and iron - which are becoming easier to access as its ice melts due to climate change. Scientists think it could also have significant oil and gas reserves.\"People do not realise that the entire missile defence infrastructure is partially dependent on Greenland,\" Vance said in his interview on Wednesday.\"If God forbid the Russians and the Chinese - not saying they're going to - but if, God forbid, somebody launched a nuclear missile into our continent, they launched a nuclear missile at Europe, Greenland is a critical part of that missile defence. \"So you ask yourself, 'have the Europeans, have the Danes done a proper job of securing Greenland and of making sure it can continue to serve as an anchor for world security and missile defence?' And the answer is obviously they haven't,\" he said. Concerns over the future of the territory resurfaced after Trump's use of military force against Venezuela on Saturday to seize its President Nicolás Maduro. Trump previously made an offer to buy the island in 2019, during his first presidential term, only to be told it was not for sale.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that he would hold talks with Denmark next week.A day earlier, European leaders issued a joint statement rallying behind Denmark.\"Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations,\" the leaders of France, the UK, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in a joint statement.Stressing they were as keen as the US on Arctic security, the European signatories said this must be achieved by Nato allies, including the US, \"collectively\".They also called for \"upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders\".Aaja Chemnitz, one of two MPs in the Danish parliament representing Greenland, told the BBC that the comments from the Trump administration were \"a clear threat\".\"It's completely disrespectful from the US side to not rule out annexing our country and to annex another Nato ally,\" she said.But Chemnitz said she saw this as unlikely and that instead, \"what we are going to see is that they will put pressure on us in order to make sure that they will take over Greenland over time\".Aleqatsiaq Peary, a 42-year-old Inuit hunter living in Greenland's remote northerly town of Qaanaaq, appeared indifferent to the potential of US ownership.\"It would be switching from one master to another, from one occupier to another,\" he told the BBC. \"We are a colony under Denmark. We are already losing a lot from being under the Danish government.\"Saying that he did not have \"time for Trump\", he added that people were \"in need\". Hunters like him, he explained, hunted with dogs on the sea ice and fish \"but the sea ice is melting and hunters cannot make a living anymore\".Additional reporting by Adrienne Murray in Copenhagen",

    "body": "Influential China church reports arrests as crackdown on Christians intensifies1 day agoKelly NgWatch: Video appears to show part of Yayang Church being taken downAn influential Protestant church in China says prominent leaders have been arrested in what appears to be a growing crackdown on the underground church movement.Nine people were detained on Tuesday after police raided their homes and the church office in Chengdu, in central China, the Early Rain Covenant Church said. Five had been released by Wednesday.More than 1,000 miles away in Wenzhou, authorities began demolishing the Yayang Church building, video obtained by non-profit ChinaAid, which monitors religious persecution, shows.This latest wave of arrests, after others last year, shows the Communist Party's resolve to snuff out churches that do not align with its ideology, Christian groups say.The BBC has contacted China's embassy in the UK for comment. Authorities have not made any statements about the arrests or the demolition in Wenzhou.China promotes atheism and controls religion. The government said in 2018 that there were 44 million Christians in the country, but it's unclear if that number includes those who attend the many underground churches.The Communist Party has long pressured Christians to join only state-sanctioned churches led by government-approved pastors. But Christian groups say the grip has tightened noticeably, with arrests becoming more common and prompt. At least two church leaders in China have told the BBC that authorities are swiftly arresting unauthorised church leaders. In the past, these individuals would first be warned, then fined and finally detained if they still refused to comply with orders.Getty ImagesUnder Xi Jinping, China has tightened its grip on religious freedomJust weeks ago, Li Yingqiang, the current leader of Early Rain Covenant Church, had said he \"sensed a storm gathering\" and referred to \"the imminent prospect of... another large-scale crackdown\".\"I dearly hope that none of our families shall ever again endure such a storm,\" he wrote in a letter to church members in November. \"Yet as an elder appointed by the Lord to stand among you... it is my duty to remind you all to prepare yourselves before the storm returns.\" Mr Li and his wife, Zhang Xinyue, are among the four who remain in detention. Their church described the arrests as a \"concerted operation\" but said the grounds for arrest, and whether those detained had been charged, remain unclear. It added that it had lost contact with two other members but did not say they had been detained.\"The situation is ongoing, with specific details yet to be fully confirmed,\" Early Rain Covenant Church (ERCC) said in a statement to members and supporters. It also also sought prayers for its members' safety and their perseverance in the Christian faith.In Wenzhou, local authorities brought in bulldozers, cranes and heavy machinery earlier this week to start taking down part of the Yayang Church building, as seen in the video. ChinaAid said it was told by multiple sources that hundreds of armed and special police officers have been deployed to stand guard outside the building.Sometimes known as \"the Jerusalem of China\", Wenzhou has more Christians than any other city in the country. Residents living near Yayang Church have been \"driven away\", while those working in the area has been instructed not to take photographs or record video, ChinaAid said.\"The massive mobilisation against the two major independent church networks shows the central government is determined to stamp out Christian churches entirely, unless the church is totally indoctrinated into the party's ideology,\" said Bob Fu, who founded ChinaAid.ChinaAidLocal authorities have started taking down part of Yayang Church's buildingIn December, authorities arrested about 100 members of Yayang Church in Wenzhou over five days. At least 24 members remain in custody, according to Human Rights Watch. And in October last year, 30 leaders of Zion Church - one of China's biggest underground churches - were rounded up across seven cities. Founder Ezra Jin is still in custody.The Chinese government has also targeted the Early Rain Covenant Church, founded in 2008, for years. In 2018, authorities raided the Church and arrested founding pastor Wang Yi and his wife Jiang Rong. At least 100 church members were taken into custody in the following days in one of China's largest crackdowns on churches in the past decade.Mr Wang, an outspoken critic of the Communist Party's policies on religion, was jailed for \"inciting subversion of state power\" and \"illegal business operations\". He is due to be released in 2027.The church has continued to gather online and sometimes replays Mr Wang's recorded sermons to its members.\"Xi Jinping's government has tightened ideological control and intensified its intolerance of loyalties beyond the Chinese Communist Party,\" said Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, referring to the Chinese premier.\"Concerned governments and religious leaders around the world should press the Chinese government to free detained religious adherents and respect religious freedom in China.\"Under Xi, China has increased its control on religious freedom. Since 2015, he has called for the \"Sinicisation of religions\", which requires religious doctrines and practices to conform with Chinese culture and values. Last year, authorities banned clergy of all religions from preaching live on social media, organising online activities for children and raising funds online, unless these are carried out on government-approved platforms.",

    "body": "'How do we look Indian?': Student's killing puts spotlight on racism in India11 hours agoAbhishek DeyGuwahatiGetty ImagesAnjel Chakma, 24, died in a hospital in Dehradun, 17 days after being attacked by a group of menThe northern Indian city of Dehradun, located in the Himalayan foothills, was shaken by a violent incident weeks ago.Brothers Anjel and Michael Chakma - students who had migrated more than 1,500 miles from the north-eastern state of Tripura for studies - had gone to a market on 9 December when they were confronted by a group of men, who allegedly abused them with racial slurs, their father Tarun Chakma told the BBC.When the brothers protested, they were attacked. Michael Chakma was allegedly struck on the head with a metal bracelet, while Anjel Chakma suffered stab wounds. Michael has recovered but Anjel died 17 days later in hospital, he says.Police in Uttarakhand state (whose capital is Dehradun) have arrested five people in connection with the incident, but they have denied that the attack was racially motivated - a claim that Chakma's family strongly disputes.The incident, which has triggered protests in several cities, has put the spotlight on allegations of racism faced by people from India's north-eastern states when they move to larger cities for education or work. They say they are often mocked over their appearance, questioned about nationality and harassed in public spaces and workplaces.For many, the discrimination extends beyond abuse to everyday barriers that shape where and how they live. People from the region report difficulty renting accommodation, with landlords refusing tenants because of their appearance, food habits or stereotypes. Such pressures have led many north-eastern migrants in large cities to cluster in specific neighbourhoods, offering safety, mutual support and cultural familiarity far from home.But while many say they learn to endure everyday prejudices to build lives elsewhere in the country, violent crimes such as Anjel Chakma's killing are deeply unsettling. They reinforce fears about personal safety and a sense of vulnerability, they say.Getty ImagesProtesters demand an anti-racism law in India in the aftermath of Anjel Chakma's killingIndia has seen many high-profile cases of racial violence involving people from the north-eastern region over the last several years.The killing of Nido Tania in 2014 became a national flashpoint, prompting protests and widespread debate about racism after the 20-year-old student from Arunachal Pradesh state was beaten to death in Delhi following taunts about his appearance.But activists say it did not mark an end to such violence. In 2016, a 26-year-old student from the region was beaten up in Pune. A year later, another student was racially abused and assaulted by his landlord in Bengaluru. Rights groups say there are many such incidents that do not grab national attention.  \"Unfortunately, the racism faced by people from the north-east tends to be highlighted only when something extremely violent happens,\" said Suhas Chakma, director of the Delhi-based Rights and Risks Analysis Group.The federal government in its annual crime reports does not maintain separate data for racial violence.For Ambika Phonglo from the north-eastern Assam state, who lives and works in the capital, Anjel Chakma's killing has been deeply unsettling. \"Our facial features like narrow eyes and flat noses make us easy targets of racism,\" she says.Phonglo recalls being subjected to racial name-calling by colleagues during a workplace discussion a few years ago. \"You face it and learn to move on,\" she says, \"but not without carrying a heavy burden of trauma.\"Mary Wahlang, from neighbouring state of Meghalaya, said she decided to return home after college in the southern state of Karnataka, abandoning plans to seek work in larger cities, after repeated racial name-calling by classmates. \"Over time I realised that some people used these slurs without understanding they were racial or hurtful, while others did so despite knowing the consequences,\" she says.Such experiences, activists say, are not isolated, with many from north-eastern states describing racial taunts and everyday discrimination as a routine part of life in workplaces, campuses and public spaces across the country's major cities.While awareness about the north-eastern region and the racism people from there face have improved over the years, casual racism persists, they say.\"How do we look Indian enough? Sadly, there are no clear answers,\" says Alana Golmei, member of a monitoring committee set up by the federal government in 2018 in the wake of increasing complaints of racial violence in Indian cities. She says that dismissing such attacks as isolated incidents unrelated to racism only deepens the problem. \"One has to first accept and acknowledge the issue to begin addressing it,\" Golmei told the BBC.Getty ImagesIndia has seen many cases of violence involving people from the north-eastern statesThe killing of Anjel Chakma has renewed calls for a specific anti-racism law. Several student and civil society groups have issued open letters demanding legal reform.After Nido Tania's death in 2014, the Indian government set up a committee to examine discrimination faced by people from the north-east living outside of the region.The panel submitted its report to the home ministry the same year, acknowledging widespread racism and recommending several measures, including a standalone anti-racism law, fast-track investigations and institutional safeguards.But activists say little has changed since. No specific anti-racism legislation has been enacted, and many of the recommendations remain only partially implemented.The BBC has sought clarification from the federal government, but they are yet to respond.The renewed demands over an anti-racism law have revived a broader debate over whether legislation can address prejudice, often seen as rooted in social behaviour.Experts and activists such as Chakma and Golmei argue that it can. They cite laws criminalising dowry and caste-based atrocities, arguing that while these haven't ended abuse, they have empowered victims and raised awareness.\"An anti-racism law could empower victims, improve reporting and place racial abuse clearly within the scope of criminal accountability,\" Golmei said.Meanwhile in Tripura, Tarun Chakma mourns his elder son while facing uncertainty over his younger one: Michael, a final-year sociology student, is expected to return to Dehradun to complete his studies.While family members have urged caution, Tarun Chakma says he is torn between fear for his son's safety and the belief that abandoning his education would amount to another loss. \"At the end of the day, higher education for a better future was the reason for which we had sent our sons so far away from home,\" he says.Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

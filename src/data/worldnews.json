    "body": "US President Donald Trump has said he will take legal action against the BBC over how his speech was edited by Panorama, after the corporation apologised but refused to compensate him.Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening, Trump said: \"We'll sue them for anywhere between $1bn [£759m] and $5bn, probably sometime next week.\"On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of the 6 January 2021 speech had unintentionally given \"the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action\" and said it would not be broadcast again.The corporation apologised to the president but said it would not pay financial compensation.The BBC released that statement after Trump's lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for $1bn in damages unless the corporation issued a retraction, apology and paid him compensation. \"I think I have to do it,\" Trump told reporters of his plan to take legal action. \"They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\"The president said he had not raised the issue with Sir Keir Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him. Trump said he would call Starmer over the weekend.A search of public court record databases confirmed that no lawsuit had been filed in federal or state court in Florida as of Friday evening.In a separate interview on Saturday recorded before his comments on Air Force One, Trump said he had an \"obligation\" to sue the BBC, adding: \"If you don't do it, you don't stop it from happening again with other people.\"He called the edit \"egregious\" and \"worse than the Kamala thing\", a reference to a dispute he had with US news outlet CBS over an interview on the 60 Minutes programme with his 2024 election opponent Kamala Harris.In July this year, US media company Paramount Global agreed to pay $16m (£13.5m) to settle a legal dispute over that interview.Sir Craig Oliver, former BBC editor and ex-director of politics and communications for former Prime Minister David Cameron, told BBC Today programme that this is a \"nightmare\" situation for the public broadcaster. \"The problem is that public money could be spent fighting this or settling this,\" Sir Craig said, adding that Trump doesn't \"understand the BBC, how it is funded or how it works\". Watch: Trump says he will sue the BBC. Gary O'Donoghue explains what's nextThe controversy stems from the way in which Trump's 6 January 2021 speech was edited by Panorama for a documentary which aired in October 2024. During his address, he told supporters: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.\"More than 50 minutes later in the speech, he said: \"And we fight. We fight like hell.\"In the Panorama programme the clip shows him as saying: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"Controversy around how Trump's speech was edited has led to the resignations of BBC director general Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness.In its Corrections and Clarifications section, published on Thursday evening, the BBC said the Panorama programme had been reviewed after criticism of how Trump's speech had been edited.\"We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" the statement said.Lawyers for the BBC have written to Trump's legal team, a BBC spokesperson said this week.\"BBC chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the corporation are sorry for the edit of the president's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" they said.They added: \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\"In its letter to Trump's legal team, the BBC set out five main arguments for why it did not think it had a case to answer.First it said the BBC did not have the rights to, and did not, distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels.When the documentary was available on BBC iPlayer, it was restricted to viewers in the UK.Secondly, it said the documentary did not cause Trump harm, as he was re-elected shortly after.Thirdly, it said the clip was not designed to mislead, but just to shorten a long speech, and that the edit was not done with malice.Fourthly, it said the clip was never meant to be considered in isolation. Rather, it was 12 seconds within an hour-long programme, which also contained lots of voices in support of Trump.Finally, an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US.The BBC's apology came hours after a second similarly edited clip, broadcast on Newsnight in 2022, was revealed by the Daily Telegraph.Watch: How the BBC works... in under two minutes",

    "body": "Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has confirmed it seized a tanker on Friday morning in the Strait of Hormuz.The Talara tanker, sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands, was travelling from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Singapore.The IRGC said it was found to be \"in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo\", but did not provide details of the violation. Reports suggest it was carrying high-sulphur gasoil. Iran has periodically seized tankers and cargo ships travelling in and around the Persian Gulf, which is a key global shipping route for oil and liquefied natural gas. It has often cited maritime violations such as smuggling or legal issues. Maritime security company Ambrey said the Talara tanker had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a \"sudden course deviation\".The US Navy's 5th fleet, which patrols the region, said on Friday it was \"actively monitoring the situation\".\"Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,\" it added. The company that manages the ship announced it had lost contact with the crew on Friday morning, while the tanker was 20 nautical miles off the coast of Sharjah's Khorfakkan port.The UK's Maritime Trade Operations Centre said it had received reports on the incident and advised vessels \"to transit with caution and report any suspicious activity\". Iran has for years threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of all traded oil passes, in retaliation for Western sanctions and other actions against it. Its threats ramped up during the 12-day conflict with Israel in June - during which Israel and United States carried out a bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities, and Iran retaliated by striking Israel. In April 2024, the IRGC seized a commercial ship with links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran's consulate in Syria which was blamed on Israel.",

It is not clear if there were passengers on board. The incident occurred near the Royal Institute of Technology university.Images from the scene show rescue crews appearing to help people trapped underneath the double-decker bus.A witness who owns a shop on the street told SVT the bus hit a pole in front of the bus shelter. They said several people ran into the shop crying.A woman told the local Expressen newspaper that the bus \"mowed down an entire bus stop queue\". She said people were screaming and trying to help the injured, while dead people lay on the ground.\"There must have been more people under the bus,\" she said.Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said his thoughts were with the victims and their families.\"People who might have been on their way home to family, friends, or a quiet evening at home. We do not yet know the cause, but right now my thoughts are primarily with those affected and their loved ones,\" he posted on X.",

    "body": "A young French campaigner, who set up an association to help victims of drugs violence and took their cause to President Emmanuel Macron, has lost a second brother to suspected criminal gangs in Marseille.Amine Kessaci's 20-year-old brother Mehdi was parking his car in the centre of the city, when a motorcycle drew up and the pillion passenger opened fire with a 9mm pistol.Their elder brother, Brahim, was murdered in 2020. He was shot and his charred body found in a burned-out car, a common method in gang killings known locally as a \"barbecue\".Marseille is renowned for worsening drugs wars, with rival gangs from high-immigration neighbourhoods in the north of the city battling over turf. While Amine's murdered elder brother, Brahim, was known to have become involved with drugs gangs, investigators say that was not true of Mehdi, who had ambitions to become a policeman. They fear the murder was a warning aimed at Amine.\"That hypothesis is absolutely not being ruled out,\" said Marseille chief prosecutor Nicolas Bessone on French radio.\"And if it turns out to be the case, it will mean we have crossed another threshold.  It brings back certain terrible periods in our country's history, when you went out and killed people simply because they were from a family with whom you had problems.\"After his elder brother's murder, Amine set up an association called Conscience, which aims to help young people in Marseille's poor estates to escape the clutches of powerful drugs gangs.He was a high-school student at the time, and then last year ran unsuccessfully for the Green Party in European and legislative elections. He recently wrote a book called Marseille Wipe your Tears – Life and Death in a Land of Drugs and now, aged 22, he lives under police protection after receiving death threats.\"It's just so sad for my friend and for his mother,\" said Christine Juste, a Green Party city councillor in Marseille.\"No mother should go through that — losing two children. And I'm so angry that in France's second city,  people can be murdered so easily in plain daylight.\"Vendettas spawn successions of revenge murders, with killers sometimes as young as 15. So far there have been 14 drugs-related murders this year.Amine Kessaci's association, Conscience, has branches in several other towns and cities. Its main activities involve providing help and advice to families who have lost sons in drugs violence, and creating links between ex-delinquents and employers.When he was 17, Amine was selected to meet Emmanuel Macron when the president came to Marseille in 2021 to discuss projects to improve life in the city.  A local newspaper dubbed him in its headline: \"The kid from the estates who has Macron's ear.\"Explaining his decision to run for election the young campaigner wrote in his book: \"Politics never held out its hand to me, so I decided to grab it by the throat. Brahim – it was you who threw me into politics the day you burned in a car.\"",

    "body": "14 hours agoDanielle Kaye,Business reporter and Nardine SaadUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing a range of food products, including coffee, bananas and beef, to escape his sweeping tariffs.The move comes as his administration faces mounting pressure over rising prices. While Trump previously downplayed concerns about the cost of living, he has focused on the issue since his Republican Party's poor performance in last week's elections.The dozens of products included on the White House's list of exemptions range from avocados and tomatoes to coconuts and mangoes.These goods, the Trump administration said on Friday, cannot be produced in sufficient quantities domestically.Trump has long said that his tariffs - currently a baseline 10% on imports from all countries, with additional levies on many trading partners - would not lead to increased prices for US consumers. He also said affordability was a \"new word\" and a \"con job\" by Democrats.He has argued the taxes are necessary to reduce the US trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods it buys from other countries and those it sells to them. Trump has said the US has been exploited by \"cheaters\" and \"pillaged\" by foreigners, adding that higher levies would encourage those in the US to buy American goods instead. But grocery costs and the soaring price of beef has become a political issue for Trump. Last week, he called for an investigation into the meat-packing industry, accusing companies of \"Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation\".He has aimed to rally support for the taxes, offering $2,000 tariff rebate cheques to Americans - even as the US Supreme Court is currently weighing whether Trump had the legal authority to implement them.  But the latest exemptions signal a reversal by the Trump administration, as the White House seeks to lower prices by walking back levies on some food staples.Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said the decision will affect products that are not produced in the US, \"so there's no protection of our industries, or our food products\".He added that he doesn't think more policy rollbacks will be required in the future, saying \"I don't think it'll be necessary.\" \"We just did a little bit of a rollback on some foods, like coffee as an example, where the prices of coffee were a little bit high. Now they'll be on the low side in a very short period of time,\" Trump said.Economists have warned that companies would pass the cost of tariffs onto their customers in the form of higher prices.While inflation remained milder than many analysts had expected in September, most items tracked in the Department of Labor inflation report showed price increases, with groceries up 2.7% from last year.The Trump administration's new tariff exemptions for food products take effect retroactively at midnight on Thursday 13 November, the White House said.In another move to address concerns among consumers about grocery prices, the Trump administration said import taxes on coffee and bananas will be lowered as part of trade deals with four Latin American countries.This week, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both vowed to decrease coffee prices by 20% in the US this year.The White House released a list that includes more than 100 products no longer subject to the levies. Some of them include: CoffeeCocoaBlack teaGreen teaVanilla beansBeef products, including high-quality cuts, bone-in and boneless cuts, corned beef, some frozen items, as well as salted, brined, dried or smoked meatFruits, including acai, avocadoes, bananas, coconuts, guavas, limes, oranges, mangoes, plantains, pineapples, various peppers and tomatoesSpices, including allspice, bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, curry, dill fennel seeds, ginger, mace, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, saffron and turmericNuts, grains, roots and seeds, such as barley, Brazil nuts, capers, cashews, chestnuts, macadamia nuts, miso, palm hearts, pine nuts, poppy seeds, tapioca, taro and water chestnuts",

    "body": "A man who jumped over a barricade and grabbed actress Ariana Grande at a Wicked: For Good premiere in Singapore has been charged with being a public nuisance. A now viral video shows the Australian man, Johnson Wen, pushing past photographers and charging at Grande while the cast made its way down a yellow carpet surrounded by fans. Co-star Cynthia Erivo could be seen wrestling the stunned actress away from Mr Wen. The 26-year-old had posted on Instagram late on Thursday that he was \"free after being arrested\". However, on Friday afternoon, he was charged with being a public nuisance by a Singapore court.  The incident caused massive outrage in the city state.Local media reports say Mr Wen, who was unrepresented, intends to plead guilty. This is not the first time Mr Wen, who describes himself as a \"Troll Most Hated\", has invaded a concert or event. His Instagram feed includes clips of him disrupting other celebrity events, including jumping on stage at Katy Perry's Sydney concert in June this year. He did the same at a concert by The Chainsmokers last December.If found guilty, he may be fined up to S$2000 ($1540; £1170). Fans had earlier called for him to be arrested and deported. \"There needs to be action [taken] against him as this is clearly a criminal offence,\" wrote an Instagram user, in a comment a video Mr Wen posted of his act.  \"Oh wow so you do this a lot... how aren't you in jail?\" one Instagram user wrote. Several accused Mr Wen of \"re-traumatising\" Grande, who has spoken of experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder after a suicide bomb attack at the end of her May 2017 concert in Manchester, killing 22 people and injuring hundreds.\"Ariana has been through so many scary things... and at her Manchester concert and you thought it would be fun to jump the barricade?\" said another comment on Instagram. Some fans also criticised security officers at the Thursday event for not being vigilant enough; while others called for social media platforms to ban Mr Wen's videos.In clips circulating online, Grande appeared shocked when she was grabbed by the intruder. Her co-stars Michelle Yeoh and Erivo can be seen comforting her while Mr Wen was escorted away by security.Grande has not commented on the incident, and the rest of the event proceeded as planned.The BBC has reached out to Singapore's police and immigration authority for comment.Hundreds of fans had gathered in a sea of green and pink at the Wicked: For Good Asia-Pacific premiere in a Singapore mall, including some who had stood in line for as long as eight hours before it began.The movie, to be released on 21 November, is the second of a two-part adaptation of the popular Broadway and West End musical Wicked, which centres on the unlikely friendship between two very different witches.The musical itself is a spin-off of the 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.Grande, who plays the good witch Glinda, was decked out in a champagne pink sequin dress at the premiere while Erivo, who plays the wicked witch, wore a black tube grown embroidered with roses.They were joined by co-star Jeff Goldblum who plays the wizard.The first movie, Wicked, was the highest-grossing movie of 2024 in the UK, and scored 10 Oscar nominations, winning two for best costume and production design.",

Nearly 200 countries are meeting to try to make progress on tackling climate change.Little progress was made in the first week of the talks, although some delegations say they are pushing for an agreed strategy to deliver on past promises to move away from using planet-warming fossil fuels.President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva of Brazil is hosting the talks and chose the city of Belém to put the world's focus on the Amazon and indigenous peoples.But shortly before the talks opened last week, his government granted permission to the Brazilian state oil company to explore for oil at the mouth of the Amazon.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump has withdrawn all support for Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a firebrand conservative who long supported Trump's agenda but recently criticised several of his policies.Trump said in a nearly 300-word social media post that the Georgia lawmaker had gone \"far left\", and called for her to be unseated in next year's midterm election by a Republican challenger. The falling out comes after Greene questioned whether Trump was still putting \"America First\" on his agenda. She criticised his focus on foreign policy and handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.Greene said Trump was lashing out to try and deter other Republicans from voting to release the files.\"All I see \"Wacky\" Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" Trump posted, while en route to his home in Florida on Friday night.He claimed that she turned on him after he suggested that she shouldn't run for governor or senator. \"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore,\" Trump said, adding, \"I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.\"Trump also said that voters in her district \"are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support\".Trump has long faced criticism from both parties over his handling of the US Department of Justice's files related to Epstein, the late financier and convicted paedophile. Trump was a friend of Epstein's for years, but the president has said they fell out in the early 2000s, two years before Epstein was first arrested. Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.Greene is one of four House Republicans - including Nancy Mace, Lauren Boebert, and Thomas Massie - who joined Democrats in signing a discharge petition calling for the release of the Epstein files.In response to Trump, Greene posted on X that Trump was trying to stop other Republicans from voting in favour of the Epstein petition.\"He's coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files,\" she posted, adding: \"It's astonishing really how hard he's fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.\"Greene has in recent days been attacking Trump for not doing enough to bring down costs for voters, and for his involvement in foreign conflicts, and tariff policies.But she has also fiercely criticised his approach to handing the Epstein files. \"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she told the BBC's US partner, CBS News, earlier on Friday.Their row continued into the weekend, as they traded barbs on social media. On Saturday, Trump posted several more times to call her a \"traitor\", a \"disgrace\", and \"just another Fake politician\".Greene also posted on X: \"I believe in the American people more than I believe in any leader or political party\", adding: \"The way forward is America First America Only.\"",

    "body": "A major data breach in Somalia's electronic visa system may have exposed personal information belonging to tens of thousands of applicants, including US citizens, the American embassy in Somalia has warned.It said had received credible reports that \"unidentified hackers\" had penetrated the Somali government's e-visa platform, potentially compromising data from at least 35,000 people.The leaked documents circulating online include names, photos, dates of birth, marital status, home addresses and email contacts, according to a US embassy statement issued on Thursday.\"This data breach is ongoing and could expose any personal data you enter into the system,\" the UK has also warned travellers.\"Consider the risks before applying for an e-visa required for travel to Somalia.\"Somali authorities have not commented on the breach. But the government has shifted its visa service from evisa.gov.so to etas.gov.so, without providing an official explanation.\"While Embassy Mogadishu is unable to confirm whether an individual's data is part of the breach, individuals who have applied for a Somali e-visa may be affected,\" the  US' statement said.The BBC has contacted the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority (SCAA) for comment.Somalia's new system requires all travellers, including those from the self-declared republic of Somaliland and the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, to apply for entry visas online.Critics say travellers have faced extra fees in certain regions, amounting to double charges.Somaliland, which declared independence in 1991, governs itself with its own institutions but has not been internationally recognised. Somalia maintains that the region remains part of its sovereign territory.The alleged breach adds to long-running tensions between Mogadishu and Hargeisa over control of Somali airspace. While Somalia re-established full control of its airspace in 2017, Somaliland continues to contest the arrangement.The dispute escalated further this week when Somaliland's President Abdirahman Irro said Somaliland would not accept Somalia's e-visa and ordered that airlines must obtain clearance from Hargeisa before entering its airspace.Yet major airlines have refused to board passengers without Somalia's e-visa approval.On Saturday, Somaliland's Foreign Minister Abdirahman Dahir Aadan again insisted that \"anyone travelling to Somaliland will obtain their visa on arrival\", saying Somalia's e-visa system was not safe and warning that \"people's data can fall into the hands of extremist groups\" as a result of using it.The stand-off has left some travellers heading to Somaliland stranded at airports after being denied boarding for lacking Somalia's e-visa.Somaliland's Civil Aviation Minister, Fu'aad Ahmed Nuux, has told the BBC that the directives - first announced earlier this year - came into effect on 10 November.He said airlines that do not comply will be told to divert, and claimed several aircraft had already been rerouted.Footage released by Somaliland's aviation ministry appears to show local air-traffic controllers issuing instructions to international pilots - a move celebrated domestically as an assertion of Somaliland's autonomy.But the Somalia Civil Aviation Authority insists it retains sole administrative and legal control over the Mogadishu Flight Information Region (FIR), which covers the whole nation's airspace. It has ordered all aircraft to ignore any instructions issued by authorities other than Mogadishu.It warned that failing to comply with Somali and international aviation rules could pose safety risks and lead to \"serious legal consequences\".Additional reporting by Natasha Booty.",

    "body": "7 minutes agoSarah RainsfordSouthern and Eastern Europe correspondent, RomeReutersPope Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as \"pilgrims of the imagination\", helping to \"bring hope\".The celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the \"troubling decline\" in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a \"great day\", the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate – and for its \"capacity to amaze\".But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called \"the world's wounds\".\"Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated,\" the Pope said. \"Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.\"Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leo's style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.EPA/ShutterstockSpike Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a customised New York Knicks shirt printed with Pope LeoIt's not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall – who came from all over the world – made it onto the Pope's own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite 4 watches of all time include the 1960s nun-themed classic, \"The Sound of Music\", and Italian Roberto Benigni's multi award-winning \"Life is Beautiful\".Among those who did join today's A-list audience were Viggo Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant – of \"Milk\" and \"Good Will Hunting\" fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the \"quiet dedication\" of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.ReutersThe audience for the international filmmakers was held beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the \"beating heart of communities\".\"More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity,\" the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Cate Blanchett.\"He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people,\" the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress – who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR – placed a woven bracelet in the Pope's hand. \"It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced,\" she explained later.Spike Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words \"Pope Leo\".",

    "body": "23 hours agoIone WellsSouth America CorrespondentAFP via Getty ImagesTens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud were unleashed through communities surrounding the damMining company BHP has been found liable for a 2015 dam collapse in Brazil, known as the country's worst-ever environmental disaster, by London's High Court.The dam collapse killed 19 people, polluted the river and destroyed hundreds of homes.The civil lawsuit, representing more than 600,000 people including civilians, local governments and businesses, had been valued at up to £36bn ($48bn).BHP said it would appeal against the ruling and continue to fight the lawsuit and has said many claimants in the London lawsuit had already been paid compensation in Brazil.The dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.The claimants' lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \"were in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\".A separate claim against Samarco's second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, was filed in the Netherlands, with more than 70,000 plaintiffs.The dam was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud. The sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people's homes and poisoning the river.Judge Finola O'Farrell said in her High Court ruling that continuing to raise the height of the dam when it was not safe to do so was the \"direct and immediate cause\" of the dam's collapse, meaning BHP was liable under Brazilian law.BHP is expected to appeal the ruling. President of BHP's Minerals Americas, Brandon Craig, said in a statement that 240,000 claimants in the London lawsuit \"have already been paid compensation in Brazil\".\"We believe this will significantly reduce the size and value of claims in the UK group action,\" he added.The lawsuit has been littered with different clashes between the UK firm representing the claimants, Pogust Goodhead, and BHP. BHP always denied liability and said the London lawsuit duplicated legal proceedings and reparation and repair programmes in Brazil.BHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims. It has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace the town of Novo Bento and has disbursed billions of dollars in repair and compensation actions to hundreds of thousands of people.In June, a presentation by BHP and Vale's Samarco venture said around 130,000 people in Brazil had reached settlements with them. In response, Pogust Goodhead alleged the companies had pressured claimants to \"settle their claims at far below their true value\" and that it would seek £1.3bn in unpaid fees lost as a result.It alleged that a $30.3bn compensation agreement which Brazil signed with BHP, Vale and Samarco in October 2024 prevented claimants from discussing the deal with the firm or paying its legal fees.The firm said it had incurred $1bn in borrowing costs to finance the English case.BHP said it rejected Pogust Goodhead's allegations in their entirety and dispute \"their factual and legal basis.\"It said the claims were \"without merit\" and BHP would \"vigorously contest them.\" A spokesperson also said that the firm continued to believe Brazil was the most appropriate, effective, and efficient place for compensation for the dam collapse.AFP via Getty ImagesSome of those affected by the disaster travelled to the High Court last yearBut there were also parallel claims that Pogust Goodhead – which promotes itself as a firm representing human rights and environmental law – had tried to profit off \"vulnerable\" Brazilians.During proceedings the firm was accused of \"misleading\" vulnerable Brazilians for its own gain by a Brazilian judge in the state of Minas Gerais.Pogust Goodhead rejected the accusation at the time as \"without merit\". In a claim brought by the Public Prosecutors and Public Defenders in Brazil against Pogust Goodhead, the judge criticised several \"allegedly abusive clauses\" in Pogust Goodhead's contracts with Brazilians who suffered damage.Among these, it alleges the law firm engaged in \"misleading advertising\" considering the \"hypervulnerability of those affected\".It also alleges \"undue charging of fees on compensation amounts obtained extrajudicially in Brazil\" which it said represents \"illicit enrichment that diverts essential resources from those affected\" and \"excessive\" penalties for claimants who terminated their contracts which it said \"discouraged\" them from joining national compensation programmes.The former Brazilian ambassador in London and Washington, Rubens Barbosa, told the BBC earlier this year that he believed this amounted to spreading misleading information in Brazil.Mr Barbosa said bringing the case to London \"hinders efforts to resolve the matter locally\" and the \"extremely vulnerable Brazilians were misled\" by contracts.",

    "body": "2 days agoMadeline HalpertKristy GammonMs Gammon and her husband used to enjoy travelling to the US to go to Baltimore Orioles gamesKristy Gammon used to travel to the US from Canada at least once every other year, taking ski trips at Lake Placid in New York and travelling to Baltimore, Maryland, for her husband's favourite Orioles baseball games.But those trips are now over, she said. This year, the Nova Scotia resident has avoided even passing through the US on her way to Ontario, a shortcut for an otherwise 18-hour drive.Since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, the 62-year-old said she and most of her Canadian friends have decided to stop visiting the US as a way of protesting policies they oppose and trade actions Trump has taken against Canada.\"There are so many things that we just feel aghast about in terms of how [the administration] is acting internationally, behaving toward their own citizens, how they're treating their allies and neighbours, i.e. Canada,\" Ms Gammon said.Ms Gammon and her friends are part of a trend that shows no signs of slowing. October marked the 10th straight month of decline in the number of Canadian travellers to the US. Air travel from Canada to the US dropped nearly 24%, while car travel fell more than 30% when compared to the same period last year, according to data released this week by Canada's statistics office.Overall, the US has seen a 3.2% drop in international spending in the country, driven primarily by fewer visitors from Canada, according to the US Travel Association, a nonprofit group representing the American travel industry.As relations between the two countries remain icy, mostly in response to new tariffs Trump has imposed, Canadians are apparently committed to giving their southern neighbours the cold shoulder.In the past, Canadians have made up about a quarter of all international visitors to the US, spending over $20bn (£15.1bn) a year, according to the US Travel Association.They began to curb their US travel after Trump imposed a series of tariffs on goods from the country earlier this year, saying he wanted to reduce the trade deficit - the gap between the value of goods the US buys from Canada and those it sells to them. Trump also said Canada should do more to reduce the flow of illegal drug fentanyl into the US.Canada is currently facing 35% tariffs on its goods - although most are exempt under an existing North American free trade agreement - as well as individual levies targeting particular industries like car and steel manufacturing.Trade talks between the two countries were derailed last month when Trump was angered by an anti-tariff advertisement in the US that featured Ronald Reagan and was sponsored by the province of Ontario.Meanwhile, he has angered Canadians with his many public comments about making their country the \"51st state\".Some popular tourist destinations in US have tried to buck the trend, attempting to entice Canadian travellers back to the US. In Kalispell, Montana, home to Glacier National Park, officials have been offering a \"Canadian Welcome Pass\" that includes deals and discounts at local businesses for those crossing the border.\"For the last several months, our countries have been going through some things. But there's one thing we know and it's this – we miss you,\" the website for the welcome pass says.Major events scheduled to take place in the US in the coming years could help drive visitors from other places and replace the missing Canadian tourists, including the FIFA 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, according to the US Travel Association.'Come hug it out!' - How a Canadian tourism ad went viralStill, with Canadians choosing to travel closer to home, the country's own tourism industry has gotten a boost. Canada's tourism sector made a record-breaking C$59bn from May to August of 2025, up 6% from the same period last year, mostly because of people choosing to travel domestically, according to Destination Canada, a national tourism organisation.Some of those choosing to stay home are Canadian snowbirds, retirees who travel south to states like Florida to find warmth in the winter months. A survey from the Travel Health Insurance Association of Canada found these baby boomers were staying home more than other age groups, with only 10% planning US trips for this year, down 66% compared to last year.Ms Gammon said some of her friends have even chosen to sell their winter homes in Florida because of the frosty relations and frustrations with the Trump administration.\"They've completely changed their snowbird plans,\" the semi-retired family physician said. \"You can feel there's a shift.\"Ms Gammon said she did not know if others would stick to boycotting the US for the remaining three years of the Trump administration. But, even though she misses her US trips, that is her plan for now.\"Who knows what could change between now and three years,\" Ms Gammon said. \"But it would have to be pretty significant changes for us personally to change our minds.\"",

It didn't look like a hospital to me,\" she told the BBC from her home in Manitoba.That hospital – once the home of a Scottish shipping magnate – would be her home for a month in April 1958, after a judge ordered the then-16-year-old to undergo treatment for \"disobedient\" behaviour.It was there that Ms Ponting became one of thousands of people experimented on as part of the CIA's top-secret research into mind control.

On Thursday, a judge denied the Royal Victoria Hospital's appeal, paving the way for the lawsuit to proceed.According to her medical files, which she obtained only recently, Ms Ponting had been running away from home and hanging out with friends her parents disapproved of after a difficult move with her family from Ottawa to Montreal.\"I was an ordinary teenager,\" she recalled. But the judge sent her to the Allan.Once there, she became an unwitting participant in covert CIA experiments known as MK-Ultra. The Cold War project tested the effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD, electroshock treatments and brainwashing techniques on human beings without their consent.Over 100 institutions – hospitals, prisons and schools – in the US and Canada were involved.At the Allan, McGill University researcher Dr Ewen Cameron drugged patients and made them listen to recordings, sometimes thousands of times, in a process he called \"exploring\".The Allan Memorial Institute in Montreal is where the CIA-backed experiments were conducted in CanadaDr Cameron would make Ms Ponting listen to the same tape recording hundreds of times.\"It ran over and over again, you're a good girl, you're a bad girl,\" Ms Ponting recalled.The technique was a form of \"psychic driving,\" says doctoral student Jordan Torbay, who has researched his experiments and their ethical implications.\"Essentially the minds of patients were manipulated using verbal cues,\" she says, adding he also looked at the effects of sleep drugs, forced sensory deprivation, and induced coma.Medical records show Ms Ponting was given LSD, as well as drugs like sodium amytal, a barbiturate, desoxyn, a stimulant, as well as nitrous oxide gas, a sedative known as laughing gas.\"By April 30th, the patient had explorations… she had become quite tense and extremely violent when given the Nitrous Oxide, throwing herself half out of bed and starting to scream,\" Dr Cameron wrote in one of her medical files, which Ms Ponting has obtained through a freedom of information request.The harsh truth about the MK-Ultra experiments first came to light in the 1970s. Since then, several victims have tried to sue the US and Canada. Lawsuits in the US have largely been unsuccessful, but in 1988, a Canadian judge ordered the US government to pay nine victims $67,000 each. In 1992 the Canadian government paid C$100,000 (about $80,000 at the time) to each of 77 victims – but did not admit liability.Ms Ponting was not among them, because she did not yet know that she was a victim, she saysWatch: The CIA's secret pursuit of 'mind control'Listen: The Woman Who Resisted Mind ControlFor decades, Ms Ponting said she felt something was wrong with her, but she did not learn of the details of her own involvement in the experiments until somewhat recently.She says she had little memory of what happened at the Allan, or in the years that followed.Ms Ponting eventually married and moved to Manitoba, where she had two children whom she is still close to. Now, she's a grandmother to four grandchildren. But she says she has suffered life-long repercussions from her time at the Allan.\"I felt it all my life, because I was wondering why I would think this way, or, you know what happened to me,\" she said.She says she's had to be on a cocktail of medications her whole life to deal with mental-health issues, which she attributes to her time at the Allan, as well as recurrent nightmares.\"Sometimes I wake up screaming in the night because of what happened,\" she said.The Royal Victoria Hospital and McGill University declined to comment as the case is before the courts. The government pointed the BBC to its previous settlement, in 1992, which it said was done for \"humanitarian\" reasons and did not accept legal liability.For Ms Pointing, the lawsuit is a chance to finally get some closure.\"Sometimes I sit in my living room and my mind goes back, and I can think of the things that happened to me, you know,\" she says. \"Every time I see a picture of Dr Cameron, it makes me so angry.\"Although Dr Cameron's work has since become synonymous with MK-Ultra experiments, Ms Torbay says her research shows he didn't know he was being funded by the CIA at the time. His work with the US intelligence agency ended in 1964, and he died shortly after, of a heart attack, in 1967.But regardless of whether he knew of where the money was coming from, Ms Torbay says he should have known the experiments he was conducting were not ethical.She says she hopes the lawsuit goes forward, and the victims get some sense of justice.\"It isn't really about giving the patients back what they lost, because that's not possible, but sort of almost making sure their suffering wasn't in vain, that we do learn from this,\" she says.",

    "body": "Pakistan's army has always been influential - now its chief has new powers16 hours agoCaroline DaviesPakistan correspondent, IslamabadEPAField Marshal Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee the navy and air forcePakistan's parliament has voted to give army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir new powers and lifetime immunity from arrest and prosecution, a move that critics say paves the way towards autocracy.The 27th constitutional amendment, which was signed into law on Thursday, will also make significant changes to the way the country's top courts operate.Those defending the changes say they provide clarity and administrative structure to the armed forces, while helping to ease a backlog in the courts. Pakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politics - sometimes seizing power in coups, and, on other occasions, pulling levers behind the scenes.Throughout its history, Pakistan has oscillated from more civilian autonomy to overt control under military leaders like General Pervez Musharraf and General Zia-ul-Haq. Analysts refer to the balance between civilian and military as hybrid rule.Some see the amendment as a sign that the balance is shifting in the military's favour.\"For me, this amendment is the latest indication, perhaps the strongest yet, that Pakistan is now experiencing not a hybrid system, but a post-hybrid system,\" says Michael Kugelman, former director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute in Washington. \"We're essentially looking at a situation where the civil-military imbalance is about as imbalanced as it could possibly be.\"The latest amendment means that Munir, who has been army chief since November 2022, will now also oversee Pakistan's navy and air force.His field marshal title and uniform are for life and he will be given \"responsibilities and duties\" even after retirement determined by the president with the advice of the prime minister. The expectation is that this will give him a prominent role in public life for as long as he is alive.Supporters of the bill have argued it clarifies Pakistan's military command structure.Pakistan's government-operated news agency, the Associated Press of Pakistan, cited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that the changes were part of a broader reform agenda to ensure Pakistan's defence keeps pace with modern warfare requirements.But others see it as ceding power to the military.\"There is no balance between the military and the civilians,\" says Munizae Jahangir, journalist and co-chair of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.\"They have tilted again that power dynamic towards the military and empowered the military at a time when the military needed to be reined in.\"Getty ImagesPakistan's military has long played a prominent role in the nuclear-armed country's politicsNo 'independent space to operate'The second controversial area of change are the courts and judiciary.Under the amendment a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) will be created which will determine constitutional questions. The FCC's first chief justice and the judges that serve in it will be appointed by the president. \"It forever changes the shape and the nature of the right to a fair trial,\" says Ms Jahangir.\"The influence of the executive has increased not just in appointing judges but also constitutional benches. When the state is dictating the constitution of those benches then what hope do I have as a litigant of getting a fair trial?\"Arifa Noor, journalist and commentator, says: \"The judiciary is now quite subservient to the executive.\"The general consensus seems to be that the judiciary is now going to not really have any independent space to operate for the moment.\"Before this amendment was passed, the Supreme Court would hear and decide on constitutional cases. Some said this created a backlog of criminal and civil cases waiting to be heard as judges had to listen to constitutional arguments as well,  arguing that separating the two has helped smooth the court process.That has some traction with some lawyers, although Salahuddin Ahmed, a Karachi-based lawyer in the Supreme Court, sees that argument as disingenuous. He points out that the majority of cases pending in Pakistan are not in the Supreme Court.\"Statistically, if you were genuinely worried about making litigation quicker, you would focus on reforms for those cases.\"In the hours after the amendment was signed into law, two Supreme Court justices handed in their resignations.\"The constitution that I swore an oath to uphold and defend is no more,\" said Justice Athar Minallah in his resignation letter.Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that the judiciary had been brought under the control of the government and that the 27th amendment had \"torn the Supreme Court to pieces\".Khawaja Asif, the defence minister, said of the resignations \"their conscience has awakened because their monopoly on the Supreme Court has been curbed and Parliament has tried to prove the supremacy of the Constitution\".Judges can also now be transferred to different courts without their consent. If they don't agree to the transfer, judges can appeal to the judicial commission and if their reasons for not moving are found invalid the judge would have to retire. Those in favour argue that this will ensure that courts in all areas of the country can be staffed, but some are worried it will be used as a threat.\"To pick a judge up from the province where he's been serving and take him to a different high court is something that will place them under further pressure to toe the government's line,\" says Mr Ahmed. He worries that the change will upset the balance in Pakistan.\"[Our judiciary] has collaborated with dictators in the past, but they've also sometimes nudged the executive. I think if you completely rob people of that hope, then that sends them into other, much uglier directions.\"Mr Kugelman agrees: \"Bottled-up grievances don't bode well for social stability.\"\"It does indicate a slide towards authoritarianism,\" says Ms Noor, adding that she sees the latest amendment as building on the 26th amendment, made last year, which gave lawmakers the power to pick Pakistan's top judge. There is already speculation of a 28th. \"It indicates that the balance of power is tilted in favour, heavily tilted in favour, of the establishment.\"",

    "body": "23 hours agoKhanyisile Ngcobo,Johannesburg and Wycliffe Muia,NairobiGift of the GiversAbout 23 of them have since left for other destinations, authorities saySouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa says there will be an investigation into the \"mysterious\" arrival of a chartered plane carrying 153 Palestinians from Gaza into the country.The group arrived at OR Tambo International Airport but were initially refused entry and were stuck in the plane for more than 10 hours as they \"did not have the customary departure stamps in their passports\", local authorities said.Most were eventually allowed in after intervention from a local charity and because of the government's \"empathy [and] compassion\", Ramaphosa said.The circumstances of their departure from Gaza and travel to South Africa remain unclear.South Africa has maintained strong support for the Palestinian cause throughout the war between Hamas and Israel in Gaza.Ramaphosa said the group \"somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi\" and flew to South Africa, reports the News24 site.Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: \"The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them.\" It did not specify the country.According to the Palestinian embassy in South Africa, the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, \"without any prior note or coordination\".A statement from the embassy said \"an unregistered and misleading organization [had] exploited the tragic humanitarian conditions of our people in Gaza, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner\". The BBC has asked the Kenyan government for comment.Of the 153, 23 managed to fly on to other destinations, leaving 130 who were admitted into the country, South African authorities say.Ramaphosa, speaking during an event in Johannesburg, said he was informed of the unfolding crisis by the home affairs minister.In response, the president said \"we cannot turn them back\", according to News24.\"Even though they do not have the necessary documents and papers, these are people from a strife-torn, a war-torn country.\"The president also told reporters the South African government would carry out a \"proper evaluation\" of the matter and update the public on \"what is happening and how this matter came to be where it is\", according to public broadcaster SABC.Home Affairs Minister Leon Schreiber said that while Palestinian passport-holders qualified for 90-day visa-exempt access to South Africa, the lack of departure stamps, return tickets or accommodation addresses in some of the travellers' documentation resulted in the initial refusal to let them into the country.Once it was established that the absence of this information \"did not indicate that the travellers wished to apply for asylum\" and their accommodation was confirmed, they were granted entry.\"All of the travellers are in possession of valid passports and, at present, none of them have applied for asylum,\" he said.South African charity Gift of the Givers has said it will provide the group with accommodation in the country.Civil societies in South Africa have called for investigations into the conditions the Palestinians had fled in Gaza and the exact route of the aircraft.One of the Palestinians who spoke to local eNCA TV expressed his relief to be in South Africa, describing it as a country of \"peace, laws and justice\".  \"We came from Gaza where we've faced death on daily basis. We have survived a war of two years and we are lucky to be here,\" said one man who had fled with his wife and two children. Gift of the Givers has since called for Ramaphosa to investigate the home affairs ministry and border authority for the \"humiliation they've caused\" the Palestinians.The organisation's founder Dr Imtiaz Sooliman said this treatment included being forced to wait for hours on the tarmac at the airport, being denied food provided by the group and \"using every excuse in the book to prevent these passengers from disembarking\".South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it \"baseless\".You may also be interested in: Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

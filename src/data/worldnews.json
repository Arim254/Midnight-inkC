    "body": "13 hours agoPaul Adams,Diplomatic CorrespondentandKayleen Devlin,BBC VerifyBBCOn 26 January, staff in an office in Mumbai received an urgent e-mail from a crew member aboard a tanker off the coast of Singapore.The email, purportedly written on behalf of five colleagues aboard the tanker sailing under the name Beeta, contained a litany of complaints: crew members, it was alleged, had not been paid and were being treated \"like animals\"; and provisions were running low.The staff in Mumbai worked for the International Transport Workers Federation (ITF), the world's leading organisation representing seafarers, and were used to dealing with complaints from all corners of the globe.But what caught their eye was the fact that the emails hadn't just been copied to multiple ITF offices, but also to sanctions enforcement bodies in several countries.\"The vessel is sanctioned and blacklisted,\" the sailor wrote.He said he had discovered that the vessel calling itself the Beeta was in fact an American-sanctioned tanker called the Gale.The sailor and his colleagues were desperate to leave.\"I've been at sea for many years,\" he told the BBC when we contacted him. \"I know what's right and wrong.\"Inadvertently, the crew member had found himself involved in a problem at the heart of some of today's most contentious geopolitical issues: a surging number of tankers, transporting Russian and Iranian oil, operating outside maritime rules, using a variety of methods to conceal their identities.This \"shadow fleet\", as it's known, is growing fast.ITFThis image shows the American sanctioned tanker called the GaleEstimates vary, but the latest data from the monitoring group TankerTrackers.com says the fleet currently consists of 1,468 vessels, roughly triple its size at the time of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago.That's about 18-19% of the total internationally trading tanker fleet, carrying approximately 17% of all seaborne crude, says Michelle Wiese Bockman, senior maritime intelligence analyst at Windward AI.The phenomenon that first emerged in the 2010s, as North Korea and Iran sought to evade international sanctions, has proliferated, leaving western governments scrambling to keep up.So what can those governments do when countries circumvent or flout the rules to export oil and use the profits to fuel engines of war or repression?'Modern-day slavery'Definitions vary - as do names: it's also been called the \"dark\" or \"ghost\" fleet - but shadow vessels generally exhibit some or all of a particular set of characteristics.They tend to be old, averaging an age of around 20 years, and are often poorly maintained. Details of ownership and management are deliberately opaque - names, identification numbers and flags are frequently changed. Insurance is below Western standards and sometimes fake.Vessels frequently switch off or manipulate their automatic identification system (AIS), making them harder to track.Seamen, recruited on contracts that typically last six to nine months, don't always know what they're getting into.\"I didn't understand what shadow fleet vessels actually were,\" Russian engineer Denis told us, after serving aboard an EU- and UK-sanctioned tanker, Serena, for several months last year.Serena is currently flying under the flag of Cameroon. While Denis was aboard, it was flying a false Gambian flag.Denis says he realised the Serena was under sanctions only when he went aboard. But like many seamen, he says he needed the work.\"Once they're at sea, they've got them prisoner on board,\" says Nathan Smith, an ITF inspector familiar with the Serena.Smith has heard numerous stories of abuses aboard shadow vessels.\"It's a modern-day slavery,\" he says.Over the course of months spent sailing between Russia and China, the reality of life aboard a shadow vessel became increasingly apparent to Denis.\"Things began to deteriorate very quickly because no spare parts were sent,\" he said. \"The radar on the bridge hadn't been working for over a year, the life-saving equipment wasn't working and there were numerous faulty fire sensors.\"During a stop at the Russian port of Vladivostok, last October, the crew tried, without success, to repair a davit, a small specialised crane used to lower the tanker's life boats into the water. Denis says a port official nevertheless issued a certificate of successful inspection. The BBC has approached the Port of Vladivostok for comment.Denis says he never found out who owned the Serena or who crew members could contact to raise complaints.It's notoriously difficult to establish ownership of shadow fleet vessels. Ships have registered owners, which are often shell companies or entities set up to manage a single vessel. The names of real, or \"beneficial\" owners are frequently hidden. We have tried to make contact with the owners of the Gale and Serena, but without success. In the case of the Gale, it has proved impossible to establish the identity of the beneficial owner.Crews are poorly protected throughout the industry, with unpaid wages and abandonment by owners all-too frequent. But Denis says shadow vessels are the worst.\"Now I'll be more careful,\" he says. \"I've learned to identify dangerous vessels that I won't work on any more.\"The ships brought back from the deadDeep within the murky recesses of the shadow fleet also lurks a category experts have dubbed \"zombie ships\" - vessels which steal the identity of dead ships in order to hide their true identity.After being sanctioned, a zombie ship often disappears from tracking systems, later reappearing under a new name, using a stolen nine-digit International Maritime Organisation (IMO) number from a scrapped or decommissioned vessel.The ship's AIS tracking system, which uses transponders to continuously broadcast its location, is re-programmed to imitate the previous vessel.With the dead tanker's identity magically resurrected, the zombie ship continues to ply its trade, free from sanctions.The Gale is one such ship.According to the global trade intelligence company Kpler, the tanker, currently flying a false Gambian flag, has assumed multiple identities since being sanctioned by the US last year for its involvement in the export of sanctioned Iranian oil.After a period sailing under the false identity Sea Shell, using a different stolen IMO number, the Gale again changed identities, re-emerging as Beeta and loading a cargo of Iranian oil on 31 January.According to TankerTrackers.com, which uses satellite imagery, AIS data and shoreline photography to follow the movement of crude oil, the shipment was delivered by another US-sanctioned vessel via a ship-to-ship transfer, a procedure commonly used by shadow-fleet vessels involved in the shipment of sanctioned oil.Copernicus Sentinel 2, 2026Satellite imagery shows the Gale (Beeta) loading a cargo of Iranian oil in a ship-to-ship tranferThe ship-to-ship transfer took place south of the Riau Archipelago, around 150 miles east of Singapore.Windward AI's Michelle Wiese Bockmann calls the area \"an epicentre of maritime lawlessness\", where dozens of tankers gather to store or transfer Iranian oil.Bockmann says China imported 1.8 million barrels per day of sanctioned Iranian crude per day in 2025. The BBC has contacted the Chinese embassy for a response.\"None of it was traced,\" she says, \"because tankers hide their loading and the oil has come on four or five tankers, deliberately to obscure the origin and destination of the cargo.\"The Gale's history and behaviour mark it out as a classic zombie ship.A computer screenshot taken on board by the crew member who contacted the ITF appears to give instructions on how to fake the ship's location, a process known as spoofing.Two other screenshots, taken on 26 January, show the spoofing at work.One displays the tanker's actual location, east of Singapore. The second, taken just five minutes later, shows a fake location, around 2,800 miles away, off the coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.\"The confirmed linkage between Gale, Sea Shell, and Beeta, alongside fabricated AIS position history and prior impersonation, is consistent with deliberate identity manipulation,\" says Ana Subasic, an analyst at the global trade intelligence company Kpler.The BBC has no reason to believe the Serena is a zombie vessel, but the ship's former engineer says he saw equipment that would enable the Serena to fake its position.\"I spoke with the bridge officers about turning off the AIS and other manipulation,\" Denis told us. \"We had equipment on board to change the vessel's position. I think this equipment is only used for sanctioned cargo.\"What can be done?Such practices, coupled with the knowledge that Russian and Iranian oil revenues continue to fuel conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, are driving an urgent debate in western capitals about how to respond.Donald Trump's recent actions in Venezuela – seizing seven tankers since early December as part of a pressure campaign on the regime of then president Nicolás Maduro – has shown that one solution is the simple application of force.The operation to chase and capture one vessel, the Russian-flagged tanker Marinera, took the US military, including a coastguard vessel and special forces, on a two-week chase far out into the North Atlantic.The Marinera, previously known as the Guyanese-flagged Bella 1, was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and Iran.Getty ImagesBella 1, renamed Marinera, was intercepted in the early hours of 7 JanuaryThe change of name and flag was designed to provide the tanker with a measure of international protection.Upping the ante further, Russia took the highly unusual step of requesting that the US call off its pursuit and said it had dispatched a submarine to escort the tanker, which was empty at the time. The Russian Foreign Ministry said there was not \"any basis\" to allege the tanker was sailing \"without a flag\" or \"under a false flag\".Undeterred by the possibility of an international incident or by the possible accusation of piracy on the high seas, the US intercepted the Marinera in international waters between Iceland and the UK in the early hours of 7 January.Getty ImagesThe Russian-flagged Marinera - seen in January in Burghead, Scotland - was wanted by the US for transporting sanctioned oil from both Venezuela and IranFor the first time, the UK got involved, sending an RAF surveillance aircraft and a Royal Navy support ship to help the operation.Defence Secretary John Healey said the action was \"in full compliance with international law\" and said the UK was \"stepping up activity against shadow vessels\".Perhaps spurred on by Washington's assertive approach, there is some evidence that European partners are willing to take more robust action too.Two weeks after the Marinera episode, France launched an operation in the Mediterranean to seize the Grinch, another Russia-linked tanker suspected of violating international sanctions.ReutersA French navy boat stopping the Grinch oil tankerOnce again, the UK was involved. A Royal Navy patrol boat, HMS Dagger, shadowed the Grinch, as it passed through the Strait of Gibraltar.With at least one sanctioned vessel passing through the English Channel every day, according to experts, speculation is mounting that the UK might soon conduct its own interceptions.Healey recently told MPs that \"further military options\" were being explored.For some, it can't come soon enough.\"There's obviously huge frustration in the policy-maker circles in Brussels and London that Russia is continuing to sell its oil,\" says Tom Keatinge, founding director of the Centre for Finance and Security at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) in London.Keatinge runs a maritime sanctions task force at Rusi, bringing together representatives from industry and government. Some participants, he sees, are keen to see more forthright action.\"We have people… who like jumping out of helicopters on ropes,\" he says. \"And that community has thus far been kept firmly in its box.\"He adds: \"Put bluntly, no one's had the balls to look at what is often a 50-50 call and say 'We'll send the boys in'.\" The MoD said: \"Deterring, disrupting and degrading the Russian shadow fleet is a priority for this government.\"But the constraints are considerable.\"You've got a bunch of consequences that you need to be ready to deal with,\" Keatinge says. \"The first is you've got an absolutely enormous vessel. What the hell do you do with that?\"Once seized, tankers need to be maintained, with engines running and a skeleton crew on board. The appetite for holding such vessels, particularly older ones that might pose an environmental risk, is minimal.The Marinera remains moored in the Moray Firth, with other US-seized vessels being held off the coast of Texas and Puerto Rico.\"If you look at the very high costs that the US is probably incurring at the moment to have two tankers off Houston, awaiting legal action, it's not something you take lightly,\" says Bockmann.A problem of resourcesThen there's the question of what to do with the oil itself.Again, Trump's approach is blunt: confiscate it.The president says 50 million barrels have been taken so far, as the US assumes control of Venezuela's oil industry.\"Venezuela is going to get some and we're going to get some,\" he said in a recent interview.The president's European allies are unlikely to follow suit.\"That would probably be a step too far for the Foreign Office,\" says Keatinge.So would Ukraine's increasingly direct approach. In recent months, Kyiv has targeted at least seven Russian shadow fleet tankers, using a variety of drones and mines.ReutersA Ukrainian sea drone shows the Dashan, a tanker part of Russia's so-called \"shadow fleet\", being struck by another sea drone in the Black SeaMost of Ukraine's attacks have been in the Black Sea, but one tanker, the Qendil, was hit and critically damaged while passing through the Mediterranean in December. Another tanker, the Mersin, was attacked and immobilised off the coast of Senegal in late November. Kyiv has not commented on reports that it carried out the attack.Most of the international effort so far has been more bureaucratic than kinetic: sanctioning hundreds of vessels, persuading countries such as The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Comoros, among others, to tighten their regulations, and addressing the issue of insurance.The number of falsely flagged ships globally more than doubled last year to over 450, according to the IMO, the BBC reported in November.Last year, the European Commission introduced new rules requiring all vessels entering EU waters to provide proof of insurance.The UK has a similar, voluntary reporting scheme, but shadow fleet vessels often ignore it or alter course when challenged.Ultimately, the sheer number of shadow vessels poses a simple problem of resources.But with Russian ships sometimes suspected of involvement in the monitoring or sabotage of undersea cables, there's an added national security dimension.In late January, the UK and thirteen other countries with Baltic and North Sea coastlines issued a coordinated warning that AIS manipulation, along with interference with Global Navigation Satellite Systems represented a growing threat to maritime safety and security.Vessels sailing under flags of convenience, the statement said, \"may be treated as a ship without nationality\", under the terms of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, a reminder to anyone paying attention that existing laws already provide for the detention and seizure of ships.Windward AI's Bockmann says the Trump administration's actions over Venezuela have shown European leaders what can be done.\"There's definitely a low threshold [for intervention] building for the darkest of the dark fleet,\" she says.More from InDepthThe net is gradually closing on Russian oil. Last October, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on the country's two largest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft.The EU's next sanctions package against Russia may include a full ban on maritime services, making it impossible for European tankers to transport Russian oil under the legal price cap currently in place.Around 30% of Russia's maritime oil exports are currently carried on EU-owned vessels.But for Russia and Iran, war and sanctions are the mothers of invention. As the net tightens, you can be sure that the world's burgeoning fleet of shadow vessels will continue to operate in the dark.Top picture: Getty ImagesBBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "body": "3 hours agoHelen LivingstoneSydneyGettyLiberal leader Sussan Ley is facing an expected leadership challenge from Angus TaylorAustralian opposition leader Sussan Ley, the first woman to head the Liberal Party, is under renewed pressure after the resignation of her shadow defence minister Angus Taylor.His resignation paves the way for an expected leadership challenge. Local media say he has long been plotting to oust her.Ley narrowly defeated Taylor in a leadership contest last year, after her party's worst ever election loss. But since then she has been plagued by poor poll numbers and infighting among the conservative Liberal-National coalition.The coalition, a partnership dating back to the 1940s, has twice split and reunited under her leadership, further undermining her tenure.Taylor - from the conservative faction of the party as opposed to Ley's moderate wing - on Wednesday announced he had quit the party leadership team, though he would \"continue to serve the Liberal Party\".\"We have failed to hold a bad Labor government to account,\" he told reporters, adding that the party needed to \"protect Australians' way of life\" and \"focus on restoring their standard of living\".He said he did not believe Ley was \"in a position to be able to lead the party as it needs to be led from here\".It is unclear if Taylor's allies in Ley's shadow cabinet will follow with resignations of their own.According to local media, Taylor's supporters are now expected to request a special party room meeting to consider a so-called spill motion, which would mean the party's leadership is up for contest.A victory for Taylor would put an end to months of speculation around Ley's leadership, which has never seemed secure. The coalition reunited after its most recent split just days ago, following a row over hate speech laws for which Ley had pushed after the Bondi Beach attack in December, but which her Nationals colleagues refused to support.A series of recent polls have shown the populist One Nation party - which only got 6% of the national vote last year - overtaking the Coalition to take second place behind Labor. Ley's personal ratings are also poor.The coalition has failed to agree on what caused its crushing election defeat to Labor, which saw the Liberals all but wiped out in the major cities. Immediately after the election the coalition briefly split amid argument over climate and energy policy including its commitment to a net-zero emissions by 2050 policy, which the Liberals later agreed to abandon under pressure from the Nationals and its own right-wing.The Nationals are based in rural areas and lean more conservative than the Liberals. Political analysts say the recent surge in One Nation support has pushed them further to the right in a bid to win back votes at a time when the Liberals need to appeal to more centrist voters in the cities.",

    "body": "1 day agoTabby WilsonGetty ImagesSinger Chappell Roan says she has left the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman, whose name appears in the Epstein files.Announcing her split with the agency, Roan said she has a \"duty to protect her team\" and her decision reflected her belief that \"meaningful change in our industry requires accountability\".Wasserman has been criticised after his flirtatious emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, sent in 2003, were revealed among the millions of files published in relation to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Roan made no mention of Epstein, nor the Epstein files, in her statement on Instagram announcing her departure.\"As of today, I am no longer represented by Wasserman, the talent agency led by Casey Wasserman,\" she said. Roan added: \"No artist, agent or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\" The BBC has reached out to Wasserman for comment.Wasserman is also the chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games, and has faced calls to step down from the position following the release of the emails.He said in a statement that his correspondence with Maxwell \"took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light\".Who is in the Epstein files?Wasserman also emphasised that he had \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\".\"As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane,\" he said.\"I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"Wasserman has not been accused of wrongdoing by any of Epstein's victims, and the appearance of his name in the files does not imply criminal activity of any kind.Roan's announcement comes after two other bands represented by Wasserman released statements indicating they wanted to distance themselves from his agency.Wednesday, a self-described indie rock band, said they were \"aghast\" to see Wasserman feature in the Epstein files and did not want to continue to be associated with him. They said that they hoped he would step down \"for the sake of his staff\".Rock band Beach Bunny said they were \"hugely disappointed and disgusted\" that Wasserman \"had involvement with Ghislaine Maxwell\".",

    "body": "20 hours agoHugh SchofieldParis correspondentBenoit Pavan/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty ImagesGrenoble prosecutor Etienne Manteaux (left) said the unusual decision had been made to name the suspect so potential victims could come forwardAn elderly French man has been charged with the rape and sexual assault of 89 teenagers in a mass abuse case that police allege spans many countries and dates back to the 1960s.Jacques Leveugle, 79, who is in custody in south-east France, was arrested after his nephew found a USB that allegedly detailed his \"sexual relations\" with minors aged 13 to 17, the Grenoble prosecutor, Etienne Manteaux, told a news conference.In an unusual move, authorities are naming the suspect because out of the 89 assaults, Manteaux said that only around 40 victims had been identified.\"If victims wish to come forward, now is the time,\" he added.Police allege the crimes took place between 1967 and 2022. Throughout much of his life, Leveugle worked as an informal teacher or assistant at holiday camps, the prosecutor said.A timeline released of Leveugle's whereabouts dating back to the 1960s shows his appearance throughout the decades. Police allege that he could have carried out assaults not only in France, but also Germany, Switzerland, Morocco, Niger, Algeria, the Philippines, India, Colombia, and the French overseas territory of New Caledonia.\"He travelled to these different countries and in each of these places where he settled to provide tutoring and teach, he would meet young people and have sexual relations with them,\" Manteaux told the news conference on Tuesday.Gendarmerie NationaleLeveugle was arrested in 2024 after visiting his brother in the Isère department around Grenoble, a city in south-eastern France. At the time, Leveugle was living in Morocco.His brother's son - who had suspicions about his uncle - took advantage of his absence one day in October 2023 to examine a USB drive that belonged to Leveugle. It allegedly contained \"15 tomes of very dense material\" - photographs and written accounts of his \"sexual relations\" with minors, Manteaux said.\"The victims we have spoken to tell us that he spent a lot of time helping them to learn foreign languages, awakening their sense of culture... He has a complex personality,\" the prosecutor said.\"A lot of work has been done to identify all the victims. But in his journal, some only have first names, and there we found ourselves up against a wall. That's why we decided to launch this appeal - and also in case there are other victims not listed in his journal,\" Manteaux added.The prosecutor revealed that under questioning, Leveugle also allegedly admitted to killing his own mother and aunt by smothering them with cushions.He is accused of killing his mother in 1974 when she was in the terminal phase of cancer, and he allegedly did the same to his 92-year-old aunt in 1992.\"He explained to us that he told (his aunt) he had to leave for the Cévennes. She was pleading with him not to go, so he took the decision to kill her too,\" the prosecutor said.\"He justifies the killings by saying he hoped someone would do the same to him if he was in the same situation at the end of his life.\"A separate judicial investigation has been opened into these alleged killings.Under French law, alleged assaults that took place before 1993 come under the country's statute of limitations, so no prosecutions for them would be possible. However Manteaux said it was still important to get a full picture of Leveugle's alleged crimes.In two other recent and high-profile sexual assault cases in France, offenders kept records of their activities which were later key in bringing them to justice. In the Pélicot rape case,  Dominique Pélicot kept videos of men assaulting his sleeping wife Gisèle, whom he had drugged. He was jailed for 20 years.In Brittany, former doctor Joêl Le Scouarnec compiled detailed computer records of the hundreds of children he molested in hospital. Without this evidence, he may never have been convicted. He, too, was jailed for 20 years.",

It came hours after Guanipa and other political prisoners were released.Venezuela's Interior and Justice Minister Diosdado Cabello later said \"a person\" was rearrested \"for violating the conditions under which he was released\".\"Some politicians believed they could do whatever they wanted,\" Cabello added on Monday.A former vice-president of the National Assembly, Guanipa spent eight months in prison and is among several political prisoners to have been freed since the US seized Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro in January.In an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, Ramón said his father, leader of the Justice First party, had initially been released from prison at about 11:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Sunday.He said his father then spent time with families waiting for the release of other political prisoners.\"He made some statements, he mobilised a lot of people,\" Ramón said, continuing: \"He went on an interview... and after that he was kidnapped by security forces that weren't wearing uniform, that weren't identified properly.\"During the BBC interview, Guanipa's son said he had been informed that his father would be returned and placed under house arrest. But he said no further information was shared about when his father would be transported.Later on Tuesday, Ramón posted on his father's X account, saying: \"I confirm that my father, Juan Pablo Guanipa, is at our home in Maracaibo. We are relieved to know that our family will soon be together.\"He added: \"My father remains unjustly imprisoned, because house arrest is still imprisonment, and we demand his full freedom, as well as the freedom of all political prisoners.\"Ramón thanked the US government, including President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for \"their efforts in support of freedom in Venezuela and for all political prisoners\".'He mobilised a lot of people', says Guanipa's sonGuanipa's centre-right party had previously said the 61-year-old was kidnapped by the \"repressive forces of the dictatorship\" while he was moving between locations.It added that those accompanying him warned that weapons were pointed at the group before Guanipa was loaded into a car.\"We hold Delcy Rodríguez, Jorge Rodríguez, and Diosdado Cabello responsible for any harm to Juan Pablo's life,\" Justice First wrote on social media, referring to Venezuela's interim president, the National Assembly speaker, and the interior minister respectively.The party also called on the international community to demand Guanipa's \"immediate release\", as well as an end to the Venezuelan government's \"persecution of the opposition\".When Guanipa was recaptured on Sunday, Ramón and a key figure in Venezuela's opposition, Edmundo González, had demanded proof of life.Guanipa, a political ally of Machado, was among at least 30 people freed on Sunday, according to Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal, which provides assistance to political prisoners in the country.He was elected governor of the Zulia region in 2017, but barred from taking office after refusing to swear an oath before Maduro's National Constituent Assembly.He then went into hiding after being accused of terrorism and treason for challenging the 2024 election result.Guanipa was later tracked down by Venezuela's security forces and detained in May 2025.Opposition and human rights groups say the government under Maduro had for years used detentions of political prisoners to stamp out dissent and silence critics.Many were detained after the 2024 presidential election, when Maduro claimed victory despite opponents and many countries disputing the results.The Venezuelan government has denied holding political prisoners, insisting they were arrested for criminal activity.",

    "body": "23 hours agoSteven McIntoshEntertainment reporterGetty ImagesSinger Marc Anthony has described the Beckham family rift as \"extremely unfortunate\", but added that the way it has played out is \"hardly the truth\".The 57-year-old performed at Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham's wedding reception in 2022, and is a close friend of the wider family. But Brooklyn recently said the way the couple's first dance was handled at the wedding left him feeling \"uncomfortable and humiliated\", after Anthony reportedly called for him to dance with his mother instead of his wife. Beckham added that his mother then danced \"very inappropriately\" on him. Sir David and Lady Beckham have not commented since Brooklyn published his statement. \"I've known them since before the kids were born. I'm godfather to Cruz. I'm really close to the family. But I have nothing to say about what happened there.\"He added: \"It's extremely unfortunate how it's playing out - but [how it's playing out] is hardly the truth.\"Getty ImagesMarc Anthony is a long-term friend of the Beckham family and godfather to Cruz (pictured in 2023)He accused his parents of trying to \"ruin my relationship\" with Peltz, adding that he had no wish to reconcile with his family.The 26-year-old also said his mother had \"hijacked\" his first dance with Peltz, which had been \"planned weeks in advance to a romantic love song\".\"In front of our 500 wedding guests,\" he continued, \"Marc Anthony called me to the stage, where in the schedule was planned to be my romantic dance with my wife but instead my mum was waiting to dance with me instead.\"\"She danced very inappropriately on me in front of everyone. I've never felt more uncomfortable or humiliated in my entire life.\"After speculation about the nature of Lady Beckham's dancing, Fat Tony clarified: \"There was no slut-dropping, there was no black cat PVC catsuits, there was no Spice Girl action.\"Fat Tony claimed Marc Anthony had called for \"the most beautiful woman in the room\" to come up for the first dance with Brooklyn, but then said Lady Beckham's name instead of Nicola's. The DJ said this led to the bride running out of the room in tears.Sir David and Lady Beckham have not responded to repeated requests for comment on the claims in their eldest son's statementHowever, when asked about young people and their social media use in Davos last month, Sir David remarked that children are \"allowed to make mistakes\".",

Russian forces also dropped seven bombs on the city of Slovyansk on Tuesday, Donetsk regional head Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram. Three people, including an 11-year-old girl, were killed.Moscow has increased pressure on the area by targeting transport and energy infrastructure with a record number of ballistic missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said.A state of emergency has been declared over the energy situation in the Kharkiv region by local authorities.It comes after a so-called \"energy truce\", which was meant to allow Ukraine's energy sector a reprieve during -20C (-4F) temperatures, expired last week.Tens of thousands of people across Ukraine are experiencing severe power cuts, and many households have no running water or heating.Zelensky has said the US wants the war with Russia to end by June, and that both sides had been invited to the US for talks next week. Meanwhile, a massive attack by Ukrainian drones on Volzhsky, in the Volgograd region in Russia, was reported on Wednesday night.Regional Governor Andrei Bocharov said an apartment was damaged in the strike and a fire broke out at a factory. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

    "body": "9 hours agoNardine Saad,Los AngelesandClaire KeenanReutersBritney Spears has sold the rights to her music catalogue.Pop superstar Britney Spears has sold the rights to her entire music catalogue, the BBC has learned. Spears, 44, is said to have sold to independent music publisher Primary Wave on 30 December for around $200m (£146m).The singer - whose protracted conservatorship long dictated her personal and professional life - is known for the hits ...Baby One More Time, Oops!... I Did It Again, Toxic and Gimme More.Primary Wave did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Spears declined to comment.In January 2024, the singer said she would \"never return to the music industry\". Her last song was a duet released with Elton John in 2022. Primary Wave has also acquired rights to the estates of Notorious BIG, Prince and Whitney Houston. Details of the sale and the exact price of Spears' catalogue have not been made public. High-profile artists such as Bruce Springsteen, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, and Shakira recently sold their catalogues too. Springsteen sold his back catalogue to Sony in 2021 for $500m, and Bieber reportedly signed a $200m deal with Hipgnosis Songs Capital in 2023.The publisher was founded 20 years ago by music executive Lawrence Mestel after purchasing 50% of Kurt Cobain's portion of the Nirvana catalogue. Spears is one of the best-selling female artists, with more than 150 million records sold worldwide. Her catalogue includes nine studio albums since her debut in 1999. The sale comes after a tumultuous few years for the singer, who in 2021 ended a 13-year-long conservatorship – a legal guardianship that saw her finances and personal life controlled by her father. The singer published her memoir in 2023 titled The Woman in Me, which detailed her struggles living under the conservatorship. Her ex-husband Kevin Federline released his own memoir, You Thought You Knew, at the end of 2025. ",

    "body": "58 minutes agoJessica RawnsleyPA MediaForeign Secretary Yvette Cooper boards a helicopter during her visit to Norway to discuss Nato's presence in the ArcticThe UK government has pledged to increase its military presence in Norway over the next three years, as part of efforts to combat Russian threats in the region.Defence Secretary John Healey said the number of British troops stationed in Norway will increase from 1,000 to 2,000 personnel.According to Healey, Moscow is \"rapidly re-establishing military presence in the region, including reopening old Cold War bases\".His concern is echoed across Europe. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, the continent has seen an increase in Kremlin aggression.\"Demands on defence are rising and Russia poses the greatest threat to Arctic and High North security that we have seen since the Cold War,\" Healey said.The High North includes the Arctic circle and areas adjacent to it, it is a term used to describe the northernmost part of the globe.The defence secretary will join his Nato counterparts at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the proposals.The announcement comes weeks after a rift between European allies and Washington over Greenland, which is also in the Arctic. US President Donald Trump had threatened to take over Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing alleged threats from Russia and China. He has since appeared to back down from plans to annex Greenland.The Arctic Sentry mission, proposed by Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, aims to bolster surveillance and security in the region - modelled on existing Nato alliances such as the Baltic Sentry and the Eastern Sentry.As part of the expanded presence in the region, 1,500 Royal Marine Commandos will take part in Nato's Exercise Cold Response in March. The large-scale drill across Norway, Finland and Sweden is designed to train allied forces in extreme Arctic conditions.In September, the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force will conduct an exercise known as Lion Protector involving air, land and naval forces from several European nations. The government says that operation will train armed forces to defend critical infrastructure against attacks and sabotage across Norway, Iceland and the Danish straits.The UK and its Nato allies have become increasingly concerned about the risk Moscow poses to underwater cables and pipelines, amid heightened tensions following the invasion of Ukraine.There has been a 30% rise in Russian submarines in UK waters over the past two years, according to the MoD.The defence ministry has said Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic is now back to the same levels as the Cold War era.More on this story",

    "body": "11 hours agoBrandon DrenonWatch: Buddhist monks' Walk for Peace nears end in Washington DCA band of Buddhist monks who have spent four months walking - sometimes barefoot or through the snow - on a 2,000-mile march from Texas to Washington DC completed their journey on Tuesday. The group's arduous so-called Walk of Peace has gone viral, capturing the attention of millions of Americans at a time of heightened political division in the US.Along the way, the troupe has shared a message of mindfulness, with its leader, the Venerable Bhikkhu Pannakara, saying: \"My hope is, when this walk ends, the people we met will continue practicing mindfulness and find peace.\" Their journey began on 26 October 2025 at the Huong Dao Vipassana Bhavana Center in Fort Worth.Getty ImagesAfter arriving in the US Capital, the monks visited the Washington National Cathedral where they attended an interfaith service. Later in the week, they will make stops at the Abraham Lincoln Memorial and the Peace Monument, which stands on the US Capitol grounds.The group also reportedly plans to appeal to lawmakers to declare Buddha's birthday - called Vesak - a national holiday - but their expedition has gained traction beyond this policy request.\"Their long journey and gentle witness invite us all to deepen our commitment to compassion,\" said Washington Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde, who will help host the monks at an interfaith reception, according to the Associated Press.The 19 travelling monks are from Theravada Buddhist monasteries around the globe.The final day of their single-file trek across the country began on Tuesday morning in Arlington, Virginia, roughly five miles (9.1km) outside the US capitol. A livestream on the group's Facebook account shows them walking past piles of snow, as the first days of above-freezing temperatures return after weeks of record cold across much of the eastern United States. They are cheered on by rows of onlookers in the video.\"May you be safe and warm. Thank you for your walk of peace. We desperately need this in our world now,\" one user wrote. For the last 108 days - a sacred number in Buddhism representing spiritual completion - the group has walked this same single-file line step by step. But the trip has not been without incident. In November, an escort vehicle that accompanied the monks as they walked alongside a highway in Houston, Texas was hit by a truck, injuring two of the monks. One of them had his leg amputated. Their return to Texas is likely to be quicker - and easier - as they are expected to commute back via bus, arriving in Fort Worth on Saturday. ",

    "body": "1 day agoHugh SchofieldParisAFP via Getty ImagesEmmanuel Macron warned that \"today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder\"French President Emmanuel Macron has urged Europe to assert itself on the world stage, saying it is time to start acting like a \"power\".In the face of growing threats from China, Russia and now the US, he told a group of European newspapers that the continent faced a \"wake-up call\".\"Are we ready to become a power? This is the question in the field of economy and finance, in defence and security, and in our democratic systems. \"In another era we might have said it is the moment to 'assume our majority',\" he said ahead of an EU summit in Brussels later this week.Macron repeated his call for EU-wide mutualised loans in order to raise hundreds of billions of euros needed for industrial investment.\"The time has come to launch a shared debt capacity to fund our future expense -  eurobonds for the future. We need big European programmes to finance the best projects,\" he said.Similar calls in the past have met scepticism from Germany and other countries, who feel France wants to use Europe to bear a financial burden which it alone - because of its failure to reform - is unable to take up.Macron admitted that France \"has never had a balanced model, unlike certain economies of the north, which are built more on a sense of responsibility. \"And we have never had reforms like the ones initiated in the 2010s in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece, which are paying dividends today.\"But he said there was growing demand in the world's financial markets for mutualised European debt, which currently the EU was not equipped to supply.\"The world markets are increasingly afraid of the American greenback [dollar]. They want alternatives… \"For investors everywhere a democratic state of law is a huge attraction. And when I look at the world as it is, we have the authoritarian regime that is China, and on the other side we have the US distancing itself further and further from a state of law.\"According to Macron, the 27-member EU needs €1,2tn (£1tn; $1.4tn) a year to invest in the vital sectors of security and defence, clean energy, and artificial intelligence.Calling on the EU to \"protect\" these and other industries, he said: \"The Chinese do it, the Americans too.  Europe today is the most open market in the world.\"In the face of that, I am not saying we should be protectionist. It's more a question of being coherent - in other words not imposing on our own producers rules which we do not impose on non-Europeans.\"\"Today Europe faces a massive challenge, in a world of disorder,\" he said.\"Climate change is accelerating. The US – which we thought would guarantee our security for ever – is no longer sure. Russia was to give us cheap energy for ever, but that stopped three years ago. China... has become a rival that gets fiercer and fiercer.\"Today, we Europeans are on our own. But we have each other. We are 450 million people. It's huge. For me [becoming a power] is the fulfilment of the European adventure.\"We came together to stop war, we came together to build a market. But we always forbade ourselves to think of power.\"Asked about the latest stand-off with Washington over Greenland, at the end of which US President Donald Trump appeared to back down from threats to annex the Danish territory,  Macron said the Europeans should not be fooled.\"At the end of a crisis, there is a cowardly tendency to sit back and say 'phew'. There are threats and intimidation, and then suddenly Washington gives way. And people think it's over.\"Don't believe it for a single second,\" the French leader said.",

    "body": "India orders social media firms to remove unlawful content within three hours4 hours agoAbhishek DeyGuwahatiAFP via Getty ImagesIndia has taken several steps in recent years to tighten oversight of online speechIndia has introduced new rules that make it mandatory for social media companies to remove unlawful material within three hours of being notified, in a sharp tightening of the existing 36-hour deadline.The amended guidelines will take effect from 20 February and apply to major platforms including Meta, YouTube and X. They will also apply to AI-generated content.The government did not provide a reason for reducing the takedown window. But critics worry the move is part of a broader tightening of oversight of online content and could lead to censorship in the world's largest democracy with more than a billion internet usersIn recent years, Indian authorities have used existing Information Technology rules to order social media platforms to remove content deemed illegal under laws dealing with national security and public order. Experts say they give authorities wide-ranging power over social media content. According to transparency reports, more than 28,000 URLs or web links were blocked in 2024 following government requests.The BBC has contacted the ministry of electronics and information technology for comment on the latest changes. Meta declined to respond to the amendments. The BBC has also approached X and Google, which owns YouTube, for a response.The amendments also introduce new rules for AI-generated content.For the first time, the law defines AI-generated material, including audio and video that has been created or altered to look real, such as deepfakes. Ordinary editing, accessibility features and genuine educational or design work are excluded.The rules mandate that platforms that allow users to create or share such material must clearly label it. Where possible, they must also add permanent markers to help trace where it came from.Companies will not be allowed to remove these labels once they are added. They must also use automated tools to detect and prevent illegal AI content, including deceptive or non-consensual material, false documents, child sexual abuse material, explosives-related content and impersonation.Digital rights groups and technology experts have raised concerns about the feasibility and implications of the new rules.The Internet Freedom Foundation said the compressed timeline would transform platforms into \"rapid fire censors\".\"These impossibly short timelines eliminate any meaningful human review, forcing platforms toward automated over-removal,\" the group said in a statement.Anushka Jain, a research associate at the Digital Futures Lab, welcomed the labelling requirement, saying it could improve transparency. However, she warned that the three-hour deadline could push companies towards full automation.\"Companies are already struggling with the 36-hour deadline because the process involves human oversight. If it gets completely automated, there is a high risk that it will lead to censoring of content,\" she told the BBC.Delhi-based technology analyst Prasanto K Roy described the new regime as \"perhaps the most extreme takedown regime in any democracy\".He said compliance would be \"nearly impossible\" without extensive automation and minimal human oversight, adding that the tight timeframe left little room for platforms to assess whether a request was legally appropriate.On AI labelling, Roy said the intention was positive but cautioned that reliable and tamper-proof labelling technologies were still developing. The BBC has reached out to the Indian government for a response to these concerns. ",

    "body": "Ghana declares Wednesday 'Fugu Day' to promote traditional outfit after online mockery1 hour agoWycliffe MuiaandThomas Naadi,BBC Africa, AccraZambia's Ministry of Information and Media/XPresident John Dramani Mahama said he would export the outfit to Zambia in bulk following the online debateGhana has designated every Wednesday as a day to wear the country's traditional outfit, the fugu, days after it sparked an online debate with Zambians.The garment gained prominence last week when President John Dramani Mahama wore it during a state visit to Zambia, where some mockingly called it a \"blouse,\" prompting a fierce response from Ghanaians online.Ghana's Minister for Tourism Abla Dzifa Gomashie said on Tuesday that wearing the outfit every week would help project the country's identity \"with pride on the global stage\".She encouraged wearing the outfit \"in all its diverse forms, designs, and expressions, complemented by its distinctive and beautiful accessories\". The fugu, also known as batakari, is a traditional northern Ghanaian top made from hand‑woven, narrow strips of thick cotton fabric stitched together to form a structured, poncho‑style garment.It is worn by traditional leaders in northern Ghana, as well as ordinary citizens, and is a symbol of royalty and authority.Beyond its cultural importance, Gomashie said the outfit's weekly display would \"generate far-reaching social and economic benefits\" especially for local weavers, designers, artisans and traders. \"The government hopes that this collective embrace of Fugu will strengthen national unity, stimulate the creative economy, and serve as a powerful symbol of Ghana's cultural confidence and self-expression,\" the minister added. Following the announcement, many Ghanaians on Wednesday heeded the minister's call, wearing the outfit in a variety of colours across the country. The iconic outfit has been trending on social media for days following the banter between Ghanaians and Zambians. This revived a cultural movement on social media, with Ghanaians informally declaring \"Fugu Friday\" to showcase the outfits. Fridays had been designated by the previous government as a day where people were encouraged to wear traditional clothes.The debate prompted Ghanaians, including MPs, to flood social media proudly showcasing their fugus, while Zambians featured wearing their traditional outfits known as siziba. The online exchange attracted the attention of Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema, who announced that his country would order fugus from Ghana. President Mahama also suggested exporting the smock in bulk to Zambia.While emphasising the fugu's cultural and political significance, Mahama noted that Ghana's founding father and Pan-Africanist Kwame Nkrumah wore it on Independence Day in 1957, and that he himself had recently worn it proudly to the UN.Other presidents, including Nana Akufo-Addo, John Kufuor and Jerry John Rawlings, have also embraced and publicly promoted the outfit.More about Ghana from the BBC:Getty Images/BBCBBC Africa podcasts",

Democrats have hoped to capitalise on the impasse to ensure health insurance subsidies for those with low-income do not expire and reverse the Trump administration's cuts to the Medicaid health programme. </p><p>Republicans, for their part, have repeatedly accused Democrats of shutting down the government in a bid to provide <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vzyl5x15ro\">healthcare to undocumented immigrants</a> - a charge that Democratic leaders have denied. </p><p>A total of 54 Senators voted in favour of a Republican-led proposal to fund the government, with 44 against and two not voting. </p><p>A separate, Democrat-led proposal also failed, with 45 voting in favour and 52 against. </p><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gjyzv6vv8o\">'No good outcome' - voters across US share concerns about shutdown</a></li><li><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg201rnw2zo\">Trump wields axe over 'Democrat Agencies' as shutdown blame game rages</a></li></ul><p>Both sides have continued to blame the other for the shutdown, with little sign of any progress in negotiations. </p><p>\"We can vote and vote and vote,\" Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley told the BBC. \"But it's up to basically five people.\" </p><p>During a news briefing at the White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of holding Americans \"hostage over their demands\". </p><p>\"The economic consequences of this shut down are piling up every day,\" she added, noting that $15bn (£11.1bn) in GDP could be lost each week as unemployment rises. </p><p>White House officials have repeatedly vowed to lay off federal workers if the shutdown continues, and earlier this week President Donald Trump posted that he would meet with Russell Vought, who heads OMB, to examine \"which of the many Democrat agencies\" that should be cut. </p><p>The White House has provided no scope or timeline for any potential lay-offs or cuts to agencies. Leavitt said that most of those cuts would come from agencies that \"do not align with this administration's values of putting our country first\". </p><p>As part of the federal government's response to the shut down, Vought on Friday announced the suspension of $2.1bn in federal infrastructure funding for Chicago, in addition to the previous freezing of $18bn in infrastructure spending in New York City and the cancellation of approximately $8bn in funding for federal energy projects in some Democratic-run states. </p><p>On the Senate floor, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Democrats are fighting the healthcare issue because \"we know Americans want this\". </p><p>\"And we know many of my Republican colleagues want this as well,\" he said. \"But failure to act would be devastating, and Republicans know it.\" </p><p>Some Democrats - including Connecticut Senator Richard Bluementhal and Pennsylvania Senator John Fetterman - said they want to hear directly from the president about the ongoing stalemate. </p><p>Citing a bipartisan border bill that the president ultimately rejected last year, they said they fear that any negotiations with Senate Republicans could ultimately be contradicted by Trump. </p><p>Early polls have suggested that Americans are deeply split on the shutdown, with one Washington Post poll conducted on 1 October finding that 47% of US adults blame Republicans, compared to 30% who blame Democrats. </p><p>Another 23% said they were unsure.</p><p><i>(With additional reporting from Cai Pigliucci on Capitol Hill)</i></p></div>"

The group agreed to release all the remaining Israeli hostages, both living and dead, and that Gaza would be governed by technocrats. </p><p>But, among other things, the group did not mention whether it would disarm - a key Israeli demand.</p><p>In both Gaza and Israel, there has been cautious optimism that the current efforts could finally lead to a deal. One of the main differences now is the personal involvement of Trump, keen to be remembered – and rewarded – as the man who ended the war.</p><p>He has publicly urged Hamas to accept a deal, threatening even more military force, and there have been indications of his growing irritation with Israel's leadership recently. But it is unclear if the Trump effect will be enough.</p><p>The reality is that the obstacles that prevented earlier deals essentially remain the same, including Hamas' demand for a full Israeli withdrawal and a guarantee that Israel will not resume the war after the hostages are freed.

Hybrid sales have jumped by a factor of three.</p><p>Battery-powered cars accounted for 10% of overall sales in August - a new high, according to S&P Global Mobility. </p><p>And in updates to investors this week, General Motors, Ford, Tesla and other companies all reported record electric sales over the past three months.</p><p>This marked a bright spot in an industry wrestling with the fallout from still high interest rates and buyers on edge over inflation, tariffs and the wider economy. </p></div><div><p>But analysts say the boom was caused by a dash to buy before the end of a government subsidy that helped knock as much as $7,500 (£5,588) off the price<b> </b>of certain battery electric, plug-in hybrid or fuel cell vehicles. </p><p>With that tax credit gone as of the end of September, carmakers are expecting momentum to shift into reverse. </p><p>\"It's going to be a vibrant industry, but it's going to be smaller, way smaller than we thought,\" Ford chief executive Jim Farley said at an event on Tuesday.</p><p>\"I expect that EV demand is going to drop off pretty precipitously,\" the chief financial officer of General Motors, Paul Jacobson, said at a conference last month, adding it would take time to see how quickly buyers would come back.</p></div><div><p>Even with the recent gains, the US, the world's second biggest car market, stood out as a laggard in electric car sales compared to much of the rest of the world. </p><p>In the UK, for example, sales of battery electric and hybrid cars made up nearly 30% of new sales last year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyd094168go\">Latest industry figures suggest that number is even higher.</a></p><p>In Europe, they accounted for roughly one in five sales, while in China, the world's biggest car market, sales of such cars accounted for almost half of overall sales last year, according to the IEA, and they are expected to become the majority this year.</p><p>Take-up in some other countries, like Norway and Nepal, is even greater. </p><p>Electric vehicles (EVs) tend to account for a smaller share of sales in Latin America, Africa and other parts of Asia - but growth there has been surging. </p></div><p></p><h2>Policy differences</h2><p></p><div><p>Analysts say adoption in the US has been slowed by comparatively weak government support for the sector, which has limited the kinds of subsidies, trade-in programmes and rules that have helped the industry in places such as China, the UK and Europe.  </p><p>Former President Joe Biden pushed hard to increase take-up, aiming<b> </b>for electric cars to account for half of all sales in the US by 2030.</p><p>His administration tightened rules on emissions, boosted demand through purchases for government fleets, nudged carmakers to invest with loans and grants for EV investments, spent billions building charging stations and expanded the $7,500 tax credit as a sweetener for buyers.</p><p>Supporters cast those efforts in part as a competitive imperative, warning that without these US carmakers would risk losing out to competitors from China and other countries.</p><p>But President Donald Trump, who recently called climate change a \"con job\", has pushed to scrap many of those measures, including the $7,500 credit, arguing that they were pushing people to buy cars they would not otherwise want. </p><p>\"We're saying ... you're not going to be forced to make all of those cars,\" he said this summer, while signing <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgq4wxd583o\">a bill aimed at striking down</a> rules from California, which would have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62683260\">phased out sales of petrol-only cars</a> in the state by 2035. \"You can make them, but it'll be by the market, judged by the market.\"</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1692/live/2ca15240-9fcc-11f0-9898-81c16e16c706.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bloomberg via Getty Images A row of BYD Dolphin compact hatchback electric vehicles illuminated by fluorescent lights at a manufacturing plant\" /><span>Bloomberg via Getty Images</span></p></div></figure><div><p>Electric cars have become more affordable in the US in recent years - but they still cost more than comparable petrol-powered vehicles. </p><p>And Chinese carmakers like BYD, which have made rapid inroads in other markets thanks to low prices, have been effectively shut out of the US, due to high tariffs targeting cars made in China, backed by both Biden and Trump. </p><p>As of August, the average transaction price of an electric car in the US was more than $57,000, according to auto industry research firm Kelley Blue Book, about 16% higher than the average for all cars.</p><p>The least expensive battery car on offer, a Nissan Leaf, costs about $30,000 (£22,000). By comparison, several models can be found for under £20,000 in the UK.    </p></div><div><p>Analysts say what buyers do next hinges on how carmakers set prices in the months ahead, as they contend not only with the end of the tax credit but also tariffs on foreign cars and certain car parts that Trump introduced this spring. </p><p>Hyundai said this week it would offset the loss of the tax credit by lowering the price for its range of Ioniq EVs. But Tesla said the cost for monthly lease payments of some of its cars would rise. </p><p>Stephanie Brinley, associate director of S&P Global Mobility, said she did not expect to see many firms follow Hyundai's example, given the pressures from tariffs. </p><p>While some buyers may opt for EVs anyway, \"next year is going to be hard,\" she warned, noting that her firm is calling for overall car sales to fall by roughly 2% in 2026.  </p><p>\"It would have been difficult enough if all you had to deal with is new tariffs, but with new tariffs and the incentive going away, there's two impacts.\"</p></div><div><p>Carmakers had already been scaling back their investments in electric cars.</p><p>Researchers say Trump's policy changes could reduce those investments even more.</p><p>\"It's a big hit to the EV industry - there's no tiptoeing around it,\" said Katherine Yusko, research analyst at the American Security Project</p><p>\"The subsidies were initially a way to level the playing field and now that they're gone the US has a lot of ground to make up.\"</p><p>However Ms Brinley said she was hesitant to declare the US behind in an industry still testing out technology alternatives. </p><p>\"Is [electric] really the right thing?\" she said. \"Saying that we're behind assumes that this is the only and best solution and I think it's a little early to say that.\"</p></div></article>"

Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will appoint the rest.</p><p>Long-time former President Assad was ousted by Sharaa's forces 10 months ago after a 13-year civil war.</p><p>Authorities say they have postponed the polls for security reasons in two Kurdish- controlled provinces and a third which saw deadly fighting between government forces and Druze militias.</p></div><div><p>The clashes, in July, marked the latest outbreak of sectarian violence in Syria since Assad's overthrow.</p><p>In a speech at the UN General Assembly last week - the first by a Syrian president in 60 years - Sharaa promised to bring to justice everyone responsible for the bloodshed, as well as those who committed atrocities under Assad.</p><p>He also pledged that Syria was now \"rebuilding itself through establishing a new state, building institutions and laws that guarantee the rights of all without exception\".</p><p>Sunday's polls are being overseen by the Higher Committee for the Syrian People's Assembly Elections, whose 11 members were chosen by the president in June.</p><p>The number of seats allocated in each of 60 districts is based on census data collected in 2010 - the year before the country descended into a civil war that killed more than 600,000 people and displaced another 12 million.</p><p>The postponement of the elections in the three provinces - Raqqa, Hassakeh and Suweida - means the electoral colleges in only 50 out of 60 districts will be choosing representatives for about 120 seats on Sunday.</p></div><div><p>There will be more than 1,500 candidates, who must also be electoral college members. Supporters of \"the former regime or terrorist organisations\" were barred from membership, as were advocates of \"secession, division or seeking foreign intervention\".</p><p>At least 20% of the electoral college members were required to be women. But there were no minimum quotas for female lawmakers, nor for those from the country's many ethnic and religious minorities.</p><p>The president will choose representatives for 70 seats from outside the electoral colleges.</p><p>Last month, 14 Syrian civil society groups expressed concern that this meant he would have direct influence over parliament's composition. </p><p>\"This setup makes the parliament susceptible to power balances not reflecting the voters' will and undermines its intended representative nature, enabling the executive authority to dominate an institution that should be independent and reflective of the popular will,\" a joint statement warned.</p><p>They also said the president's direct and indirect influence over the Higher Committee and the electoral colleges rendered the elections \"symbolic at best, devoid of their democratic purpose of ensuring representation and accountability\".</p></div><figure><div><p><img src=\"https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250919-090805-05e5ba0164-web-2.30.1-2/grey-placeholder.png\" /><img srcset=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 240w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 320w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 480w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 640w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 800w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1024w, https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp 1536w\" src=\"https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/d661/live/3c484e70-a043-11f0-b741-177e3e2c2fc7.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Reuters A woman takes an oath during the selection of subcommittee members supervising Syrian parliament elections, as multiple people look on (03/09/25)\" /><span>Reuters</span></p></div><p></p><figcaption>Concern has been expressed over the level of female representation in the election </figcaption><p></p></figure><div><p>Sharaa has defended the way the elections are being held. \"As a transitional period, there is a difficulty to hold popular elections due to the loss of documents, and half of the population is outside of Syria, also without documents,\" he said in a television interview, referring to the millions of refugees who have not returned.</p><p>The Higher Committee said it was not possible to hold elections in Raqqa, Hassakeh and Suweida because of the \"security and political situation\".

The two already sit in the same European Parliament group – the \"pro-sovereignty\" Patriots for Europe, which Babis founded alongside Hungary's Viktor Orban and Austria's Herbert Kickl last year.</p><p>ANO shares the Motorists' misgivings about the EU's emissions targets, and vows to modify or reject them outright.</p><p>Both parties are firmly against Czech households carrying a greater financial burden for cleaner energy, and both oppose the EU's ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars after 2035.</p><p>Relations with the SPD could be more fraught.</p><p>For a start, SPD fought this election in a formal alliance with a number of fringe parties on the far-right, meaning they will have to yield some of their seats to them.

A former government minister, TV host and avid heavy metal drummer, she is one of the best-known figures in Japanese politics - and a controversial one at that.</p><p>She faces many challenges, including contending with a sluggish economy and households struggling with relentless inflation and stagnant wages. </p><p>She will also have to navigate a rocky US-Japan relationship and see through a tariff deal with the Trump administration agreed by the previous government.</p></div><div><p>If confirmed as prime minister, one of Takaichi's key challenges will be uniting the party after a turbulent few years which saw it rocked by scandals and internal conflicts. </p><p>Last month, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose term lasted just over a year, announced he would step down after a series of election defeats that saw the  Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) governing coalition lose its majority in both chambers of parliament.</p><p>Prof Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Temple University in Tokyo, told the BBC that Takaichi was unlikely to have \"much success at healing the internal party rift\".</p><p>Takaichi belongs to the \"hardline\" faction of the LDP, which believed that \"the reason the LDP support has imploded is because it lost touch with its right-wing DNA\", he added.</p><p>\"I think she's in a good position to regain the right wing voters, but at the expense of wider popular appeal, if they go into a national election.\"</p><p>Takaichi has been a long-time admirer of Britain's first female prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. She is now ever closer to fulfilling her Iron Lady ambition. </p><p>But many women voters don't see her as an advocate for progress. </p><p>\"She calls herself Japan's Margaret Thatcher. In terms of fiscal discipline, she's anything but Thatcher,\" Prof Kingston said.</p><p>\"But like Thatcher she's not much of a healer. I don't think she's done much to empower women.\"</p><p>Takaichi is a staunch conservative who's long opposed legislation allowing women to keep their maiden names after marriage, saying it is against tradition. She is also against same sex marriage. </p><p>A protégé of the late former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi has vowed to bring back his economic vision, known as Abenomics – which involves high fiscal spending and cheap borrowing. </p><p>The LDP veteran is hawkish on security and aims to revise Japan's pacifist constitution. </p><p>She's also a regular visitor of the controversial Yasukuni shrine where Japan's war dead including some convicted war criminals are memorialised.</p><p>She will likely be confirmed by parliament, although not automatically like her predecessors because the ruling party is in a much weaker position now having lost its majority in both houses.</p></div>"

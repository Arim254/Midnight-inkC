    "body": "Trust is the foundation of emotional intimacy and long-term connection in romantic relationships.When you trust your partner, you believe that they will follow through on their commitments. But it's also shaped by your past experiences and emotional patterns. For example, if you experienced betrayal in a previous relationship, you might find it harder to believe others can be counted on, even when they can.As a Harvard-trained psychologist specializing in relationships, I've seen how trust influences the way couples communicate. Couples who truly trust each other never use eight phrases that quietly cause long-term damage.1. 'Do you love me?'Constantly asking for reassurance may be a sign of insecurity. Even if your partner answers \"yes,\" it might not feel genuine, especially if you had to ask.If you trust your partner cares about you, share with them that you're feeling vulnerable and want connection. Instead, they say:\"I'm feeling a little vulnerable. Can I get a hug?\"\"It's important to me that we express how we feel. How are you feeling about us lately?\"2. 'Let me see your phone.'It can be tempting to do a \"check-up\" when you feel suspicious. But snooping signals a lack of trust. In healthy relationships, privacy is respected. You both have the right to your own space and communication.Instead, they say:\"I'm sensing something's off. Is there something you're not telling me?\"\"I noticed you got some late-night texts. Everything okay?\"3. 'I don't even know you anymore.'We're always growing and changing. It's a part of life. In relationships rooted in trust, change is seen as an opportunity to evolve together over time.Instead, they say:\"I didn't know that about you.\"\"Even after all this time, I'm still learning about you. I love that.\"4. 'Don't leave me.'Commitment is important. But if dysfunction lasts over time, your partner may leave (or vice versa!). You want to trust that your partner will stay because they choose to, not because you've guilt-tripped, manipulated, or begged them to do so. Instead, they say:\"I trust that we can get through this tough time.\"\"If you ever feel this relationship isn't right, it will be hard for me. But I'll get through it.\"5. 'I can't talk to you about this.'Couples who trust each other are willing to talk about anything, no matter how painful or uncomfortable it might be. They trust that their partner be respectful and stay connected even if they disagree. Instead, they say:\"I know I can tell you anything.\"\"Thank you for loving me, even when it's hard.\"6. 'Text me every hour.'Couples who trust one another give each other space. This means they don't need constant check-ins to feel secure. They know that their partner is okay and even thriving when they are physically apart.Instead, they say:\"Have fun tonight!\"\"Shoot me a text when you're heading home.\"7. 'I'm done with you.'Relationships go through highs and lows. Saying \"I'm done\" in the heat of an argument can cause long-term damage. Couples who trust each other don't make empty threats, and they know that one tough moment doesn't mean the relationship is over.Instead, they say:\"We'll figure this out.\"\"I'm not going anywhere. I've got your back.\" 8. 'You should know why I'm upset.'Expecting your partner to read your mind isn't fair. Communication is key to any successful relationship. If you trust your partner, you stay engaged and talk to them respectfully.Instead, they say:\"Here's why I'm upset.\"\"I need a moment to cool off, but I'll come back when I'm ready to talk.\"Dr. Cortney S.

    "body": "Police officers stand guard outside the Supreme Court on November 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Monday morning that it still wants a block on a Rhode Island federal judge's order mandating that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits for November.The message came a day after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, for a second time, flatly rejected a request by the Trump administration to stay that order pending its full appeal of the decision.That judge's order remains temporarily paused as a result of a prior ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.But Jackson on Monday told the Trump administration to inform the Supreme Court by 11 a.m. ET whether it intends to continue to seek a stay of the order. The administration quickly did so, and said it would comply with her directive to file a supplemental brief on the request by 4 p.m. Monday. Plaintiffs in the case were told to respond by 8 a.m. on Tuesday.Separately on Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order blocking the Trump administration's memo over the weekend telling states that they had to \"undo\" any full SNAP benefits payments to recipients, or face financial penalties.The ruling Sunday night by a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued that memo.And it came hours after the Senate narrowly passed the first step of a bipartisan deal that might reopen the government within days, and fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through next September.\"In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,\" wrote Circuit Court Judge Julie Rikelman in the panel's decision Sunday. \"As the district court found, 'this is a problem that could have been avoided.'\"\"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" Rikelman wrote.\"In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 [temporary restraining order] after the government had failed to comply with it.\"The Trump administration on Oct. 24 broke decades of precedent when it said it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because Congress had not appropriated money for the program, or any other government program, past the date the shutdown began, Oct. 1. Past administrations had paid SNAP benefits in full during other shutdowns.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration rejected the idea of using the remaining $4.6 billion in a contingency fund that Congress had specifically allocated to backstop SNAP.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of nonprofits, local governments, a union and a food retailer, sued the administration in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island seeking a judicial order forcing the administration to use the contingency fund and other pools of money to fully fund SNAP benefits.Judge Jack McConnell, who is overseeing the case, ordered the administration to make at least partial benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund, and to investigate if other money could be used.McConnell on Thursday ordered that the administration pay full benefits, days after the administration told him it would pay only partial benefits — but that it would take some time to do so — and told him that it had ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds.McConnell ordered that the administration use Section 32 funds to make up the difference between the 65% of benefits the administration planned to pay by using the contingency fund and the full value of the benefits. SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion each month.The administration then asked the 1st Circuit for a temporary stay of McConnell's order on an emergency basis, which the appeals court rejected Friday.But the appeals court at the same time also said it was still considering the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] ... and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"On Friday night, Jackson, acting on a request by the administration, paused McConnell's order from taking effect and told the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the request for the stay pending appeal.Jackson's order paused for 48 hours any ruling by the 1st Circuit from taking effect.",

    "body": "Ofer Shacham is CEO of Majestic Labs.Tal GivonyThree former Meta and Google silicon executives on Monday announced they've raised a total of $100 million to build technology they say will reduce cloud companies' spend on data center buildouts.Called Majestic Labs, the startup's co-founders are Ofer Shacham, Sha Rabii and Masumi Reynders, all of whom spent years working together leading silicon products at Meta and Google. Majestic's patent-pending silicon design architecture includes 1,000 times the memory of a typical enterprise-grade server, the co-founders told CNBC.Majestic develops its entire chip system, much like Nvidia, but each of the startup's servers may replace up to 10 of today's leading racks, they said.The company closed its $71 million Series A funding round in September, led by Bow Wave Capital. Among its others investors is Lux Capital. Prior to Monday's announcement, the co-founders had been quietly working on the startup since late 2023.Majestic's funding announcement comes as major tech companies raise their capital expenditures, primarily for data center infrastructure. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures in October, and they collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, more companies are entering the fold. Google last week announced Ironwood, its latest tensor processing unit, or TPUs, which artificial intelligence startup Anthropic plans to use for its Claude model.Sha Rabii is Majestic Labs President. Rabii used to lead Google's silicon efforts.GoogleHowever, memory capacity remains a challenge for companies that have large amounts of data to process, which the Majestic co-founders said they hope to address.\"Nvidia makes excellent GPUs and has driven incredible AI innovation,\" Shacham, Majestic's CEO, told CNBC. \"We're not trying to replace GPUs across the board — we're solving for memory-intensive AI workloads where the fixed compute-to-memory ratio becomes a constraint\"Majestic is going after hyperscalers and large companies that run AI models, including those from the financial and pharmaceutical industries, the co-founders said.The technology underpinning the company includes patent-pending architectures that allow Majestic to collapse multiple racks worth of conventional equipment and memory into a single server. Majestic claims that will allow for a smaller footprint and requires less power and cooling, helping the company's clients reduce their data center costs.Prototypes of Majestic's box servers will be available for some customers in 2027, and the startup has already begun discussing pre-orders, the co-founders said. Majestic declined to share its clients.The company has fewer than 50 employees — half of which are based in Tel Aviv, Israel, while the rest are based in Los Altos, California. Majestic said it plans to grow each location and seek additional funding in the coming year. Always in the peripheryThe trio met at Google, and together, they helped stand up the team working on Google's TPUs.\"We'd been building AI for DARPA, for Google, for Meta, but suddenly AI became this ubiquitous thing that everybody needs,\" Shacham said. \"Every large company needs AI, and that was a good time for me to say 'How about we go and do that?'\"The first to join the search company was Reynders in 2003, who went to Google as a senior corporate counsel. She's now Majestic's COO and manages the business side of the company.At Google, her teams were focused on business development and product strategy focused on silicon. Reynders spent 15 years at Google, where she rose to director of product management and silicon.Rabii, Majestic's president, earned his doctorate from Stanford University, and in 2011, he sold his last chip design company, Arda Technologies, to Google, where he rose to senior director of engineering. Under Rabii, Google launched its video chip Argos, which is used in YouTube's data centers.Shacham sold his company, Chip Genesis, to Google in August 2013, when Rabii was leading Google's silicon team. Chip Genesis's technology was used broadly across many products including the AI accelerators in Google's Pixel smartphones. At Google, Shacham rose to head of silicon design and implementation for consumer hardware.Majestic Labs chief operating officer and co-founder Masumi ReyndersSharyce RainsThe three of them left Google in 2018 for the company then known as Facebook. There, they built the Facebook Agile Silicon Team, known as \"FAST,\" within the company's Reality Labs hardware division. Shacham rose to vice president and head of FAST.When Meta laid off employees from Reality Labs in 2023, Shacham had to conduct the cuts, he said. At that point, Meta was trying to conserve cash, he said.\"Part of that was layoffs across the organization, and FAST was not excluded from that,\" Shacham said. \"It's not a good place to be, not a good feeling to do.\"The three founded Majestic Labs after brainstorming about the biggest bottleneck problems for silicon and AI.\"We've been friends and colleagues for a long time, so this notion of working together and doing something exciting has always been in the periphery,\" Reynders said.As Majestic eyes growth and hiring in 2026, the co-founders said they're tapping into their collective of rolodex of the more than 1,500 employees they've worked with at prior companies, including Meta and Google.\"There's that trust they already have with us,\" Rabii said of the former colleagues.WATCH: Google opens access to its most powerful AI chipwatch now",

Gross transaction value, which tracks the value of goods sold, rose 10% to $9.17 billion from $8.3 billion last year and surpassed a $9.11 billion estimate from FactSet.In his first letter to shareholders as CEO, Rogers said Instacart is focused on affordability and boosting its enterprise solutions. He referred to the company's enterprise platform as one of the \"most underappreciated parts\" of the business during an earnings call with analysts.\"We're deepening customer and retailer relationships, expanding our ads ecosystem, and launching innovative AI-powered tools across all aspects of our business — all while driving profitable growth,\" he wrote.For the current quarter, the grocery delivery platform forecasted gross transaction value to range between $9.45 billion and $9.6 billion, reflecting 9% to 11% year-over-year growth.

Instacart said average order volume fell 4% due to restaurant orders and waived delivery fees on lower basket orders for Instacart+ members.Instacart is facing an increasingly competitive landscape, with market share loss a concern as more companies hop into the grocery delivery space. This summer, e-commerce giant Amazon launched same-day fresh food delivery and said it plans to reach at least 2,300 markets by year end. Food delivery leader Doordash expanded its partnership with Kroger in September.Rogers told analysts on Monday that the company isn't concerned about retailers such as Kroger teaming up with other partners. He referred to last week's news that Kroger will expand its agreement with Instacart as a \"strong vote of confidence in the value that we bring.\"Net income rose to $144 million, or 51 cents per share, from $118 million, or 42 cents in the year-ago period.The company said it is using artificial intelligence tools to expand features for grocers and shoppers and boost its advertising offering. Earlier this month, the company launched a suite of new AI solutions for grocers, including a shopping assistant that offers product recommendations.The company also upped its share buyback plan by $1.5 billion and said it plans to undertake an accelerated $250 million share repurchase program.WATCH: Investors don't like investment cycles, says Evercore ISI's Mark Mahaneywatch now",

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a memo late Saturday evening, threatened to enact financial penalties on states that issued full monthly SNAP benefits for November if they don't \"undo\" those food stamp payments.The late-night directive from the Trump administration adds to the chaos surrounding the anti-hunger program that serves more than 42 million Americans.The memo, signed by Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary of the USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, warned states that the administration had not cleared full SNAP benefit payments for November.\"To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,\" the memo said.State program administrators were directed to distribute 65% partial payments of SNAP benefits for the month instead, the memo said.States must also \"immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,\" the memo said. Failure to comply could result in the USDA cancelling the federal share of administration costs or holding states financially liable for \"any overissuances that result from the noncompliance.\"It was unclear how the USDA expects states to claw back any unauthorized SNAP payments.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., blasted the Trump administration's move.\"The cruelty is the point. It is their choice to do this,\" Klobuchar wrote in a post on the social media site X.The USDA and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe memo was first reported by The New York Times.It comes as some states scrambled to comply with a court ruling on Thursday, when a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November on Friday. The judge rejected the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program amid the U.S. government shutdown.The USDA subsequently told states that it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with that order, even as the ruling faced an appeal from the Trump administration.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"The administration asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency injunction to block the order that it pay full food stamp benefits pending the outcome of its appeal of that order. A three-judge panel on the appeals court denied that request on Friday.But within hours, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the order. Jackson directed the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the administration's motion to impose an indefinite stay on the lower court's order mandating full benefits.The Trump administration previously said that it would not use a contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November.U.S. District Court of Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell on Oct. 31 told the administration to use that fund to pay partial benefits, at least, and to explore other options to provide full benefits.The administration, days later, said it would pay 65% of the benefits, but ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds to make up the difference.The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1. Hopes that the shutdown may be nearing an end were buoyed Sunday evening after Senate lawmakers took a critical step towards a potential deal to reopen the government, but there are no guarantees lawmakers will come to an agreement anytime soon.Past administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.",

    "body": "Tourists walk past the U.S. Capitol more than a month into the continuing U.S. government shutdown in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 7, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersThe Senate late Sunday night passed the first stage of a deal that would end the U.S. government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.The procedural measure that allows other votes essential to the agreement to be held starting on Monday was approved with the bare minimum of 60 yes votes, after eight senators in the Democratic caucus broke with party leadership to support the deal. Forty senators voted no.Voting was held open on the Senate floor for more than two hours to allow for the arrival of the final \"aye\" vote, cast by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who flew to Washington, D.C., on Sunday evening for the proceeding.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, is seen after the senate luncheons in the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday, June 3, 2025. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesSenators broke into applause when Cornyn walked in to vote for the measure, just before 10:50 p.m. ET.The agreement, which was reached after round-the-clock negotiations over the weekend, would fund the U.S. government through the end of January.The deal does not include what had been the key demand for Democrats: an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of December.But the agreement, for the first time since the shutdown began, includes a guarantee by Republicans of a vote in December on a bill chosen by Democrats to extend those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance plans purchased on ACA marketplaces.The deal would need to be approved by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump before the shutdown ends.The deal calls for a reversal of all permanent layoffs of government employees during the shutdown and protection of such so-called reductions-in-force happening until the end of fiscal year 2026.It also guarantees that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown, when many of them were not allowed to work.The package includes provisions for having a bipartisan budget process and preventing the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.It would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.The Trump administration last week said that it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because of the shutdown, and on Friday won a temporary order from the Supreme Court blocking a federal judge's ruling mandating that full SNAP benefits be paid to recipients this month. The administration has said it will pay only partial food stamp benefits.With Cornyn not on the floor, the vote for more than 25 minutes was stuck at 56 ayes and 40 nays, with three other GOP senators, Rick Scott of Florida, Wisconsin's Ron Johnson and Mike Lee of Utah, not voting, for unclear reasons.All three eventually voted aye, in quick succession, after they spoke with Senate Majority Leader John Thune.One Republican, Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the measure.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key races\"After 40 long days, I'm hopeful that we can bring the shutdown to an end,\" said Thune, before the vote.Thune's efforts to pass a continuing resolution to reopen the government had failed in 14 prior votes before Sunday night.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., talks with reporters in the U.S. Capitol on the eighth day of the government shutdown on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025.Tom Williams | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThune negotiated the deal with the White House and three members of the Democratic caucus, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both Democrats from New Hampshire, and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.The other Democrats who voted for the deal were the party's whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Virginia's Tim Kaine.Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats, called the deal \"horrific\" and said that the Republicans' agreement to schedule a vote next month on the ACA credits was a \"totally meaningless gesture.\"King, during a press conference while the vote was still ongoing, said that he would tell his constituents that he agreed to drop the main demand of extending the ACA credit \"because it wasn't working.\" \"It's been six weeks,\" King said. \"The Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, the Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\"Would it change in a week or another week or after Thanksgiving or Christmas? And there's no evidence that it would,\" he said. \"What there is evidence of is the harm that the shutdown is doing to the country.\" Shaheen, at the same press conference, said, \"This was the only deal on the table.\"\"It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the ACA tax credits that tens of millions of Americans rely on to keep costs down,\" Shaheen said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in angry remarks on the Senate floor, said he would not vote for the deal.US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New York, speaks during a press conference at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, Oct. 29, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesSchumer blasted Republicans and Trump for refusing to agree to extend the ACA credits, which he said would lead to much higher health insurance costs for millions of people in 2026.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot, in good faith, support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said.Kaine, before voting to support the deal, said, \"I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans' health care mess and to protect the federal workforce.\"\"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do,\" Kaine said.\"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will.\"A strong majority of Americans favor extending the enhanced subsidies, which were adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

    "description": "Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping ",
    "body": "Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to scale the continent's booming deep tech cluster.While the European startup and venture capital ecosystem has long operated in the shadow of Silicon Valley, it has become fertile ground for Japanese corporates, whose domestic market is younger.  Japanese investors or venture capital funds who themselves have Japanese investors, known as limited partners, participated in European financing rounds worth more than 33 billion euros ($38 billion) since 2019 when a trade deal between the European Union and Japan came into force, according to research from venture capital fund NordicNinja and data platform Dealroom.   For the five years leading up to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, investment totaled 5.3 billion euros.In Europe at that time, \"there was no Japanese capital other than Softbank,\" Tomosaku Sohara, co-founder and managing partner of Japan-Europe VC NordicNinja, told CNBC. NordicNinja, which has 250 million euros of assets under management, is a collaboration between the firm's managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners.\"Softbank was pretty active already at that moment, because they had acquired Finnish gaming company Supercell,\" Sohara said, noting that the acquisition injected life into Finland's startup ecosystem. Now, Mitsubishi, Sanden, Yamato Holdings, and Marunouchi Innovation Partners are among those directly backing European tech, per the report, while Japan-linked venture capital firms such as NordicNinja, Byfounders, and Toyota's Woven Capital cut checks to startups on the continent. There are over two times more VC-backed startups in Europe than in Japan, per capita, and 4.3 times more unicorns, per the report. The shadow of Silicon Valley  Japan's appetite for investing was always there, Sohara said. Its multinationals — like many — headed stateside to set up corporate venture capital arms in early 2000, in search of a slice of the action at the time when some of today's largest companies were just being thought up in dorm rooms.  \"Nobody wanted to look at Europe at that moment, but I think that after a couple of years they realized, 'Hey, maybe the U.S. culture is totally different from the Japanese culture,' and they began thinking, 'Hey, maybe we need to look at another region like Europe,'\" Sohara said, adding that the profile of entrepreneurs in Europe, many of whom came from large corporates at the time, was more aligned with Japan. That's in contrast to the young founders coming from Stanford or university research and development departments, he said.\"They have experience at the corporates and also they have a mindset of entrepreneurship. Japan, unfortunately, is lacking the entrepreneurship mindset,\" Sohara added, referring to Europe's founders, many of whom came from Nokia and Skype.The pull for foundersJapanese-linked investors have a penchant for one sector in particular: deep tech, which refers to companies building on top of scientific or engineering innovation. Deep tech and artificial intelligence accounted for 70% of deals made by such investors in Europe in 2024, echoing trends in the broader startup ecosystem as the AI, energy, and defense industries boom.  The top-funded companies with Japanese participation include the U.K.'s autonomous vehicle startup Wayve, which raised $1.05 billion in an investment round in May 2024, British quantum computing firm Quantinuum, which secured 273 million euros in January 2024, and Spanish quantum firm Multiverse Computing, which saw investors cut it a check of 189 million euros in June 2025. The rounds were backed by Softbank, Mitsui and Toshiba, respectively.  Such companies, however, typically need a lot of growth capital and industrial experience to scale successfully — two elements that Europe famously lacks.  \"Investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe,\"Sarah Fleischerco-founder and CEO, Tozero\"Japanese firms — and they're old, most of them that we're talking about, right — they're just sitting on a pile of money. They've been saving money throughout the last century, and now they're starting to spend it, to try to grow as a large corporate and increase their footprint outside of Japan,\" said Sarah Fleischer, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based battery materials recycling startup Tozero. \"You see that investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe,\" she added. Tozero has raised 14.5 million euros to date and counts NordicNinja, Honda and JGC among its investors.It's not just about the check. Japanese corporates and industrials have robust manufacturing and automotive know-how, Fleischer and Sohara noted respectively, meaning they are well positioned to plug Europe's knowledge gaps when it comes to scaling large manufacturing projects.Fleischer added that Japanese firms have long shored up their critical minerals supply chain and long-established trading firms, meaning they know how to secure essential components needed for the energy transition. For Tozero, this is an added plus, Fleischer said, given it's in the business of recovering such materials from spent batteries. In the age of political uncertainty amid choppy U.S.-China relations, Japan also acts as a good bridge to the Asian markets, Fleischer said.A slower pace and lower risk appetiteBack in Japan, the number of entrepreneurs is \"still very limited,\" Sohara said, as the older generation and \"great talents\" wanted to work for \"a Toyota and Honda or Sony,\" he added, but the younger generation's mindset is beginning to change.  Europe has also become the home to ambitious would-be founders searching for a tech ecosystem to build their companies in, Sohara said.However, as collaboration between Europe and Japan scales, language remains a barrier as fluency in English is not widespread in Japan, he added.  For Fleischer, this also poses challenges. \"There's so much miscommunication and local translation that could ruin a partnership instantly. And there's also some sort of cultural aspect as well, one needs to probably be aware of,\" she said, adding that she recently spent weeks in Japan getting to know her investors face-to-face, \"because that's still the sentiment\" there.  Decision-making can therefore be slower, the founder said, due to thorough research and preparation. \"They just do their homework,\" Fleischer said, noting that Japanese partners were hands-on in helping the company understand \"how to build our next future commercial plant, potentially starting from Japan and then going worldwide.\"watch nowIndeed, \"without the support from NN [NordicNinja] it would have been much more difficult to build the right relationships,\" said Aaike van Vugt, co-founder and CEO of Dutch nanotechnology engineering firm VSParticle.That's in contrast to perhaps the most well-known Japanese player: Softbank. Softbank is \"totally different\" from traditional Japanese investor cultures, given it is driven by founder Masayoshi Son's decisions rather than operating on a consensus basis, like most Japanese business, Sohara added.  The venture firm, known for its lofty bets on WeWork and, more recently, chip company Arm, poured huge sums of cash into tech startups amid the 2021 venture capital tech boom, which saw at least one Japanese-linked investor involved in deals worth 11.2 billion euros, per the report. Softbank stood out during this period; it was involved in 22% of deals with Japanese-linked participation in 2021.Interest ticking upLooking forward, Sohara and Fleischer expect greater collaboration between Europe and Japan. However, Japanese investors are expected to participate in rounds worth 3 billion euros in 2025, per the Dealroom and NordicNinja report, representing a dip from last year.  As many eyes turn to the Middle East for investment, Fleischer said that interest in Japan appears to be ticking up. Anecdotally, \"people reach out to me for intros, which is fun, to meet Japanese corporate LPs,\" she said, noting that this is a new development for her but that it may simply be because she has such investors now. \"I think it's also politically driven as well in Japan, by the government, to position themselves more geopolitically smartly and make sure that the corporates or the industries grow in certain ecosystems, strengthening their positioning as a country,\" she said.  Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that NordicNinja is a collaboration between its managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners, and to update Tozero's investors.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.\"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a \"non-starter.\"The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.In multiple posts on Saturday, Trump also reiterated his calls for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying earlier this week they would not support a change. Trump had called for his party to exercise what he called \"the Nuclear Option\" on the rule.On Saturday, Trump alleged that he is \"making progress\" with Republicans on changing the rule.\"The Democrats are cracking like dogs on the Shutdown because they are deathly afraid that I am making progress with the Republicans on TERMINATING THE FILIBUSTER! Whether we make a Deal or not, THE REPUBLICANS MUST 'BLOW UP' THE FILIBUSTER,\" he wrote.",

    "body": "This photograph shows a general view of Nexperia headquarters in Nijmegen on November 6, 2025.John Thys | Afp | Getty Images Shares of Wingtech Technology, parent company of chipmaker Nexperia, extended gains on Monday after Beijing agreed to further talks with a Dutch delegation, easing concerns about a global auto supply crunch.Shanghai-listed Wingtech Technology saw its shares jump as much as 6.4% on Monday, according to LSEG data, after surging 9.7% in the final minutes of trading last Friday on signs of de-escalation in a battle over control of the Dutch-based Nexperia.The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement Sunday that it had taken steps to allow exports of certain chips from Nexperia's China facility, while urging the European Union to press the Dutch government to lift restrictions on the firm.In a separate statement on Saturday, Beijing said that it has agreed to the Dutch government's request to send representatives to Beijing for talks, and that it hoped the Netherlands would propose \"constructive solutions\" and take \"concrete actions\" to resolve the dispute over Nexperia soon.The move followed a statement from Dutch Economic Affairs Minister Vincent Karremans last Thursday, which suggested Nexperia chips would reach customers in Europe and beyond in the coming days, citing \"the constructive nature of our talks with the Chinese authorities.\"China and the U.S. had informed the Netherlands that the trade deal they struck last month would result in the resumption of supplies from Nexperia's facilities in China, Karremans said. \"This is also consistent with information provided by the European Commission by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,\" he added.The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia on Sept. 30, citing security concerns that the company would shift its operations to China, where its parent company Wingtech is based, prompting Beijing to retaliate by blocking exports of components from Nexperia's Chinese facility.Automakers 'war room'The dispute over the ownership and control of the Dutch-based Nexperia led to worries of a global shortage of the chips widely used in industrial, computing, mobile and consumer products.Carmakers like Volkswagen warned of possible production risks, while Honda slashed its annual profit forecast after halting production at several plants.Other major automakers, including Stellantis, said they were monitoring the situation around the clock, setting up \"war rooms\" to explore alternative purchasing methods to mitigate disruptions.The recent escalation of the dispute over Nexperia was the \"direct result\" of Beijing's simmering tensions with the U.S., said Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI.watch nowWashington in late September expanded its entity list — a U.S. trade blacklist for companies seen as security or foreign policy risks — to include subsidiaries that are 50% or more owned by firms already on the list.Nexperia is one such subsidiary of Zhejiang-based communications equipment manufacturer Wingtech Technology Co., which was added to the list in December last year, Wang said.Following a trade truce struck between Beijing and Washington on Oct. 30, which led both sides to scale back some restrictions, China said earlier this month that it would allow Nexperia's China unit to resume shipments to global customers.\"Beijing appeared unwilling to gamble with bilateral relations [with the Netherlands],\" Evercore’s Neo said, as the stakes are high given that the Dutch government controls ASML Holding, the world's top supplier of advanced chipmaking equipment.Because of its unique technology, ASML has been a key focus of U.S.-China tensions, with Washington pressuring The Hague to restrict exports to China.Suppliers have begun receiving chip shipments from China, according to a note on Saturday from a team of auto and mobility analysts led by Dan Levy at Barclays. However, the analysts warned that low chip inventories could still cause disruptions in the near term.They added that the relief appeared \"temporary,\" as the core dispute between Nexperia's Dutch headquarters and its China-based operation remains unresolved.",

    "body": "watch nowIt's no secret that buying a home is expensive. The average sales price for U.S. homes has hovered around $400,000 since the end of 2021, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Most homebuyers looking to cover that cost turn to mortgage lenders, who pore over financial details like salaries, bank balances and retirement accounts to determine how risky it is to lend the money.That review process has typically excluded crypto assets. But for the roughly 15% of Americans who invest in digital assets, that could soon change.In June, a directive issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals to consider crypto as an asset in single-family home risk assessments.The director of the agency, Bill Pulte, wrote in a post on X that he ordered the two enterprises to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. Pulte said the directive came \"after significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.\"Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said the process would look similar to how lenders account for stocks and other investments.\"A lender would look at the assets that a potential borrower has, and before, they might have only considered stocks and bonds and those traditional kinds of investments, but now they would consider those less traditional cryptocurrency investments. And it might be a bit difficult for them to assess the riskiness, but I think they're used to assessing the riskiness,\" Fairweather said. \"There are stocks that are even more volatile and risky than some long-standing cryptocurrencies so I think for the lender, it would be pretty easy for them to adapt their framework to incorporate crypto into that.\"  The move from the FHFA found immediate backing from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who introduced a bill to codify the directive into law.  The directive from the federal lending agency also faced criticism from those who argue backing loans with crypto could add new stress to the home lending market.  In July, a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Pulte, taking issue with his \"risky proposals\" to allow unconverted crypto assets in mortgage loan underwriting. The senators requested information regarding his directive to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and they expressed concern that crypto is more volatile than traditional assets. They stressed that Congress and the public should better understand the agency's decision-making process to assess the potential risks and benefits to the order and the implications for the housing market.Watch the video above to learn why the Trump Administration wants to allow crypto-backed mortgages, and what it could mean for the housing market.",

    "body": "mapodile | E+ | Getty ImagesLAS VEGAS — Millions of households have individual retirement accounts, and simple mistakes can be expensive, experts warn.  One of the most common IRA errors is overlooking beneficiary designations, which dictate who receives the account after you die, according to Brandon Buckingham, vice president for the advanced planning group for Prudential Retirement Strategies. It's \"the biggest mistake people make,\" said Buckingham, speaking at the Financial Planning Association's annual conference on Tuesday. Some investors don't name a beneficiary or leave an outdated heir. The latter is particularly problematic, since beneficiary designations override what's outlined in your will, he said.  \"I can't tell you how many times I've seen an ex-spouse inherit an IRA or 401(k) account,\" Buckingham said. \"It happens all the time.\"As of mid-2024, nearly 58 million U.S. households, or about 44%, owned IRAs, up from 34% a decade ago, according to a March report from the Investment Company Institute, a trade organization. These accounts collectively held $16.2 trillion in assets around mid-year 2024.That growth has been fueled by employer retirement account rollovers, such as 401(k) plans, with nearly 60% of pretax traditional IRAs including rollovers in 2024, the report found.With trillions of wealth in IRAs, investors need to stay organized with beneficiary designations, which can easily be overlooked when you have multiple accounts, Buckingham said.The 'worst beneficiary' for your IRAIf you don't name a beneficiary for your IRA, the default is usually your estate, Buckingham said.\"The worst beneficiary you can ever have for a retirement account is the estate, whether it's on purpose or by default,\" he said.If you name a beneficiary, the account is payable to the heir upon death. But without a beneficiary, the assets go through probate, a legal process to settle the estate after death — which can be costly and time-consuming, Buckingham said.  In the meantime, income to the estate from the IRA is subject to a \"very compressed tax bracket\" because it hits the 37% rate once earnings exceed $15,650 for 2025, he said. By comparison, a married couple filing jointly reaches the 37% income tax bracket around $750,000 of taxable income for 2025.    Another issue is that an estate-owned IRA must be emptied within five years, Buckingham said. Typically, non-spouse heirs have 10 years to deplete inherited IRAs, which provides more time for tax planning.",

    "body": "Many restaurants may need to rethink their mandatory gratuity policies if they want this income to count as qualified tips for their workers under the new tax laws.The \"no tax on tips\" provision in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in \"qualified tips\" per year from 2025 through 2028. The rub is that mandatory gratuities, the 15% to 20% that restaurants often impose on parties of six people or more, aren't eligible for the deduction, a disappointment to the restaurant and foodservice industry, which held out hope for a different outcome.The industry is the country's second-largest private-sector employer, providing 15.7 million jobs, or 10% of the total U.S. workforce, according to a data brief from the National Restaurant Association based on the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey.The service fee issue is sure to resonate with many restaurateurs. Research from the National Restaurant Association shows that 54% of full-service operators — including 67% of fine-dining operators — say their restaurants sometimes add a service charge or automatic gratuity to customer checks. Among this group, 12% add the service charge or automatic gratuity to all checks, while 88% only add it to parties that exceed a specific number of people (typically six or more) or to banquets, private events or catering events. Notably, the Internal Revenue Service has never considered these service fees as tips. However, the restaurant industry hasn't necessarily followed the letter of the law, according to Jean Hagan, a partner at Eisner Advisory Group who focuses on the restaurant industry. Hagan said during a recent webinar for a large state restaurant association, many proprietors were surprised to learn they weren't supposed to be counting service fees as tips. \"They've just always been doing it a certain way — passing on the service fees to employees as a tip,\" Hagan said. Now, however, restaurants will have to put all tips through payroll, even if they weren't doing it before, or were incorrectly including service fees, so that the employee can benefit from the deduction. There will be more pressure on restaurants to do it properly. \"They've got to clean their systems up and follow the law as it's always been,\" Hagan said. \"If they don't, the employee won't get the full benefit of the new tax law.\" Industry lobbying unsuccessful to dateSome advocates for the restaurant industry have been lobbying to change the way service fees are treated. They'd like to see automatic gratuities included as tips. The Culinary Union in Nevada, for example, submitted formal recommendations to the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS that automatic gratuities and suggested tips both be treated as eligible tip income. Separately, several members of Congress from Nevada had asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to ensure that automatic gratuities are deemed eligible for the tips deduction. \"Functionally, for employees, there is no distinction between auto-gratuity and a tip, and inclusion of this income as eligible will prevent arbitrary distinctions between tip practices that would disadvantage workers based solely on the business model of their employer,\" lawmakers wrote in an Aug. 12 letter.However, upending the long-standing distinction between service fees and tips doesn't appear likely. In September, the IRS issued proposed rules on the new \"no tax on tips\" deduction. The rules aren't final yet, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room, since the language within the OBBBA is unambiguous — the tip has to be voluntary. \"Congressional intent is pretty clear,\" said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center. \"What's unclear is how restaurants respond to that,\" he added. Business owners weigh next steps, competitive advantageSome restaurants are taking a wait-and-see approach.\"Restaurant operators are watching closely for the final 'No Tax on Tips' rules from the IRS and will evaluate any shift in their restaurant's current policies on tipping so that it best suits their tipped employees' desires,\" Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, wrote in an email.\"These employees have chosen a restaurant job because of the income potential they get from tipping, so operators want to make sure that they can take full advantage of the tax credit while it is available to them,\" he wrote.Some restaurants are \"consulting with their accountants, point-of-sale providers, and teams to determine what approach works best for their business and employees,\" said a spokesperson for the Texas Restaurant Association.Some business owners may decide to make changes for competitive reasons. \"For restaurants who use the commission-based model or utilize service charges, those servers would likely consider it a disadvantage to forego $25,000 of tax-free income when they could potentially move to a restaurant that does not utilize service charges and are therefore eligible for tax-free tips up to $25,000,\" said a spokesperson for The Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association.IRS guidance on making the most of tips tax deductionEven though the regulations regarding these rules are not yet final, industry participants aren't expecting much to change with respect to service fees and tip eligibility. At a hearing in October, the IRS reiterated that it is maintaining the stance that service fees aren't eligible for the deduction, said Scott Klein, senior manager of tax policy and advocacy for the American Institute of CPAs, who attended the hearing. That's not likely to change in the final regulations, he said.In its September guidance, the IRS offered several examples of how restaurants can respond so their employees can eke out the most benefit from the deduction under the rules. \"If a customer is expressly provided an option to disregard or modify amounts added to a bill, such amounts are not mandatory amounts,\" the guidance states. Say, for example, that a restaurant's menu states that an automatic 18% charge will be added to all bills for parties of six or more customers. Even if the restaurant distributes this amount to waitstaff, it is not a qualified tip for purposes of the deduction, the IRS said. However, if the restaurant adds a line labeled \"additional tip amount\" and the customer adds in an amount equal to 2% of the price for food and beverages, the 2% can be considered a qualified tip.Another option would be for the restaurant to include a \"recommended tip\" equal to 18% of the price for food and beverages, and include a line for the customer to subtract (including to zero) or add to the recommended tip amount before paying the bill. Say the customer subtracts 3% from the recommended tip amount, resulting in a tip of 15%. The 15% amount that the customer voluntarily paid is a qualified tip in this scenario, according to the IRS.In another example provided by the IRS, a server presents a customer's bill on an electronic handheld point-of-sale device, which offers the option to pay 15%, 18%, 20%, other, or no tip. Because the customer has a right to determine the additional amount and was expressly provided the option to leave no tip, the amount chosen is a qualified tip. If, however, the customer was not given an option to modify the amount or leave zero tip, the amount selected would not be a qualified tip for purposes of the deduction.As restaurant owners and employees weigh their options, the clock is ticking. Because President Trump's OBBBA is so new, and the IRS is still crafting the applicable regulations, the situation is complicated for restaurants and other businesses whose employees want to claim a deduction for 2025. The AICPA had asked the Treasury Department and the IRS to include a safe harbor for businesses for this tax year, which the IRS issued in early November. This means employers will not face penalties for \"failing to provide a separate accounting of any amounts reasonably designated as cash tips or the occupation of the person receiving such tips.\"This safe harbor only applies to tax year 2025.",

    "body": "Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference for Eli Lilly and Company in Houston, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly and Nvidia are partnering to build what they call the pharmaceutical industry's \"most powerful\" supercomputer and so-called AI factory to help accelerate drug discovery and development across the sector, the companies announced Tuesday. It's the latest stride by Nvidia and the pharmaceutical industry to harness AI to help shorten the time it takes to bring cures to patients, while reducing costs at every stage of drug discovery and development. The process typically takes about 10 years on average from dosing the first human with a drug to its launch on the market, said Diogo Rau, Eli Lilly's chief information and digital officer, in an interview. Eli Lilly expects to complete the buildout of the supercomputer and AI factory in December. They will go online in January. But the new tools likely won't yield significant returns for the company's business and that of any other drugmaker until the end of the decade. \"The things that we're talking about discovering with this kind of power that we have right now, we're really going to see those benefits in 2030,\" Rau said. The industry's efforts to use AI to bring medicines to people faster are still in the early stages. There are no drugs on the market designed using AI, but progress is evident in the number of AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials, recent AI-focused investments and partnerships among drugmakers.Eli Lilly will own and operate the supercomputer, which will be powered by more than 1,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs – a newer family of chips from Nvidia – connected on a unified, high-speed network. The supercomputer will power the AI factory, a specialized computing infrastructure that will develop, train and deploy AI models at scale for drug discovery and development.The supercomputer \"is really a novel scientific instrument. It's like an enormous microscope for biologists,\" said Eli Lilly's Chief AI Officer Thomas Fuchs. \"It really allows us to do things we couldn't do before at that enormous scale. Scientists will be able to train AI models on millions of experiments to test potential medicines, \"dramatically expanding the scope and sophistication\" of drug discovery, according to a release from Eli Lilly. While finding new drugs isn't the only focus of the new tools, it is \"where the big opportunity is,\" said Rau.\"We're hopeful that we'll be able to discover new molecules that we never would have with humans alone,\" he said. Several AI models will be available on Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform that allows biotech companies to access drug discovery models that Eli Lilly has trained on years of its proprietary research. That data is worth $1 billion.Eli Lilly launched that platform in September as a way to expand access to drug discovery tools across the sector. \"It's really powerful to be able to give that extra starting point to these startups that, you know, otherwise could take a couple of years burning their capital to get to that point,\" said Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health care, adding that the company is \"delighted to participate\" in that effort. In exchange for access to the AI models, biotech companies are expected to contribute some of their own research and data to help train them, Rau noted. The TuneLab platform employs so-called federated learning, which means that companies can take advantage of Lilly's AI models without either side directly sharing data.Eli Lilly also plans to use the supercomputer to shorten drug development and help get treatments to people faster. The company said new scientific AI agents can support researchers, and advanced medical imaging can give scientists a clearer view of how diseases progress and help them develop new biomarkers — a measurable sign of a biological process or condition — for personalized care. \"We would actually like to deliver on that promise of precision medicine,\" Powell said. \"Without an AI infrastructure and foundation, we'll never get there, right? So we're doing all of the necessary building, and now we're seeing this true lift off, and Lilly is an exact example of that.\"Precision medicine is an approach that tailors disease prevention and treatment according to differences in a person's genes, environments, and lifestyles.",

    "body": "The UBS Group AG headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday, July 30, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwiss banking giant UBS on Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected third-quarter net profit, driven by solid investment banking performance and the release of legal provisions.Net profit attributable to shareholders came in at $2.5 billion for the three-month period, up 74% from $1.43 billion in the same period of last year. Analysts had expected third-quarter net profit of $1.85 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.Switzerland's largest bank said its net profit included net litigation reserve releases of $668 million, primarily due to the resolution of legal matters related to Credit Suisse's residential mortgage-backed securities business and its legacy cross-border activities in France.UBS posted third-quarter revenues of $12.76 billion, slightly above analyst expectations of $12.68 billion.Shares of UBS rose 2% shortly after Wednesday's opening bell. The stock price is up more than 13% so far this year.\"I'm very happy that the breadth and the quality of our diversified business model has once again delivered very strong results,\" UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Carolin Roth.watch nowEmotti said investments in strategic areas were paying off and the bank reported good progress on its complex integration of Credit Suisse. The integration process of its domestic rival is set to complete by the end of next year.UBS said it had reached $10 billion of its expected $13 billion in cost savings, well ahead of schedule, noting that more than two-thirds of Swiss-booked client accounts have now been migrated.UBS formally completed the legal takeover of its domestic rival as part of a state-backed rescue in 2023.The bank now faces a potentially significant increase in its mandatory capital requirements, however, as the government seeks to learn from Credit Suisse's collapse and reduce risks for taxpayers and the economy.UBS, for its part, said in June that while it supports most of the regulatory proposals outlined by the Swiss Federal Council, it \"strongly disagrees\" with what it described as the \"extreme\" increase in capital requirements.Market sentiment 'can shift quickly'UBS said wealth management pulled in $38 billion in net new assets over the third quarter.Looking ahead, UBS said the bank is \"likely to see more modest sequential gross and net saves in the fourth quarter,\" citing its continued focus on the Swiss platform migration and a seasonal uptick in non-personnel costs.The Swiss bank said investors appear to be increasingly focused on hedging downside risks, noting some recent spikes in market volatility.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSwiss bank UBS' share performance year-to-date\"Against this backdrop, transactional activity and our deal pipelines remain healthy, though sentiment can shift quickly as confidence in the outlook is tested and seasonal effects come into play,\" UBS said in a statement.\"Furthermore, macro uncertainties along with a strong Swiss franc and higher US tariffs are clouding the outlook for the Swiss economy, and a prolonged US government shutdown may delay capital market activities,\" it added.Earlier in the month, the Swiss government trimmed its 2026 economic forecast for the country, citing U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy. In August, the White House imposed tariffs of 39% on Swiss goods sent to the U.S. after a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials.It represents one of the highest country-specific tariff rates imposed by the Trump administration.",

    "body": "TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 27: U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One as he arrives at Haneda Airport on October 27, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. Takashi Aoyama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he expects to lower fentanyl-linked tariffs on China as Beijing confirmed a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the American leader.A spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Xi will meet Trump in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday to exchange views on issues of shared concerns, without elaborating.\"We are willing to work with the U.S. to push the meeting toward achieving positive outcomes,\" the spokesperson said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One that fentanyl flows into the U.S. and \"farmers\" will be among topics he expects to discuss with Xi on Thursday.When asked whether the potential one-year pause in Beijing's implementation of rare earth export controls would be enough to draw more concessions from the U.S., Trump said \"we haven't talked about the timing yet but we are gonna work out something.\"The two leaders' meeting — their first in-person sit-down since Trump's return to the office in January — comes as bilateral tensions have escalated in recent weeks. Beijing has turned up the heat on rare earth export controls, while Washington has retaliated with port fees on Chinese ships and threatened software-related export restrictions. A delicate trade detente between the world's top two economies that includes lower tariffs on each other's goods is nearing its expiration on Nov. 10, if they fail to agree on another extension. Trump has also threatened additional 100% tariffs on Beijing starting Nov. 1. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the U.S. could cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports by half, in return for Beijing's crack down on the export of chemicals that make fentanyl. If Washington were to lower those tariffs to 10%, that would bring the average duty on most Chinese imports — currently around 55% — to about 45%.On whether Taiwan would be on the agenda, Trump said \"I don't know if we'll even speak about Taiwan. He may want to ask about it. There is not that much to ask about it.\"Answering a question about exports of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China, Trump said \"I think we may be talking about that with President Xi.\"watch nowIn a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit on Wednesday, Trump said that he hoped to reach an agreement with Xi, which will be \"a good deal for both.\" The U.S. will also finalize a trade agreement with South Korea \"very soon,\" he added.Chinese President Xi will also deliver a speech at the summit and hold bilateral meetings with foreign leaders, a spokesperson of the ministry said last Friday.The U.S. president kicked off his whirlwind Asia trip on Sunday, signing a flurry of trade and mineral agreements with Southeast Asian leaders and most recently Japan.Likely outcomes from the Trump-Xi meeting include Beijing's guarantee of ensuring the U.S. access to rare earth items under its export-control measures, purchases of Boeing aircraft, approval for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operation and more efforts on curbing fentanyl flows, according to Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI.In return, the U.S. could offer to loosen export controls on certain semiconductor equipment and AI chips, roll back the 100% tariff threat, in addition to a reduction of 10 percentage points in the fentanyl-linked tariffs, starting from Nov. 10 as part of a renewed tariff truce, Wang said.\"We expect Beijing to give Trump a way out on the fentanyl deadlock, such as via a new promise from Xi in person, to facilitate Trump's reduction on China fentanyl tariff, effective no later than Nov. 10,\" Wang added.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company's GTC conference on Tuesday that its Blackwell graphics processing units — the company's fastest AI chips — are now in full production in Arizona.Previously, Nvidia's fastest GPUs were solely manufactured in Taiwan.Huang said that President Donald Trump had asked him nine months ago to bring manufacturing back to U.S. shores.\"The first thing that President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back,\" Huang said. \"Bring manufacturing back because it's necessary for national security. Bring manufacturing back because we want the jobs. We want that part of the economy.\"Earlier this month, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced that the first Blackwell wafers had been produced in a facility in Phoenix. Wafers are the base material on which semiconductors are etched.Nvidia said in a video that Blackwell-based systems will now be assembled in the U.S., too.Much of what the company announced on Tuesday at its conference in Washington was for an audience of policymakers to convince them of the essential role that Nvidia plays, and that it would hurt U.S. interests to restrict its exports.Huang said on Tuesday on a panel before his speech that Nvidia was holding its conference in Washington to allow Trump to attend, according to CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, but the president is currently on a trip in Asia.Trump said on Tuesday that he planned to meet with Huang on Wednesday, according to a Reuters report. Demand for the company's GPUs remains high, with 6 million Blackwell GPUs shipped in the last four quarters, Huang said Tuesday. Nvidia expects $500 billion in GPU sales between the Blackwell generation and next year's Rubin chips combined, he added.Cell networks 'built on foreign technologies'Additionally, Huang Tuesday said Nvidia would partner with Finland-based Nokia to build gear for telecommunications, an industry that he said was worth $3 trillion. As part of the partnership, Nvidia will take a $1 billion stake in Nokia.Huang said that Nvidia is building chips for 5G and 6G base stations because it's important to have wireless networks based on American technology.\"Thank you for helping the United States bring telecommunication technology back to America,\" Huang said to Nokia CEO Justin Hotard during his speech.The deal is an appeal to Western policymakers who have long had concerns about the amount of technology from China's Huawei that's used for cellular networks around the world.\"Our fundamental communication fabric is built on foreign technologies,\" Huang said. \"That has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift.\"Nokia will use Nvidia chips in its future base stations, which are the pricey computers that distribute cellular signals. Huawei, the market leader, was effectively banned in the U.S. in 2018, leaving Nokia and Ericsson as the primary equipment vendors for U.S. networks. Huang said that Nokia would be using a new product called Nvidia ARC that combines its Grace GPU, a Blackwell GPU and the company's networking parts. Huang said that AI delivered over next-generation 6G networks could help operate robots and deliver more accurate weather forecasts.Stakes are highThe location of the conference carries significance as Nvidia makes the case that it is a core part of the \"U.S. technology stack.\"Huang has argued that it would be better for American interests if Chinese AI developers got used to U.S. technology like Nvidia's chips, rather than forcing the Chinese to develop their own AI chips. \"Nvidia is a proud American company building the U.S. AI infrastructure that will ensure our country leads the world in shaping the future of innovation,\" Kari Briski, Nvidia's vice president of generative AI software for enterprise, told reporters on a Monday call. The stakes are high for Nvidia. U.S. export restrictions have already cost Nvidia billions of dollars in lost sales.In April, the U.S. government informed Nvidia that its H20 chip, which was specially designed to comply with U.S. export controls, would require a license to ship to China. In May, Nvidia said it would have recorded about $10.5 billion in H20 sales over two quarters if the government hadn't made the license requirement.Then, in July, Huang visited Trump in Washington and again tried to persuade him and other administration officials that it's in U.S. interests to ship Nvidia chips to China. The Trump administration said it would approve license requests for the H20, but that Nvidia would have to pay the U.S. government 15% of China sales. Still, Nvidia's China business isn't yet back on track.Earlier this month, Huang said at a financial conference that Nvidia is currently \"100% out of China\" and has no market share there. While Nvidia said it would receive licenses for the H20 chip, the company hasn't revealed a newer chip for China based on the company's current generation of Blackwell GPUs.Quantum computingMany of Nvidia's announcements on Tuesday were partnerships intended to signal that the company works with a variety of U.S. companies.Among those announcements was NVQLink, a new way to connect quantum chips to Nvidia's GPUs.The U.S. having a lead in quantum computing is important to policymakers because military officials are worried that a foreign adversary may be able to spy on military communications if it gets a working quantum computer first. Nvidia officials said in a Monday call that its chips can be used to correct errors that pop up during quantum computing and advance the technology. Nvidia said that 17 different quantum computing startups would produce hardware compatible with NVQLink.\"Researchers will be able to do more than just error correction,\" Huang said Tuesday. \"They will also be able to orchestrate quantum devices and AI supercomputers to run quantum GPU applications.\"Nvidia also said it will partner with the Department of Energy to build seven new supercomputers.WATCH: Nvidia CEO: We brought GTC to DC so President Trump could attendwatch now",

He also met Emperor Naruhito at the Imperial Palace.Takaichi's premiership will shift the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party toward more economically liberal, socially conservative, and hawkish security policies, FitchSolutions company GeoQuant wrote in a note.Markets are pricing in nearly 100% odds that the Federal Open Market Committee will deliver another quarter-point reduction, on the heels of September's cut, bringing the federal funds rate to a range between 3.75%-4.00%.\"If [Fed chair Jerome Powell] comes off dovish, bets for future Fed cuts will increase and provide more fuel to market momentum,\" veteran investor Louis Navellier wrote in a daily note.The federal funds rate, set by the Federal Open Market Committee, is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. While it doesn't directly affect consumers, the Fed's moves often influence borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other loans.The Topix, however, lost 0.15%. South Korea's Kospi rose 1.77%, while the small-cap Kosdaq lost 0.28%.India's Nifty 50 gained 0.44%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.96%. Australia's consumer prices rose 3.2% in the third quarter, the strongest gain in more than a year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The increase exceeded the 2.1% rise seen in the second quarter and was above the 3% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.Mainland CSI 300 was up around 1%.Hong Kong markets are closed for the holidays.Overnight in the U.S., all three major averages closed higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.23% to close at 6,890.89. It had surpassed the 6,900 level for the first time on an intraday basis earlier in the day.The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.80% to finish at 23,827.49, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 161.78 points, or 0.34%, to settle at 47,706.37. In addition to their closing highs, the tech-heavy Nasdaq and 30-stock Dow scored new all-time intraday highs alongside the broad market S&P 500.—CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon and Pia Singh contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Fall meetings at the IMF headquarters in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe easy part for the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will be announcing an interest rate cut when it wraps up its two-day policy meeting. The hard part will be taking care of other details that are presenting substantial challenges to policymaking these days.Markets are assigning a nearly 100% probability that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a second consecutive quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, reduction in the federal funds rate. The overnight lending benchmark is currently targeted between 4%-4.25%.Beyond that, policymakers are likely to debate, among other things, the future path of reductions, the challenges posed by a lack of economic data and the timetable for ending the reduction in its asset portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Underlining all of those deliberations will be a growing divergence of opinion over what the future holds for monetary policy.\"They are at a moment in the policy cycle where there's genuine disagreement between people who are thinking we will probably cut rates but I'm not ready to cut again just yet, and people who think even though there's risks, it's time to do more now,\" said Bill English, a Yale professor and the Fed's former director of monetary affairs. \"There's dissent between people who want to cut now, and people who want to wait and see a bit more.\"watch nowJudging by recent statements and prevailing Wall Street sentiment, newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran is likely to dissent in favor of a bigger cut, as he did at the September FOMC meeting.At the same time, regional Presidents Beth Hammack of Cleveland, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Jeffrey Schmid of St. Louis have expressed reluctance to go much further on cuts, though it's far from clear whether they will vote against a cut this week. Only Miran, who wanted a half-point reduction, actually dissented in what was an 11-1 committee vote last month to cut by a quarter point.Left to try to straddle the difference will be Chair Jerome Powell, who in a recent speech gave an implied nod to an October cut when he expressed worry over the state of the labor market.Investors will look to the central bank chief, who will leave the position in May 2026, for guidance on the prevailing sentiment.\"I would expect him to try to walk a middle ground, not tip his hand necessarily, on December,\" English said, referring to the next policy meeting after this one. \"I don't think he wants to be locked into a rate cut in December. But on the other hand, it does seem like he's worried about the labor market and about the outlook for real activity, so he doesn't want to come across as hawkish.\"Markets currently also are pricing in a near-certainty of a December reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, so it would take a lot do dissuade Wall Street from anticipating more Fed easing.Worries about jobsOne big reason officials are in the mood to lower is concern over the labor market. Even with an absence of data, there are clear signs that inflation is slowing even if layoffs, judging by state-level jobless claims submissions that are still ongoing despite the federal shutdown, do not appear to be accelerating.In fact, worries over jobs could keep the Fed cutting well into 2026, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.\"We expect 25 [basis points Wednesday] and then again in December, and then again in January and March and April,\" Tilley said. \"Then that would bring them down to what we think of as the neutral range to 2.75% to 3%.\"watch nowFed officials in September indicated, through the \"dot plot\" of individual members' expectations, that they won't get to a rate that neither pushes nor restrains growth — the so-called \"neutral\" rate — until 2027, and even then it will be a quarter point above where Tilley sees.However, he thinks the Fed won't have any choice but to react to labor market weakness, particularly as it poses a challenge to surprisingly strong economic growth seen in the second half of this year.Worries over jobs have taken more of the Fed's focus even as inflation remains well above the central bank's 2% target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week, in the only official data release during the shutdown, that the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index was stuck at 3% in September.Lack of data challengeOutside of the CPI report, central bankers face the additional challenge of the data blackout that has accompanied the government shutdown.\"It's hard to make policy to achieve two goals ... when you're not getting data about about at least one of them,\" Tilley said, referring to the Fed's dual mandate to maximize employment and keep prices stable, and the absence of the September nonfarm payrolls report due to the shutdown.\"I expect that to be communicated as more uncertainty about the path forward, that they have to be ready to pivot and hold rates, if need be, or to reduce them faster when they finally do get data,\" Tilley said.Finally, markets will be looking for more definitive answers on when the Fed will stop reducing its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, most of which is in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Nicknamed quantitative tightening, or QT, the process has entailed allowing proceeds from maturing securities to roll off rather than being reinvested as usual.In a recent speech, Powell indicated the time is getting closer to where the Fed will want to stop QT. While financial conditions are largely still solid, there have been some small signs lately that short-term markets are tightening up. With the Fed's overnight funding facility nearly drained, officials are likely to signal this week that QT is in its final stages.Market commentary was split over whether the Fed will announce the actual end of the program, or signal a future date when it will cease.\"There are signs that they're getting close to bottom, so to speak, in terms of getting through ample reserves and actually getting some tightness and liquidity. So that's why I would expect an announcement, if not action,\" Tilley said.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon said Tuesday that it will lay off about 14,000 corporate employees, marking the latest cuts in the company's multiyear effort to rein in costs.In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs are being carried out to help make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, while it looks to invest in \"our biggest bets\" including generative artificial intelligence.\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote. \"We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and businesses.\"The layoffs are expected to ultimately be the largest corporate job cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported. The cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, according to Reuters, which cited sources familiar with the matter.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawEmployees in Amazon's cloud, grocery, video games, human resources, sustainability and communications, ads and devices units were informed of cuts early Tuesday morning, although the layoffs are expected to touch nearly every area of the company.Amazon is the nation's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.It has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.The company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in \"key strategic areas.\"Amazon's job cuts come as companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing the size of their workforces.Several companies have indicated they can hire fewer employees and still grow their revenues, partly as a result of relying more on AI, which they believe will translate to greater efficiencies and productivity.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company's workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"Meta last week laid off about 600 staffers in its AI unit in an effort to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. Microsoft has cut more than 15,000 staffers this year as CEO Satya Nadella told staffers they must \"reimagine our mission for a new era\" of AI. Google made cuts to a number of units earlier this year and taken steps to reduce bureaucracy by eliminating 35% of managers overseeing small teams.Jassy, who took the helm at Amazon from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years. Amazon laid off 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and job reductions have continued since then, though at a smaller scale.Amazon is slimming down its workforce after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.The company has since moved to shutter some of its unprofitable initiatives, while committing to invest about $118 billion this year in AI development and cloud infrastructure. Amazon faces growing pressure to show its cloud and AI businesses aren't lagging behind rivals.At the same time, Jassy been trying to overhaul Amazon's corporate culture and operate like the \"world's largest startup\" as it looks to stay competitive. Last September, as part of a mandate requiring corporate employees to work in the office five days a week, he set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon by the first quarter of this year.Earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to hire 250,000 workers for full-time, part-time and temporary roles in its fulfillment and transportation units to meet demand for the holiday shopping season.Amazon is slated to report its third-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco on June 2, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Tuesday announced it has completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business.The artificial intelligence startup said its nonprofit is now called the OpenAI Foundation, and it holds an equity stake worth about $130 billion in its for-profit arm. OpenAI said its for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.Under the new structure, the OpenAI Foundation will hold a 26% stake in the for-profit, with 47% held by current and former employees and investors.Microsoft, which has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI and backed the company as early as 2019, said it supports OpenAI's recapitalization and now holds an investment in the PBC that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.The company said it previously held a 32.5% stake in the for-profit on an as-converted basis, excluding OpenAI's recent funding rounds.Microsoft shares closed up 1.98% on Tuesday.\"The more OpenAI succeeds as a company, the more the non-profit's equity stake will be worth, which the non-profit will use to fund its philanthropic work,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion.In 2024, the company announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. But after facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said in May that its nonprofit would retain control.The OpenAI Foundation will make an initial $25 billion commitment to work to accelerate health breakthroughs and technical solutions to AI resilience, OpenAI said Tuesday.As part of the announcement, Microsoft said OpenAI has agreed to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, though Microsoft will no longer have a first right of refusal to be OpenAI's compute provider.The companies also outlined several additional changes to their partnership.When OpenAI says it has reached Artificial General Intelligence, or AGI, which is a term for an AI system that rivals or exceeds human intelligence, that claim will have to be verified by an independent expert panel, Microsoft said. The revenue share agreement between the two companies will remain until that panel verifies AGI.Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently or in collaboration with third parties, and OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties.OpenAI remains Microsoft's frontier model partner. Microsoft said its IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032, and include models post-AGI. OpenAI's consumer hardware is excluded from Microsoft's IP rights.\"As we step into this next chapter of our partnership, both companies are better positioned than ever to continue building great products that meet real-world needs, and create new opportunity for everyone and every business,\" Microsoft said in a statement.Microsoft is slated to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 results after market close on Wednesday.WATCH: OpenAI begins to threaten software stockswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowBridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio on Tuesday warned that a bubble could be forming around megacap technology in the U.S. amid the artificial intelligence boom, but said that it may not end until the Federal Reserve reverses its current easy policies.\"There's a lot of bubble stuff going on,\" Dalio told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from the Future Investment Institute in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \"But bubbles don't pop, really, until they are popped by tightness of monetary policy and so on.\"Added Dalio, \"We're going to be more likely to ease rates than to tighten rates.\"The hedge fund titan said he uses a personal \"bubble indicator\" that's relatively high right now. Dalio joins a growing chorus of well-known market participants that have cautioned about the potential for a bubble tied to AI spending in recent months.The Fed is set to cut rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and many investors expect the central bank it will do so again at its final meeting of the year in December.The billionaire investor also pointed out that outside of AI-linked names, the market as a whole has done \"relatively poorly\" and there's a \"concentrated environment.\" He noted that 80% of gains are concentrated within Big Tech. The three major indexes on Monday rallied to all-time closing highs, led higher by technology stocks with more good AI news expected from a series of Big Tech earnings this week.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, all-time chartDalio said there's a \"two-part economy,\" with the easing of interest rates because of weakening in some places while a bubble develops elsewhere.He said monetary policy cannot aid both ends of this spectrum given the divergence, making it more likely that the bubble will continue. Dalio said the outcome could be similar to what was seen in 1998 to 1999 or in 1927 and 1928.\"Whether or not it's a bubble and when that bubble is going to burst, maybe we don't know exactly,\" Dalio said. \"But what we can say is there's a lot of risk.\"",

The Trump administration said it had issued around 4,000 RIFs on Oct. 10.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteWhite House Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the right-wing government policy guidebook known as Project 2025, said the following week that the total RIF number would likely \"end up being north of 10,000.\"Vought's remark came on the same day that Illston granted her TRO, which slammed the mid-shutdown layoff plans as \"unprecedented in our country's history.\"The White House, asked for comment on Tuesday's preliminary injunction order, referred CNBC to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, which did not immediately respond.Illston's ruling is \"a major blow to the Trump-Vance administration's unlawful attempt to make the Project 2025 playbook a reality by targeting our nation's career public servants, who work for all Americans,\" said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of the legal group Democracy Forward, which represents AFSCME in the lawsuit.\"Our team is honored to represent the civil servants who are fighting back against President Trump's dangerous agenda, and to have won this crucial injunction that will help stop federal workers from continuing to be targeted and harassed by this administration during the shutdown,\" Perryman said in a statement.",

    "body": "A visitor looks at a model of SK hynix's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology during the 2025 World IT Show in Seoul on April 24, 2025. Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's SK Hynix on Wednesday posted record quarterly revenue and profit, boosted by a strong demand for its high bandwidth memory used in generative AI chipsets.The company is looking to expand production capacity in 2026, with its planned supply of memory products for 2026 already sold out.Here are SK Hynix's third-quarter results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 24.45 trillion won ($17.13 billion) vs. 24.73 trillion wonOperating profit: 11.38 trillion won vs. 11.39 trillion wonRevenue rose about 39% in the September quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, while operating profit surged 62%, year on year.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, revenue was up 10%, while operating profit grew 24%. In its earnings release, the company noted that the quarterly operating profit had surpassed 10 trillion won for the first time.Following the report, SK Hynix shares in South Korea popped nearly 5%, boosting its stock rally past 210% this year.SK Hynix makes memory chips that are used to store data and can be found in everything from servers to consumer devices such as smartphones and laptops.The company has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence as a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory or HBM chips used to power AI data center servers. \"As demand across the memory segment has soared due to customers' expanding investments in AI infrastructure, SK Hynix once again surpassed the record-high performance of the previous quarter due to increased sales of high value-added products,\" SK Hynix said in a statement. HBM falls into the broader category of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM — a type of semiconductor memory used to store data and program code that can be found in PCs, workstations and servers.The company said it will begin supplying its next-generation HBM4 chips in the current quarter, following negotiations with unspecified customers. The chips represent the sixth generation of HBM technology.In an earnings call, an SK Hynix executive said that the company's HBM product has been selling out since 2023, with its HBM supply expected to remain tight compared to demand into 2027 as it works to increase production.HBM leaderSK Hynix has set itself apart in the DRAM market by getting an early lead in HBM and establishing itself as the main supplier to the world's leading AI chip designer, Nvidia. However, its main competitors, U.S.-based Micron and South Korean-based tech giant Samsung, have been working to catch up in the space.Micron has already supplied Nvidia with some of its HBM technology, while Samsung recently passed Nvidia's qualification tests for an advanced HBM product, according to a local report last month.\"With the innovation of AI technology, the memory market has shifted to a new paradigm and demand has begun to spread to all product areas,\" SK Hynix Chief Financial Officer Kim Woohyun said in the earnings release.\"We will continue to strengthen our AI memory leadership by responding to customer demand through market-leading products and differentiated technological capabilities,\" he added.watch nowThe HBM market is expected to continue to boom over the next few years to around $43 billion by 2027, giving strong earnings leverage to memory manufacturers such as SK Hynix, MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\"[F]or SK Hynix to continue generating profits, it'll be important for the company to maintain and enhance its competitive edge,\" he added.A report from Counterpoint Research earlier this month showed that SK Hynix held a leading 38% share of the DRAM market by revenue in the second quarter, increasing its shares after having overtaken Samsung in the first quarter. The report added that the global HBM  market grew 178% year over year in the second quarter, and SK Hynix dominated the space with a 64% share. Samsung will report its earnings on Thursday.Ray Wang, lead semiconductor analyst at Futurum Group, told CNBC that he expects SK Hynix to maintain its dominant leadership in the HBM market through next year, thanks to its technological edge.\"The company is likely to sustain around 60% global HBM market share, underpinned by its position as the primary supplier to key customers such as Nvidia, Google and other leading customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "A general view of JLR signage at the Jaguar Land Rover vehicle manufacturing plant in Castle Bromwich on September 30, 2025 in Birmingham, United Kingdom.Christopher Furlong | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA major cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover, considered the most expensive security breach in British history, has prompted experts to question whether the U.K. is equipped to handle a rapidly growing cyber threat.The Cyber Monitoring Centre, a cybersecurity body, recently estimated the hack of Britain's biggest automaker to have cost the U.K. a whopping £1.9 billion ($2.5 billion), a figure that represents the substantial disruption caused to JLR's manufacturing.The company is currently in the midst of a phased restart to operations after the incident forced it to halt production at factories around the world.\"The threat profile is changing,\" Edward Lewis, director at the Cyber Monitoring Centre, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday.\"What JLR now shows is that things have pivoted quite dramatically, much more towards economic security at an organizational level and national economic security,\" he continued. \"Let's make no mistake here ... this isn't just another cyber headline. This was a macro economic event, and a very serious one for the U.K.\"The Department for Business and Trade did not directly respond to a CNBC question on how prepared the government is for this threat.JLR first reported it had been victim of a \"cyber incident\" on Sept. 2. As the U.K.'s largest automotive employer, with nearly 33,000 people employees nationwide — and a further 104,000 working across its vast supply chain. Early figures from the company suggest the attack dealt a heavy blow, with wholesale deliveries down nearly 25% on the year in its fiscal second quarter.On Tuesday, figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association, or ACEA, showed Jaguar sales to the EU by September year-to-date were down nearly 80% on an annual basis.watch nowThat impact is being felt on links all along the value chain. In a survey of businesses across the West Midlands region, the Black Country Chamber of Commerce found that nearly eight in 10 firms were negatively impacted by the cyberattack, with 14% already making redundancies by late September.The cyberattack also comes amid years of decline for Britain's car industry, with September's production figure coming in at the lowest level since 1952, according to the lobby group Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.JLR is such a pivotal player that its plant shutdown was singled out in S&P's manufacturing PMI release for September, which fell to a six-month low of 46.2, below the 50-mark that separates growth from contraction.The hack itself is understood to be the work of a criminal gang calling itself Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters: apparently a collaboration between three collectives, including one named Scattered Spider — which the National Crime Agency indicated it was investigating in connection with the cyberattack on British retailers Co-op and Marks and Spencer earlier this year.A rising threatThe U.K.'s National Cyber Security Centre says cybercrime is on the rise, warning the country faces four \"nationally significant\" cyberattacks every week. That's a record, and reflects a surge of more than 100% on previous levels.In mid-October, the NCSC co-signed a letter with the National Crime Agency and government ministers —including Finance Minister Rachel Reeves — to the leaders of every company in the FTSE 350, calling on businesses to take steps toward protecting themselves from cyberattacks. The group's message was clear: \"Don't wait for the breach, act now.\"Government attention has also turned to JLR's parent company, Tata Group, whose subsidiary Tata Motors bought the Jaguar and Land Rover brands from Ford in 2008.JLR is one of the more than 200 U.K.-based companies which outsources some or all of their IT management to another Tata subsidiary: Tata Consulting Services, with which JLR expanded its partnership in late 2023 to help it \"create a simplified and leading-edge IT infrastructure,\" in a deal worth more than £800 million.An aerial view of the Jaguar Land Rover electric propulsion manufacturing centre on September 30, 2025 in Wolverhampton, United Kingdom.Christopher Furlong | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOther companies in that roster include fellow cyberattack victims Marks and Spencer — which outsourced more than half of its IT team in 2018 — and the Co-op, which did the same for some of its IT roles two years later.The Telegraph reported on Sunday that Marks and Spencer ended its business relationship with TCS in July in the aftermath of the attack, which TCS denies. \"Some current reports are misleading,\" a spokesperson for the firm told CNBC, \"with inaccuracies including the size of the contract and the continuity of TCS' work for Marks & Spencer.\"Spokespeople for both TCS and Marks & Spencer confirmed to CNBC that the bidding process for the service desk contract began in January, months before the hack.Liam Byrne, chair of the U.K.'s Business and Trade Committee, wrote to TCS CEO Krithi Krithivasan in late September asking for information amid British media reporting that the attack on Marks and Spencer was apparently linked to one of TCS' employees. TCS said there were \"no indicators of compromise\" within its network — and that the cyberattacks at all three firms took place within those clients' own systems.A TCS spokesperson expanded on this letter to CNBC, saying \"while in none of these cases did the attack originate from TCS or our networks, our priority has been to help our clients during this period ... TCS has reviewed our own networks systems and been able to conclude that the vulnerabilities have not originated from there.\"'Moral hazard'JLR says it makes up 4% of all U.K. goods exports. That's a significant chunk. Therefore, it's unsurprising that the government scrambled into action to try and support the company and the firms that rely on it to function — with ITV reporting that the U.K. mulled becoming a \"buyer of last resort\" for those companies, planning to sell components on to JLR once it resumed production.The Department for Business and Trade wasn't able to confirm the ITV report, but a government spokesperson told CNBC: \"We acted swiftly to provide cyber security expertise and made a loan guarantee available at a critical moment to help stabilise the the situation. We continue to work closely with JLR, the industry and major banks to keep a close eye on the supply chain.\"JLR reportedly didn't have cyber insurance at the time of the incident, leading some to question the precedent set by — and sustainability of — the government having to step in to prevent catastrophe. CNBC asked the automaker if this was the case, to which a a spokesperson for the firm said it does not comment on commercial matters.As it happened, the government has said it will partially guarantee £1.5 billion in loans from a consortium of commercial lenders — meaning the taxpayer will only foot the bill if JLR defaults.But, the Confederation of British Metalforming, which represents many businesses within JLR's supply chain, called for further long-term support options -- saying \"the price of saving good companies is a lot cheaper than losing them.\"The Cyber Monitoring Centre's Lewis told CNBC that while it's \"still a moral hazard if public intervention removes the incentive to invest in resilience,\" it's unlikely any policy \"would even have touched the sides of the financial exposure\" JLR has experienced.Lewis said the conversation should focus more on turning resilience into value. \"Emphasis can't be on admonishment ... it should be about encouraging a collective national understanding of the scale of this threat, what resilience really means day to day.\"",

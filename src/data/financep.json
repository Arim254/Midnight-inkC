    "body": "We often underestimate how much our morning rituals can set the tone for the rest of the day. When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.\"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement,\" says Mia Soviero, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.\"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen,\" says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit Research Girl, Inc to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.\"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system,\" she says. \"You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to.\"Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routineStep 1: Exposure to sunlightSoviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: Getting adequate sleep sets the tone for the next day, she explains.Then, \"I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning,\" she says. \"Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, especially if you have seasonal depression.\"Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to Harvard Health Publishing.Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day \"can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic,\" the health blog states.Step 2: SudokuSoviero makes time in her mornings to do \"small, meaningful activities\" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.\"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it],\" she says. \"Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great.\"Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine when \"something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens.\"\"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward,\" she says. \"So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine.\"Step 3: Text a friendEach morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. \"I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'\" she says.\"Humans are biologically wired for connections,\" Soviero adds. \"When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing.\" Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Connecting with others is \"really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body,\" Soviero says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "It's the season of giving, the time of year when do-gooders get generous and tax pros occasionally get creative. That's because donations to charities and other types of nonprofit organizations are tax-deductible. Historically, though, most taxpayers don't receive a tax break for their charitable giving. Other than for a brief period under Covid-19 relief legislation, taxpayers have generally had to itemize to take advantage of the deduction, but about 9 in 10 people take the standard deduction instead, according to the Internal Revenue Service. But the rules around charitable deductions are changing. A provision in President Donald Trump's so-called \"big beautiful\" bill, which passed in July, allows taxpayers who don't itemize to deduct up to $1,000 for single filers and up to $2,000 for married couples filing jointly for tax year 2026.So, for people thinking about writing a check to their favorite charity, it may make more sense, tax-wise, to wait until January to send it in, says Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder of accounting firm MiklosCPA. \"First and foremost, if they love to give, please give,\" he says. \"But if they are making a strategic move, and they're not going to itemize for sure for 2026 tax year purposes, doing the charitable donation in 2026 does give them a benefit.\"When it makes sense to wait to donateTo be clear, if you plan to give to your favorite charity this holiday season, no one is telling you not to do it. Indeed, many tax pros would advise against upending your financial plans in the name of optimizing your tax return. \"There's certainly a tax calculation, but there's also just the the charitable intent. You potentially need to get money to an organization and you want to do that now,\" says Stephen Eckert, practice leader at Plante Moran's National Tax Office. \"That can override some of this, potentially.\"But if a donation in January would do just as much good as one in December, you may be able to have an equal charitable impact while saving a few bucks, he says.To get the new deduction, you'll have to make a cash donation to a qualifying charitable organization — donations to political campaigns, crowdfunding efforts, private foundations and donor-advised funds are excluded. Make sure to get a receipt for your gift; the IRS generally requires written acknowledgement of any donation in excess of $250.And before making any moves for tax year 2026, you'd be wise to consider whether major life changes on the horizon will drastically change your tax situation, says Ringbauer. The IRS's rules around charitable giving are different and more complicated for those who itemize deductions.\"That's where your trusted financial advisor, your accountant, comes in,\" Ringbauer says. \"Sit down with them before year-end, go through what your scenarios are, and you can come up with a really good solution as to whether [a charitable tax strategy] benefits you or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "A guest poses for a photograph during the Jellycat Road Trip to Joy at Nordstrom Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.Jeff Schear / Stringer/ Getty ImagesChristmas is just around the corner and if you're a stuck on what to gift your Gen Z family members, a cuddly plush toy might be the answer this year.  2025 has proved that toys are not just for kids, as more young adults show off extensive collections of plushies. Experts say it signals a longing for community and a return to childhood. The popularity has been driven by a manic craze for Labubu dolls — collectible toys produced by Chinese toy company Pop Mart — as well as for soft toys, also known as \"Jellies,\" designed by British brand Jellycat. Brightly coloured stuffed animals and wide-eyed dolls can be seen lined up on walls or falling out of overstuffed shelves, in videos posted by Gen Z on TikTok.The platform — which has become a barometer for Gen Z trends — is currently home to millions of videos showing young adults obsessed with plushies. Videos range from building a \"Labubu wall,\" to hacks on finding authentic Labubus, or a five-rack shelf dedicated to displaying Jellies.\"It's the biggest year we've ever seen of adults buying toys,\" Melissa Symonds, U.K. toys director at global consumer insights firm Circana, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\"Adults of all ages do buy into toys, but it's primarily the younger, the Gen Z people, that are really driving this strong growth that we've had in the last few years,\" Symonds said. Labubu dolls are on display at a Pop Mart store in Shanghai, China.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesIn fact, a recent Circana report found that 43% of U.K. adults bought a toy for themselves or another adult this year, and that rises to 76% for Gen Z shoppers between the ages of 18 to 34-years-old.Across toy genres, plushies are the fourth most popular category for adults, with games and puzzles ranking top, following by building sets like LEGO, and action figures coming in at third place, according to data from Circanca shared with CNBC.It's a similar story across the pond, with sales of licenced toys increasing by 18% for U.S. adults over the age of 18 in the first half of the year, per Circana. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when  you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life.\"Melissa Symonds Executive director of toys at CircanaSymonds explained that businesses are tapping into what's called the \"joy economy\" in which consumers seek out comfort and nostalgia in products and experiences, especially when faced with economic or political pressures. \"The economy, the wars, everything is really depressing and serious, whereas toys just bring a little bit of joy back into life,\" Symonds said.  Pop Mart and Jellycat have benefitted from that trend. Pop Mart posted a near 400% surge in net profit in the first half of the year, and its revenue jumped 204.4% year on year to 13.88 billion yuan ($1.93 billion). In 2024, roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, Pop Mart previously told CNBC Make It. Meanwhile, Jellycat saw its revenue rise 66% to £333 million in 2024, up from £200 million in 2023. Its profit before tax more than doubled to £139 million, up from £67 million the prior year. \"Seeing the response across multiple generations to our new characters has been wonderful,\" Jellycat's CEO Arnaud Meysselle said in a statement to CNBC. \"It's been amazing to meet so many adults discovering Jellycat for the first time at our recent experience launches in Beijing, Seoul, and Los Angeles — and to welcome many others into our online communities,\" Meysselle said. 'Peter Pan effect' Guests attend the Jellycat X Selfridges Amuseables Bag launch in London, England.Dave Benett | Dave Benett Collection | Getty ImagesFans of Jellycat, Labubu, and plushies in general span from corporate workers to military personnel who tout the benefits the toys have on their mental health on TikTok, as they grapple with increasingly stressful adult lives. Circana's Symonds said that this is a symptom of the \"Peter Pan effect\" which refers to a psychological syndrome where adults struggle to grow up and take on responsibilities. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life,\" she said. \"There's a bit of that Peter Pan effect where they [Gen Z consumers] don't want to grow up, but I think it's just holding on to that joy element that brings them happiness.\" Gen Z adults have had it fairly rough as a generation as many say they were priced out of the adulthood they were promised. Economic and geopolitical turmoil has disrupted their lives, footage of war replays on their social media feeds everyday, and the cost of living continues to skyrocket. Some of the conflicts they've seen through their adult lives include the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to the Israel-Hamas war. And to top it all off, rising inflation means their buying power decreases every day with economic milestones like buying a house or starting a family feeling out of reach. Many Gen Z are instead \"doom spending\" to fill the gap. This refers to a phenomenon where people splash out on small luxuries like travel, designer goods, or even expensive toys because they know they might never be able to afford bigger milestones like owning a home or even children. Delaying parenthood also means Gen Z have more disposable income to spend on small luxuries. \"I think some of it might be because they're [Gen Z] choosing to have kids slightly older, so they've got a slightly longer period of time where they have money coming in, but don't necessarily have to spend it on schools or lunch boxes, so they're choosing to spend it on themselves to bring themselves some happiness,\" Symonds said.'Part of the community' Alongside economic woes, Gen Z have also struggled with loneliness and for some, buying and collecting toys can help them feel like they're part of a community. Some 85% of British Gen Z reported experiencing feelings of loneliness, according to a Hinge survey that polled 2,000 Gen Z adults in the U.K. in March. More than half of low-income young adults experienced severe loneliness, according to the research. Jellycat's Meysselle explained that the brand has looked to create a community for its fans from launching Instagram and TikTok accounts in 2022, both of which have racked up over two million followers since. Jellycat Fish & Chips Experience at Selfridges, London.Tim CharlesIts also invested in themed pop-up experiences that fans can visit in person from Jellycat Fish & Chips in Selfridges in London, to Jellycat Patisserie in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, and Jellycat Diner in FAO Schwarz in New York. Around 80% of fans that turned up to Jellycat's Space Experience in Seoul that was launched in November, were in their 20s and 30s — the largest percentage of adults at a Jellycat experience so far. Selfridges' toy buyer Joe Evans told CNBC Make It that Jellycat is its fastest selling toy brand and in the past two years there's been \"a meteoric rise\" in Gen Z and millennial customers who want to \"feel like they're part of a community and collect,\" toys. \"When you purchase a Jellycat, you feel like you're part of a community, you feel like you're part of something, there are a lot of groups online that talk, and people race each other for the best and the newest product,\" he added.

He has refused to rule out the use of force.Meanwhile, Greenland has shown little interest in becoming a top mining nation, and its leaders have criticized the U.S. administration's calls for the country to become a U.S. territory.Late Sunday, Trump posted on social media that he had appointed Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry, as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland.\"Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,\" the president wrote.Read moreThe Danish foreign ministry declined to comment further and referred to Løkke Rasmussen's TV2 interview.In an Instagram post translated by CNBC, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and the U.S. should not take over Greenland.\"\"No one should be allowed to change national borders by force.

    "body": "French cheeses displayed in a store in Paris. Bertrand Guay | Afp | Getty ImagesChina on Monday announced tariffs of up to 42.7% on dairy products from the European Union, following the results of an anti-subsidy investigation that began in August 2024. In a statement by the country's Ministry of Commerce, China said that EU subsidies for dairy products had caused \"substantial damage\" to China's domestic dairy industries. The tariffs are set to take effect on Dec. 23, the ministry said, and the rates would be determined by the amount of \"ad valorem subsidy rates\" from the country's Customs Tariff Commission.The tariffs range from 21.9% to 42.7%, with companies \"who cooperated with the investigation\" subject to tariffs of 28.6%, and those that \"did not cooperate\" facing the top rate of 42.7%, according to a statement from a Commerce Ministry official.Products that will be affected include fresh, processed and blue cheeses — such as the famous Roquefort blue cheese aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France — as well as some kinds of milk and cream. The latest tariffs mark an escalation in trade tensions between the regions, which flared up when Brussels slapped tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China in October last year.Separately, the bloc in November challenged China's imposition of tariffs on imports of EU brandy at the World Trade Organisation, saying \"China's provisional measures on EU brandy are not in line with WTO rules.\"An EU spokesperson described the measures as \"unjustified and unwarranted\" on Monday, according to Reuters, and said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, would be providing comments to the Chinese authorities.The Commission was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday. Last week, Beijing sharply cut its duties on pork imports and pig by-products from the European Union, with new tariff rates ranging from 4.9% to 19.8% on dozens of European pork exports.It comes after the country in September imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 62.4% in the form of cash deposits on pork imports from the EU.— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that China's tariffs will come into force on Dec. 23.

For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": "Ulta is expanding its wellness shop to have more health-focused brands and more shelf space for those items.Melissa Repko | CNBCSanta may be bringing you some supplements this year.Along with typical holiday wish list items like clothing, perfume and gadgets, the wellness category is poised to gain popularity this shopping season and beyond — particularly as retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target give it more shelf space long before the start of New Year's resolutions.Beauty is always a top-performing holiday category. November and December combined account for about 25% of annual spending on prestige beauty items, which includes brands usually sold by specialty beauty retailers and department stores, according to Circana, a market research group. Holiday shoppers said they plan to spend an average of $247 on beauty while buying gifts this year, the fourth-highest holiday category for spending, according to Circana's annual survey.Yet the beauty category's assortment has become wider ranging with the addition of more health and wellness-focused items, such as products that promise to improve nutrition, hydration and sleep.Larissa Jensen, global beauty industry advisor at Circana, said wellness has gained attention since the Covid pandemic as consumers prioritize self-care and feeling good from the \"inside out.\" She said health-related products typically relegated to drugstore shelves, such as teeth whitening kits, vitamins, full-body deodorants and eye drops, have gotten a glow-up. Some now come in more attractive packaging, have gotten backing from influencers and celebrities or have moved to the beauty section as retailers seize a chance to blend beauty and wellness and become a one-stop shop.Ulta Beauty, in particular, has carved out more space in its stores for wellness. The specialty retailer, which has more than 1,450 stores across the country, has always carried some individual items related to wellness and \"beauty from within,\" said Laura Beres, the retailer's vice president of wellness.Yet as demand grew after the pandemic, Ulta started to open wellness shops inside of its stores in 2021 and devoted about four to eight feet of shelf space to items including probiotic gummies, sleep masks and aromatherapy oils. In August, the company said it would expand the size of those wellness shops to up to 45 feet in about a third of its stores. It's added nearly 30 new wellness brands to its stores, bringing its total to about 100, Beres said.She said customers who shop wellness cut across ages, but Ulta has seen growth especially with millennial shoppers and consumers with household incomes of more than $100,000. She said innovation has sparked more interest, especially as customers seek solutions for key life stages that brands overlooked in the past, such as needs for pre- and post-pregnancy and menopause.This year, she said Ulta is carrying some gift sets of wellness items, including an Advent calendar of Saje Natural Wellness' essential oils and a beauty sleep gift set from Kourtney Kardashian's vitamins brand, Lemme. Yet she said she expects wellness to become a bigger part of the holidays in the future as the category grows.\"It's the perfect combination of being able to give someone else the gift of relaxation during the holiday season in a really elevated way that just frankly, hasn't existed in the market before,\" she said.Neom Wellbeing is one of the brands carried in Ulta Beauty's wellness shops. The United Kingdom-based brand makes home fragrances and body care items with essential oils intended to reduce stress, improve sleep or boost mood or energy levels.Courtesy of Neom WellbeingOne of the brands in Ulta's wellness shop is Neom Wellbeing, a United Kingdom-based company that sells home fragrances and body-care items. Neom sells online through Amazon and its website, with many top-sellers focused on improving sleep.Amanda Kahn, general manager for the U.S. at Neom, said the company's early sellers this holiday season were stocking stuffers that cost less than $20. As shoppers seek value because of inflation, wellness items are attractive because they're also practical, she said.\"It feels very giftable while also delivering a benefit that everyone can use,\" she said.Shoppers at a Bath & Body Works store at an outlet mall on Black Friday in Sunrise, Florida, US, on Friday, Nov. 28, 2025. Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works, best known for its fragranced soaps, candles and lotions, has launched more wellness-focused items, too. Early this month, for instance, it began selling a new wellness fragrance collection called \"Water Winter Mint\" with peppermint and alpine waters scents and ingredients including hyaluronic acid and shea butter.Kristie Lewis, senior vice president of merchandising for the company, said more customers have turned to the mall staple for body-care products or gifts that boost mood and solve health-related challenges, such as dry skin or trouble falling asleep.Bath & Body Works plans to keep expanding its aromatherapy line and its ingredient-led products, she said. It has aromatherapy body products with natural essential oils and launched a holiday collection with the scents eucalyptus pine and vanilla nutmeg.\"We're seeing consumers really buy them for themselves, but also for gifts for holiday because who does not want stress relief or sleep, especially around November and December?\" she said. Nutrition and health has been a trending category at Target, too, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a store tour in the Minneapolis area in October. He said wellness has cut across many of the categories Target sells, such as Joylab, a private brand that's offering bright colors and floral prints of workout gear, Khloe Kardashian's Khloud protein popcorn, and beauty kits and skin masks.He said some of those items are giftable, too. Gomez said he bought his nephew protein powder as a gift.Wellness could gain more square footage at Target next year, he added. It's one of the ideas Target is considering as its deal with Ulta Beauty ends in August and the branded beauty shops inside of hundreds of its stores close, Gomez said. While supplements tend to be more popular around New Year's resolution season, Gruns is hoping its sales get a holiday bump. It's selling some packs of gummies with a holiday flair, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor.Courtesy of GrunsGrüns is one of the wellness items on Target's shelves. The superfood greens gummies are a healthier spin on a fruit snack for adults, but with a nutritional punch similar to a greens powder, said founder and CEO Chad Janis. Its name is inspired by \"grün,\" the word for green in German.Retailers including Walmart, Sprouts Farmers Market and Sam's Club sell the gummies, which have expanded to other lines for kids and for immune support since the company was founded in 2023.While vitamin and supplement sales tend to spike around the new year, Janis said the company hopes its gummies will be a gift or a stocking stuffer. It's selling some holiday-inspired items, including a Grinch-inspired sour punch flavor and a Target pack that's holiday themed.Walmart is carrying some wellness items for the holidays, too, as it sees millennial and Gen Z shoppers seek out self-care and wellness items year-round, such as gift sets of body washes from vitamin maker Olly and vitamin patches from Barrière that look like stickers or temporary tattoos. Even outside of the beauty aisles, retailers have leaned into wellness as a gift-giving category, such as Best Buy, which sells Oura rings and has demos for the health-tracking wearables, and Kohl's, which carries items including massage guns and portable ice baths.During this holiday season, wellness may also get more attention from shoppers who buy items for themselves while shopping for gifts for friends and family, Circana's Jensen said.\"Here's a little ornament with a lip gloss for you and teeth whitening products for me,\" she said. Yet, in the coming years, Jensen said she expects wellness to gain prominence on holiday wish lists because of their high price tags and their wider acceptance. She compared it to anti-aging skin-care products and gift sets. She said they once seemed taboo and now, they're an item that people request.",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldAlphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday between 6 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.The power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.\"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections,\" Waymo's Philion also told CNBC. \"This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting from San Francisco.",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, Nov. 24, 2025. Tom Little | ReutersThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity from Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk, a landmark decision that health experts say could open up treatment access to more patients. Novo Nordisk said it expects to launch the pill in early 2026. The Danish drugmaker said starting in early January, the starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month. That's the same price that cash-paying patients can access the starting dose of the pill on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Trump's site also launches in January. Novo Nordisk did not say how much higher doses of the drug would cost, but said additional information on coverage and savings options for eligible patients will be available at that time as well.Shares of Novo Nordisk gained roughly 10% in extended trading Monday. The FDA's approval also clears the pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease, according to Novo Nordisk. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide.\"What we've learned through years of research is that having an oral option really kind of opens up, activates and motivates different segments to seek treatment,\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, told CNBC ahead of the approval. \"To have that conversation with their doctor to see if this is something that might be right for them.\"\"That's what we're excited about — to be able to give people an option and make sure we have access and ease of access like we have been doing with our injections,\" he continued.It's unclear exactly how many people are using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity in particular. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.The move gives Novo Nordisk a head start over its chief rival Eli Lilly, which is currently the dominant player in the market and is racing to launch its own obesity pill. Pills are the next battleground for the two drugmakers, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s.Wall Street thinks there's plenty of room for pills in the market, with Goldman Sachs analyst saying in August that pills could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.In a note Monday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the approval of Novo Nordisk's pill gives the company a \"much-needed win in light of recent challenges maintaining incretin market share dominance.\" Incretins refer to treatments that mimic gut hormones such as GLP-1. Eli Lilly earlier this year gained the majority share of the market thanks to its blockbuster obesity injection Zepbound, which has shown to be more effective than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy. \"Novo will likely benefit from first-mover advantage, capturing patients with a preference for convenience and comfort provided by an oral dosing regimen,\" Seigerman said. But he also noted that the market is \"rapidly evolving with competitive assets in development\" and an approval for Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, \"just around the corner.\"The approval is based on a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity but not diabetes.In that study, a 25-milligram dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks, according to results from the trial presented at a medical conference in 2024. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than an experimental oral drug from Eli Lilly, which is still waiting for FDA approval.But unlike Novo Nordisk's pill, Eli Lilly's treatment is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.Moore said the prices of the pill get costs closer to what some people are paying for unapproved, compounded versions of branded GLP-1s, some of which are still being illegally mass-marketed and sold in the U.S.Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments. During FDA-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. But the agency earlier this year determined that the shortage of semaglutide is over, barring the practice in many cases.\"It continues to be alarming and disturbing for us,\" Moore told CNBC, referring to illegitimate ingredients that are imported into the U.S. illegally and used by some compounding pharmacies to create copycat versions of branded GLP-1s.This is breaking news.

The trade pact, which will be reviewed after one year, will be signed in the first half of next year.\"This historic agreement eliminates and reduces tariffs on 95% of New Zealand's exports,\" New Zealand Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay said in a statement, adding that nearly 57% of exports from the country will become duty-free in India \"from day one.\"The pacific island nation will also invest $20 billion in India over next 15 years and allow mobility of professionals, skilled labor and students from India to New Zealand, according to a statement from India. India has also secured a \"zero duty market\" on all its exports to New Zealand that includes textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, marine products, gems and jewelry, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles. \"Today this Free Trade Agreement is about building trade around people and launching opportunities,\" India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said. The deal will give Indian businesses and youth an opportunity to \"learn, work and grow on a global stage,\" he added.India will eliminate tariff on sheep meat, wool, coal and nearly all of forestry and wood exports. New Delhi will also allow duty-free access for dairy and other food ingredients for re-exports.However, to ensure protection to farmers and the domestic industry, New Delhi has said the market access excludes dairy, coffee, milk, cream, cheese, yoghurts, whey, caseins, onions, sugar, spices, edible oils, rubber.India's trade pact with New Zealand \"provides policy certainty and lowers input costs for manufacturing, creating a vision for long-term economic resilience,\" said Ranjeet Mehta, chief executive officer and secretary general, of Indian industry body PHDCCI.Bilateral merchandise trade between the two countries stood at  $1.3 billion in 2024–25 while total trade in goods and services was $2.4 billion in 2024. \"The FTA provides a stable and predictable framework to unlock the full potential of this relationship,\" India's commerce ministry said.The FTA marks India's third deal this year following a free trade agreement with the UK in July and another pact with Oman earlier this month. The deals comes at a time when the U.S., New Delhi's largest trading partner, has levied 50% tariffs on its goods exports, that includes 25% duties for India's purchases of Russian oil.  India, which has ambitions to become an export powerhouse, has been looking to diversify its exports to make up for the impact of U.S. tariffs. After steep tariffs came into force in August, India's exports to the U.S. fell nearly 12% in September and 8.5% in October, before a sharp growth of 22.6% in November.",

Schumer's announcement came three days after the DOJ missed last week's deadline to release all of the documents required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which President Donald Trump signed into law in November. All documents were required by the law to be released on Friday with minimal redactions. Only a fraction of the total files relating to Epstein have been released so far. \"Instead of transparency, the Trump administration released a tiny fraction of the files and blacked out massive portions of what little they provided,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Republicans should again show that same support for upholding the bipartisan law we passed and demand the Trump administration release all the Epstein files.\"Schumer's resolution would force Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., to \"initiate or intervene in one or more civil actions in the name of the Senate in a Federal Court of competent jurisdiction\" to compel the release of the Epstein files. Schumer intends to force consideration of the resolution when the Senate reconvenes in the New Year. Senate Republicans previously joined with Democrats to unanimously pass the law requiring the release of the Epstein files. Over the weekend, several photos, including one that contained images of Trump's face, were removed from the Justice Department's repository for the Epstein files. The photos were later restored.

The DOJ has defended its rollout of the Epstein files, arguing it is working to review and redact material required by the law to protect the privacy of Epstein's victims. \"This is an arduous process, as each document and photograph must be individually reviewed by the DOJ and the Southern District of New York for potential redactions to protect victims or potential victims,\" the DOJ said in a fact sheet. CNBC has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on Schumer's resolution. Other members of Congress who pushed for the release of the Epstein files, including Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche over the rollout of the Epstein Files. CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos or mentioned in the latest release of the Epstein files. All have denied wrongdoing previously.

Vance to the island in March.The Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on Monday said he was \"deeply upset\" by Landry's appointment and that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark over it.

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The photo, which contained two separate images showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday. The photo showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenzaOne of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true?

The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all Justice Department files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.CNBC has reached out to the DOJ over Massie's remarks. ",

    "body": "Dominion Energy's wind turbines located 27 miles off of Virginia Beach in the Atlantic Ocean, July 17, 2023.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration on Monday halted Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, the largest project of its kind in the U.S., as well as four other projects under construction off the East Coast in a devastating blow to the wind industry. Shares of Dominion Energy, the utility developing the Virginia project, dropped nearly 4% on the news. The administration also paused leases for Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England, and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island. The projects taken together would provide enough power for more than 2 million homes, according to statements from the developers. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said the administration paused leases for the projects due to national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. watch nowShares of Denmark's Orsted, the developer of the Revolution and Sunrise projects, tumbled 11%. Norway's Equinor, the developer of Empire Wind 1, fell about 1%. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176 turbine project project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. The project was expected to be complete next year. Dominion said the massive project is essential for U.S. national security and Virginia's dramatically growing energy needs. Northern Virginia is the largest hub for data centers in the world. Growing demand from artificial intelligence is contributing to higher electricity prices in the state. \"Stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI, and civilian assets,\" Dominion said in a statement. \"It will also lead to energy inflation and threaten thousands of jobs,\" the utility said.  Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, supports the project. Incoming Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, won the gubernatorial election in November on a promise to address rising electricity costs in part by expanding renewable energy. The Interior Department said in a statement that the pause will give the federal government time to \"work with leaseholders and state partners to assess the possibility of mitigating the national security risks posed by these projects.\" watch nowInterior said the U.S. government found that turbine blades and \"highly reflective towers\" create radar interference risk. \"The clutter caused by offshore wind projects obscures legitimate moving targets and generates false targets in the vicinity of the wind projects,\" Interior said. President Donald Trump has targeted the U.S. wind industry since his first day in office. Trump on Jan. 20 ordered a halt to all new leases and permits for onshore and offshore wind pending federal review. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., condemned Trump's campaign against wind projects as \"irrational.\" The senate minority leader said Interior's decision would spike energy bills.  \"Trump's obsession with killing offshore wind projects is unhinged, irrational, and unjustified,\" Schumer said in a statement Monday. \"At a time of soaring energy costs, this latest decision from DOI is a backwards step that will drive energy bills even higher.\" Trump's campaign against the wind industry has run afoul of the courts. Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled on Dec. 8 that Trump's order was \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law.\"",

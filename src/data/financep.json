    "body": "<div><div><p>The U.S. government <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">shut down Wednesday</a>, putting hundreds of thousands of federal workers at risk of losing pay.</p><p>About 750,000 federal employees are expected to be furloughed each day, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61773-Government-Shutdown.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Congressional Budget Office</a>. Hundreds of thousands more are required to keep working without pay until funding resumes, based on federal agency estimates, including essential staff like air traffic controllers and border patrol agents.</p><p>The shutdown was triggered early Wednesday after the Senate failed to pass a short-term funding bill. The measure, which would have kept the government open through Nov. 20, fell short in a 55-45 vote, below the 60 needed.</p><p>All but two Democratic senators opposed the bill. Led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/29/shutdown-democrats-republicans-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats have been pushing</a> for an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of about $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts included in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.</p><p>In turn, Trump and Vice President J.D Vance have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">threatened permanent job cuts</a>. Last week, the Office of Management and Budget sent a memo directing federal agencies to prepare layoff plans for programs \"not consistent with the president's priorities\" if funding lapses, according to the memo <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-the-full-memo-directing-federal-agencies-to-weigh-mass-layoffs-if-the-government-shuts-down\" target=\"_blank\">published by PBS</a>.</p><p>Labor unions have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/labor-unions-sue-omb-opm-00589170\" target=\"_blank\">already sued</a> over the move, arguing it violates federal law.</p></div><h2><a></a>What a shutdown means and who is affected</h2><div><p>Each year, Congress must approve funding for the government's new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. A shutdown occurs when lawmakers miss that deadline. The last time it happened was a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\" target=\"_blank\">34-day shutdown in 2018</a>, during Trump's first term.</p><p>In a shutdown, agencies pause many operations and split workers into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Excepted employees</strong> who must keep working without pay, commonly in roles tied to safety and national security.</li><li><strong>Non-excepted employees</strong> who are placed on unpaid leave and told not to report to work.</li></ul><p>Federal employees are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends, but <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/government-shutdown-who-gets-paid\" target=\"_blank\">contractors are not</a>.</p><p>The shutdown's effects will be most visible in the government's largest agencies. At the Department of Homeland Security, more than 250,000 employees are required to keep working without pay, including border patrol officers and TSA agents, according to its contingency plan. </p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services expects to furlough about 32,460 workers, or 41% of its staff,<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-shutdown-furlough-41-health-agency-workers-2025-09-29/\" target=\"_blank\"> Reuters reports</a>. And at the FAA, more than 11,000 employees are being sent home while about 13,000 air traffic controllers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/faa-would-furlough-11000-employees-us-government-shutdown-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">continue working without pay</a>.</p><p>Most social programs will continue because they're funded outside the annual budget process. Social Security and Medicare benefits will still go out, the Postal Service will keep running and veterans' health care and disability payments will continue. SNAP food assistance is not expected to be affected immediately, though a prolonged shutdown could strain USDA's reserves,<a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/government-shutdown-snap-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\"> AARP</a> reports.</p></div><h2><a></a>Guidance for federal workers</h2><div><p>Shutdowns are a considerable disruption, especially for federal employees whose pay status can be unclear. To help them, the Office of Personnel Management maintains the government-wide<a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutdown guidance</a> that applies to all federal employees.</p><p>Federal agencies have also posted contingency plans that outline who is furloughed, who must keep working without pay and the procedures employees are expected to follow while operations are scaled back. Below is guidance from some of the agencies with the most employees affected:</p><ul><li>Department of Defense <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/27/2003809363/-1/-1/1/CONTINGENCY-PLAN-GUIDANCE-FOR-CONTINUATION-OF-OPERATIONS-IN-THE-ABSENCE-OF-APPROPRIATIONS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Department of Veterans Affairs <a href=\"https://department.va.gov/contingency-planning/\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/2025_0929_dhs_procedures_related_to_a_lapse_in_appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown procedures</a></li><li>Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/media/1377216/dl\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Health and Human Services<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> contingency staffing plan</a></li><li>Department of Transportation <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/lapse\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown guidance</a></li><li>State Department<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DOS-Lapse-Guidance-updated-29-September-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> guidance</a></li></ul><p>For contract workers wondering if they'll get paid, the National Law Review <a href=\"https://natlawreview.com/article/how-government-contractors-should-prepare-and-deal-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">offers advice</a> on confirming contract status and possible recourse on compensation.</p><p>Beyond that, out-of-work federal workers and contractors might qualify for <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/unemployment-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">state unemployment insurance</a>. Furloughed federal employees access it through the <a href=\"https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/docs/factsheet/UCFE_FactSheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, excepted employees have fewer options and often need to rely on personal savings until the shutdown ends.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

Sentiment from Democrats, who had typically had better views of Disney before the past two weeks, soured more strongly than Republicans. Though both groups showed significant declines.</p><p>\"The last two weeks for Disney have been as eventful to say the least, and have been equally controversial,\" analyst James Heaney wrote in a Thursday note to clients. The analyst noted a recent price hike for Disney+ added to the plunging mood around the brand.</p><p>Disney became a cultural flashpoint after taking Kimmel's late-night comedy show <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">briefly off the air</a> in the wake of his comments about slain conservative activist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/who-was-trump-ally-and-conservative-influencer-charlie-kirk.html\">Charlie Kirk</a> last month. ABC made the move after Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr hinted the network's broadcast license could be yanked. Local ABC-affiliated stations owned by <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NXST/\">Nexstar Media Group</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SBGI/\">Sinclair</a><span><span></span></span></span> preempted the show in their areas before Disney's decision.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>Disney shares, 1-month</p></div><div><p>Heaney noted that the entertainment giant faced backlash for both Kimmel's original comments and the subsequent move to halt his show's production. And then bring him back.</p><p>Critics of Disney's decision — including Democratic-leaning Hollywood power players — argued that the company was acquiescing to appease President Donald Trump's administration rather than stand up for the First Amendment right of free speech. Kimmel's show returned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-return-ratings-abc-disney.html\">much higher viewership</a> than is typical.</p><p>A chart Heaney shared with clients of the bank's research showed the readings of positive Disney sentiment divided by negative sentient among Democrats, Republicans and all consumers plunging to near zero, the lowest readings going back to before 2024.</p><p>Disney also announced late last month it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/disney-plus-new-pricing-streaming-kimmel.html\">upping prices</a> for many of its subscriptions by $2 to $3. The new cost tiers take effect Oct. 21.</p><p>Heaney noted that Disney as a whole saw its highest brand awareness in the past two years. For Disney+ specifically, the jump was much smaller, which the analyst said bodes well from a business perspective for CEO Bob Iger.</p><p>\"This is clearly a PR hit for Disney,\" Heaney said. \"But the data implies a smaller impact on Disney+ than the brand as a whole, which may limit the amount of streaming churn.\"</p><p>Disney shares have dropped 6% over the last month, pulling the stock into the red for 2025. But Heaney reaffirmed his buy rating and $144 price target, which implies nearly 30% upside over Wednesday's close.</p></div></div>",

That represented little change from August, though was just 0.01 percentage point away from moving up to 4.4%, the highest level since October 2021.</p><p>In September, the central bank district announced it would be releasing its own dashboard of labor market indicators that also includes the layoff rate, which was little changed monthly at 2.1%, and the hiring rate, which moved lower to 45.2%, down 0.4 percentage point from August.</p><p>Elsewhere in the labor market, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported that layoff announcements declined 37% in September and were down 26% from the same month a year ago.</p><p>However, the year-to-date level of planning furloughs is the highest since 2020, the year of the Covid pandemic.

    "body": "<div><div><p>Co-founder and Chief Science Officer at Hugging Face, Thomas Wolf, speaks at the opening ceremony of the Web Summit, in Lisbon, Portugal, November 11, 2024. </p><p>Pedro Nunes | Reuters</p></div><div><p>Current artificial intelligence models from labs like OpenAI are unlikely to lead to major scientific breakthroughs, a tech co-founder said, pouring cold water on some of the hype around the technology and claims by major figures in the field.</p><p>The comments by Thomas Wolf, co-founder of $4.5 billion AI startup Hugging Face, are in stake contrast to those by major names in AI including OpenAI boss Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei.</p><p>When Wolf talks about scientific breakthroughs, he means novel ideas like those at a Nobel Prize level. Examples including Nicolaus Copernicus who theorized the sun was at the center of the universe and other planets move round it.</p><p>Wolf explained a couple of issues with chatbots right now. The first is that these products like ChatGPT and others often agree or align with the person prompting it. Think back to if you've asked a chatbot a prompt and it will tell you how interesting or great that question is.</p><p>The second is that the models underpinning these chatbots are designed to \"predict the most likely next token\" or \"word\" in a sentence.</p><p>However, he noted two key traits of scientists. The first is that scientists who make major breakthroughs are often contrarian and question what others are saying.</p><p>\"The scientist is not trying to predict the most likely next word. He's trying to predict this very novel thing that's actually surprisingly unlikely, but actually is true,\" Wolf said.</p><p>The Hugging Face co-founder has been thinking about this topic for the last few months. His interest was sparked after he read an essay penned by Anthropic's Amodei, who posited that \"AI-enabled biology and medicine will allow us to compress the progress that human biologists would have achieved over the next 50-100 years into 5-10 years.\"</p><p>That got Wolf thinking about the state of AI and how this won't be possible, in his view, with the current crop of models.</p><p>Wolf said that these chatbots and tools will likely be used as a sort of \"co-pilot for a scientist\" where they are used for research to help the human generate new ideas.</p><p>To some extent, this has been happening already. Google DeepMind's AlphaFold product has helped to analyze protein structures which the company has promised could aid scientists in discovering new drugs.</p><p>But there are some new startups that are hoping to take AI one step further into being able to make scientific breakthroughs, including Lila Sciences and FutureHouse.</p></div></div>",

Taiwan currently faces a \"reciprocal\" tariff rate of 20%.</p><p>Washington has held discussions with Taipei about the \"50-50\" split in semiconductor production, which would cut American reliance on Taiwan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/taiwan-should-only-produce-half-of-americas-chips-says-us-commerce-chief.html\">Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> said last weekend in an interview to NewsNation, adding that currently 95% of the U.S. demand was met via chips produced within Taiwan.  </p><p>\"My objective, and this administration's objective, is to get chip manufacturing significantly onshored — we need to make our own chips,\" Lutnick said. \"The idea that I pitched [Taiwan] was, let's get to 50-50. We're producing half, and you're producing half.\" </p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump had also taken aim at the island's dominance in chips earlier this year, accusing it of \"stealing\" the U.S.' chip business.</p><p>The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.</p><p>Lutnick's proposal has been condemned by Taiwan's politicians, with Eric Chu, chairman of the island's principal opposition party Kuomintang, calling it \"an act of exploitation and plunder,\" according to the Central News Agency report.</p><p>\"No one can sell out Taiwan or TSMC, and no one can undermine Taiwan's silicon shield,\" Chu said, referring to <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/2330-TW/\">Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company</a><span><span></span></span></span>, the world's leader in advanced chip manufacturing.</p><p>Taiwan's critical position in global chips production is believed to have assured the island nation's defense against direct military action from China, often referred to as the \"Silicon Shield\" theory.</p><p>In his NewsNation interview, Lutnick downplayed the \"Silicon Shield,\" arguing that Taiwan would be safer with more balanced chip production between Washington and Taipei. Beijing views the democratically governed island of Taiwan as its own territory and has vowed to reclaim it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-china-will-never-renounce-right-use-force-over-taiwan-2022-10-16/\" target=\"_blank\">by force if necessary</a>, while Taipei rejects those claims<em>. </em></p><p>Taiwan People's Party Chairman Huang Kuo-chang reportedly called Lutnick's proposal an attempt to \"hollow out the foundations of Taiwan's technology sector.\"</p></div></div>",

Online retailers can use the Business AI digital assistant across apps like Facebook and Instagram as well as their own <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/31/shopify-stock-pops-after-it-strikes-buy-with-prime-deal-with-amazon.html\">websites that are powered</a> by Shopify, Meta said.</p><p>The new company-focused artificial intelligence assistant represents another way Meta is trying to make a big business incorporating generative AI, which CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/29/25-mark-zuckerberg.html\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> has been <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/29/meta-ai-q2-earnings.html\">investing billions of dollars</a> into.

If those companies want to use the Meta Business AI assistant on their own websites, they will have to pay a yet-to-be-determined price that Shih said will be cheaper than other \"market alternatives.\"</p><div><p>\"We're entering a new AI product category that makes our ads better,\" Shih said.</p><p>The Business AI digital assistant will also be available on WhatsApp and Messenger later this month in Mexico and the Philippines, with more markets coming down the line, Shih said.</p></div><p>If companies use the Business AI digital assistant across Meta apps and their retail-oriented websites, Shih explained that the software should presumably provide better responses to users that correspond to their product-related inquiries.</p><p>Shih said that Meta is partnering with companies like her former employer <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CRM/\">Salesforce</a><span><span></span></span></span>, as well as <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/\">Microsoft</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NOW/\">ServiceNow</a><span><span></span></span></span>, Zendesk and others to provide customer relationship management services and chatbots as part of its business AI push.</p><p>\"The best analogy is if you, as a customer, ask a salesperson about warranty information or a return,\" Shih said about the way Meta's Business AI software would work alongside third-party chat apps focusing on customer support. \"Often, they'll walk you over to the customer service desk to handle those more complicated requests.\"</p><p>Meta previously spent $1 billion in 2020 to buy the enterprise CRM startup Kustomer, but then <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/16/meta-spins-out-customer-service-startup-kustomer-amid-cost-and-efficiency-push.html\">spun it out in 2023</a> as an independent company during the social media giant's \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/meta-started-latest-round-of-layoffs-focusing-on-technical-employees.html\">year of efficiency</a>.\"</p><p>The company also debuted another tool called the Meta AI business assistant, which is intended for its advertisers to access for account problems and learn how their ad campaigns are performing. </p><p><strong>WATCH</strong>: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/09/29/sag-meta-is-paving-the-way-for-the-industry-not-chasing-quick-profits.html\">Meta is paving the way for the industry, not chasing quick profits</a>.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108204958-2ED1-WEX-092925-Anshel.jpg?v=1759145800&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Sag: Meta is paving the way for the industry, not chasing quick profits\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div></div>",

Artemis V is expected to involve Blue Origin. </p><p>Neither SpaceX nor Blue Origin has finalized the design of their lunar landers, and so far have only built test hardware.</p><p>Representatives of NASA, SpaceX and Blue Origin didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House of Representatives on Thursday passed the final set of outstanding government funding bills as a partial federal government shutdown looms on Jan. 30.The four bills account for the largest chunk of government spending, about $1.2 trillion in total. They would fund the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; Labor; Housing and Urban Development; Transportation; and Education. The Homeland Security bill passed 220-207, while the other three cleared 341-88 as part of a package known as a \"minibus.\"The bills represent the final quartet of 12 annual appropriations bills required to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown on Jan. 30. The Senate still needs to approve them, along with two other House-passed funding bills, before they head to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. The Senate does not return until next week, and a winter storm closing in on Washington over the weekend threatens to complicate those plans. House lawmakers were widely expected to pass the bills on Thursday, with lawmakers desperate to avoid another shutdown after enduring a record 43-day shutdown last year. Despite bipartisan accord on avoiding another shutdown, some of the bills still face serious hurdles in the Senate.

    "body": "Packages of Pampers diapers are displayed at a Target store on June 05, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesProcter & Gamble is selling diapers made with silk fibers in China as part of the company's strategy to entice shoppers to spend more, even as demand for some of its products wanes.China is the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States. In both markets, P&G has turned to innovation, rather than discounts, to attract consumers who are otherwise trying to spend less at the grocery store. For example, last year, it unveiled a new formula for its liquid Tide detergent in the U.S. In China, P&G also faces another challenge: a record-low birth rate. Government data released Monday showed that births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023. For P&G, fewer babies means the company is selling fewer diapers. To boost the sales of its baby-care division, P&G is leaning into luxury.Executives touted the success of the Pampers Prestige product on the company's earnings conference call Thursday. It added silk fibers to the inside of the diaper for skin comfort and protection.\"Chinese parents want only the best for their baby,\" P&G CEO Shailesh Jejurikar said.He added that \"reframing\" the company's super-premium diaper line has fueled double-digit organic sales growth and a 3% market share increase for P&G's baby-care business in Greater China over the last 18 months. The company did not share how the pricing of Pampers Prestige compares with its other diaper lines in China.In the latest quarter, P&G's overall baby-care division reported single-digit organic sales declines, despite a 20% jump in organic sales in Greater China, according to CFO Andre Schulten.More broadly, the focus on innovation is paying off for P&G. Consumer sentiment in China is still negative, yet P&G saw 3% growth in the market in the latest quarter, Schulten said on a call with reporters on Thursday.Stateside, P&G's sales were weaker. Organic sales in North America fell 2% in its fiscal second quarter. P&G is hoping that the strategy that is working in China could soon pay off in the U.S. The current bifurcated — or \"K-shaped\" — economy has showed that wealthier Americans are still willing to flex their purchasing power, even as lower-income shoppers pull back. Shares of P&G rose more than 2% in morning trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. However, P&G's revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by weaker demand in the U.S.",

    "body": "Brex co-founders Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras.BrexCapital One said Thursday that it was acquiring payments startup Brex for $5.15 billion, the latest splashy deal undertaken by the bank's CEO, Richard Fairbank.The firm, which disclosed the acquisition in its fourth-quarter earnings statement, said the purchase is made up of 50% cash and 50% stock. Brex was previously valued at $12.3 billion. Shares of the bank fell about 3%.Under Fairbank, a rare founder-CEO of a major U.S. bank, Capital One acquired rival card firm Discover Financial last year for about $35 billion. That deal was Fairbank's crowning achievement, giving the credit card lender access to one of the only payment networks of any scale. \"Since our founding, we set out to build a payments company at the frontier of the technology revolution,\" Fairbank said in a release. \"Acquiring Brex accelerates this journey, especially in the business payments marketplace.\"Fairbank said that Brex pioneered the melding of corporate cards, banking and spend management software: \"They have taken the rarest of journeys for a fintech, building a vertically integrated platform from the bottom of the tech stack to the top.\"Still, the more than 50% decline in valuation for Brex from its 2023 level shows the headwinds that even successful fintech companies have encountered. Brex is among a class of fintech firms that rose to prominence during a period of low interest rates; it was known initially as a startup that made loans to other startups via its cards.But the company expanded beyond technology into other sectors and now services larger established firms and startups alike, including Robinhood, Zoom and Anthropic. Capital One, which has offered business credit cards for decades, became increasingly convinced that it was Brex's model that would be the winning offering, according to a person with knowledge of the lender's strategy. \"We didn't have to pursue this acquisition, our growth was incredibly strong,\" Brex CEO Pedro Franceschi told CNBC in an interview.Combining Brex's technology with Capital One's reach and resources would grow the startup's scale faster than as a standalone firm, he said.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's push for mineral rights in Greenland may be the latest play in long-standing U.S. efforts to block China from accessing rare earths on the world's largest island. Trump has disclosed few details about the Greenland framework deal that he announced after meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Wednesday. But he told CNBC that it includes mineral rights for the U.S. and other partners, presumably NATO allies though it's unclear at this stage.\"They're going to be involved in the Golden Dome, and they're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we,\" Trump said in an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.The Trump administration declined requests for further information when asked by CNBC. White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said, \"as details are finalized by all parties involved, they will be released accordingly.\" \"If this deal goes through, and President Trump is very hopeful it will, the United States will be achieving all of its strategic goals with respect to Greenland, at very little cost, forever,\" Kelly said in a statement.Rare earths are used to make magnets that are key inputs for strategic industries like defense and robotics. China dominates the global supply chain and blocked exports in trade disputes with the U.S. last year. Beijing declared itself a \"near-Arctic state\" and regional stakeholder in 2018.Trump has made developing a Western rare earth supply chain a central objective of his industrial policy as he seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China. Greenland has the eighth-largest rare earth reserves in the world at 1.5 million metric tons, according to 2024 data from the U.S. Geological Survey. Beijing has a financial interest in the Kvanefjeld mining project in Greenland's south. It is the third-largest known land deposit of rare earths in the world, according the Center for Strategic and International Studies. China's Shenghe Resources is the second-largest investor in Kvanefjeld's owner, Australia's Energy Transition Minerals. The project came to a halt after Greenland banned uranium mining in 2021 and it is now mired in litigation.A framework that provides the U.S. with priority access to Greenland's rare earths \"might ensure that a Chinese partner or somebody else doesn't come back to the table to develop those resources,\" said Ryan Castilloux, founder of Adamas Intelligence, a rare earth market research firm. Greenland's resourcesA second project called Tanbreez is under development in Greenland's south by New York City headquartered Critical Metals. The company has described Tanbreez as one of the largest rare earth deposits in the world. Critical Metals received a letter of interest from the Export-Import Bank of the United States earlier this month that could result in a $120 million loan for the development of Tanbreez. The company's stock rallied about 21% on Thursday and has nearly tripled in value this year. watch nowThe Biden administration was also worried about China gaining access to Greenland's rare earths. It lobbied the developer, Tanbreez Mining, to not sell the project to a China-linked company, CEO Greg Barnes told Reuters in January 2025. Tanbreez was ultimately acquired by Critical Metals.Economic challengesTrump said at Davos that his push for Greenland is not about extracting rare earths. He has said U.S. interests in Greenland are about blocking China's and Russia's ambitions in the Arctic. \"I want Greenland for security. I don't want it for anything else,\" Trump told reporters Wednesday before meeting with the NATO chief. \"We have so much rare earth, we don't know what to do with it. We don't need it for anything else.\" The pipeline for rare earth supplies is full after the U.S. made significant progress in standing up its supply chain over the past year, Castilloux said. The Pentagon struck an agreement last year with rare earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. Supplies from Greenland are not needed in the near term, though that could change over a longer time horizon, Castilloux said. The economics of mining in Greenland are challenging, the analyst said. The island's remote location and infrastructure gaps would bring higher development costs, he said. Greenland's small population means at least some of the skilled workforce would have to be flown in and out. Shipping costs would also be higher, he said. Trump was blunt Wednesday about the cost of rare earth mining in Greenland.\"In terms of Greenland, you know, you have to go 25 feet down through ice to get it,\" Trump said. \"It's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.\" \"No, this is security we're talking about,\" he said.",

Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" Hours before Carney's speech, Trump had posted on social media a digitally-altered image of a map with Greenland, Venezuela and Canada covered with American flag.  Recent events have shown that \"the rules-based international order\" is effectively dead, while the world's superpowers \"pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion,\" Carney said in his speech.  Relations between the two longstanding allies have come under heavy strain in Trump's second term, who has referred to the neighboring country as the U.S.' 51st state, besides targeting it with tariffs.

Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe \"Board of Peace,\" chaired by Trump, was originally conceived to oversee the demilitarization and rebuilding of Gaza strip after a two-year war with Israel. But Trump said he foresees the board to take a wider role that could ultimately rival the United Nations, a remit that has alarmed several U.S. allies. Trump has garnered the support from regional Middle East countries including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as emerging economies such as Indonesia. But several global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy and some have rejected the proposal. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reportedly said that it \"won't be one of the signatories\" citing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to join.  Russia and China are among those invited to join the board. Putin reportedly told the Russian security council that the foreign ministry was still studying the proposal while China has not confirmed whether it will join. Carney's WEF address followed his high-profile visit to China last week, where he reached a wide-ranging agreement with President Xi Jinping to reduce tariffs and rebuild ties. As part of the deal, Beijing cut tariffs on a number of agricultural products from Canada while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles into its market with the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Carney hailed his strategic partnership with Xi, touting the importance of their ties in the face of a \"new world order,\" in a veiled reference to the global instability caused by Trump's foreign policy swings and disruptive trade agenda.

    "body": "A former official of U.S. President Donald Trump's first administration is planning a multi-billion-dollar data center project in a remote corner of Greenland, as hyperscalers scramble to build out capacity across the globe to keep up with the AI rollout.The data center is aiming to be operational at 300 megawatts (MW) by mid-2027, before further expansion would see it hit 1.5 gigawatts (GW) by the end of 2028.While that's currently several times the power capacity of any active data center in the world, there are plans to build multiple 1 GW-plus facilities across the globe over the next two years as the race to develop AI infrastructure continues to gather pace.The Greenland data center project will cost billions of dollars to complete and has binding commitments with investors to finance half of its initial phase of development and half of the final phase, Drew Horn, a senior aide to Trump's first-term vice president Mike Pence and CEO of GreenMet, a company that's offering strategic support to the project, told CNBC. The venture is eyeing a buildout in the Kangerlussuaq area, a small settlement at the end of a deep fjord on the southwest coast of the Arctic island, with an airport, he added.Technical partners have been enlisted to help with the physical buildout, but the project has yet to secure land or approvals from the local authorities, Horn said. He declined to share the names of the other companies involved in the venture because the information isn't public yet.Commercial opportunities in Greenland have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks as the Arctic island has become the center of a geopolitical firestorm after U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on acquisition talk. Critical minerals mining and freshwater reserves have been touted as potential prospects, though skeptics point to logistical challenges around tapping into them with Greenland's limited infrastructure.  watch nowMulti-billion-dollar data centerData center deals hit a record $61 billion in 2025 amid a rush to build out the infrastructure needed to power energy-intensive AI workloads. Big tech firms, including Meta, OpenAI, Oracle, AWS, Microsoft and Google are investing huge sums into developing facilities across the globe. Work on plans for the Greenland data center project began a year ago, and Horn told CNBC it has secured technical partners to assist with construction, operation and supplying energy.Committed financing, which is in the form of debt and equity, is contingent on the project meeting key milestones, including securing permits from local government, said Horn — who was also a senior advisor to both the energy and intelligence departments towards the end of Trump's first term.Other former senior Trump employees also have stakes in GreenMet, which says on its website that it helps companies with government and private funding and strategic partnerships.  George Sorial, who was an executive vice president and chief compliance counsel at the Trump Organization until 2019, and Keith Schiller, who was a longtime bodyguard for Trump and director of Oval Office operations during the U.S. president's first term, helped set up the company in 2021 and remain shareholders.\"We are not actively involved with GreenMet or Greenland,\" Sorial told CNBC. \"We are passive minority shareholders in GreenMet and have no management role in the company.\" Schiller had not responded to a CNBC request for comment as this story went live.The GreenMet CEO has been developing relationships with officials in the Greenlandic and Danish administrations as he looks to advance the project. He met the Danish Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper Møller Sørensen on Wednesday, as part of a \"continuing dialogue,\" to discuss the data center, Horn said. CNBC has approached Denmark's U.S. embassy for comment.While officials on all sides have been supportive of the project, the \"issue is not so much on the private side, it's on the diplomatic,\" Horn said, pointing to the geopolitical tensions surrounding the U.S. push to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous Danish territory.Tensions have cooled since Trump backtracked on plans to impose tariffs on several European nations over the issue, but questions still remain as negotiations around U.S. military and economic involvement in Greenland continue.\"Our effort, which is purely private, it succeeds only if we have the buy-in from the relevant affected parties and countries,\" Horn said.Securing power\"Larger corporate entities\" will be taking the lead on the construction and development of the data center, but GreenMet will continue to be involved as an advisor as the project looks to secure government investment from nations including the U.S., Greenland, Denmark, and other NATO countries, Horn told CNBC. \"We've spent about a year putting together everything from the power to the technology components, [and] we have a Greenlandic partner on the ground,\" Horn said. \"Right now we're waiting on approvals from the Greenlandic side.\"A big challenge for projects of this scale in Greenland is access to power. For the first phase of the project, which is targeting 300 MW power capacity, the plan is to use specialized barges carrying Liquefied Natural Gas to the fjord, Horn said.The venture plans to build a hydroelectric facility — 70% of the island's energy comes from such facilities — to power the second phase, which would see the data center hit 1.5 GW capacity. Permits and approvals from the Greenlandic government are still pending for both the barges and the facility. Greenland's Ministry of Business has been approached for comment.Kangerlussuaq Fjord. Large iceberg in scenic fjord surrounded by snow-capped mountains, Southeast coast, Greenland.Vw Pics | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesHorn argues that if local authorities greenlight the large hydroelectric facility, energy prices will make the project commercially viable long-term. There are some significant advantages to building data centers in an environment with low temperatures, analysts told CNBC.\"The biggest value sits in its resource profile, specifically in hydro for electricity generation and a 'free cooling' proposition given the lower ambient temperature,\" Noah Ramos, strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, told CNBC.But there are hurdles the project will have to overcome. \"Building in the Arctic is capital intensive; construction seasons are short, and the heat from the servers can melt the very ground the building sits on... specialized engineering is needed,\" Ramos said.Nvidia is also touting a new generation of chips that require less cooling. \"It's early days, but if future generations of chips are even more efficient in this regard, it could negate the need for expensive data centre build outs in places like Greenland,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC.watch now",

    "body": "The Intel logo is displayed on a sign in front of Intel headquarters on Jan. 22, 2026 in Santa Clara, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIntel reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations but offered soft guidance for the current quarter.Shares of the company were down as much as 13% in after-hours trading. Here's how the chipmaker did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 15 cents adjusted vs. 8 cents expectedRevenue: $13.7 billion vs. $13.4 billion expectedIntel said it expected first-quarter revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and breakeven adjusted earnings per share. That came in below LSEG expectations of 5 cents earnings per share on $12.51 billion in sales. Finance chief David Zinsner told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos that the company's soft guidance in the first quarter was partially because the company doesn't have the supply it needs for seasonal demand, and that supply would improve in the second quarter this year. On a call with analysts, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that the company was looking to improve its production efficiency, called yield, in order to improve supply of the company's products. \"Our yields are in line with our internal plans,\" Tan said. \"They are still below what I want them to be.\"The company said it had a net loss of $600 million, or 12 cents per diluted share. In the year-ago period, Intel reported a net loss of $100 million, or 3 cents per share. Investor expectations were high for Intel heading into the report, with the stock up 147% in the past year. The rally has been driven by optimism that Intel may be on the cusp of securing its first major anchor customer for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies.Tan said earlier this month that the company's 18A manufacturing technology — competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 2nm technology — \"over-delivered\" in 2025. That suggests that the technology is mature enough to start volume production of products, such as Intel's own Core Ultra Series 3 central processor. In a statement, Tan said that Intel was \"working aggressively\" to increase 18A supply to meet \"strong customer demand.\"Zinsner told CNBC that customers for Intel's next-generation 14A technology would show up in the second half of the year. Zinsner added that the company was unlikely to announce customers in general. \"Once we get them, we're gonna need to start really spending capital on the 14A front, and that's how you'll know,\" Zinsner said. Intel said its foundry had $4.5 billion in revenue, although some of that is accounting for making the company's own chips. There is also optimism tied to strong sales of Intel's latest server chips, which analysts say are seeing a sales boom because of increased spending on infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Tan said in a statement Thursday that Intel's central processing units were becoming more important because of systems built for artificial intelligence. Revenue from those chips is reported as Data Center and AI sales, which totaled $4.7 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 9% on an annual basis. Chips for laptops are reported as Client Computing Group sales. The product category was down 7% on a year-over-year basis to $8.2 billion in sales. During 2025, the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia made big investments into the chipmaker, all becoming major shareholders. Intel said that its sale of stock to Nvidia worth $5 billion was completed during the quarter. WATCH: Can Intel's New Arizona Chip Fab Bring It Back From The Brink?watch now",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, on Thursday for closing accounts belonging to Trump and related entities in early 2021, in what the lawsuit calls political actions. The closures came on the heels of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol, and Trump exiting the White House later that same month after his electoral loss to former President Joe Biden was confirmed.\"He debanked me,\" Trump told reporters in Switzerland, when asked about Dimon on Wednesday, hours after his lawsuit was filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County.\"He shouldn't be debanking,\" Trump said. \"It's so wrong.\"\"Jamie Dimon is not allowed to do what he did.\"JPMorgan on Thursday denied that it closed Trump's accounts for political reasons and suggested that the closures were due to federal rules and regulations that the bank has been seeking to change during this and prior presidential administrations.Trump and the other plaintiffs in the case, which are business entities related to the president, are seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages. The plaintiffs had been customers of the bank for decades, the suit says.\"Plaintiffs are confident that JPMC's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"In essence, JPMC debanked Plaintiffs' Accounts because it believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so,\" says the suit.The suit says JPMorgan failed to disclose why the bank was terminating the accounts, but that the \"plaintiffs have subsequently learned that they were debanked as a result of political discrimination against President Trump, the Trump Organization, its affiliated entities, and/or the Trump family.\"The suit does not detail what the plaintiffs learned that substantiated that claim.The suit also says that JPMorgan's \"reckless decision is leading a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer's access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution.\"In addition to alleging motivations for the closures, the complaint says that Trump and the plaintiffs \"have recently learned that JPMC — at the direction of Dimon — has unlawfully and unjustifiably published some or all of their names, including the names of President Trump, the Trump Organization with its affiliated entities, and/or the Trump family, on a blacklist.\"That purported blacklist is accessible by federally regulated banks \"and is comprised of individuals and entities that have a history of malfeasant acts and are otherwise non-compliant with applicable banking rules and regulations,\" the suit says, while stating that the plaintiffs \"have always complied\" with banking rules and regulations.The complaint does not give a formal name for that blacklist or indicate that it was part of a government regulatory apparatus.The complaint alleges trade libel, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by JPMorgan.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

What policy experts say about itStudents forgo four-year degrees in favor of community college, certificate programsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedSurveys show many Americans are worried about Social Security's future, and experts say this may inform their decisions about claiming benefits, one of the most important financial decisions in retirement. Concerns about the program's future may prompt people to claim benefits earlier  — which reduces their monthly checks and, in turn, may weaken their retirement security. Almost three-quarters of Americans — 74% — said they worry Social Security will run out in their lifetimes, according to a 2025 Nationwide Financial survey of 1,812 adults. Another 2025 survey from the Cato Institute found 30% of respondents don't believe Social Security will be there for them when they retire, while 70% expect benefits to face future cuts. The libertarian think tank polled 2,000 Americans ages 18 and over.Americans can assume that Social Security will be there for them in some form, Nuñez told CNBC.com.\"The word 'bankruptcy' used with the program doesn't really accurately describe what's happening,\" he said.Other retirement experts have similarly argued that the term \"bankrupt\" does not accurately describe Social Security's funding predicament. \"Even if nothing is done, people will continue to receive the bulk of their benefits,\" Alicia Munnell, senior advisor at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, wrote in May. Social Security has faced funding woes beforeIn less than 10 years, government projections show, the Social Security trust funds used to help pay benefits will be depleted. The trust funds, which are invested in Treasury securities, are excess money reserves that were not used to pay benefits.Recent legislation enacted by lawmakers has made the program's financial issues more imminent. That includes the Social Security Fairness Act, which increased benefits for certain public pensioners, and the \"big beautiful bill,\" which reduces tax rates seniors pay.In particular, the fund dedicated to retirement benefits may run out by late 2032, according to the latest estimates from the Social Security Administration's chief actuary. If Congress does not act, beneficiaries may face an estimated 24% benefit cut. Notably, benefits would still be payable, as the program would have money coming in from payroll taxes. If the program reaches that depletion date without congressional action to reform the program, there are several ways benefits may be affected, depending on the interpretation of the law, Nuñez said. Among the possibilities include an across-the-board benefit cut, prioritization of payments to the most vulnerable beneficiaries or staggering full benefit payments on a delayed schedule.watch nowSocial Security has been in this situation before. In 1982, the balance of the retirement trust fund fell to zero, prompting the government to temporarily authorize loans from the disability and Medicare trust funds. In 1983, Congress passed legislation to shore up Social Security's finances that included changes like raising the full retirement age and applying federal income taxes on benefits.That package of reforms was slated to shore up the program for 75 years.Yet the projected shortfall is coming much sooner.There was a lot that lawmakers at the time got right, Nuñez said, such as anticipating the large size of the baby boomer population that would eventually claim benefits, as well as demographic changes, including a declining fertility rate and increased longevity.Income inequality, Great Recession affect projectionsTwo surprises — earnings inequality and the Great Recession — have prompted the projected depletion dates to move up sooner.Those two factors caused the program to start drawing down its reserves around 2009, much sooner than had been projected in 2021 and 2022, according to Nuñez.Had the trust funds matured as projected, the depletion date would have been around 2063, rather than roughly 2034, the date Social Security's trustees identified for the combined funds in their 2025 report.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageAs federal ACA subsidies lapse, blue states offer their ownIn an affordability crunch, Gen Z adults lean on their parents for financial helpHow a smaller IRS, budget cuts may impact tax filing: 'Buckle your seatbelts,' expert says'Will Social Security run out?' is the wrong question, economist says.

What policy experts say about itStudents forgo four-year degrees in favor of community college, certificate programsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedIncome inequality has affected how much the program takes in from the FICA payroll tax, which is applied to earnings up to a certain cap that is adjusted each year. In 2026, that limit is $184,500. Earnings up to that amount are subject to a 6.2% payroll tax paid by workers and another 6.2% paid by their employers.In 1983, 90% of earnings were below the Social Security FICA payroll tax cap. Yet projections that the percentage would stay about the same with future average annual earnings growth proved to be inaccurate.Average real earnings grew as expected. Yet those gains were \"unexpectedly unequal,\" Nuñez said.The top 6% of earners continued to have wages above the payroll tax cap. Yet their real earnings grew by an average of 62% from 1983 through 2000, exceeding expectations. Meanwhile, the remaining 94% of workers only saw a 17% increase in average real earnings. The FICA payroll tax cap did not increase quickly enough to maintain the 90% tax coverage. As of 2000, it had dropped to about 82.5%, and mostly stabilized there, according to Nuñez — which meant less tax revenue for the program's reserves. In 2023, 83% of total payroll was subject to Social Security taxes, a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis shows. The unexpected economic shock of the Great Recession also hurt Social Security's funding, as higher unemployment and slower earnings growth meant less payroll tax revenue coming into the program. Older workers may have opted for retirement, increasing the benefits the program paid out. Congress will be 'forced to deal with Social Security'It is now up to lawmakers to decide how Social Security's shortfalls will be addressed, whether through tax increases, benefit cuts or a combination of both.\"The longer we wait to do something, the higher the cost is going to be,\" Nuñez said.The soonest projected depletion date — 2032 — means the next presidential election \"could very well determine the future of the program,\" Nuñez said.Senate lawmakers who are elected this year will also be in office at that time.\"Legislators are going to be forced to deal with Social Security, even though they have not wanted to,\" Nuñez said.watch nowWhile today's lawmakers have vowed to protect Social Security, their approach has largely meant doing nothing rather than tackling the tough reforms the program needs, Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, wrote in November. That leaves it up to voters to press lawmakers to address the program, she said.The changes they make will determine how much Americans pay into Social Security and the amount of benefits they receive.\"What's going to matter the most is who's at the table making those decisions when that time comes around,\" Nuñez said.",

    "body": "Indian billionaire Gautam Adani attends the 51st Gems and Jewellery Awards in Jaipur, India, November 30, 2024. Stringer | ReutersShares of Adani Group companies fell between 5 to 13% on Friday as court filings showed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to send summons to founder Gautam Adani and nephew Sagar Adani on charges of bribery and fraud.  Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, chair of India's Adani Group and one of the world's richest people, was indicted with seven other men in New York federal court in November 2024 on charges related to a massive bribery and fraud scheme.The SEC has approached a U.S. District Judge, Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn, seeking permission to issue a legal summons to Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani and the executive director of Adani Green Energy, Sagar Adani, according to court filings. CNBC has reached out to Adani Group and the U.S. SEC for comment.Shares of Adani Green Energy ended the session nearly 14% lower, while those of the flagship company Adani Enterprises closed 10.7% lower on Friday. Shares of Adani Power dropped 5.7%.The Adani Group executives are charged with misleading U.S. and international investors about their company's compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption practices, as they raised more than $3 billion in capital to fund those energy contracts.India's Ministry of Law and Justice has twice refused last year to deliver the summons to Gautam Adani and Sagar Adani under the Hague Convention, the SEC told the court. \"The Ministry appeared to suggest that the SEC lacks authority to invoke the Hague Convention or seek service of the Summonses,\" it said.Adani and several other defendants are accused of having paid Indian government officials more than $250 million in bribes to obtain solar energy supply contracts worth more than $2 billion in profits.",

    "body": "watch nowThe sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight.Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: \"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\" Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making \"garbage loans\" and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit.While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven't lifted completely.Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital, as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR, still trade well below their recent highs.The rise of private creditPrivate credit is \"lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast, which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit's boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient.Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector's competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes.After all, it's the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. \"The double-edged sword of private credit\" is that the lenders have \"really strong incentives to monitor for problems,\" said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay.\"But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,\" she said.De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it's difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said.\"This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it's not a public market,\" she said. \"We're not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.\"In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero.Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report.And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.Finance frenemiesAfter investment bank Jefferies, JPMorgan and Fifth Third disclosed losses tied to the auto industry bankruptcies in the fall, investors learned the extent of this form of lending. Bank loans to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, reached $1.14 trillion last year, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.On Jan. 13, JPMorgan disclosed for the first time its lending to nonbank financial firms as part of its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. The category tripled to about $160 billion in loans in 2025 from about $50 billion in 2018.Banks are now \"back in the game\" because deregulation under the Trump administration will free up capital for them to expand lending, Moody's Zandi said. That, combined with newer entrants in private credit, might lead to lower loan underwriting standards, he said.\"You're seeing a lot of competition now for the same type of lending,\" Zandi said. \"If history is any guide, that's a concern ... because it probably argues for a weakening in underwriting and ultimately bigger credit problems down the road.\"While neither Zandi nor de Fontenay said they saw an imminent collapse in the sector, as private credit continues to grow, so will its importance to the U.S. financial system.When banks hit turbulence because of the loans they made, there is an established regulatory playbook, but future problems in the private realm might be harder to resolve, according to de Fontenay.\"It raises broader questions from the perspective of the safety and soundness of the overall system,\" de Fontenay said. \"Are we going to know enough to know when there are signs of problems before they actually occur?\"watch now",

Shares traded 29% higher at 32.25 euros ($37.85) at 1:54 p.m. London time (8:54 a.m. ET), having jumped as much as 32% earlier in the session. The upswing implies a market capitalization of roughly 32.5 billion euros.The Prague-based company, which makes armed vehicles, ammunition, and advanced defense systems, raised a total of 3.8 billion euros in its initial public offering. Euronext said the listing marked the world's largest defense IPO ever recorded, both in terms of amount raised and market capitalization.\"Today marks a historic milestone for CSG as we join the Euronext Amsterdam market and we welcome the confidence shown in us by investors,\" Michal Strnad, chairman of CSG, said in a statement.\"Becoming a publicly listed company demonstrates our commitment to high standards of transparency, disclosure and corporate governance and strengthens our ability to invest in innovation, expand our global reach and deliver on our mission to be a critical long-term supplier of advanced defence and industrial solutions to NATO states and Government partners worldwide,\" he added.The listing comes after weeks of mounting geopolitical tensions, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to use military force to seize Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally. In a surprise development on Wednesday, however, Trump said he had agreed to a framework of a future deal with respect to the self-governing Danish territory. In Europe, meanwhile, investors have continued to pile into defense stocks, fueled by a mix of European Union, national and private capital funding.Strategists have cited Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the end of the U.S. defense umbrella in Europe as underpinning a so-called \"mega-trend in the making.\"  — CNBC's Hugh Leask contributed to this report.",

Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans to visit China in the coming days ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The trip comes as questions persist over the U.S. chip giant's ability to sell in the Chinese market, which once accounted for at least one-fifth of revenue from Nvidia's data center business.U.S. export restrictions have prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China as Washington seeks to maintain an edge over Beijing in chips used to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence.Huang is expected to attend an Nvidia company party in Beijing on Monday, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak about the trip.He is also set to meet with potential buyers in China and discuss recent logistical challenges in supplying U.S.-approved Nvidia chips into the market, according to a person with direct knowledge of the travel plans. The Information reported last week, citing sources, that China would only approve local purchases of Nvidia's H200 AI chips for limited purposes such as research. When asked about the report Thursday, China's Commerce Ministry claimed it was unaware of the situation. Bloomberg first reported news of Huang's China trip earlier this week. Nvidia declined to comment on executive travel plans. Huang visited mainland China at least three times last year, including in January for Lunar New Year celebrations. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "President Donald Trump returns to the White House on Marine One in Washington, D.C., on November 22, 2025.Allison Robbert | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesA judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election.The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case \"dismissed in its entirety,\" draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024.McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"\"In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years,\" Skandalakis wrote in a court filing.Fulton County Sheriff's OfficeTrump celebrated the ruling later Wednesday, writing in a lengthy Truth Social post that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed.\"\"This case should never have been brought,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement. \"A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"The case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law.The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the case of the State of Georgia v. Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia.Alex Slitz-Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.By that time, Willis was facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was disqualified from the case in December 2024.The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "watch nowMassachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday released a study that found that artificial intelligence can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, or as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, health care and professional services.The study was conducted using a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which was created by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The index simulates how 151 million U.S. workers interact across the country and how they are affected by AI and corresponding policy. The Iceberg Index, which was announced earlier this year, offers a forward-looking view of how AI may reshape the labor market, not just in coastal tech hubs but across every state in the country. For lawmakers preparing billion-dollar reskilling and training investments, the index offers a detailed map of where disruption is forming down to the zip code.\"Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market,\" said Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research. ORNL is a Department of Energy research center in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modeling efforts.The index runs population-level experiments, revealing how AI reshapes tasks, skills and labor flows long before those changes show up in the real economy, Balaprakash said. The index treats the 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.What the researchers found is that the visible tip of the iceberg — the layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing and information technology — represents just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Beneath the surface lies the total exposure, the $1.2 trillion in wages, and that includes routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration. Those are areas sometimes overlooked in automation forecasts.The index is not a prediction engine about exactly when or where jobs will be lost, the researchers said. Instead, it's meant to give a skills-centered snapshot of what today's AI systems can already do, and give policymakers a structured way to explore what-if scenarios before they commit real money and legislation.The researchers partnered with state governments to run proactive simulations. Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah helped validate the model using their own labor data and have begun building policy scenarios using the platform.watch nowTennessee moved first, citing the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month. Utah state leaders are preparing to release a similar report based on Iceberg's modeling. North Carolina state Sen. DeAndrea Salvador, who has worked closely with MIT on the project, said what drew her to the research is how it surfaces effects that traditional tools miss. She added that one of the most useful features is the ability to drill down to local detail. \"One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,\" she said. Salvador said that kind of simulation work is especially valuable as states stand up overlapping AI task forces and working groups.The Iceberg Index also challenges a common assumption about AI risk — that it will stay confined to tech roles in coastal hubs. The index's simulations show exposed occupations spread across all 50 states, including inland and rural regions that are often left out of the AI conversation.To address that gap, the Iceberg team has built an interactive simulation environment that allows states to experiment with different policy levers — from shifting workforce dollars and tweaking training programs to exploring how changes in technology adoption might affect local employment and gross domestic product. \"Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,\" the report says. Balaprakash, who also serves on the Tennessee Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council, shared state-specific findings with the governor's team and the state's AI director. He said many of Tennessee's core sectors — health care, nuclear energy, manufacturing and transportation — still depend heavily on physical work, which offers some insulation from purely digital automation. The question, he said, is how to use new technologies such as robotics and AI assistants to strengthen those industries rather than hollow them out.For now, the team is positioning Iceberg not as a finished product but as a sandbox that states can use to prepare for AI's impact on their workforces. \"It is really aimed towards getting in and starting to try out different scenarios,\" Salvador said.

    "body": "At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. \"There's some trickery happening,\" says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. \"Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago.\"That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. \"The consumer has to be proactive,\" says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. \"Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale.\" Track price historiesIdeally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, \"it's definitely not too late\" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. \"Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark,\" says Woroch. Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. \"Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price,\" Woroch says. \"Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need.\"Beware of other Black Friday pitfallsAlthough Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. \"You may be able to find good deals on mattresses,\" says Lupo. \"But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday.\"And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls \"spaving\" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive \"bundle\" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. \"Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free,\" Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, \"you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

This year, Workday has announced the launch of several AI agents and expanded its offerings through startup acquisitions. Earlier this month, Workday completed the $1.1 billion purchase of AI and learning software company Sana.Despite those moves, Workday's third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress Wall Street. The company called for $8.83 billion in subscription revenue for the fiscal year that will end in January 2026, implying 14.4% growth, but the figure was up just $13 million from the company's guidance in August. The new number includes contributions from Sana and a contract with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Workday finance chief Zane Rowe told analysts on a conference call.\"Investors were likely looking for more of a beat-and-raise quarter,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Matt VanVliet and Mason Marion wrote in a note to clients. They have the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday stock. The new number, they wrote, \"borders on a slight guide down.\" The analysts held their 12-month price target on Workday stock at $280.Stifel, with a hold rating on the stock, lowered its Workday target to $235 from $255.\"It does not appear that the underlying momentum of the business is showing any signs of stabilization,\" Stifel's Brad Reback and Robert Galvin wrote in a note. Reback and Galvin said Workday implied that growth from its 12-month subscription revenue backlog will continue to slow when removing impact from acquisitions. They expect the trend to continue even as customers sign up for Workday's AI products, they wrote.The outcome was \"like turkey without the gravy,\" Evercore analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, wrote in the title of their note. Analysts at RBC, which also has the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday shares, lowered their price target to $320 from $340. Despite the mixed guidance, they wrote in a note to clients, results for the fiscal third quarter did exceed consensus. Plus, AI products contributed over 1.5 percentage points of annualized revenue growth, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said on Tuesday's conference call. '\"We remain encouraged by early AI momentum,\" the RBC analysts wrote.WATCH: AI will drive the market higher in 2026, says Citizens' Mark Lehmannwatch now",

Firefighters were still working to contain the blaze in the remaining areas.Officials said the blaze may have started on a section of bamboo scaffolding encasing the complex, then spread to other buildings through the wooden poles and protective netting — prompting public scrutiny of the city's housing standards.  Hong Kong's police pointed to a \"grossly negligent\" construction company that used protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not meet fire standards and foam material that is \"highly inflammable.\" Three men from the construction company have been arrested on suspicion of \"manslaughter.\"  Volunteers give out food to residents after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong's Tai Po district on Nov. 27, 2025.

    "body": "President Donald Trump and his administration will begin imposing new limits for federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.Undergraduate borrowers will have the same current limit of up to $7,500 a year for dependent students, depending on their class year. But graduate and professional students will see new limits of up to $20,500 per year ($100,000 total) for graduate studies and $50,000 a year ($200,000 total) for professional programs. Graduate PLUS loans, which previously allowed students to borrow up to their total cost of attendance, will be eliminated.According to the proposed regulation, a professional degree \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"The Department of Education has named 11 degree fields that meet the requirements to be considered professional, and thus eligible for higher loan limits under the new rules: Pharmacy (Pharm. D.)Dentistry doctorate (D.D.S. or D.M.S.)Veterinary medicine (D.V.M.)Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.)Law (L.L.B. or J.D.)Medicine (M.D.)Optometry (O.D.)Osteopathic medicine (D.O.)Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.)Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.)Clinical psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.)The addition of clinical psychology came out of the department's recent negotiated rulemaking session where stakeholders debated the loan limit rule and how it should be applied.The department also said programs in at least 44 other fields could qualify if they meet certain criteria, including giving students a \"level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree,\" generally resulting in a doctoral level degree and requiring professional licensure to begin practice. Potentially eligible programs include a number of other pharmacy degrees, clinical counseling and theological studies. Institutions are responsible for determining whether a program meets the requirements to be considered a professional degree or not, says Sarah Austin, a policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.Professional organizations respondSome professional organizations have expressed concern over the list of degrees eligible for the $200,000 aggregate federal loan limit and the Department of Education's definition of professional programs.\"Despite broad recognition of the complexity, rigor, and necessity of post-baccalaureate nursing education, the Department's proposal defines professional programs so narrowly that nursing, the nation's largest healthcare profession, remains excluded,\" The American Association of Colleges of Nursing said in a press release on Nov. 7. \"Should this proposal be finalized, the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.\"\"Declassifying the [Master of Social Work] and [Doctorate of Social Work] degrees will reduce access to affordable social work education, thereby increasing reliance on high-interest private loans,\" the National Association of Social Workers' Florida chapter said in a press release on Nov. 20.In a fact sheet released on Nov. 24, the Department of Education said, \"The definition of a 'professional degree' is an internal definition used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.\"The intention behind the loan limits is to discourage borrowers from taking on more debt than they will be able to handle and to encourage institutions to rein in tuition costs, the department said. The loan limit regulation is not final, however. The Department of Education will publish the regulation in its current form in the federal register in the coming months where the public will have the opportunity to give feedback before it becomes final.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "The Dell Technologies logo is on display at the International Broadcasting Convention (IBC2025) on Sept. 12, 2025 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.Michel Porro | Getty ImagesDell reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that missed Wall Street expectations for revenue, but the company forecasted a stronger-than-expected fourth quarter driven by increased AI sales.Dell shares rose 5% in extended trading. Here's how Dell did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: $2.59 adjusted versus $2.47 estimatedRevenue: $27.01 billion versus $27.13 billion estimatedDell said it expects about $31.5 billion in sales in the fourth quarter versus $27.59 billion estimated by analysts. The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings per share of $3.50 versus $3.21 expected. The company said it was raising its expectations for AI server shipments during the year to $25 billion, up from $20 billion, and raised its full-year revenue guidance to $111.7 billion from $107 billion.Dell reported $1.54 billion in net income, or $2.28 per diluted share, during the quarter, versus $1.17 billion, or $1.64, in the year-ago period. The company is an important bellwether for the health of the AI infrastructure industry as one of the top vendors for systems based around Nvidia's graphics processors. Overall revenue in the quarter rose 11% on an annual basis. Dell's main customers for its artificial intelligence systems are big businesses, governments and so-called neoclouds like CoreWeave. Dells sells less to big cloud companies typically called hyperscalers, which have been the most voracious Nvidia buyers so far. The company said it expects to sell $9.4 billion of AI servers in the fourth quarter, and that doesn't include a deal announced in November to sell Nvidia-based GB300 systems to Iren, a neocloud that plans to rent them out to Microsoft. Dell's data center business, called Infrastructure Solutions Group, reported $14.11 billion in sales, in-line with analyst estimates. Of that, $10.1 billion was for servers and networking parts, which was up 37% on an annual basis. Much of that increase was driven by $5.6 billion in AI server shipments. Dell said it sold $4 billion of storage gear during the quarter.But the company said that its laptop and PC business, called Client Solutions Group, reported $12.48 billion in sales, which was up 3% year-over-year but slightly lower than the $12.65 billion expected by analysts. Dell's laptop and PC business was hit particularly hard, declining 7% on an annual basis. The company said it spent $1.6 billion during the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.

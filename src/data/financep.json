    "body": "Amina AlTai has always been a high achiever.As a child of immigrants, she was told to \"keep your head down, work really hard, and if you do that, you'll have everything you want,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Her early career looked \"great on paper,\" she says: AlTai opened her own marketing agency in her late 20s, and says she was \"achieving all the milestones\" of success.At the same time, she was overworking herself to the point of illness, she says. One day, while driving to a client meeting, she got a call from her physician. \"My doctor called to say that if I don't go to the hospital now, instead of going to work, I'll be days away from multiple organ failure\" due to severe anemia, AlTai says.In hindsight, the moment was \"such a wake-up call,\" she says — but instead of heading straight for the hospital, AlTai first attended her client meeting.She says she was subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, both of which were exacerbated by exhaustion.\"My workaholic tendencies and painful relationship to success were — quite literally — killing me,\" AlTai, now 41, wrote in her recent book, \"The Ambition Trap: How to Stop Chasing and Start Living.\"Today, AlTai is a leadership coach who teaches her clients how to protect their wellbeing and practice healthy ambition. \"So many of us are working ourselves into pain and suffering,\" she says — but it doesn't have to be that way. Here's her advice for building a healthy mindset around ambition.'Painful' versus 'purposeful' ambitionThough AlTai's unhealthy relationship with ambition caused her to \"crash and burn,\" she says, it doesn't mean that being driven is inherently a bad thing.\"I think ambition is neutral and natural,\" she says. She defines it as \"simply a desire for more life, a wish to grow, a wish to unfold.\"In AlTai's view, people tend to experience ambition in two ways, she says: \"painful\" ambition and \"purposeful\" ambition.Painful ambition, which AlTai defines as \"the voracious desire to advance, regardless of the cost,\" stems from a feeling of \"not-enoughness,\" she writes in \"The Ambition Trap.\" From a psychological perspective, painful ambition is based in emotional \"core wounds\" like rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice, she says.\"If you build your ambition upon that, it's going to be a bit of a house of cards,\" AlTai says, \"because we're perpetually looking for the salve on the outside for the wound on the inside, and that never works.\"On the other hand, purposeful ambition \"comes from a place of wholeness,\" she says. People who practice purposeful ambition are driven by a desire to make a positive impact, AlTai says. They excel at collaborating with others, protect their needs and approach their mistakes with a growth mindset.Self-awareness is the key to turning painful ambition into purposeful ambition, according to AlTai. She encourages her clients to journal about their thought patterns without self-judgement, taking note when they fall into unhealthy mindsets.Habits for healthy ambitionIn order to stay in the zone of healthy ambition, one essential practice is \"honoring your energy,\" AlTai says. That means making time for the things that nourish you, from nutrition and exercise to spending time with loved ones.Without taking care of ourselves, \"it's really hard to show up fully,\" AlTai says. From a career standpoint, honoring your energy could mean designing your work week around the times you're most productive, taking walks in between meetings or blocking off certain times on your calendar to allow uninterrupted focus.Another important habit is to \"celebrate your wins,\" she says. As a leadership coach, AlTai noticed a pattern among many of her \"really ambitious\" clients: They were \"always moving the goalpost,\" she says.Instead of taking time to enjoy their successes, her clients immediately started working toward their next goal. That mindset makes it \"very tricky\" to feel satisfied with your accomplishments, according to AlTai.AlTai encourages taking time to rest after reaching a major milestone. \"In those quiet moments, you take inventory, you take stock, you see what worked, what you loved, what you didn't love, what you would do differently, and then you rise again,\" she says.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Living alone with a $2,000 housing budget may be nearly impossible in some major cities — but in others you may be able to afford up to three bedrooms.Across the U.S., the average rent for a studio apartment listed on Apartments.com in October was $1,699 a month, and a two-bedroom space had an average rent of $1,887 per month, according to data collected and analyzed by Apartments.com in a November report. Of the 25 most populous cities in the U.S., New York, Boston and California cities San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose were the most expensive. Average rent for a studio apartment in these cities was over $2,000 in October, according to data from Apartments.com shared with CNBC Make It.With $2,000, you could get an average of 267 square feet in New York City, or one-third the size of a pickleball court, according to a normalized estimate from October listings. Compare that with Oklahoma City, the most affordable of the most populous cities, where $2,000 is worth about 1,900 square feet — more than two pickleball courts. While this data offers a useful benchmark for comparison across cities, it isn't necessarily indicative of the size of any single apartment a renter is likely to encounter. In reality, apartment sizes and prices can differ within the same city due to various factors, and renters should keep that in mind, the authors of the report said.Here's where $2,000 in rent would get you the least space in the 25 most populous cities in America:New York, N.Y.: 267 square feetBoston, Mass.: 336 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.: 340 square feetSan Diego, Calif.: 458 square feetSan Jose, Calif.: 427 square feetHere's where $2,000 in rent would get you the most space in the 25 most populous cities in America: Oklahoma City, Okla.: 1,900 square feetEl Paso, Texas: 1,762 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.: 1,676 square feetColumbus, Ohio: 1,633 square feetSan Antonio, Texas: 1,517 square feetHere's how much space you could get for $2,000 a month in all 25 of the most populous U.S. cities as of October.New York, N.Y.Unit type: N/A Average size for $2,000: 267 square feetLos Angeles, Calif.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 530 square feetChicago, Ill.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 679 square feetHouston, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,443 square feetPhoenix, Ariz.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,230 square feetPhiladelphia, Pa.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 772 square feetSan Antonio, TexasUnit type: Three BedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,517 square feetSan Diego, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 458 square feetDallas, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,154 square feetJacksonville, Fla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,453 square feetFort Worth, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,305 square feetSan Jose, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 427 square feetAustin, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,186 square feetCharlotte, N.C.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,235 square feetColumbus, OhioUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,633 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,676 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 340 square feetSeattle, Wash.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 534 square feetDenver, Colo.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 852 square feetOklahoma City, Okla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,900 square feetNashville, Tenn.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 863 square feetWashington, D.C.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 512 square feetEl Paso, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,762 square feetLas Vegas, Nev.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,354 square feetBoston, Mass.",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, arrives to speak during a site expansion groundbreaking ceremony at the Boeing South Carolina (BSC) manufacturing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, US, on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025. Sean Rayford | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the U.S. was not at risk of entering a recession in 2026 and claimed Americans would soon benefit from the Trump administration's economic policies on trade and taxes. \"I am very, very optimistic on 2026,\" Bessent said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy.\" Parts of the GOP's massive spending package — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — are still going into effect and have yet to be felt in the economy, Bessent said. The new law makes permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, along with a senior \"bonus\" to offset Social Security taxes and a bigger state and local tax deduction. The plan also has tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans.Health-care costs are also expected to become more affordable, Bessent added. The secretary said the Trump administration would have more news on that subject this week. For now, a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace is expected to push up health-care costs for millions of people. Bessent acknowledged that there are parts of the economy showing signs of struggle, including housing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors. He cited the services economy as contributing to inflation, claiming that lower energy prices will soon help to drive down prices.Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, also said on Sunday that economic data from the fourth quarter could show weakness because of the government shutdown. The 43-day congressional stalemate in Washington, D.C., was the longest in U.S. history. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, a recent NBC News poll found. Americans' views of the economy largely depend on their income level, according to JPMorgan's latest Cost of Living Survey.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average, the bank found. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10. In contrast, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. ",

    "body": "Cambridge Dictionary named \"parasocial\" as Word of the Year for 2025.Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty ImagesAI chatbots, Taylor Swift, and social media influencers all played a part in deciding Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year, 2025: \"parasocial.\" Parasocial — revealed by the global dictionary on Tuesday as its word of the year — refers to the connection a person feels to an online personality ranging from celebrities to podcasters, and even artificial intelligence. \"Parasocial relationship is when we think we know someone, or we feel very close to someone who's in fact, a person we've never met, like a celebrity, an influencer, or somebody in public life who's famous for some reason,\" Simone Schnall, professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, told CNBC Make It. \"In reality, of course, it's only a one-sided, so-called relationship,\" she added. The term originated in 1956 when University of Chicago sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl found that people who watched television were treating the actors on-screen like friends or family. Schnall explained that the \"phenomenon\" is well-known in our culture, but it's only now that people are using the term more commonly. \"It's been there forever, but I think in our culture, we now see parasocials on steroids, simply because there are so many opportunities for it. There are so many people who, for whatever reason, we can be interested in and fascinated by, inspired by,\" she said. One example is singer and billionaire Taylor Swift who has an intense global fanbase due to her relatable songs. Many of her fan report having a deep, emotional connection with her and keep up with her personal life and romantic relationships. Other examples include social media influencer and Youtuber Logan Paul who has around 27 million followers on Instagram and 23 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2018, Paul posted a video showing a deceased person in Japan's Aokigahara \"suicide forest,\" sparking global outrage. Many of his die‑hard fans defended him, showing fierce loyalty despite the seriousness of the content. Paul later apologized for the video. Schnall warned there are \"dangers\" in following celebrities and social media influencers who might share incorrect medical advice, sell bad products, or promote unethical behaviour.  \"They [influencers] could do some serious harm to their followers. The people who feel they're in that parasocial relationship, they could really be harmed by that,\" Schnall warned. AI chatbots and loneliness culture Cambridge Dictionary referenced that part of the increasing popularity of the word \"parasocial\" stems from relationships being formed with AI chatbots. A 2025 report by Common Sense Media, which surveyed 1,060 U.S. teens, found that 72% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 had used an AI companion at least once. This was for a range of reasons from emotional or mental health support or as a friend or best friend. \"They're called chatbots because we feel like we're chatting with someone already,\" Schnall said. \"People can develop certain relationships, like a friendship or even romantic relationship, or at least, that's how they feel about it, when of course in reality, there is no one else involved.\" And it's not just teens. A recent survey by Vantage Point Counselling of over 1,000 American adults found that 28% said they have had a romantic or intimate relationship with an AI. Schnall offered two reasons why people are turning to parasocial relationships: a global loneliness epidemic and increased screentime. On phones and screens, parasocial relationships are \"just a click away\" so it's easier to get immediate social approval. Meanwhile, chatbots are designed to flatter you, per Schnall. \"People tend to be more lonely than in previous generations, and they spend so much time on their screens where these parasocial relationships are very easy to establish,\" she said.The antidote, Schnall said is investing in real-life relationships because the more time you spend online, the less time you spend pursuing in-person connections. \"The more time I spend chatting with a chatbot, the less time I probably spent chatting with a real life person,\" she added.

    "body": "It's natural to want to comfort a child when they're crying. When parents see their kid hurting physically or emotionally, they often want to do anything in their power to stop their heartache. As a dual certified child life specialist and therapist, I've heard parents and even health care workers telling kids \"don't cry\" while wiping away their tears during medical procedures and other difficult moments. It comes from a place of wanting to fix the hurt and make it all better. But it can make kids feel like their emotions and tears aren't okay, especially when they're in pain or distress. Instead, try to validate kids' feelings and help them feel safe and supported expressing their emotions and tears. Use these five alternatives:1. 'It's okay to cry, I'm here with you.'This helps kids know and believe that their experience is real and it's natural. Staying with kids through their stress conveys the message that their feelings don't scare you, that you can handle the difficult moments with them, and that they can rely on you for real-time support, even when it's hard or uncomfortable. 2. 'I see your tears.'You may not always know exactly why a child is crying or understand their reaction to the situation. Validation doesn't necessarily mean agreement; it means, \"I see you and I believe you.\" One way to validate their experience is to simply reflect back what you're seeing. Naming their emotion can be helpful for some kids, but for others it can be upsetting if your label doesn't match what they're truly feeling. Try naming their behaviors or using a more encompassing term such as \"upset.\"3. 'Your feelings make sense.'If kids hear, \"don't cry,\" they might interpret that their response doesn't match the situation, when in fact, it often does. We want kids to trust their feelings and to know that their tears make sense for what they're experiencing, whether it's pain, fear, or isolation. Sometimes the behaviors will be out of proportion with the situation, but the underlying feelings are never wrong. 4. 'It's natural to feel sad.'Parents often want their kids to feel happy, but it's natural to feel a range of emotions including difficult or uncomfortable ones. The goal is not to stop the emotion but to help kids acknowledge and manage it. Helping kids understand that crying is not bad — and that it's perfectly natural to feel sad, angry, lonely, or frustrated sometimes — reduces a sense of shame from any negative experiences. 5. 'Crying is one healthy way our bodies let feelings out.'Lastly, it's important for kids to understand that crying is a very healthy way to release emotions. Crying is coping and so is coloring, playing, talking, running, listening to music, and breathing. You can help kids try different strategies and find the ones that work best for them. Use tears as a chance to meet kids where they're at and help them work through challenges with confidence and connection. Kelsey Mora is a Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "Short of a cash windfall, saving for a down payment on a home can take years — and in some U.S. states, it may take decades.A new analysis from ConsumerAffairs estimates how long it would take to save a 10% down payment in every state by comparing each state's median household income with its median home price, along with median tax burdens and essential living costs.In Iowa, it would take about 8.7 years to save enough for a 10% down payment, the fastest of any state. In California, the estimate is 25.1 years — longer than any other state. Across all 50 states, the average timeline is 14.4 years, according to the study.These timelines rely on what the study calls \"fractional saving,\" which assumes a household sets aside 10% of its discretionary income each year. That approach was chosen because \"that's how people really save,\" Dayna Edens, media relations manager at ConsumerAffairs, tells CNBC Make It. \"Nobody's setting aside every spare penny for a down payment on a house they're not even shopping for yet.\"A 10% down payment was also chosen over the commonly recommended 20% as a more realistic target for first-time buyers, says Edens.Here's a look at the 10 states where it would take the least amount of time to save up a 10% down payment on a home, based on each state's median income, median home price and estimated household savings.1. IowaTime to save: 8.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,501Median home price: $247,4002. OhioTime to save: 9.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $72,212Median home price: $261,7003. TexasTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $79,721Median home price: $339,4004. MarylandTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $102,905Median home price: $439,3005. North DakotaTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $77,871Median home price: $298,2006. KansasTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,514Median home price: $292,6007. OklahomaTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $66,148Median home price: $252,9008. IllinoisTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $83,211Median home price: $303,3009. AlaskaTime to save: 10.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $95,665Median home price: $402,80010. IndianaTime to save: 11.0 yearsMedian annual household income: $71,959Median home price: $276,000The key factor in affordability is home price. All but one of these states have median home prices below the national median of $410,800, per U.S. Census data.In eight of the 10 states, median household income is roughly in line with the national median of $83,730, per U.S. Census data. The shorter timelines largely reflect lower home prices, not unusually high earnings.That pattern holds in many higher-income states as well. In places where median household income exceeds six figures, such as California and Hawaii, the timelines tend to run longer than in states with lower-cost homes. In those states, high living costs, especially housing, can offset the advantage of higher wages.Annual taxes and essential expenses also influence how much discretionary income households can save. Tax burdens vary by roughly $15,000 from state to state, and the annual cost of necessities ranges from the mid-$20,000s to the low-$40,000s, according to the study.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Daniel Gray and his husband, Douglas, and their dog.Courtesy: Daniel GrayOn Oct. 23, the day after Daniel Gray's 56th birthday, he received an email that made him feel like he was dreaming: The U.S. Department of Education would forgive his more than $170,000 student loan balance.\"I could not believe it,\" Gray said. \"This is the first time I've been without debt since I'm 18.\"Yet the relief should not have been so surprising. Gray began paying his student loan debt in the 1990s and was eligible for the loan cancellation under the terms of his income-driven repayment plan. IDR plans lead to loan erasure after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. But, like many borrowers, Gray was worried by reports that the relief was becoming harder to access under the Trump administration. \"Because of what's been going on, it was unclear whether they'd get forgiven,\" Gray said. Recently, many student loan borrowers have been left doubting if they'll get the loan cancellation to which they're entitled, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"When borrowers worry about whether the Trump administration will renege on the student loan forgiveness promised by the federal government, it places them under extreme financial and emotional stress,\" Kantrowitz said. The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment. Loan forgiveness becomes uncertain under Trump Earlier this year, the Education Department stopped forgiving the debt of borrowers in two long-standing student loan repayment plans, the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay As You Earn plan, or PAYE. It also temporarily paused debt forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. More than 12 million student loan borrowers are enrolled in one of the Education Department's IDR plans, according to Kantrowitz.  But then, in October, there was a major victory for borrowers: The Trump administration agreed to resume clearing people's debts under ICR and PAYE, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers. That same month, eligible borrowers enrolled in IBR also began to see their debts canceled again. The AFT contended that Trump officials were blocking borrowers from their rights mandated in their loan terms. \"We cannot say for sure, but it is possible that the AFT lawsuit prompted the discharge,\" said Weena Sanchez, a student loan counselor at the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, a nonprofit, about Gray's student loan forgiveness. EDCAP worked with Gray on his request for the relief. Gray had earned the loan cancellation by May 2024, according to his loan forgiveness statement. \"We've heard of other clients receiving similar notices,\" Sanchez said.

The Trump administration announced this week that it will transfer much of the Education Department's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency. Education Department officials are also exploring options to sell portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student portfolio to the private market, Politico reported in October.A lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain. Mark Kantrowitz higher education expert Whatever changes lie ahead, it's important for borrowers to remember that the original terms of their student loans, spelled out in their Master Promissory Note, cannot change in the middle of repayment, Kantrowitz said. When borrowers signed that agreement, any programs that were in existence at the time, including repayment plans that conclude in loan forgiveness, must remain available to them, by law.Since student loans can't be discharged in normal bankruptcy proceedings, like other types of debt, borrowers \"depend on there being a light at the end of the tunnel,\" with the government's forgiveness, Kantrowitz said.\"When a low-income student is forced to borrow to pay for college, a lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain,\" he said. Student loan forgiveness 'the only way out' For some 30 years, Gray says his student loan debt weighed on him. He graduated in the mid-1990s from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a degree in film studies and began working technical jobs in video and television production. But in the following years, he says, he grappled with substance abuse issues and clinical depression. As a result, his career took a hit, and Gray struggled to keep up with his monthly student loan payment, he said. Originally, he borrowed roughly around $30,000, but his balance steadily grew due to interest charges. \"This system is designed for students to graduate, get good jobs and start paying,\" Gray said. \"But what about for those of us who don't get our lives together until we are 37 or 38?\" By then, he said, his debt was already nearing six figures. By the time his debt was canceled by the government in October, his balance had spiraled to more than $170,000. \"I couldn't believe I had allowed it to get to this point; I felt incredibly guilty and ashamed,\" Gray said, but he also \"felt like the whole situation was engineered to take advantage of the borrower.\"  In 2011, Gray got a job offer at a television studio in Brazil. Frustrated with the cost of living in the U.S. and hoping for a major change, he made the move to São Paulo. He's lived in Brazil ever since. He met his now-husband, Douglas, a chef, there. The couple live close to the beach and take their dog for long walks every day.The biggest change Gray has felt since his student debt was wiped away is psychological: \"I suddenly feel like I can relax,\" he said. \"It's easy for people to say, 'Why don't people just pay them off? What's the big deal?\" Gray said, about his student loans. But he went on: \"It reached a point where it was beyond control. It seemed impossible. Student loan forgiveness is the only way out for a lot of people.\"",

However, the overall unemployment rate edged up to 4.4%, and for younger workers, ages 16 to 24, unemployment was 10.4% in September. The current job market \"is an enormous challenge for members of Gen Z who are just now entering the labor force,\" a report published this week by Oxford Economics says.

Although college graduates are still less likely to be unemployed than their non-degree counterparts, the advantage is smaller than it's been in decades. Job market worsens for recent gradsFor recent college graduates, the cracks are starting to show. Some large employers have said they're replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence in order to streamline operations and cut costs. Concerns about the economy, persistent inflation and a slowdown in consumer spending are also likely contributors to an erosion of entry-level opportunities, other research shows.Although members of the Class of 2025 submitted more job applications than did their 2024 counterparts — 10 and six, respectively — they received fewer job offers on average than did the previous class, with mean numbers of .78 and .83, respectively, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found. NACE's study, conducted April 1-May 30, 2025, surveyed 1,479 graduating seniors.According to a report by education technology company Cengage Group, in its  survey conducted in June and July 2025 only 30% of 2025 graduates said they had secured a full-time job in their field and only 41% of the Class of 2024 said they had done so. The survey included 971 recent graduates across the U.S.\"These workers are a vital part of the labor market, and if they're having a hard time, that means the economy could be having a hard time,\" said Indeed's Stahle.The market for 2026 graduates could be as bad or worse. Employers are less optimistic about the overall job market for upcoming grads than they were in the last several years, according to a separate report by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. About half, or 51%, of employers rated the job market for this year's college seniors as poor or fair, the highest share since 2020-21.'A long-term scarring impact'A weak labor market can have a negative effect on younger workers' economic well-being over time, particularly in terms of wage growth and earning potential, according to Oxford's report.\"Unemployment is rising and wage growth is declining for young adults, which could have a long-term scarring impact,\" said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics and author of the report. \"If these workers have a hard time getting into jobs now ... that also impacts their earning capabilities,\" Stahle said. \"You start to add these things together and it really can lead to further widening in income inequality.\" \"There are big economic implications down the road,\" he said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at Microsoft Build AI Day in Jakarta, Indonesia, on April 30, 2024.Adek Berry | AFP | Getty ImagesOn Microsoft's earnings call last month, CEO Satya Nadella boasted about the company's artificial intelligence products, and said over 150 million people are using its Copilot assistant for productivity, cybersecurity, coding and other endeavors.But conversations with IT buyers at Microsoft's Ignite conference in San Francisco this week highlighted some of the hurdles the company must overcome as it tries to sell its AI chatbot in the enterprise market.\"I know a lot of customers who are like, 'Yeah, I want 300 to go to zero,'\" said Adam Mansfield of consulting firm UpperEdge, referring to Copilot licenses. Mansfield, who helps companies negotiate Microsoft deals, said those clients are saying, \"I don't even want it.\"Microsoft started selling the commercial version of 365 Copilot two years ago for $30 per person per month, as an add-on to its broader productivity suite. The chatbot can answer a user's questions based on information stored in corporate systems and can run alongside Microsoft apps, summarizing email threads, creating formatted presentations and capturing key points from calls.Microsoft is competing in AI on multiple fronts, with its heftiest investment coming out of its Azure cloud infrastructure business. Alongside a $13 billion bet on OpenAI, Microsoft is the AI startup's key cloud provider. In October OpenAI announced a $250 billion commitment. Microsoft said revenue growth at Azure reached 40% in the latest quarter, topping the growth rate at Amazon Web Services and Google's cloud business. AI agents present a different challenge. Instead of paying for the infrastructure needed to run hefty workloads, customers are buying a new tool for their employees, and the return on that investment isn't yet clear, according to a number of clients and consultants interviewed by CNBC.  watch nowAdobe, Google, Salesforce, Workday and other vendors are also trying to sell agents to corporations, schools and governments, creating a crowded market for a still nascent technology. OpenAI and Anthropic not only have popular AI models but are increasingly catering to businesses with new services as well.Eon, a Sequoia-backed cloud backup startup, runs its software in Azure. CEO Ofir Ehrlich said Microsoft has broadened Azure's appeal for software developers and operations specialists. But the company isn't standardizing on Microsoft's AI software. It relies on AI coding tools from startups Cognition and Cursor and multiple AI assistants, said Ehrlich, who previously sold startup CloudEndure to Amazon.Google's Gemini has been making rapid advancements in the market. This week, the company debuted its latest model, Gemini 3, which it says will deliver better answers to more complex questions.\"We just had a massive 16,000-employee company move all their mail back to Google so they can leverage more Gemini,\" said Julian Hamood, founder of Microsoft partner TrustedTech.Microsoft declined to comment. More discounts?Hamood said one thing Microsoft could do is provide incentives to help companies and partners pay for data-cleaning projects that would make Copilot more valuable. Microsoft has offered some clients 50% off of the $30 list price for Copilot, he said. \"But they're starting to lean away from the Copilot discounts,\" Hamood said.Tim Crawford, a former IT executive who now advises chief information officers, said many customers aren't getting enough from Copilot to justify the cost. \"Am I getting $30 of value per user per month out of it?\" he said. \"The short answer is no, and that's what's been holding further adoption back.\"Starting in December, a Microsoft 365 Copilot Business tier will become available at $21 per person per month for organizations with up to 300 end users, the company announced at Ignite this week.It's not all doom and gloom for Copilot, as Microsoft still has an advantage with its expansive user base.Nadella said on the latest earnings call that \"more than 90% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot,\" though he didn't provide an average number of users at those companies. He named five companies and a U.K. government department that each bought over 15,000 seats in the quarter, adding that most enterprise clients continued to come back for more.Land O'Lakes butter is displayed in a supermarket in New York on Feb. 15, 2017.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThis year, butter maker Land O'Lakes rolled out Microsoft 365 Copilot to all of its nearly 5,000 knowledge workers, after initially granting access to about 20% of them. A small number of employees also have Gemini subscriptions.Land O'Lakes has long relied on Microsoft software and now runs over 70% of its infrastructure in Azure, said Teddy Bekele, the company's technology chief, in an interview at Ignite.Software engineers at Land O'Lakes used the GitHub Copilot AI automated programming software to build custom project and portfolio management software, Bekele said, adding that the company stopped paying for an off-the-shelf product.Now Land O'Lakes is testing Oz, an assistant for retail agronomists who advise farmers. The company developed it with Microsoft Foundry software. Oz can save Land O'Lakes money as it replaces older applications, Bekele said.'Natural choice'Education publisher Pearson, meanwhile, has turned on Microsoft 365 Copilot for all of its 18,000 employees. The company uses Windows, Office and Azure products, as well as Amazon and Google cloud services, technology chief Dave Treat said at the conference. At Ignite, Pearson announced Communication Coach, an agent that will provide personalized learning recommendations through Copilot based on Teams calls, with help from OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model. \"Microsoft is dominant in the enterprise,\" Treat said. \"It was a natural choice if we're thinking about how to train people in communication in the workplace.\"Microsoft is also adding more models into the fold. On Tuesday, Microsoft said Anthropic is bringing its Claude Haiku 4.5, Opus 4.1 and Sonnet 4.5 to Microsoft Foundry. Anthropic committed to spend $30 billion on Azure.\"Before today, we didn't have access to all the models from Anthropic,\" Treat said. \"Now we do. That's a big improvement.\"Still, Mansfield said competition has intensified this year, and some companies have been more seriously evaluating alternatives to Microsoft's AI products.\"Microsoft is trying to catch up, quite honestly,\" Mansfield said. \"That's not what a monopoly typically has to do. They're not comfortable. Their sales reps actually now have to learn to sell.\"According to Microsoft, the technology is getting more traction internally. Around 70% of commercial sales, support and partner services workers now use Microsoft 365 Copilot daily, up from 20% a year ago, said Pam Maynard, the company's chief AI transformation officer. \"We've got the 30% daily active usage to get after,\" Maynard said in an interview. \"I do believe we'll get there, and it's just part of change management and helping people to develop that habit.\"WATCH: Microsoft CEO of commercial business on Anthropic, Nvidia partnershipwatch now",

    "body": "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo star in Universal's \"Wicked: For Good.\"UniversalUniversal's \"Wicked: For Good\" defied gravity at the box office, snaring an estimated $150 million from domestic ticket sales.It marks the second-highest opening weekend for a film released in 2025, just behind Warner Bros.' \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which tallied $163 million back in April. It also outpaces the debut of last year's \"Wicked,\" which tallied $112.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.The film's haul sets the record for the biggest opening weekend of a Broadway adaptation. With additional ticket sales from international markets, \"Wicked: For Good\" is set to reach a $226 million global haul for its first three days in theaters.An estimated 10 million tickets were sold for \"Wicked: For Good\" during opening weekend, topping the 8 million sold during the opening of \"Wicked\" last year, according to data from EntTelligence. The box office data company also reported that 30% of domestic screenings were in premium large format theaters, up from 18% for \"Wicked.\" These tickets are more expensive than general admission and can help bolster blockbuster releases. EntTelligence noted that general tickets for \"Wicked: For Good\" averaged at around $15.25 each while tickets for premium screens averaged at $18.75 a piece.\"Team Universal did a fantastic job of following perfectly on the success of the original film a year ago and have parlayed that into an even bigger debut for this second installment,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Wicked: For Good' will look forward to incredibly strong playability throughout Thanksgiving week and beyond during the all-important holiday movie-going season.\"Last year, the combination of \"Wicked,\" Paramount's \"Gladiator II\" and Disney's \"Moana 2\" helped boost the Thanksgiving holiday box office to its highest haul ever. This year, \"Wicked: For Good\" is joined by Disney's \"Zootopia 2.\"The first \"Zootopia\" opened in 2016 to $75 million domestically but went on to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. Pent-up audience demand could push the film's three-day opening to around $100 million and the five-day Thanksgiving period to north of $125 million. \"The impressive expected over-performance by 'Wicked: For Good,' in combination with the other films in the marketplace, could give last year's record Thanksgiving literally a run for its money,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This is great news after all the negative stories about the challenging October box office drove the narrative.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Victoria Beckham, formerly Posh Spice of the Spice Girls, is known for her healthy habits and discipline when it comes to wellness.Since entering the spotlight three decades ago, the fashion designer's daily practices for peak health have evolved. While her diet remains consistent—fresh fish, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—her exercise routine and priorities have shifted now that she is in her 50s.Here are four ways Beckham's wellness routine has changed from the early 2000's to now.4 ways Victoria Beckham's wellness routine has changed1. She's more flexible with her diet\"I do try to be quite disciplined in the way that I eat,\" Beckham said on the BBC Radio program \"Gordon Ramsay's Perfect Christmas Lunch\" in 2006 at age 32.At the time, she prioritized a \"really healthy\" diet of fish, vegetables and fruit — and still does, she said. But these days Beckham is less rigid.\"I'm flexible with regards to food,\" Beckham told Net-a-Porter in 2020. \"My treat is a few glasses of red wine, and I also love tequila, and I do eat carbs. I have lots of avocado and really good fats, like salmon.\"2. She added weight training to her workoutsOver a decade ago, Beckham set a new year's resolution to start going to the gym, she told The Guardian in 2014. \"I've never stopped. Once I get into something, I do it properly,\" she said.Back then, she would exercise for 90 minutes with a trainer, attend SoulCycle classes and run often, sometimes for eight miles. By 2023, her workout routine looked much different.\"I usually workout every morning prior to beginning my day and recently incorporated strength training into my routine which has been a fun way to switch up my regime,\" Beckham said in an interview with Harper's Bazaar.The following year, she shared that weight training at 50 made her feel \"stronger than I did when I was 20.\"3. Sleep is key for her self care nowIn 2013, Beckham's three sons were still in school and her daughter was just one. Beckham started her days between 6:15 and 6:30 a.m., and would fall asleep sometime between midnight and 1 a.m., she told Harper's Bazaar that year.At the time, she was getting between five and six hours of sleep a night. \"I like to get as much sleep as I can. But when you're a mummy, you kind of—well, it would be nice,\" Beckham said.Ten years later, she told the publication that her best advice for self care was developing a healthy sleep routine.\"Creating healthy sleep habits is incredibly important; it's become a key part of my self-care practice,\" she said.\"I've been working on incorporating less screen time and more mindfulness into my routine, which means putting my phone away before bedtime.\"4. Wellness shots and green smoothies are a staple in her routineBeckham also gets plenty of nutrients and vitamins from her daily beverages.Earlier this year, Vogue covered Beckham's morning routine based on stories shared to her personal Instagram account. The first thing she consumes every morning is apple cider vinegar, \"a couple of tablespoons on an empty tummy,\" she said.Then, she and her husband David Beckham have their green smoothies which include:BroccoliSpinachCucumberCeleryAvocadoAppleGingerLemonAfter a workout, Beckham has another smoothie with berries, bananas, apples and almonds. She rounds out her morning with a wellness shot of lemon, black pepper, fresh ginger and turmeric. \"One shot a day!!\" she said.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "President Donald Trump offered praise for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday after the two men met for the first time at the White House to discuss the growing issue of affordability.While the Republican president and the Democratic mayor-elect have hurled searing attacks at each other in the recent past, they repeatedly shrugged off those words while appearing side by side in the Oval Office. At one point, when Mamdani was asked for the second time about having called Trump a \"fascist,\" the president gave him cover.\"That's OK, you can just say yes,\" Trump said after Mamdani began to respond. \"It's easier than explaining it.\"Trump also appeared to backtrack on his prior threat to withhold federal funding for New York City if Mamdani became its mayor. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Trump said.Instead of rehashing their feud, they talked up their areas of agreement on broad issues, especially focusing on lowering the cost of living.But they also found common ground on some more specific matters, such as getting NYC-based energy giant Con Edison to lower prices. \"We've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison, and we're going to have to talk to them ... to start lowering the rates,\" Trump said. \"Absolutely,\" Mamdani added.U.S. President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media as they meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 21, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersTrump gave more praise than Mamdani returned, but the two did trade some compliments.\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" Trump said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"\"I appreciated the meeting with the president,\" said Mamdani, who stood while Trump sat at the Resolute Desk. \"And as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.\"The conciliatory tone was brand new. Mamdani had laced into the president on the campaign trail and in his electoral victory speech, saying, \"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.\"And just two days earlier, Trump had called Mamdani the \"Communist Mayor of New York City.\" The mayor-elect is a self-described democratic socialist who denies being a communist.The Oval Office meeting was requested by Mamdani, the 34-year-old whose stunning triumph in the mayoral race over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has put him at the center of American politics.\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight-and-a-half million people who call the city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.Mamdani and other Democrats who won a bevy of elections this month had focused relentlessly on affordability — a word that Trump has chafed at, while insisting that prices are broadly down already.Meanwhile, the president's approval ratings have fallen precipitously in numerous polls, with respondents consistently pointing to the high cost of living as a main concern.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.     ",

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) salutes former U.S. President Donald Trump during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, U.S. March 26, 2022. Alyssa Pointer | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, \"Marjorie went BAD.\"Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a \"traitor,\" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' \" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.\"Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,\" Trump said.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he wrote.\"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.\"Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, \"It's not going to be easy\" for her to have a future in Republican politics.\"I would like to see it,\" Trump told NBC.\"She's got to take a little rest,\" he said.\"I can patch up differences with anyone,\" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.Trump last week said he would support \"the right person\" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\"  Greene said.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.\"\"Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"",

    "body": "An operator for Baker Hughes conducts a wireline survey on a Chesapeake Energy natural gas rig in the North Texas Barnett Shale near Burleson, Texas.Matt Nager | Getty ImagesCompany: Baker Hughes (BKR)Business: Baker Hughes is an energy technology company with a portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. The company operates in two segments: oilfield services and equipment and industrial and energy technology. The OFSE segment provides products and services for onshore and offshore oilfield operations across the lifecycle of a well, ranging from exploration, appraisal, and development, to production, rejuvenation, and decommissioning. OFSE is organized into four product lines: well construction; completions, intervention and seasurements; production solutions and subsea and surface pressure systems. The IET segment provides technology solutions and services for mechanical-drive, compression and power-generation applications across the energy industry, including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas operations, downstream refining and petrochemical markets, as well as lower carbon solutions to broader energy and industrial sectors.Stock Market Value: $47.84 billion ($48.48 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to resort to a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital announced that they have taken a position in Baker Hughes and are calling on the company to spin out its oilfield services and equipment business, arguing such a step could help push up the stock price by at least 60%.Behind the scenesBaker Hughes is a leading provider of energy and industrial technology services. The company was formed through the 2017 merger of legacy Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas, combining best-in-class intellectual property shared by GE spinoff assets and the technical expertise from both organizations. The company operates through two primary segments: industrial and energy technologies and oilfield services and Equipment. The IET unit (55% of projected 2025 revenue and 60% of projected 2025 EBITDA) is a long-cycle industrial and energy business focused on gas technology equipment, including turbines and compressors, and aftermarket services, including new energy applications. The OFSE unit (45%/40%) is a short-cycle oilfield equipment and production services business with an end-to-end portfolio of oilfield services and equipment for well construction and production.Management has built up a strong track record of effective execution, and that success has been reflected in the share price, with the company delivering strong returns of 28.26%, 75.29% and 232.98% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively. Within IET, the company has taken advantage of its leading position in LNG, in which Baker now has 95% global footprint for the turbomachinery required in plant construction, a market that is expected to grow at a 10% compound annual growth rate through 2030. Additionally, the company has a strong position in power generation, as Baker is one of few original equipment manufacturers supplying smaller-scale turbines and complete behind-the-meter power solutions. These offerings have allowed the company to play a pivotal role in helping to address rapidly growing data center demand, as its data center orders have gone from $0 to $550 million in just two quarters. As such, management is heavily investing in this opportunity — developing larger-scale power systems to support mega-data center deployments. Furthermore, Baker's pending acquisition of Chart Industries is expected to further strengthen IET's position in power, LNG, and industrials. As a result, IET is approaching a 20% EBITDA margin, with further margin expansion expected as the business mix continues to shift toward aftermarket services, which generate long-term recurring revenue streams supported by contracts exceeding 10 years and margins of 35% or more. For OFSE, management has taken steps to meaningfully improve the segment's earnings mix and reduce its cyclical commodity exposure. This includes exiting or downsizing non-core ventures and low-margin product lines, such as its surface pressure control joint venture with Cactus; prioritizing the Middle East and international markets (now 75% of OFSE revenue), which are less correlated to commodity prices; and implementing strong pricing discipline and cost cutting measures by enforcing minimum margin thresholds on new contracts, consolidating product lines and simplifying reporting. However, despite these efforts, OFSE remains highly subject to commodity volatility, affecting both the segment's performance and the company's overall valuation. Currently valued at about 9x EBITDA, Baker trades more closely with oilfield services peers (6–7x EBITDA), than its industrial and energy technology peers (16–18x), despite IET being the majority of the company's revenue and EBITDA. An implied sum-of-the-parts multiple for Baker would put the company at approximately 13x. It is for this reason that Ananym has launched a campaign at Baker calling for the company to either continue growing IET relative to OFSE or to pursue a sale or spin of OFSE. Ananym believes that a potential separation could result in an about 51% immediate upside through realizing Baker's sum of parts valuation, even when assuming $100 million dis-synergies from separation. Moreover, this upside does not reflect much of the potential long-term growth tailwinds and margin expansion expected from these ongoing operational initiatives — value drivers that shareholders should also be better positioned to realize through such a move.Founded in September 2024, this is Ananym's third public activist campaign. Knowing Charlie Penner and Alex Silver as we do, we would expect them to strive to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders. As such, they have already expressed full confidence in management to choose the optimal path forward, and the company's strong operational track record fully supports that confidence. Moreover, on Oct. 6, the company announced a review of its capital allocation, business, cost structure, and operations. With all signs pointing towards alignment between the two parties, we do not expect that they will insist on, or even ask for, board representation or continue to engage in much more of a public campaign. Rather, we expect them to work amicably with Baker behind the scenes to unlock meaningful shareholder value. However, this cooperative approach should not be confused for weakness, as they are fiduciaries to their own investors and will do whatever is necessary to create value at their portfolio companies. Thus, should management fail to act decisively, Ananym could quickly shift to a more assertive stance.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

For now, however, Nvidia's solid earnings last week seemed to undermine the idea that everything tied to AI investment is in a bubble.Investors looking to capitalize on the recent selloff and pick up some attractive stocks for the long term can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. These experts can help provide key insights into a company's growth potential.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.MicrosoftWindows and Xbox owner Microsoft (MSFT) is viewed as one of the major beneficiaries of the AI boom. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in its fiscal first quarter, with revenue from the Azure cloud business growing by 40%.Recently, Baird analyst William Power initiated coverage on Microsoft with a buy rating and a price target of $600. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also optimistic on MSFT, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $628.\"Microsoft is leading the AI revolution with infrastructure and applications, aided by its OpenAI relationship, providing an end-to-end AI platform for enterprises and consumers alike,\" said Power, explaining his optimism.Power sees MSFT's partnership with ChatGPT parent OpenAI as a key differentiator, helping it run AI at scale and speed. The 5-star analyst said that after a commitment to invest $13 billion, Microsoft recently announced an incremental $250 billion Azure investment over several years.The analyst discussed the impressive growth in MSFT's total revenue and Azure business in the September quarter, with the cloud business now constituting 60% of the overall top line. Power also highlighted the strength in Microsoft's core applications, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics. He noted that MSFT's revenue growth in Q1 FY26 was accompanied by a solid operating margin of 49% and free cash flow margin of 33%. Microsoft's strong margins are ensuring continued double-digit EPS growth, he said.Power believes in Microsoft's near- and long-term potential, despite any immediate pressure stemming from AI capital spending concerns.Power ranks No. 287 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 17%. See Microsoft Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Booking HoldingsOnline travel agent (OTA) Booking Holdings (BKNG) is another pick this week. The Priceline and Kayak owner posted impressive third-quarter results, with double-digit gains in gross bookings and revenue.Impressed by the Q3 performance and attractive valuation, Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt upgraded BKNG to buy from hold with a price targe of $6,000. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on Booking Holdings with a price target of $5,406.\"Booking remains the best-positioned OTA in our view,\" benefiting from several positives, from the company's scale and diversification to solid liquidity to free cash flow conversion, Devitt said.The top-rated analyst also noted management's impressive history of successfully executing major strategic initiatives. Devitt highlighted Booking Holdings' widening market share in alternative lodging while optimizing costs and driving efficiencies. The company's cost savings are supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives to achieve longer-term targets, he said.Additionally, Devitt discussed Booking's impressive growth across key metrics in the third quarter amid better-than-anticipated global travel demand. Third-quarter gross bookings growth of 14% surpassed management's guidance by 400 basis points, the analyst said. ASs a result, Devitt raised his 2025 gross bookings growth estimate by 100 basis points from his prior forecast, to 11.5%. Further, he expects BKNG to report adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year margin expansion of about 180 basis points.Devitt ranks No. 660 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 50% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.3%. See Booking Holdings Financials on TipRanks. DoorDashDevitt also upgraded his rating for food delivery platform DoorDash (DASH) to buy from hold with a price target of $260. TipRanks' AI Analyst rates DoorDash \"neutral\" with a price target of $211. DASH shares took a hit when the company announced mixed third-quarter results and said it expects to spend \"several hundred million dollars\" on new initiatives and development in 2026.Devitt believes that the pullback in DASH shares presents an attractive risk/reward opportunity, with the stock now trading at about 17.7x his 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate. The Wedbush analyst noted that the post earnings selloff was mainly due to concerns about the level of capital spending and pressured profit margins.Devitt admits that the higher level of spending will hurt near-term margins, but argues such investments in growth initiatives are warranted given that they'll expand DASH's addressable market and bolster its product offerings.Specifically, Devitt highlighted management's plans to direct incremental investments toward three key areas: \"(1) creating a cohesive global tech platform, (2) building new verticals and products, and (3) scaling geographic expansion.\"Overall, Devitt is bullish on DoorDash, believing it has held a dominant position in the U.S. food delivery sector. Moreover, he noted the company's solid execution across strategic initiatives as management pushes for long-term sustainable growth. See DoorDash Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. ",

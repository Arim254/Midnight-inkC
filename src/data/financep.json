    "body": "Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said Monday he will summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark for a conversation about President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland.\"I'm deeply upset about the appointment and the statement, which I find completely unacceptable,\" Løkke Rasmussen told Danish media TV2 in an interview Monday morning. He added he hoped a meeting could take place today or tomorrow.Since starting his second term as president, Trump has repeatedly said that the U.S. needs the resource-rich Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, for security reasons. He has refused to rule out the use of force.Meanwhile, Greenland has shown little interest in becoming a top mining nation, and its leaders have criticized the U.S. administration's calls for the country to become a U.S. territory.Late Sunday, Trump posted on social media that he had appointed Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry, as the U.S. Special Envoy to Greenland.\"Jeff understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World,\" the president wrote.Read moreThe Danish foreign ministry declined to comment further and referred to Løkke Rasmussen's TV2 interview.In an Instagram post translated by CNBC, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: \"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and the U.S. should not take over Greenland.\"\"No one should be allowed to change national borders by force. Neither politically nor militarily,\" Frederiksen wrote Monday, adding that she expected respect for the territorial integrity of Denmark.",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, Nov. 24, 2025. Tom Little | ReutersThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday approved the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity from Wegovy maker Novo Nordisk, a landmark decision that health experts say could open up treatment access to more patients. Novo Nordisk said it expects to launch the pill in early 2026. The Danish drugmaker said starting in early January, the starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month. That's the same price that cash-paying patients can access the starting dose of the pill on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Trump's site also launches in January. Novo Nordisk did not say how much higher doses of the drug would cost, but said additional information on coverage and savings options for eligible patients will be available at that time as well.Shares of Novo Nordisk gained roughly 10% in extended trading Monday. The FDA's approval also clears the pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease, according to Novo Nordisk. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite. \"What we've learned through years of research is that having an oral option really kind of opens up, activates and motivates different segments to seek treatment,\" Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's executive vice president of U.S. operations, told CNBC ahead of the approval. \"To have that conversation with their doctor to see if this is something that might be right for them.\"\"That's what we're excited about — to be able to give people an option and make sure we have access and ease of access like we have been doing with our injections,\" he continued. He added that patients will have the \"comfort and familiarity\" on the safety and efficacy side since the pill contains the same active ingredient as Wegovy. Some health experts said pills could reach people who are afraid of needles or patients who might benefit from the existing injections but don't take them because they don't view their need as severe enough. It's unclear exactly how many people are using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity in particular. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.The approval gives Novo Nordisk a head start over its chief rival Eli Lilly, which is currently the dominant player in the market and is racing to launch its own obesity pill. Pills are the next battleground for the two drugmakers, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s.Wall Street thinks there's plenty of room for pills in the market, with Goldman Sachs analyst saying in August that pills could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.In a note Monday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said the approval of Novo Nordisk's pill gives the company a \"much-needed win in light of recent challenges maintaining incretin market share dominance.\" Incretins refer to treatments that mimic gut hormones such as GLP-1. Eli Lilly earlier this year gained the majority share of the market thanks to its blockbuster obesity injection Zepbound, which has shown to be more effective than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy. \"Novo will likely benefit from first-mover advantage, capturing patients with a preference for convenience and comfort provided by an oral dosing regimen,\" Seigerman said. But he also noted that the market is \"rapidly evolving with competitive assets in development\" and an approval for Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, \"just around the corner.\"What to know about the Wegovy pill The approval is based on a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity but not diabetes.In that study, a 25-milligram dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks, according to results from the trial presented at a medical conference in 2024. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than an experimental oral drug from Eli Lilly, which is still waiting for FDA approval.But unlike Novo Nordisk's pill, Eli Lilly's treatment is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.But Moore said several existing medicines have the same dietary requirements, so \"we don't see it as something that impacts adherence to treatment.\" He noted that Novo Nordisk's research has found that it helps patients to remember to take their medicine in the morning with a few sips of water.\"It's actually a reinforcement factor for patients,\" Moore said. He added that the prices of the pill get costs closer to what some people are paying for unapproved, compounded versions of branded GLP-1s, some of which are still being illegally mass-marketed and sold in the U.S.Patients flocked to the cheaper copycats when Ozempic and Wegovy were in short supply over the last two years due to skyrocketing demand, or if they didn't have insurance coverage for the costly treatments. During FDA-declared shortages, pharmacists can legally make compounded versions of brand-name medications. But the agency earlier this year determined that the shortage of semaglutide is over, barring the practice in many cases.\"It continues to be alarming and disturbing for us,\" Moore told CNBC, referring to illegitimate ingredients that are imported into the U.S. illegally and used by some compounding pharmacies to create copycat versions of branded GLP-1s.In terms of manufacturing, Moore said the company is \"prepared to be able to satisfy a big demand here in the U.S., and we're pretty excited about it.\" Novo Nordisk said manufacturing is underway at its North Carolina facilities.",

    "body": "A guest poses for a photograph during the Jellycat Road Trip to Joy at Nordstrom Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.Jeff Schear / Stringer/ Getty ImagesChristmas is just around the corner and if you're a stuck on what to gift your Gen Z family members, a cuddly plush toy might be the answer this year.  2025 has proved that toys are not just for kids, as more young adults show off extensive collections of plushies. Experts say it signals a longing for community and a return to childhood. The popularity has been driven by a manic craze for Labubu dolls — collectible toys produced by Chinese toy company Pop Mart — as well as for soft toys, also known as \"Jellies,\" designed by British brand Jellycat. Brightly coloured stuffed animals and wide-eyed dolls can be seen lined up on walls or falling out of overstuffed shelves, in videos posted by Gen Z on TikTok.The platform — which has become a barometer for Gen Z trends — is currently home to millions of videos showing young adults obsessed with plushies. Videos range from building a \"Labubu wall,\" to hacks on finding authentic Labubus, or a five-rack shelf dedicated to displaying Jellies.\"It's the biggest year we've ever seen of adults buying toys,\" Melissa Symonds, U.K. toys director at global consumer insights firm Circana, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\"Adults of all ages do buy into toys, but it's primarily the younger, the Gen Z people, that are really driving this strong growth that we've had in the last few years,\" Symonds said. Labubu dolls are on display at a Pop Mart store in Shanghai, China.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesIn fact, a recent Circana report found that 43% of U.K. adults bought a toy for themselves or another adult this year, and that rises to 76% for Gen Z shoppers between the ages of 18 to 34-years-old.Across toy genres, plushies are the fourth most popular category for adults, with games and puzzles ranking top, following by building sets like LEGO, and action figures coming in at third place, according to data from Circanca shared with CNBC.It's a similar story across the pond, with sales of licenced toys increasing by 18% for U.S. adults over the age of 18 in the first half of the year, per Circana. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when  you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life.\"Melissa Symonds Executive director of toys at CircanaSymonds explained that businesses are tapping into what's called the \"joy economy\" in which consumers seek out comfort and nostalgia in products and experiences, especially when faced with economic or political pressures. \"The economy, the wars, everything is really depressing and serious, whereas toys just bring a little bit of joy back into life,\" Symonds said.  Pop Mart and Jellycat have benefitted from that trend. Pop Mart posted a near 400% surge in net profit in the first half of the year, and its revenue jumped 204.4% year on year to 13.88 billion yuan ($1.93 billion). In 2024, roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, Pop Mart previously told CNBC Make It. Meanwhile, Jellycat saw its revenue rise 66% to £333 million in 2024, up from £200 million in 2023. Its profit before tax more than doubled to £139 million, up from £67 million the prior year. \"Seeing the response across multiple generations to our new characters has been wonderful,\" Jellycat's CEO Arnaud Meysselle said in a statement to CNBC. \"It's been amazing to meet so many adults discovering Jellycat for the first time at our recent experience launches in Beijing, Seoul, and Los Angeles — and to welcome many others into our online communities,\" Meysselle said. 'Peter Pan effect' Guests attend the Jellycat X Selfridges Amuseables Bag launch in London, England.Dave Benett | Dave Benett Collection | Getty ImagesFans of Jellycat, Labubu, and plushies in general span from corporate workers to military personnel who tout the benefits the toys have on their mental health on TikTok, as they grapple with increasingly stressful adult lives. Circana's Symonds said that this is a symptom of the \"Peter Pan effect\" which refers to a psychological syndrome where adults struggle to grow up and take on responsibilities. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life,\" she said. \"There's a bit of that Peter Pan effect where they [Gen Z consumers] don't want to grow up, but I think it's just holding on to that joy element that brings them happiness.\" Gen Z adults have had it fairly rough as a generation as many say they were priced out of the adulthood they were promised. Economic and geopolitical turmoil has disrupted their lives, footage of war replays on their social media feeds everyday, and the cost of living continues to skyrocket. Some of the conflicts they've seen through their adult lives include the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to the Israel-Hamas war. And to top it all off, rising inflation means their buying power decreases every day with economic milestones like buying a house or starting a family feeling out of reach. Many Gen Z are instead \"doom spending\" to fill the gap. This refers to a phenomenon where people splash out on small luxuries like travel, designer goods, or even expensive toys because they know they might never be able to afford bigger milestones like owning a home or even children. Delaying parenthood also means Gen Z have more disposable income to spend on small luxuries. \"I think some of it might be because they're [Gen Z] choosing to have kids slightly older, so they've got a slightly longer period of time where they have money coming in, but don't necessarily have to spend it on schools or lunch boxes, so they're choosing to spend it on themselves to bring themselves some happiness,\" Symonds said.'Part of the community' Alongside economic woes, Gen Z have also struggled with loneliness and for some, buying and collecting toys can help them feel like they're part of a community. Some 85% of British Gen Z reported experiencing feelings of loneliness, according to a Hinge survey that polled 2,000 Gen Z adults in the U.K. in March. More than half of low-income young adults experienced severe loneliness, according to the research. Jellycat's Meysselle explained that the brand has looked to create a community for its fans from launching Instagram and TikTok accounts in 2022, both of which have racked up over two million followers since. Jellycat Fish & Chips Experience at Selfridges, London.Tim CharlesIts also invested in themed pop-up experiences that fans can visit in person from Jellycat Fish & Chips in Selfridges in London, to Jellycat Patisserie in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, and Jellycat Diner in FAO Schwarz in New York. Around 80% of fans that turned up to Jellycat's Space Experience in Seoul that was launched in November, were in their 20s and 30s — the largest percentage of adults at a Jellycat experience so far. Selfridges' toy buyer Joe Evans told CNBC Make It that Jellycat is its fastest selling toy brand and in the past two years there's been \"a meteoric rise\" in Gen Z and millennial customers who want to \"feel like they're part of a community and collect,\" toys. \"When you purchase a Jellycat, you feel like you're part of a community, you feel like you're part of something, there are a lot of groups online that talk, and people race each other for the best and the newest product,\" he added.

In a release at the time, Intersect said its strategic partnership with Google and TPG Rise Climate aimed to develop gigawatts of data center capacity across the U.S., including a $20 billion investment in renewable power infrastructure by the end of the decade.Alphabet said Monday that Intersect will work closely with Google's technical infrastructure team, including on the companies' co-located power site and data center in Haskell County, Texas. Google previously announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, which includes new data center campuses in the state's Haskell and Armstrong counties.Intersect's operating and in-development assets in California and its existing operating assets in Texas are not part of the acquisition, Alphabet said. Intersect's existing investors including TPG Rise Climate, Climate Adaptive Infrastructure and Greenbelt Capital Partners will support those assets, and they will continue to operate as an independent company.Alphabet's acquisition of Intersect is expected to close in the first half of 2026, but it is still subject to customary closing conditions.WATCH: Here’s what’s happening to electricity bills in states with the most data centerswatch now",

    "body": "We often underestimate how much our morning rituals can set the tone for the rest of the day. When you prioritize activities that spark a natural dopamine release, you aren't just waking up — you're essentially giving your brain a head start on feeling motivated and balanced.\"Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, which is a chemical released by brain cells, and it's mostly involved in motivation, learning and reinforcement,\" says Mia Soviero, a neuroscience researcher who conducted research at NYU Langone Health and Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute.\"It isn't just about feeling good. It's mostly about learning and motivating you. So, it helps our brain understand what actions are worth repeating and what habits we should have in our lives that we should strengthen,\" says Soviero, who also founded the nonprofit Research Girl, Inc to help aspiring science researchers receive more opportunities in their field of interest.A common misconception is that dopamine levels are always supposed to be boosted, Soviero says: Neurotransmitter levels are meant to fluctuate.\"We don't want to always have really high dopamine levels, but we do want to have a healthy dopamine system,\" she says. \"You just want to build these good patterns in dopamine, where dopamine is able to be released the way it's supposed to.\"Here's how Soviero structures her mornings to keep her dopamine system healthy, she says.A neuroscience researcher's dopamine-boosting morning routineStep 1: Exposure to sunlightSoviero's ideal morning routine for the best mood starts the night before: Getting adequate sleep sets the tone for the next day, she explains.Then, \"I make sure that when I wake up, I get exposure to some light in the morning,\" she says. \"Opening your curtains in the morning and getting sunlight on your face for a few minutes have actually been scientifically proven to reduce depressive symptoms, especially if you have seasonal depression.\"Sunlight exposure directly affects the area of your brain that controls your body's internal clock, or your circadian rhythm, according to Harvard Health Publishing.Not getting enough exposure to sunlight each day \"can cause your brain to produce too much of the sleep hormone melatonin and to release less serotonin, the feel-good brain chemical that affects mood. The result of this chemical imbalance? You feel low and lethargic,\" the health blog states.Step 2: SudokuSoviero makes time in her mornings to do \"small, meaningful activities\" like completing a daily Sudoku puzzle.\"It's a great way to kick off the day with a little dopamine from doing a puzzle. It's that feel-good chemical from achieving [it],\" she says. \"Novelty and new things that you aren't expecting that are good can increase dopamine levels in the brain and contribute to dopamine health. So that's why puzzles are great.\"Solving crossword puzzles and physical puzzles can have the same effects on your brain, Soviero says: The brain has a reward system that boosts dopamine when \"something unexpectedly good happens, and then decreases when something worse than expected happens.\"\"This means that evolutionarily, we would strive for goals in the hopes that we'd get this feel good chemical as a reward,\" she says. \"So when you do something, [like] learning a new skill, and you're surprisingly good at it, you get this influx of dopamine.\"Step 3: Text a friendEach morning, Soviero practices a simple and significant form of social connection: texting a friend. \"I'll send a text to my friends [like], 'Hey, good morning. How are you doing today?'\" she says.\"Humans are biologically wired for connections,\" Soviero adds. \"When you get to make that human connection, it's scientifically proven to boost your mood because that's what we're supposed to be doing.\" Spending too much time without interacting with close loved ones like friends and family can harm your health, she says. Being socially isolated and feeling lonely can increase a person's risk of developing heart disease, dementia, depression and other chronic conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Connecting with others is \"really healthy, not only for your brain but also for your body,\" Soviero says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldAlphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday between 6 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.The power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.\"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections,\" Waymo's Philion also told CNBC. \"This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting from San Francisco.",

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

Kim Hong-ji | ReutersShares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. watch nowLast week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the new frigate class would be part of Trump's envisioned \"Golden Fleet.\"Trump on Monday stateside said that the U.S. Navy will build two new \"Trump-class\" battleships, and may expand the count to as much as 25 such ships. The U.S. president described the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" adding that the they will \"help maintain American military supremacy, [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"Describing them as \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,\" the Trump-class battleships are envisioned to be equipped with hypersonic weapons, lasers, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons, according to the U.S. President.",

    "body": "Performance review season can be nerve-wracking, but there are several ways employees can set themselves up for success.The best thing employees can do for themselves is to practice \"emotional management,\" according to career coach Sarah Baker Andrus.Remaining calm and engaged during the meeting will leave a good impression, she says, while becoming defensive or flustered can reflect poorly on you.Besides, you're likely not the only one feeling nervous, Andrus says. Many managers dread performance review season because \"nobody wants to give somebody negative feedback.\"The way you handle your performance review can \"define your relationship with your supervisor\" going forward, so it's important to get it right, she says.Here are some common performance review mistakes that employees should avoid, according to Andrus.Walking in unpreparedEmployees should come into their performance reviews \"having thought through what contributed to their wins and what contributed to the places where they think they could have done better,\" Andrus says.One blunder that Andrus often sees is that employees will simply copy their self-assessments from the past year, rather than writing a new one.\"That sends a signal that you're not committed to growth and development,\" she says. \"It's a huge mistake.\"Employees should view self-assessments as \"a record of your performance that other people will refer to,\" Andrus says.That's why it's crucial to spend time thoroughly filling out your self-assessment and getting materials like your brag doc ready ahead of the meeting.\"It's not just a piece of paper. Everybody hates doing it, but you've got to take it seriously, or you're not taking yourself seriously,\" she says.Reacting negatively to feedbackIt's a \"huge red flag\" when someone immediately starts arguing with feedback during a performance review, according to Andrus.As an employee, \"the important thing is that you do not react in the moment,\" she says. Andrus acknowledges that receiving negative feedback can be difficult — \"I'm not saying you can't be emotional, we all have emotions,\" she says — but she recommends taking a deep breath before responding.If you don't agree with the criticism, Andrus says she likes using language like, \"That's disappointing,\" she says.Instead of starting an argument, she recommends following up with \"I'm not sure I agree with this — are you willing to continue the conversation later?\"It's okay to disagree, she says, but reacting strongly \"serves nobody\" in the situation and could potentially damage your relationship with your manager.Going off-topicAnother common mistake Andrus sees is that employees will \"bring up issues and problems that deserve their own meeting\" during their performance reviews, such as a conflict with a co-worker or scheduling concerns. In most cases, \"both sides of the table share responsibility\" when this happens, she says: managers should be meeting with their employees frequently enough that they can discuss issues as they arise.\"If we're not meeting regularly, then it's easy for a staff member to want to come in and say, 'Oh my gosh, I finally got on her calendar. Here's my list of other things that I need to talk about'\" during a performance review, Andrus says.Andrus advises employees to focus on the topic at hand. Your performance review meeting is your chance to discuss professional goals and growth opportunities for the next year, \"and there's only so much time,\" she says.That's why it's crucial \"to raise issues as they come up, and not wait for the performance review,\" she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The photo, which contained two separate images showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday. The photo showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenzaOne of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche early Sunday said the image was removed from the website after learning there were concerns about women in the photo, \"so we pulled that photo down.\"\"It has nothing to do with President Trump,\" said Blanche on NBC's \"Meet the Press.The disappearance of the image and more than a dozen other files over the weekend came despite a law signed by Trump that required the agency to make public all of the Epstein files by Friday.The image went live on the DOJ's website on Friday, and disappeared from the webpage several hours later. The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all Justice Department files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.CNBC has reached out to the DOJ over Massie's remarks. ",

Tiffany Hagler-Geard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInstacart said Monday it will cease the use of artificial intelligence-driven pricing tests on its grocery delivery platform after the practice was scrutinized in a wide-ranging study and rebuked by lawmakers. The company said in a blog post that retailers will no longer be able to use its Eversight technology to run pricing experiments on its platform, effective immediately. \"We understand that the tests we ran with a small number of retail partners that resulted in different prices for the same item at the same store missed the mark for some customers,\" the company wrote. \"At a time when families are working exceptionally hard to stretch every grocery dollar, those tests raised concerns, leaving some people questioning the prices they see on Instacart. That's not okay – especially for a company built on trust, transparency, and affordability.\"Instacart acquired Eversight for $59 million in 2022. Eversight's software allows retailers to carry out pricing tests to gauge shoppers' reactions to higher or lower prices on certain items. Instacart said at the time that the technology would help retailers improve sales and growth, while \"also surfacing the best deals for customers.\"Read more CNBC tech newsXbox is losing the console race by miles.

The total cost for the same basket of goods at a single store varied by about 7%, which can result in more than $1,000 in extra annual costs for customers. Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed on the app.The company also rejected characterizations of the technology as surveillance pricing or dynamic pricing, and said the tests were never based on personal, demographic or individual-level user data. Reuters reported last week that the Federal Trade Commission had sent a civil investigative demand to Instacart about its pricing practices. Separately, Instacart last week was ordered to pay $60 million in refunds to customers to settle claims raised by the FTC that it used deceptive tactics in its subscription sign-up, \"satisfaction guarantee\" advertising and other processes.

    "body": "Ted Sarandos, left, co-CEO of Netflix, and David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.Mario Anzuoni | Mike Blake | ReutersHours before Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix, Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, called WBD CEO David Zaslav to inform him Netflix wouldn't be bidding any higher. WBD shareholders now have a chance to call Sarandos' bluff.WBD shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash, though that deadline may be artificial. Paramount can extend it all the way to WBD's annual meeting, which hasn't been set yet but this year took place June 2. If Paramount acquires 51% of outstanding WBD shares, it would control the company, even though the WBD board already agreed to sell the company's studio and streaming assets to Netflix. Both Netflix and Paramount can use the coming days and weeks to speak with WBD shareholders to gauge whether they'd like to take Paramount's offer or stick with the board's recommendation to sell to Netflix. To tender or not to tender, that is the question. There are sound arguments for both sides. The decision also presents a game theory element for shareholders who may simply want a bidding war rather than caring about the right buyer.To tenderThere are two overarching reasons why a shareholder might tender their holdings to Paramount. The first is if the investor believes Paramount's $30-per-share, all-cash offer for the entirety of WBD is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for just the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO Max streaming business. The second is a belief that tendering shares is the best way to force a bidding war between Netflix and Paramount.A shareholder could decide Paramount's current offer is better than Netflix's if they think it has a higher likelihood of regulatory approval or if they believe Discovery Global — the portfolio of linear cable networks including CNN, TNT, Discovery, HGTV and TBS that's set to be spun out — will have minimal value as a publicly traded company. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison told CNBC earlier this month he values Discovery Global at $1 per share, given his prediction on the likely multiple (two times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at which it will trade based on current valuations for similar linear cable networks. If WBD doesn't agree to sell the entire company to Paramount, it plans to split Discovery Global out as its own publicly traded entity in mid-2026. Paramount's argument is that $30 per share is already greater than Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer plus $1 per share for Discovery Global. David Ellison, CEO of Paramount Skydance, exits following an interview at the New York Stock Exchange, Dec. 8, 2025.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersParamount's bid is also all cash, while Netflix's bid includes 16% equity with a so-called collar, which means shareholders won't know exactly how much Netflix stock they'll actually receive until the deal closes. As for regulatory approval, Paramount has played up arguments that a combined Netflix and HBO Max streaming business would be anticompetitive. Netflix has more than 300 million global paying customers. The idea of the largest streamer buying HBO Max has already raised concerns with politicians, including President Donald Trump, who said there may be a \"market share\" issue with a Netflix deal. While Paramount would combine Paramount+ with HBO Max, Paramount+ has about 80 million subscribers, presenting less of a risk to competition. The second, more nuanced argument to tender is to maximize upside even if the assets ultimately go to Netflix. Ellison has already made it known Paramount's $30-per-share offer isn't best and final. Tendering could cause Netflix to come back with a higher offer, which may then prompt Paramount to raise its bid as well. GAMCO Investors chairman and CEO Mario Gabelli told CNBC earlier this month \"the notion of Company A and Company B having a bidding war — that's what we like as part of the free market system.\" He added last week that while he was previously leaning toward tendering his shares to Paramount, \"the most important part is to keep it in play.\" Not to tenderOther shareholders may believe, in contrast, that not tendering is the best way of jumpstarting a bidding war. If Paramount sees that it's not getting traction with shareholders as the annual meeting gets closer, it may raise its bid to get more shareholders on board. There are additional reasons not to tender. Shareholders may want the Netflix and Discovery Global equity portion of the Netflix proposal. In a WBD filing last week, the company said a mystery \"Company C\" proposed to acquire Discovery Global and its 20% stake in WBD's streaming and studios business for $25 billion in cash. That bid was rejected by the WBD board as \"not actionable.\" Still, the mystery bid suggests there may be an interested buyer in all of Discovery Global if it gets spun out, which could result in far more than $1 per share, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. That's a good reason not to tender, he said, because it makes the Netflix offer much more valuable than Paramount's bid. Ensuring WBD splits Discovery Global is also the safe play for shareholders in case regulators block a Paramount-WBD merger, Greenfield said. Since the Paramount deal is for all of WBD, including CNN, Ellison's bid — which includes roughly $24 billion from Middle Eastern sovereign funds — may run into regulatory and political hurdles, Greenfield noted.\"You want the split to happen,\" Greenfield said in an interview. \"If the Paramount deal doesn't get regulatory approval, now you've prevented the split from happening. You're stuck in 2027 with declining cable networks, and you haven't spun them off. Does the U.S. really want a company funded by more Middle Eastern money than money from the Ellisons owning CNN?\" 'Where's Poppa?'WBD's board has argued part its reasoning for rejecting Paramount's $30-per-share bid was its concern with financing, noting more funding comes from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds than the Ellison family, which has committed about $12 billion. Paramount altered the terms of its deal Monday to help address funding concerns. Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the father of David and one of the world's five wealthiest people, agreed to provide \"an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" should the existing financing fall through, Paramount said in a statement. Paramount also said Monday it will publish records confirming the Ellison family trust \"owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that all material liabilities of the Ellison family trust are publicly disclosed.\" Paramount has said the family trust will backstop the financing. WBD's board had previously argued the trust is an \"opaque entity,\" preferring a direct commitment from the Ellisons. Notably, even with the Monday announcement, the Ellisons haven't increased their personal equity investment, which still stands at $12 billion. Internally, some WBD executives have cited the 1970 Carl Reiner movie \"Where's Poppa?\" when speaking about the bid, according to a person familiar with the matter. WBD has pushed for the Ellisons to commit more personal money to the deal. Still, a WBD shareholder may not care where the funding is coming from as long as it's there. The three SWFs involved in the deal are the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Co. and the Qatar Investment Authority. The PIF and QIA, in particular, are known institutions that have contributed billions of dollars to other U.S.-based deals.Correction: This story has been revised to correct that Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash. A previous version misstated this deadline.",

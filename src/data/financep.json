HRC noted many of the companies that dropped out hold federal contracts.\"Our research shows the strength and the strain of this moment on LGBTQ+ workers, consumers and the companies that count on us,\" HRC President Kelley Robinson said in a statement.Of the companies that participated — which includes more than the Fortune 500 — 534 earned a score of 100, representing nearly 6 million U.S. employees, according to HRC. HRC's index launched in 2002 and rates companies based on their social responsibility and equity in the workplace.Over the past two years, the anti-DEI movement, championed by the White House, began to reframe the index, making it a conservative target.The Corporate Equality Index has increasingly seen more companies exiting its orbit, beginning with Tractor Supply and including big names like Walmart, Ford and Lowe's. Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer and grocer, said it had conversations with conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has publicly advocated for a shift away from DEI, before the company pulled out.It was a significant change from years prior, when companies like Ford and Walmart issued public statements supporting DEI and touting their achievements in their workplaces.",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk logos.Mike Blake | Tom Little | ReutersIt's a tale of two drugmakers in the red-hot obesity drug market. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are grappling with lower prices in the U.S., but their 2026 outlooks are diverging sharply: While Novo is bracing for a sales decline, Lilly sees revenue jumping again thanks to its blockbuster medicines. The split in guidance – despite similar headwinds – underscores the strength of Lilly's position in the obesity and diabetes drug market, underpinned by its more effective injections and early foray into direct-to-consumer sales, among other factors. While Novo Nordisk effectively made the drugs mainstream, Lilly has since taken a clear edge in market share — and the forecasts show it will likely only extend its advantage this year.\"The difference in sales momentum and market share trend was visible throughout 2025, but the dichotomy between the two companies' prospects was accentuated within this 24-hour period in which Novo guided below consensus and Lilly guided above consensus expectations,\"  Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger told CNBC on Wednesday. \"That really solidified an investor's mind that Lilly is going to be the dominant player in obesity going forward,\" he added. This year, all eyes will be on how Lilly's upcoming obesity pill, orforglipron, fares against Novo's own oral Wegovy drug, which has had an explosive U.S. launch this year. In an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday, Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said 20 million to 25 million patients are currently taking both companies' medicines. But he said the total addressable market of patients in the obesity space is \"gigantic.\" watch nowDiverging outlooksOn Wednesday, Lilly forecasted 2026 sales of $80 billion to $83 billion, surpassing the $77.62 billion that analysts were expecting, according to LSEG. The midpoint of that outlook translates to sales growing by 25% this year.In contrast, Novo warned on Tuesday that it sees sales and profit declining by 5% to 13% this year, as prices fall in the U.S. and exclusivity expires for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs in China, Brazil and Canada. (L/R) Maziar Mike Doustdar, CEO of Novo Nordisk, and David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, listen as US President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office during an event about weight-loss drugs at the White House in Washington, DC on November 6, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesLilly similarly pointed to a \"global pricing decline in the low- to mid- teens [percentages] this year.\" That comes after the landmark \"most favored nation\" deals both companies struck with President Donald Trump in November to slash obesity and diabetes drug costs, along with their recent efforts to further reduce direct-to-consumer prices for their treatments. The agreements with Trump are expected to take a bite out of both companies' sales, but eventually increase volumes of prescriptions for their drugs. Still, Lilly is bullish about other factors that will help offset that pricing pressure. That includes continued worldwide demand for its obesity drug Zepbound and diabetes counterpart Mounjaro and the expected launch of its GLP-1 pill for obesity in the second quarter, pending U.S. approval. Lilly also pointed to government Medicare coverage of obesity treatments starting for the first time by at least July, one of the winning features of the drug pricing deals with Trump. Lilly's Ricks told CNBC that coverage will open up access to 40 million new Medicare beneficiaries, \"and that could be quite expansive to volume.\"Overall, Risinger called Lilly's guidance \"very encouraging\" and said the \"price per volume trade-off is playing out well\" for the company. He said tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro, is \"superior\" in its effectiveness and tolerability compared to semaglutide, the ingredient in Novo's obesity and diabetes drugs. That was proven in a head-to-head clinical trial conducted by Lilly in 2024, and prescription trends show that the company's drugs are preferred among prescribers.  \"I think that's what is driving Lilly's market share gain\" relative to Novo, Risinger said. Another factor that sets Lilly and Novo apart is patent exclusivity. While Novo said expiring patents in some international markets pose a challenge, Lilly's Ricks said tirzepatide should be protected into \"the back half of the 2030s\" in major markets. Risinger noted that Lilly is still working to drive global uptake for tirzepatide, which won U.S. approval for obesity in 2023. All eyes on pillsA pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk is first to market with a GLP-1 pill for obesity, and it already hit 50,000 weekly prescriptions in just under three weeks of its launch. But investors are watching to see how that shifts once Lilly's pill rolls out to patients later this year. In an interview with CNBC's \"Mad Money,\" Novo CEO Mike Doustdar said he's confident about the company's ability to compete with Lilly. \"Clearly we have the most efficacious weight reduction pill that there is and I'm very optimistic and bullish on when they come with their pill and we have to battle this out,\" Doustdar said. He's referring to clinical trial data suggesting that Novo's Wegovy pill promotes comparable weight loss to its injectable counterpart, which is around 15%. Meanwhile, Lilly's pill appears to be slightly less effective than that, based on separate study data. Risinger said the launch of Novo's pill has benefited from the fact that the company is leveraging the Wegovy brand name, which is recognizable by many patients, and immediately launched direct-to-consumer advertising for the product in early January. But he said Lilly could capitalize on its pill's convenience advantage. Orforglipron is a small-molecule drug that is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's pill, which is a peptide medication. Patients are supposed to drink no more than four ounces of water with the Wegovy pill and must wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything else each day. Novo contends that those requirements won't hinder uptake, but Risinger said it could help Lilly's pill eventually generate greater sales globally. ",

    "body": "Pinterest CEO Bill Ready rebuked staffers who created an internal tool to track layoffs at the company, and fired those involved. \"Healthy debate and dissent are expected, that's how we make our decisions,\" Ready said at a companywide meeting last week, according to audio obtained by CNBC. \"But there's a clear line between constructive debate and behavior that's obstructionist.\" Pinterest announced on Jan. 27 that it would lay off less than 15% of its workforce and cut back on office space as part of a broader restructuring aimed at directing resources toward artificial intelligence projects. The company said it expects the layoffs will be complete by the end of September.Following the announcement, Pinterest's technology chief addressed the layoffs in a meeting. Some employees asked which teams were impacted and whether more job cuts were coming, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the meeting was private. Several Pinterest engineers then created an internal software tool to try and quantify the layoffs. Pinterest fired the engineers on Friday, the person said. It's unclear how many employees were let go. Ready defended the moves at an all-hands meeting on Friday, saying Pinterest was facing a \"critical moment\" in the industry. Employees should consider a job elsewhere if they're \"working against the direction of the company\" and disagree with its mission, he said. Ready said Pinterest wouldn't disclose detailed information about the layoffs out of a concern for staffers' privacy.\"I know people have natural curiosity around these things,\" Ready said. \"We shared some of those major structural changes. The smaller ones, those will be communicated at the team level.\" A Pinterest spokesperson confirmed the engineer incident and town hall meeting, but declined to comment on the firings.\"After being clearly informed that Pinterest would not broadly share information identifying impacted employees, two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly,\" the spokesperson said. \"This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy.\"After this article was published, several Pinterest employees contacted CNBC and disputed the company's characterization of the incident. Pinterest fired the engineers after they posted instructions showing how to prompt the company's staff directory to show who was laid off, the employees said. The employees said Pinterest's claim that the engineers created custom software was inaccurate, and said the directory tool is accessible to anyone in the company.Pinterest has been investing heavily in AI to surface more personalized and relevant content, and to keep users returning to its platform. It's also rolled out automated tools for marketers in an effort to better compete with digital ad leaders Meta and Google. Investors have raised concerns around whether the increasing popularity of consumer chatbots from OpenAI, Google and others could steal users and ad dollars away from Pinterest. There's particular consternation around the use of AI agents for shopping, \"which compresses the market of discovery and purchase on competing platforms,\" Wedbush analysts wrote in a research note last week.Pinterest shares are down 20% so far this year after dropping 11% in 2025. \"We can't tolerate from each other obstructionism, especially when we have a mission that is so meaningful but also where the odds are stacked against us,\" Ready said. \"We think we can beat those odds, but as a small purpose driven player competing against the largest companies in the history of the world, the only way that we succeed is if we work together, constructively, with clarity and focus.\"More recently, Pinterest's advertising sales slowed as some large U.S. retailers weathered the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies.  Tech companies have continued to downsize this year as they look for more ways to increase efficiencies and invest in AI. Amazon last week said it would lay off about 16,000 corporate employees, after it let go 14,000 staffers in October. Meta cut about 10% of staff in its Reality Labs unit, while design software maker Autodesk slashed about 7% of its workforce.WATCH: Pinterest CEO Bill Ready learned one key business lesson early",

    "body": "A customer enters a Taco Bell restaurant in El Cerrito, California, US, on Tuesday, April 29, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesYum Brands on Wednesday reported mixed quarterly results, despite strong demand for Taco Bell.Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.73 adjusted vs. $1.77 expectedRevenue: $2.51 billion vs. $2.45 billion expectedYum reported fourth-quarter net income of $535 million, or $1.91 per share, up from $423 million, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier. The company's tax rate was higher than anticipated by Wall Street, according to Kalinowski Equity Research.Excluding tax benefits, acquisition costs and other one-time items, the restaurant company earned $1.73 per share.Net revenue rose 6% to $2.51 billion.Yum's global same-store sales increased 3%, fueled by strong performance at Taco Bell and in KFC's international markets. Taco Bell's same-store sales spiked 7% in the quarter, topping Wall Street expectations of 5.6% growth, according to StreetAccount. The Mexican-inspired chain is the gem of Yum's portfolio, regularly outperforming the broader fast-food industry, thanks to a mix of value offerings and buzzy menu items. The chain is stealing market share from competitors, and consumers aged 18 to 24 years old are flocking to its restaurants, Yum CEO Chris Turner said on the company's conference call.KFC saw its global same-store sales rise 3%. The fried chicken chain's international locations reported same-store sales growth of 3%, while restaurants in the U.S. saw a same-store sales increase of 1%. Wall Street analysts had expected KFC to report same-store sales growth of 2.1%, according to StreetAccount. KFC has been undergoing a turnaround in its home market, where it has ceded market share to upstarts like Raising Cane's in recent years. To win back customers, it is taking some cues from Taco Bell's successful playbook. The chain is planning to unveil new menu items, like sauces and beverages, at a more rapid pace than it previously did. The chain will also try to offer customers more affordable options, whether it is a \"profitable low-price point products\" or targeted individual value offers, executives said on the company's conference call.And once again, Pizza Hut was the laggard of the portfolio. The embattled pizza chain reported that its same-store sales declined 1%, driven by a 3% drop in the U.S. and slightly edging out Wall Street estimates of a 1.7% decline during the period. In November, the company said it would explore strategic options for Pizza Hut. Yum on Wednesday said that the review had begun but did not share more details.\"As of now, we intend to complete the review of options this year,\" Turner said. \"Given the ongoing nature of the process at this time, we cannot share further details on the strategic review.\"While Pizza Hut undergoes the review, Yum is also implementing a strategy that will act as a \"bridge to a longer-term acceleration of the brand,\" according to CFO Ranjith Roy. As part of that plan, Pizza Hut will shutter about 250 underperforming U.S. locations in the first half of the year.",

    "body": "All-electric vehicle maker Rivian is dealing with a lot: the end of federal support for EVs, a surge in hybrid vehicle sales and a rate of cash burn that still alarms investors, among other things.The company also has relatively low production and delivery numbers, but Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe told CNBC in a December interview that's not the full story. \"The R1 is the best-selling premium electric SUV in the United States,\" he said, adding that it has been a top-selling premium SUV of any kind in the state of California. But the R1S carries a nearly $80,000 starting price. Rivian's hope is that the upcoming, less expensive R2 model can repeat that same success in the far larger midsize, mid-price SUV EV market.The R2 looks like a smaller R1S. Someone sitting inside will notice Rivian's familiar style and design language throughout the interior. It has Rivian's recognizable headlights. And it's much the same shape, with a long, flat roof that lets a 6-foot-1-inch person sit in the rear seat without slouching.  One of the biggest differences is that it has five seats, two fewer than the larger R1S. \"It's a smaller vehicle,\" Scaringe said. \"But I think this is the best vehicle we've developed to date. We're incredibly bullish on this and excited for it. Of course it's cheaper, but it doesn't mean it's not an aspirational product, something that you're really going to enjoy and love to be in.\"Test rideScaringe took CNBC on a test drive of the R2 near the company's office in Palo Alto, California. It feels low to the ground and agile. \"Watch this,\" Scaringe said as we were driving on the freeway. He kicked the accelerator and the R2 shot forward. EVs are known for fast acceleration, but this might stand out for its class. \"It's quicker than it needs to be,\" he said.We didn't drive off road, but Scaringe said the R2 is trail-worthy, though customers shouldn't expect the more than 1,000-horsepower, go-anywhere capability of the $120,000 R1 Quad. \"It's a Rivian, so it still has to be adventure ready,\" Scaringe said. \"It can go out and be on a trail. It's just not going to be doing extreme rock crawling in the way that an R1 can do.\"Rivian's approach to design and manufacturing has enabled the company to pack a lot into a lower-cost package. Traditional cars have more than 60 computing units in them. By designing the computing architecture differently, the company reduced that down to 17 in its first-generation R1 vehicles and then to seven in the second generation. That's the same number the R2 has, but the company was able to cut the length of the wiring in the vehicle by 2 miles from the previous generation. These kinds of design choices lower the cost of materials. \"It's a dramatic reduction in the cost structure to build it,\" Scaringe said. \"So it's key for both enabling the ramp-up in volume because it's so much more accessible in terms of pricing, but it's also much lower cost to build.\"There are also some unique features — rear-seat side windows drop down all the way into the door panel--highly unusual for the back of a vehicle — due to the location of the rear wheel. The company spent a lot of time getting the placement of the rear wheels right to allow it, Scaringe said.Lowering costs doesn't mean Rivian skimped everywhere. Customers had complained that there was no glove compartment on R1 vehicles, so the R2 has two of them. They both have a velvet-like lining that costs $11 per car. \"We wanted to make it a very nice environment,\" Scaringe said. \"So we spent the money to line them up. But this is a really good example. That's a trade-off we made. The top-line number, the starting price of $45,000, has to be achieved. And we have to do it profitably.\"Wall Street's viewAnalysts are divided on whether Rivian can pull this off and match or beat Tesla's success. Needham analyst Chris Pierce said the consensus opinion holds that Rivian will sell about 15,000 units of the R2 in 2026, but he thinks the company can top that. He added that Rivian ranks first in Consumer Reports' owner satisfaction survey.\"They have the highest rating of people that own the car that want to buy it, that would buy the car again, would recommend the car to a friend,\" Pierce said. \"If you have a car and you like that car and you tell people, 'That's a great car,' that's the best form of advertising. It just seems like, for whatever reason, because of EV uncertainty, Trump, etc., people really got bearish on how many cars of this car they could sell.\"Rivian burned through $3 billion in the first three quarters of 2025, according to the company's financial statements. As of January, the company had about $7 billion in cash. Pierce said he expects Rivian to burn $5 billion in 2026. But company struck a $5 billion deal with Volkswagen to use Rivian software in VW vehicles worldwide, and that arrangement should bring in another $2 billion in 2026, leaving the company with about $4 billion in 2027 if all goes well. For now, Rivian needs to ramp up its new vehicle, which is expected to roll out to reservation holders in June. \"If we can have the type of market share that we have on R1, where it's the market share leader with R2, I mean, we'd have a real challenge of making enough of them,\" Scaringe said. \"So this is the hope, is we can capture that spark that's connected with so many customers and at the flagship price point.\"Watch the video to learn why Rivian is betting on the R2 in its pursuit to profitability.

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesOlder workers and retirees who have lost track of retirement savings from a previous employer may benefit from a relatively new resource to help them reunite with those funds.Of the 236,269 unique visitors who logged onto the Labor Department's Retirement Savings Lost and Found Database from its launch in late December 2024 through the end of 2025, about 29.5% — 69,712 — found an old 401(k), pension or other workplace retirement plan associated with their Social Security number, according to data provided to CNBC by the agency. The database currently includes information that pertains only to people age 65 or older.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMillions may drop ACA coverage — and raise health insurance costs for everyone elseRetirement savings 'lost and found' helps retirees track down old 401(k)sBigger SALT cap may 'drive higher refunds,' tax expert says — who benefitsWhat new Medicaid, SNAP work requirements mean for older workersTrump accounts could grow to $50,000 or more, president says.

The typical U.S. worker holds about 13 jobs between ages 18 and 58, according to an ongoing Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of people born between 1957 and 1964.An estimated 31.9 million 401(k) accounts, totaling about $2.1 trillion, remain with former employers, according to 2025 research from Capitalize, which helps people roll over workplace savings to IRAs. The data includes accounts that former employees intentionally leave in their old plan, for example, to take advantage of lower fees or stronger creditor protections relative to IRAs. Be aware that if your balance is under $7,000 when you leave a company, your employer may roll over your balance to an IRA if you don't take action yourself. If it's under $1,000, the plan may cash you out and send you a check.Depending on how often you switch employers, it's possible to lose track of your savings and end up with multiple accounts that you're overlooking when it comes to retirement planning. For example, companies can be acquired or go out of business, or they may no longer have up-to-date contact information for you. \"I always tell people to treat old retirement accounts like missing puzzle pieces,\" said certified financial planner Melissa Caro, founder of My Retirement Network in New York City. \"You can't plan accurately if you don't know what you own.\"Usefulness of Labor database may improve over timeThe Labor Department's database is the result of a provision included in retirement legislation known as Secure 2.0, which was signed into law in December 2022. The bill required the department to create and maintain a database to help workers locate retirement accounts they left behind with a former employer.However, the age 65 threshold for information in the database means it's not yet useful for younger workers who have lost track of accounts with previous employers.The Labor Department said in a 2024 notice published in the Federal Register that it began building the database for an older age group because \"such individuals are more likely to benefit sooner from a functioning database than other age cohorts.\" In its most recent semiannual agenda, the department indicated that it will propose regulations related to the information it collects for the database, including potentially broadening it.You can't plan accurately if you don't know what you own.Melissa CaroFounder of My Retirement Network\"I'm hoping an expansion will include [any age],\" said Tyler Compton, director and managing attorney for the Pension Action Center at the University of Massachusetts Boston.Compton said the database has been a useful tool for the center's clients, who have found amounts ranging from about $350 monthly in annuities from old pensions, to 401(k) accounts worth roughly $20,000.The Labor Department's database includes only retirement benefits provided by private-sector employers or unions. Individual retirement accounts and plans sponsored by government entities or certain religious organizations are not listed.You can search only for accounts tied to your own Social Security number, the website says. In other words, you currently can't search on behalf of your deceased spouse, although experts anticipate that will change at some point.Where else to search for old retirement accountsWorkers who can't currently benefit from the Labor Department database have other avenues to locate old retirement accounts.The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation runs a Missing Participants Program, which helps people whose plans have terminated. It does not track information on benefits or accounts tied to plans that are still in existence, which is what the Labor Department's new database does.You also can search for old retirement accounts, as well as security deposits, bank accounts and other financial property through your state's unclaimed property program. The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators website includes a U.S. map with links to each state's unclaimed property database. To search more than one state at a time, you can go to MissingMoney.com.",

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in San Francisco, Aug. 27, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe share of U.S. homeowners with high rates on their mortgages has jumped sharply in just the last few years. That's having a marked impact on the refinance market and a somewhat more muted impact on home sales. Rates have been front and center in the debate over how to improve home affordability — and for good reason. In 2022, after mortgage interest rates hit more than a dozen record lows, sparking a refinance bonanza, barely 10% of homeowners had 30-year fixed mortgages with rates above 5%. Just four years later, that share has jumped to over 30%, according to ICE Mortgage Technology. About 20% of borrowers have mortgages with a rate over 6%.Home sales have been less than robust over the last few years, with the National Association of Realtors reporting a historically low 4.06 million sales last year, basically unchanged from 2024. This, after hitting a 15-year high of 6.12 million home sales in 2022. More recent sales, combined with some cash-out refinancing, pushed the share of higher-interest-rate borrowers up.There has been a major focus by the Trump administration to lower mortgage rates as a way to boost home affordability. The president recently announced a plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more than $200 billion in mortgage-backed bonds. It is still a subject of debate as to how much lower that would push mortgage rates once the purchase is made, but just the announcement alone caused rates to drop a bit. Industry experts say the actual purchases could shave perhaps about an eighth of a percentage point off the current 30-year rate, putting it right around 6%. Last year at this time, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage was just over 7%, according to Mortgage News Daily.  If the average on the 30-year fixed moved to 6%, 5.5 million current homeowners would be able to benefit from a refinance, according to ICE Mortgage Technology. Those homeowners could save at least 75 basis points on their rate, which makes the fees involved financially worthwhile, it said. If rates dropped to 5.88%, that number grows to 6.5 million homeowners. \"The most popular interest rate that's been used to buy a home over the last 3.5 years is between 6.875% and 6.99%, right? Nobody wanted to tell their neighbors they used a 7% interest rate to buy a home, so everybody bought down into this high 6% range,\" said Andy Walden, ICE Mortgage Technology's head of mortgage and housing market research. \"Coincidentally, those 15-basis-point-spread moves from this $200 billion in MBS purchase is moving rates from what would have been six and a quarter right now down to six and an eighth. And so it's providing meaningfully more refinance incentive than would otherwise be out there, and it's having an oversized impact on the market,\" he said. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications to refinance a home loan are now about 120% higher than they were one year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. As for home sales, the last four years were characterized by the so-called rate \"lock-in\" effect, meaning potential sellers didn't want to give up their historically low rates. They therefore put off moves that they might otherwise have wanted to make. Entering 2025, there were roughly 39 million homeowners with an interest rate below 5% and roughly 12 million with an interest rate below 3%, according to Walden.\"If you look at how those borrowers behaved last year, only about 6% of those folks gave up those low rates, either through a refinance to pull equity out of their home or through the sale of their home. Close to 95% of homeowners held on to those rates tight,\" he said.As for prospective homebuyers, a 15-basis-point drop on the 30-year fixed rate would save only about $35 a month on the mortgage payment for the average-priced home. Alternately, they could keep the rate and buy 1.5% more home. \"Certainly a move in the right direction, but not a massive movement for those homebuyers,\" said Walden. watch now",

The shares were fell about 4%Here's how the company did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the period ended in December:Earnings per share: 71 cents adjusted Revenue: $14.37 billion vs. $14.32 billion estimatedRevenue increased from $12 billion a year earlier, Uber said in its earnings release. The mobility segment, its ride-hailing platform, generated revenue of of $8.2 billion, up 19% from a year ago, while delivery revenue climbed 30% to $4.9 billion.Analysts were expecting mobility revenue of $8.3 billion and delivery revenue of $4.72 billion, according to StreetAccount. Uber also said it's promoting finance executive Balaji Krishnamurthy to the CFO role, replacing Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah, who is leaving the company. Net income for the quarter was $296 million, which included a $1.6 billion \"net pre-tax headwind from revaluations of our equity investments,\" the company said. Net income a year earlier was $6.88 billion.Uber's weaker profits were also related to higher taxes, and its moves to provide more affordable rides to customers in order to grow bookings and win new users. The company said it had 202 million \"monthly active platform consumers,\" in the fourth quarter, up 18% year over year.Uber reported gross bookings of $54.1 billion for the quarter, topping the average analyst estimate of $53.1 billion, according to StreetAccount. Gross bookings for the first quarter are expected to increase at least 17% from a year earlier to between $52 billion and $53.5 billion. The company's strongest revenue growth for the quarter was in its delivery business, which started with restaurants and now includes groceries and retail. Partnerships with OpenTable, Shopify, and store brands such as Loblaws in Canada, Biedronka in Poland, Seiyu in Japan and Coles in Australia helped drive expansion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconUber one-day stock chartIn prepared remarks ahead of the earnings call, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said delivery growth last year was highest for Uber in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region.Uber's report lands during a time of transition for the ride-hail industry as autonomous vehicles become more commonplace, especially in urban markets.Echoing a viewpoint he shared a year ago, Khosrowshahi said he's even more convinced that \"AVs will unlock a multi-trillion dollar opportunity,\" adding that \"autonomy fundamentally amplifies the strengths of our existing platform.\"In Atlanta and Austin, Texas, where Uber offered autonomous rides in 2025, overall trip growth \"significantly accelerated\" even for human drivers, the company said in a shareholder deck. In San Francisco, where Uber doesn't yet have a robotaxi option, \"the addition of AV supply to the market has grown the category overall,\" Khosrowshahi said. Alphabet's Waymo has operated a driverless ride-hailing service via its own app in San Francisco since 2024. In some markets, Waymo offers its robotaxi rides exclusively via the Uber app.An Uber Eats bag in the Brooklyn borough of New York, US, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBy the end of 2026, Uber expects to be facilitating AV trips in up to 15 cities globally, split between the U.S. and other countries, Khosrowshahi said. \"And by 2029, we intend to be the largest facilitator of AV trips in the world,\" he added. Forthcoming cities include Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco, as well as London, Munich, Hong Kong, Zurich and Madrid.But Khosrowshahi cautioned that \"autonomous vehicles are likely to remain a very small portion of the rideshare category for many years to come,\" given technological, regulatory and other hurdles to their broader adoption.Uber is also focused on growing its Uber One program, with members tending to book more rides and buy more items through Uber after they subscribe. The company is investing in its advertising business as well. Playing into the surging popularity of generative artificial intelligence, Uber said it's working to \"expand discovery and reach new customers,\" via integrations with ChatGPT, allowing users to \"discover services and restaurants\" before completing their checkouts.

Thom Tillis on Wednesday recommitted to his blockade of Kevin Warsh's nomination to lead the Federal Reserve until the Department of Justice ends its investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Tillis, R-N.C., said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he's \"willing to let it play out for the remainder of this Congress, if that's what's necessary to get to the truth or to get back to a process that makes sense and that keeps the Fed independent.\" \"I'd be one of the first people to introduce Mr. Warsh if we're behind this and support him, but not before this matter is settled,\" Tillis said.The DOJ last month opened an investigation into Powell relating to cost overruns for renovations at the Federal Reserve headquarters.

Powell could remain on the board as a governor for two years. \"To ramp it down or have it adjudicated, that's the only way we get out of here as far as I'm concerned in this Congress for the next 333 days,\" Tillis said. \"I know how I would react to this, I'd be there for the remaining two years.\"\"They got ahead of their blockers.

    "body": "watch nowEli Lilly on Wednesday posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue and 2026 guidance that blew past estimates, as demand for its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro soars. The pharmaceutical giant anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $80 billion and $83 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $77.62 billion, according to LSEG. Lilly also projects adjusted earnings to be between $33.50 and $35 per share for the year. That compares with analysts' estimate of $33.23 per share, according to LSEG. The guidance comes in stark contrast to the outlook of rival Novo Nordisk, which is also grappling with lower prices in the U.S. following landmark deals both companies struck with President Donald Trump to slash obesity and diabetes drug costs. Unlike Lilly, Novo warned on Tuesday that it sees sales and profit declining as much as 13% this year, as prices fall in the U.S. and exclusivity expires for its blockbuster obesity and diabetes drugs in China, Brazil and Canada. Meanwhile, the midpoint of Lilly's revenue guidance sees sales growing by 25% this year. The strong outlook comes days after Lilly CEO Dave Ricks told CNBC in an exclusive interview that he expects upcoming government Medicare coverage of obesity treatments to expand the U.S. market for those drugs this year, saying it's a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool\" of patients. In an earnings presentation Wednesday, Lilly cited several factors that it will benefit from this year, including Medicare coverage, continued worldwide demand for Mounjaro and Zepbound, and the expected launch of its GLP-1 pill for obesity in the second quarter, pending U.S. approval. But Lilly said it will be hit by a global pricing decline by a low- to mid-teens percentage, driven by the deal with Trump, new direct-to-consumer rates for Zepbound and lower Medicaid pricing on some older products, among other factors. Lilly is working to maintain its dominance in the booming market for those drugs, called GLP-1s, as Novo sees an explosive U.S. launch for its new Wegovy pill for obesity. Ahead of that rollout in January, Lilly's share of the U.S. obesity and diabetes drug market increased to 60.5% in the fourth quarter, up 2.6% from the previous quarter, according to the presentation. Novo's market share in the fourth quarter was 39.1%.Mounjaro raked in $7.41 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 110% from the same period a year ago. U.S. sales for Mounjaro were $4.1 billion, rising 57%, as demand climbed but realized prices were lower. Those numbers surpassed what analysts were expecting for the quarter, according to StreetAccount.Zepbound, which entered the market roughly three years ago, posted $4.2 billion in U.S. revenue for the fourth quarter. That's up 122% from the year-earlier period, as demand for the drug also rose while realized prices dropped. Analysts were expecting $3.91 billion in U.S. sales for Zepbound, according to StreetAccount.Here's what Eli Lilly reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $7.54 adjusted vs. $6.67 expectedRevenue: $19.29 billion vs. $17.96 billion expectedEli Lilly shares climbed more than 7% in premarket trading.The company posted fourth-quarter revenue of $19.29 billion, up 43% from the same period a year ago. Revenue in the U.S. climbed to $12.9 billion. Eli Lilly said that was driven by a 50% increase in volume — or the number of prescriptions or units sold — for its products, primarily for Mounjaro and Zepbound. That was partially offset by lower realized prices of those drugs, the company said.The pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $6.64 billion, or $7.39 per share, for the fourth quarter. That compares with net income of $4.41 billion, or $4.88 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $7.54 per share for the fourth quarter.More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsNovo and Lilly's deals with Trump are expected to eventually increase the number of prescriptions but ultimately hurt total sales.Under the agreements, Lilly and Novo will slash the prices of those treatments for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026 and offer them directly to consumers at a discount on the Trump administration's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx, which has yet to launch. In return, both companies will also get a three-year exemption from tariffs. In the interview with CNBC on Friday, Lilly's Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. But he said volume growth of the company's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.\"",

    "body": "People dig out their cars parked along Lancaster St. during a winter storm on Monday, Jan. 26, 2026 in Albany, N.Y. Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Getty ImagesThe harsh winter storm that recently hit much of the country took its toll on the mortgage market in the week that followed. Potential buyers stayed home, and mortgage rates didn't move enough to spark refinance demand.Total mortgage application volume dropped 8.9% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Last week's results included an adjustment for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, decreased to 6.21% from 6.24%, with points increasing to 0.56 from 0.55, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. Despite the drop, applications to refinance a home loan fell 5% for the week but were still 117% higher than the same week one year ago, when rates were over 7%. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 57.1% of total applications from 56.2% the previous week.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home fell 14% for the week and were just 4% higher year over year.\"Winter Storm Fern likely had an impact as much of the country was snowed in, hampering homebuying activity,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. \"The annual increase in purchase applications was the weakest since April 2025.\"Mortgage rates moved higher to start this week, on a separate index from Mortgage News Daily. They are now at the highest level in two weeks, but that's not saying much, as the range is tiny. Rates rose as the result of a stronger-than-expected report on the manufacturing sector.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the time reference for the recent winter storm.",

    "body": "watch nowOpenAI's artificial intelligence models could help power Amazon's digital assistant Alexa and other internal projects at the e-commerce giant, CNBC confirmed on Wednesday. The collaboration between the two companies is being discussed in tandem with Amazon's ongoing talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. OpenAI could also use Amazon's AI chips and compute as part of the deal, the person said. Amazon declined to comment. The Information was first to report the partnership.The investment talks between Amazon and OpenAI have not been finalized and are still subject to change, as CNBC previously reported. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman are engaging in the discussions directly. For Amazon, gaining access to OpenAI's models could provide a boost to its AI efforts, which span multiple divisions of the company. In addition to Alexa, Amazon has invested heavily in building out its shopping chatbot, called Rufus, which sits in its e-commerce app and uses a custom internal model to answer queries.Read more CNBC tech news'Muskonomy' shakeup: SpaceX valuation approaches Tesla's after merger with xAIPinterest CEO rebukes, fires 'obstructionist' employees who created tool to track layoffsNvidia, OpenAI appear stalled on their mega deal. But the AI giants still need each otherNvidia's Jensen Huang denies OpenAI deal rumors: 'There's no drama'Amazon last year released a revamped version of its 11-year-old Alexa that aims to compete with leading chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. Amazon has said the new service, Alexa+, is \"model agnostic,\" meaning it may call different AI models from a variety of providers depending on the task.  CNBC previously reported that Anthropic's Claude model is handling many of Alexa+'s more complex queries. Amazon has an existing relationship and $8 billion investment in OpenAI rival Anthropic. Amazon's top Alexa executive, Daniel Rausch, told CNBC in an interview this week that the majority of traffic is routed to its homegrown Nova models. Rausch added that the company uses upwards of 70 different models, and said the company has a \"great partnership\" with Anthropic and other model providers hosted by its Bedrock service.OpenAI also has an existing relationship with Apple on its Siri voice assistant. Last month, Apple struck a deal with Google to use its Gemini models for its upgraded Siri voice assistant coming later this year. OpenAI views the opportunity to work with Amazon as more \"accretive\" to its broader enterprise push compared to its work with Apple, which could pose more competition with OpenAI's new devices, according to a source familiar with the company's strategy. OpenAI is making a massive push into devices, acquiring Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for about $6.4 billion last year. watch now",

    "body": "Tankers docked at the Phillips 66 Freeport Terminal in Freeport, Texas, US, on Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. Mark Felix | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOil prices rose Wednesday after President Donald Trump said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"should be very worried.\" U.S. crude oil rose $1.82, or 2.88%, to $65.08 a barrel by 2:58 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was up $2.04, or 3.03%, to $69.37 a barrel. Trump issued his warning to Khamenei in an interview with NBC News. Two U.S. officials told Axios earlier Wednesday that plans for nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran are on the verge of collapsing. Trump has threatened to launch military strikes on Iran if it doesn't agree to a deal governing its nuclear program. Discussions between U.S. and Iranian officials scheduled for Friday had raised hopes that the adversaries were on a path to de-escalation. But it's now unclear whether those talks will take place. The U.S. and Iran disagree on the location and format of the discussions, the U.S. officials told Axios. The U.S. and Iran had agreed to meet in Istanbul with other Middle East countries participating as observers. But Tehran wanted to change the format to a bilateral meeting in Oman, the officials said.The U.S. considered the change but ultimately rejected it, the officials said. The Iranians were not willing to return to the original format, they said. The officials told Axios that talks could still take place this week or next, if Tehran agrees to the original plan for the meeting. The reported breakdown in talks comes after the U.S. military said Tuesday it shot down an Iranian drone that approached the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier. Iranian gunboats also tried to board a U.S. merchant vessel in the Strait of Hormuz, according to U.S. Central Command. Iranian media said the drone was conducting routine surevillance that is permitted under international law.",

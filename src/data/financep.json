    "body": "Omar Marques | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesRobinhood shares are heading for a brutal weekly loss as the once-red-hot trades in bitcoin and AI stocks that powered its growth lose momentum.The popular brokerage platform slipped more than 3% Friday, extending a punishing decline. The stock tumbled 10.1% in the prior session and is now down 16% so far this week. November alone has erased nearly 30% of its market value.The latest slide reflects a sharp reversal in the risk-hungry investment activity Robinhood relies on. The company's core business is closely tied to retail investors pouring into speculative corners of the market, particularly cryptocurrency and buzzy artificial intelligence stocks. Those trades helped fuel a resurgence in Robinhood revenue and user engagement earlier this year as bitcoin hit fresh highs and anything tied to artificial intelligence soared. But the recent rout in crypto and high-growth tech stock leaders is exposing Robinhood's sensitivity to sentiment swings. Bitcoin has fallen about 12% this week alone, hitting a fresh low of $80,548.09 on Friday, the lowest level since April. Shares of AI enabler Nvidia are down 5% this week. ",

    "body": "watch nowHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Friday rejected as \"ridiculous\" an accusation that Democrats want to let pivotal Obamacare subsidies lapse in order to deal a political blow to Republicans.\"Shame on you,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said at one point as he pushed back on that notion in a fiery exchange with CNBC's Becky Quick on \"Squawk Box.\"The clash came less than six weeks before those subsidies — enhanced tax credits that reduce health-insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act for millions of enrollees — are set to expire.Quick had questioned why House Democrats are seeking a three-year extension of those subsidies, which Republicans won't support, instead of a one- or two-year deal, which some might.When Jeffries noted that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had offered a one-year extension of the tax credits during the government shutdown, Quick interjected, pressing him not to \"go back to what's done in the past.\"Jeffries said he was providing the necessary context that \"Republicans have repeatedly refused to take yes for an answer.\"Quick replied, \"It's important context to make me realize that I don't think you want to get a deal done. I think this is something where you'd like to see the rates go higher and allow the Republicans to hang themselves with that.\"Jeffries shot back: \"That's absolutely a ridiculous assertion ... shame on you for saying that.\"\"It's not a partisan issue for us. In fact, the states that are most impacted as it relates to an Affordable Care Act tax credit expiration are all Republican states.\"The fight over the tax credits was at the center of the 43-day shutdown, which ended last week without a clear solution on health care.Democrats wanted to permanently extend the credits, which were imposed under the Biden administration during the Covid-19 pandemic, and had refused to agree to fund the government without that guarantee. Republicans, who hold slim majorities in the House and Senate and have long criticized Obamacare, said they also wanted to address health care policy. But they balked at negotiating without reopening the government first.\"Republicans said in the House they were willing to deal with the Affordable Care Act tax credit issue after the government funding agreement was reached,\" Jeffries said on CNBC. \"Well, now the government shutdown is over and there's still been no conversations with House Republican leaders.\"The funding deal ultimately signed by President Donald Trump, which drew enough Democratic support to pass in the Senate, merely guaranteed that the upper chamber would hold a vote in December on a bill of Democrats' choosing.There is no guarantee that Senate Republicans will back that measure, or that House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., will take it up if it passes.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

    "body": "Maskot | Maskot | Getty ImagesIn November 2022, Beth Pinsker's 76-year-old mother began to get sick.Ann Pinsker, an otherwise healthy woman, had elected to have a spinal surgery to preserve her ability to walk after having back issues. What Ann and Beth had thought would be a straightforward recovery process instead yielded complications and infections, landing Ann in one assisted living facility after another as her daughter navigated her care.Eventually, by July of the following year, Ann died.\"We thought she'd be back up to speed a few weeks after hospital stay, rehab, home, but she had complications, and it was all a lot harder than she thought,\" Beth Pinsker, a certified financial planner and financial planning columnist at MarketWatch who has written a book on caregiving, told CNBC.It wasn't Pinsker's first time navigating senior care. Five years before her mother's death, she took care of her father, and before that, her grandparents.But throughout each of those processes, Pinsker said she noticed a significant shift in the senior caregiving sector.\"From the level of care that my grandparents received to the level of care that my mom received, prices skyrocketed and services decreased,\" she said.It's evocative of a larger trend across the sector as the senior population in the U.S. booms and the labor force struggles to keep up.Recent data from the U.S. Census Bureau found that the population of people ages 65 and older in the country grew from 12.4% in 2004 to 18% in 2024, and the number of older adults outnumbered children in 11 states — up from just three states in 2020.Along with that population change came other shifts, including increased demand for care for older people.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the prices for senior care services are rising faster than the price of inflation. In September, the Consumer Price Index rose 3% annually, while prices for nursing homes and adult day services rose more than 4% over the same period.But the labor force hasn't necessarily kept up with the surge.The demand for home care workers is soaring as the gap widens, with a projected 4.6 million unfulfilled jobs by 2032, according to Harvard Public Health. And McKnight's Senior Living, a trade publication that caters to senior care businesses, found that the labor gap for long-term care is more severe than any other sector in health care, down more than 7% since 2020.'A critical labor shortage'That shortage is primarily driven by a combination of low wages, poor job quality and difficulty climbing the ranks, according to experts.\"This is coming for us, and we are going to have this create an enormous need for long-term care,\" Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Jonathan Gruber told CNBC.Gruber said the country is entering a period of \"peak demand\" for aging baby boomers, creating a situation where rising demand and pay do not sufficiently match up, leading to a \"critical labor shortage.\"On top of that, the jobs at nursing homes are often strenuous and vary in skills depending on the specific needs of each senior, he said, leading nursing assistants to be staffed in difficult jobs that often only pay slightly more than a retail job, despite requiring more training.According to the BLS' most recent wage data from May 2024, the average base salary for home health and personal care aides was $16.82 per hour, compared with $15.07 per hour for fast food and counter workers.\"If we can create a better caring system with an entitlement to all care for those who need it, that will free millions of workers to make our economy grow, so this is a drag on economic growth,\" Gruber said.Pinsker said she saw that shortage play out firsthand. At one of the assisted living facilities she toured for her mother, she noticed nurses wheeling residents into the dining hall for lunch at 10:30 a.m., an hour and a half before lunch would be served, because the home did not have enough caregivers to retrieve them at noon.\"They were bringing them in one at a time, whoever was available, seating them in rows at their tables, and just leaving them there to sit and wait,\" Pinsker said. \"This was their morning activity for these people in this nursing home. … They just don't have enough people to push them around. That's what a staffing shortage looks like in real time.\"Pinsker said her mother was placed in a nursing rehab facility, unable to walk or get out of bed, and that her facility had zero doctors on the premises. Most often, she said the facility was just staffed with business-level caretakers who change bedpans and clothing.\"They don't have enough doctors and registered nurses and physical therapists and occupational therapists and people to come and check blood pressure and take blood samples and that sort of stuff,\" she said. \"They're short on all ends of the staffing spectrum.\"Filling the gapGruber said there are three directions he thinks the country could go in to solve the labor gap: Pay more for these jobs, allow more immigration to fill the jobs or set up better career ladders within the sector.\"It's not rocket science — you've either got to pay more, or you've got to let in way more people. … There are wonderful, caring people all over the world who would like to come care for our seniors at the wages we're willing to pay, and we just have to let them in,\" Gruber said.He's also part of an initiative in Massachusetts focused on making training more affordable for nurses to be able to climb the career ladder and pipelines to fill the shortages, which he said helps staff more people.For Care.com CEO Brad Wilson, an overwhelming demand for senior care made it clear to the company that it needed to set up a separate category of job offerings. Care.com, which is most known for listing child care service jobs, met the demand and rolled out additional senior care options, as well as a tool for families trying to navigate what would work best for their situations and households.Wilson said the company sees senior care as a $200 billion to $300 billion per year category. Now, it's the company's fastest-growing segment.\"We've heard from families that it's an enormous strain as they go through the senior care aspect of these things, because child care can be a little bit more planned, but sometimes your adult or senior care situation is sudden, and there's a lot to navigate,\" he said.Care.com is also increasingly seeing demand rise for \"house managers,\" Wilson said, who can help multiple people in a single household, as caregiving situations evolve.\"I can't underscore enough ... this is the most unforeseen part of the caregiving journey, and it's increasingly prevalent,\" he added.And as the senior population booms, so too does the so-called sandwich generation, whose members are taking care of both their aging parents and their young children. Wilson said his family is in the thick of navigating caring for older family members while also raising three children.\"By 2034, there will actually be more seniors in this country than children,\" Wilson said, citing Census Bureau statistics. \"Senior care is in a crisis. It's actually the very much unseen part of the caregiving crisis today, and we're really trying to bring some visibility to it and share that we have solutions that can help people.\"",

    "body": "An airplane takes off from New York's Laguardia Airport after the FAA ordered flight cuts at 40 major airports amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., November 7, 2025. Ryan Murphy | ReutersAir traffic controllers and technicians with perfect attendance during the government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonuses, the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration said this week.The bonuses will go to 776 controllers and technicians, who will receive notification next week with payments going out by Dec. 9, the FAA and DOT said. There are about 11,000 fully certified air traffic controllers in the U.S., according to their union.\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a release late Thursday.The DOT and FAA didn't immediately say whether preplanned vacation time or fatigue calls would disqualify controllers and technicians from the bonus.An increase in absences of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular paychecks during the more than 40-day shutdown, the longest ever, forced airlines to slow or cancel flights. The shutdown ended Nov. 12 with a bill to fund the government through January.The shutdown's disruptions and additional strain on air traffic controllers, many of whom are already required to work six-day weeks, sparked an outcry from the aviation industry, which urged lawmakers to ensure critical workers aren't left without pay if there's another shutdown.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

It said that 311 employees represented by NATCA qualify for the payments.\"We look forward to working with the Administration to provide the appropriate recognition to those not covered by the Secretary's announcement,\" the union said in a statement.The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists, the union that represents 11,000 FAA and Defense Department workers including technicians, said it is \"reviewing the information that has been provided by the FAA and is evaluating how best to ensure that all employees who worked during the shutdown are recognized.\"Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Transportation Security Administration officers who screen passengers at airports would also receive $10,000 bonuses for perfect attendance.\"Despite tremendous personal, operational, and financial challenges, these dedicated officers showed up to work every day for more than a month, without pay, ensuring the American people could travel safely,\" DHS said in a press release.",

    "body": "A UPS logo on the tail of a cargo jet parked at the UPS Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky, U.S.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe grounding of MD-11 aircraft after the deadly crash of a UPS plane earlier this month could boost air cargo rates during the peak holiday shipping season, with some capacity out of the market, but analysts aren't expecting a big impact.The Federal Aviation Administration on Nov. 8 prohibited flights of MD-11 planes, less than a week after a Honolulu-bound UPS aircraft crashed moments after takeoff from Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport in Kentucky, killing the three crew members and 11 people on the ground.Earlier this week, the TAC Index, which tracks air freight rates around the world, said the Baltic Air Freight Index gained more than 4% in the week ended Nov. 17 and that was it up 2.4% last week compared with the same period last year. \"While it is normal for rates to rise ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday in the US and Christmas in Europe, sources suggested they had been given an added boost after the grounding of all MD-11 freighters following a fatal crash in Louisville earlier this month,\" it said in a note.UPS and FedEx each said they were grounding the aircraft, which make up 9% and 5% of their fleets, respectively, according to a Bank of America note.FedEx said the company is working with the FAA to ensure its 28 MD-11 jets are up to standards. \"We are flexing our integrated air-ground network in the most efficient manner possible to deliver outstanding service, which includes the use of contingency options such as utilizing service recovery spare aircraft in the network, leveraging ground service where feasible, and strategically leveraging limited commercial line haul and charter opportunities,\" the company said in a statement to CNBC.UPS said after the crash that it has contingency plans in place to continue providing service.\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" UPS said on Nov. 7. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"In a Friday statement to CNBC, UPS said the company has not instituted any additional peak season surcharges as a result of the grounding of its 26 MD-11s. Instead, the company said it has secured additional aircraft for its fleet, similar to the leased planes that it procures for the peak season, and has consolidated flight routes to maximize air capacity.\"We have reconfigured our ground network, adding additional capacity to move more packages,\" a UPS spokesperson told CNBC. \"Our contingency plans give us assurance that we'll continue to effectively move volume and deliver for our customers now and throughout peak season.\"On the company's most recent earnings call, which occurred before the fatal crash, CEO Carol Tomé said early forecasts from its top 100 customers signaled the peak season would have a \"considerable surge in volume.\" Still, because UPS has begun to phase out its work with Amazon, previously its largest customer, Tomé added that the decrease in Amazon volumes means the total peak season average daily volume in the U.S. will be down year-over-year.Stifel predicted in a note on Wednesday that the operational and financial impact of the grounding would be \"minimal.\"\"Importantly, aircraft will be back flying once approved individually, rather than the entire MD-11 fleet awaiting a singular ruling, and the FAA can effectively deputize outside parties to effectuate the inspections, which have already begun, according to management,\" the Stifel analysts wrote. Air cargo volumes in October rose 4% year-over-year, with cargo supply growing an average of 3% year-over-year in the past four weeks, Bank of America said in a note Monday. The analysts said any potential disruption from the grounding was not immediately clear, but that, overall, it expected a more muted holiday shipping season compared with the past two years.The National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation into the UPS crash, said the left engine of the jet detached from the wing during takeoff before the plane crashed into a series of businesses just outside of the airport.In its preliminary report it released Thursday, the NTSB said it found evidence of fatigue cracks in the jet, as well as areas of overstress failure.Though UPS is headquartered in Atlanta, the Louisville airport is home to its largest global package handling facility.The crash occurred during the country's longest government shutdown, which promoted disruptions to air travel due to shortages of air traffic controllers. It also limited some cargo flights. Both commercial and dedicated freight companies carry packages and other goods.During the shutdown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told ABC News that the slowdown in cargo could lead to shortages around the holiday. The shutdown officially ended last week, and air travel disruptions have largely dissipated.Correction: The key points of this story have been updated to reflect the number of people who were killed in the UPS cargo plane crash.",

French authorities said Wednesday they were investigating the oil tanker Boracay anchored off the Atlantic Coast and suspected of being part of Russia's clandestine \"shadow fleet\".Damien Meyer | Afp | Getty ImagesOil prices extended declines and energy stocks fell sharply on Friday as U.S. President Donald Trump pushed for a peace deal to end the long-running Russia-Ukraine war. International benchmark Brent crude futures with January expiry slipped 2.2% to $62 per barrel at 3:02 p.m. London time (10:02 a.m. ET). The contract dipped 0.2% in the previous session.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with January expiry were last seen 2.6% lower at $57.46, after closing Thursday off 0.5%.  Europe's Stoxx Oil and Gas index, meanwhile, slipped more than 2.4%. Britain's Shell and BP were both trading around 1.4% lower. Norway's Equinor fell 2.3%, while Germany's Siemens Energy plunged nearly 8%. U.S. oil giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron traded 1.1% and 0.6% lower, respectively, on Friday.The bearish market sentiment comes as investors pore over the details of the Trump administration's push to secure a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. The U.S., under a widely leaked plan, has reportedly proposed that Ukraine cede land including Crimea, Luhansk and Donetsk, and pledge never to join the NATO military alliance.  The plan also says Kyiv will receive \"reliable\" security guarantees, while the size of the Ukrainian Armed Forces will be limited to 600,000 personnel, according to The Associated Press, which obtained a copy of the draft proposal. CNBC has not been able to independently verify the report.Analysts were doubtful that the peace plan, which is thought to be favorable toward Russia, would be backed by Ukraine.

    "body": "A sign with the company logo sits outside of the headquarters of Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, on March 17, 2024.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesEli Lilly reached a $1 trillion market capitalization on Friday, the first health-care company in the world to join the exclusive club dominated by tech firms.Eli Lilly briefly hit the $1 trillion mark in morning trading before retreating. It was last trading around $1,048 a share. Eli Lilly is the second nontechnology company to reach the coveted $1 trillion mark in the U.S. after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.The drugmaker's stock has climbed more than 36% this year as investors applaud the gains it has made over chief rival Novo Nordisk in the GLP-1 drug space. The Indianapolis-based company's stock has been riding the skyrocketing popularity of its weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEli Lilly's stock has soared on the back of the success of its drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.Demand is only expected to grow as approvals for the treatments' uses and insurance coverage expand.The two drugs have driven eye-popping sales growth for Eli Lilly. Last month, the company said Mounjaro drew in $6.52 billion in revenue in the third quarter, a 109% increase from the previous year. Meanwhile, Zepbound posted $3.59 billion in sales during the period, a 184% spike from the prior-year period.Demand for the treatments will only grow as approvals for their use and insurance coverage expand. In addition, Eli Lilly expects an oral version of its popular drugs to hit the market next year, which could give patients a more convenient option than a shot that is easier for the company to produce.Eli Lilly will likely remain a dominant player in the weight loss drug market, which some analysts believe could be worth more than $150 billion by the early 2030s. But despite its recent struggles and leadership shake-ups, Novo Nordisk remains a formidable rival for Eli Lilly in the space. Pfizer also made a push forward in the market, as well, when it won a $10 billion bidding war with Novo Nordisk for obesity drugmaker Metsera earlier this month.The runaway success of Zepbound, MounjaroEli Lilly, a pharmaceutical chemist and Union veteran of the U.S. Civil War, founded his namesake company in 1876. It has long been at the forefront of the diabetes treatment space, introducing the world's first commercial insulin in 1923. Eli Lilly became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange by 1952, and for decades relied on a slate of widely successful products to drive much of its profits and revenue. That included insulins, the antidepressant pill Prozac and the earliest polio vaccine. An Eli Lilly & Co. Zepbound injection pen, March 28, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly hit the jackpot with the May 2022 approval of tirzepatide for diabetes, which is sold as Mounjaro. It started to compete with Novo Nordisk's diabetes injection Ozempic, which had entered the market a few years earlier. But Eli Lilly brought a new way to treat diabetes and eventually, obesity. Tirzepatide works by imitating two hormones produced in the gut called GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 helps reduce food intake and appetite. GIP, which also suppresses appetite, may also improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and its weight loss drug Wegovy, only targets GLP-1. Mounjaro achieved \"blockbuster\" status — meaning it generated more than $1 billion in annual sales — during its first full year on the market. Eli Lilly then won approval in late 2023 for tirzepatide as a treatment for obesity, which is sold as Zepbound and now competes with Novo Nordisk's Wegovy. By 2024, Mounjaro pulled in $11.54 billion in sales, while Zepbound posted $4.93 billion in revenue.More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs",

    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance, Comcast and Netflix formally submitted takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery this week ahead of a deadline for first-round offers, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount Skydance and its advisors had been weighing in recent days whether to submit a higher bid than its previous $23.50-per-share offer that WBD rejected, some of the people said. Both Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal, and Netflix, bid solely for the film and streaming assets, which consists of the Warner Bros. studio and HBO Max, the people said. Netflix's offer was expected to be \"disciplined\" with its bid, one of the people said. The size and structure of the offers weren't immediately clear. Warner Bros. Discovery is aiming to have its sale process wrapped up by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported. Another round of bids is expected to occur in the coming weeks, some of the people said. Representatives for Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Netflix and Comcast declined to comment. Last month Warner Bros. Discovery said it was expanding a strategic review of its business to include a potential sale — even as it carries on with a plan to split into two separate entities: Warner Bros., made up of the film studio and streaming platform, and Discovery Global, which would include the company's pay TV networks like CNN and TNT Sports. While Warner Bros. Discovery's split has been underway, takeover interest from the newly merged Paramount Skydance led WBD CEO David Zaslav and top brass to open up to a formal sale process. The Warner Bros. logo is displayed on a water tower at Warner Bros. Studio on September 12, 2025 in Burbank, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesParamount has already sent multiple letters to WBD's board explaining why its offer of $23.50 per share for all of WBD's assets is in the best interest of shareholders and the company itself. WBD's stock was up about 2% in Friday morning trading at roughly $23.40 per share. The company's share price has increased more than 20% since announcing it was up for sale in October. Paramount CEO David Ellison recently met with Saudi-backed sovereign funds about financing a potential transaction, although the conversations were only preliminary and Ellison and his father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, are prepared to fully finance a transaction, people familiar with the matter said. While Paramount is interested in a deal for the entirety of WBD, the formal sale process has opened up the possibility of a buyer for only part of the legacy media company. If Comcast's offer for the studio and streaming assets were to be successful, Discovery Global would move forward with its spinout and current WBD CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels would become CEO. Comcast President and soon-to-be co-CEO Mike Cavanagh recently telegraphed in an earnings call that an acquisition of studio and streaming assets would be complementary to NBCUniversal. Comcast is currently in the process of spinning out its portfolio of cable networks, which includes CNBC, but will retain NBCUniversal.  — CNBC's David Faber contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "John Williams, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, speaks during an Economic Club of New York (ECNY) event in New York, US, on Thursday, Sept. 4, 2025.David Dee Delgado | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCommunication at the Federal Reserve, particularly at the highest levels, rarely happens by accident.Messages that come out of the top echelon, particularly the chair, vice chair and the powerful New York Fed president, are measured carefully, calibrated between delivering clear ideas about policy without causing undue reaction in financial markets.That's why a speech Friday from the current New York Fed leader, John Williams, mattered so much to markets. With his position comes membership in the Fed's leadership troika, a group that also includes Chair Jerome Powell and Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.So when Williams gave a nod to the likelihood of a \"further adjustment in the near term\" for interest rates, investors took it as a message from on high that the leadership is inclined for at least another rate cut sometime soon, likely at the December meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee.\"There is some ambiguity in the phrase 'near term' – but its most obvious reading is at the next meeting,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a client note. \"And while it is possible that Williams was offering a personal view, signals from the other members of the Fed leadership troika (vice-chairman, NY Fed president) on key live policy issues are almost always approved by the chair and it would be professional malpractice for him to deliver this signal without Powell's sign-off,\" he added.Williams' comments on rates come at an especially sensitive time for the Fed and financial markets.The policymaking FOMC, normally a consensus-driven group sometimes maligned for lacking diversity of thought, has found itself suddenly divided. On one side are officials who see policy as still holding back growth and open for adjustment, while the other is represented by those worrying about inflation who see solid economic growth with no need for further cuts, particularly in light of reductions already in the books from September and October.While Williams provided little insight into the longer-term trajectory of rate expectations, at least in the short term it looks like senior Fed leadership backs a cut.That's particularly important to financial markets that have wobbled lately over fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, coupled with ongoing geopolitical concerns and uncertainty over Fed monetary policy.Stocks rallied Friday, with futures turning around after Williams' comments caused a market repricing toward the expectation of a rate cut in December. Ongoing concerns about AI tempered the rally, but traders continued to place bets on a December move, assigning a 73% chance of a reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.Williams likely saved the market Friday from a potential sell-off that appeared to be taking shape, with stocks outside of tech mostly firm and supporting the major averages on the prospects of lower rates. The major benchmarks were hit hard Thursday and investors feared another big slide was coming Friday. Major averages vacillated through the morning but were at session highs heading into afternoon trading.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, 5 days\"Williams intervention came after several other Fed speakers indicated reservations about [December] but drew back from categorical statements, perhaps indicating they recognize the [December] struggle was turning into a crisis of governance at the Fed and see the need to give Powell space to make the call,\" Guha said. To be sure, other speakers weren't as enthusiastic as Williams.Regional Fed Presidents Susan Collins of Boston and Lorie Logan of Dallas both voiced hesitation about further cuts. In a CNBC interview, Collins expressed concern about inflation. Logan was even more hawkish, saying she wasn't even sure she would have voted for the previous two cuts. Collins votes this year on the FOMC, while Logan gets to vote in 2026.",

Bitcoin has been correlated closely to the price movement of the Nasdaq index.Luke MacGregor  | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBitcoin tumbled as much as 6% early Friday, hovering just above its critical $80,000 support level at one point, as investors continued their flight from risk-on assets to more defensive plays. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization hit $80,548 at around 7:30 a.m. ET. The token's plunge to that price — its lowest since April 11— marks a steepening of bitcoin's decline following widespread cascading liquidations of highly leveraged crypto positions in October. \"Price action has been unimpressive across the large tokens, BTC dipping below the year-start price as long-time and larger holders of the token have become more active,\" Citi analyst Alex Saunders said Friday in a note to clients. \"ETF flows, the main driver of BTC prices, are also drying up, adding to the short-term performance worries.\"Bitcoin has since regained some of its losses to trade down 4% to $82,939.59, according to Coin Metrics. The cryptocurrency has fallen 12% since the beginning of the week and roughly 26% over the last month.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin value year to dateThe token's slide follows mounting pressure in the U.S. stock market, which has led investors to rotate out of volatile assets like crypto and artificial intelligence stocks into safe-havens such as gold. The Nasdaq Composite fell 2% on Thursday, as a rally sparked by Nvidia's blockbuster earnings on Wednesday lost steam. Its fizzling underscores investors' increasing scrutiny of sky-high AI valuations. Investors in AI also often hold bitcoin, linking the two trades.Cryptocurrency stocks were also in the red.

    "body": "Amin Vahdat, VP of Machine Learning, Systems and Cloud AI at Google, holds up TPU Version 4 at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, on July 23, 2024.Marc GanleyGoogle 's AI infrastructure boss told employees that the company has to double its serving capacity every six months in order to meet demand for artificial intelligence services. At an all-hands meeting on Nov. 6, Amin Vahdat, a vice president at Google Cloud, gave a presentation, viewed by CNBC, titled \"AI Infrastructure,\" which included a slide on \"AI compute demand.\" The slide said, \"Now we must double every 6 months.... the next 1000x in 4-5 years.\"\"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Vahdat said at the meeting, where Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and CFO Anat Ashkenazi also took questions from employees.The presentation was delivered a week after Alphabet reported better-than-expected third-quarter results and raised its capital expenditures forecast for the second time this year, to a range of $91 billion to $93 billion, followed by a \"significant increase\" in 2026. Hyperscaler peers Microsoft, Amazon and Meta also boosted their capex guidance, and the four companies now expect to collectively spend more than $380 billion this year. Google's \"job is of course to build this infrastructure but it's not to outspend the competition, necessarily,\" Vahdat said. \"We're going to spend a lot,\" he said, adding that the real goal is to provide infrastructure that is far \"more reliable, more performant and more scalable than what's available anywhere else.\"In addition to infrastructure build-outs, Vahdat said Google bolsters capacity with more efficient models and through its custom silicon. Last week, Google announced the public launch of its seventh generation Tensor Processing Unit called Ironwood, which the company says is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first Cloud TPU from 2018.Vahdat said the company has a big advantage with DeepMind, which has research on what AI models can look like in future years. Google needs to \"be able to deliver 1,000 times more capability, compute, storage networking for essentially the same cost and increasingly, the same power, the same energy level,\" Vahdat said. \"It won't be easy but through collaboration and co-design, we're going to get there.\"Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPichai told employees at the meeting that 2026 will be \"intense,\" citing AI competition and the pressure to meet cloud and compute demand. He also answered a question about a potential AI bubble, a topic that's gained resonance across Silicon Valley and Wall Street of late as investors have grown skeptical about whether the trillions of dollars in anticipated spend in the coming years is justified. The employee question that he read aloud asked, \"Amid significant Al investments and market talk of a potential Al bubble burst, how are we thinking about ensuring long-term sustainability and profitability if the Al market doesn't mature as expected?\" Pichai acknowledged the concerns.\"It's a great question. It's been definitely in the zeitgeist, people are talking about it,\" Pichai said. He then reiterated a point he's made in the past about the risks of not investing aggressively enough, and highlighted Google's cloud business, which just recorded 34% annual revenue growth to more than $15 billion in the quarter. Its backlog reached $155 billion.\"I think it's always difficult during these moments because the risk of underinvesting is pretty high,\" Pichai said. \"I actually think for how extraordinary the cloud numbers were, those numbers would have been much better if we had more compute.\"He said the company follows a disciplined approach, pointing to the strength of the underlying businesses and company's balance sheet. \"We are better positioned to withstand, you know, misses, than other companies,\" Pichai said. Market jittersLooking ahead to next year, Pichai told employees, \"there will be no doubt ups and downs.\"\"It's a very competitive moment so, you can't rest on your laurels,\" he said. \"We have a lot of hard work ahead but again, I think we are well positioned through this moment.\"Google declined to comment.watch nowThe bubble conversation picked up steam ahead of Nvidia's quarterly earnings report on Wednesday. Shares of big AI winners like CoreWeave and Oracle have gotten hammered, continuing a monthlong slide. In an interview with the BBC earlier this week, Pichai said that there are \"elements of irrationality\" in the market and that if a bubble were to burst, \"no company is going to be immune, including us.\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began his commentary on the chipmaker's earnings call on Wednesday by rejecting the premise of an AI bubble, saying that, \"We see something very different.\" Nvidia, which counts Google as a major customer, reported 62% revenue growth, topping estimates, and issued stronger-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter. Still, the markets sank on Thursday, with Nvidia shares sliding 3.2%, pushing the Nasdaq down 2.2%. Alphabet's stock fell 1.2%. Earlier this week, Google launched its newest AI model, Gemini 3, which the company says will provide better answers to more complex questions compared with prior models. Google is in a race with artificial intelligence companies, most notably OpenAI, to get its advanced AI tools in the hands of as many people as possible.However, Pichai said capacity supply is the bottleneck. He gave the example of video generation tool Veo, which the company upgraded last month. \"When Veo launched, how exciting it was,\" Pichai said. \"If we could've given it to more people in the Gemini app, I think we would have gotten more users but we just couldn't because we are at a compute constraint.\"Another highly rated employee question read at the meeting said, \"Capex is accelerating at a rate significantly faster than our operating income growth,\" and asked what the company's strategy is for \"healthy free cash flow\" over the next 18 to 24 months.Ashkenazi, who joined Google as finance chief last year, said the company has a number of prospects, including the potential to bring more customers from physical data centers into the cloud.Broadly, she said, \"The opportunity in front of us is significant and we can't miss that momentum.\"Clarification: This story is updated to more precisely reflect Amin Vahdat's comments on the need to meet demand by both increasing capacity and improving efficiency.

He is not allowed to travel, and his passport has been revoked.He was initially denied bail following his arrest on Nov. 7, with the judge citing flight risk and public safety concerns.David Shrager of Shrager Defense Attorneys, who represents Gillespie, insisted that his client did not break any laws.\"Mr. Gillespie has never contacted a minor, either online or in person, and the facts clearly prove that,\" Shrager said after the hearing on Thursday.\"Completely false statements, including the use of artificial intelligence between adults made in the context of an online fantasy chat, are not illegal,\" he added. Gillespie's next court date is Dec. 18.The Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office said Gillespie sent lewd photos to an agent posing as a father offering his daughter to be abused, and made graphic comments about sexual acts with children.Gillespie, 57, commented on the security of the encrypted platforms being used in the chats between him and the undercover agent, according to a criminal complaint obtained by CNBC.Gillespie is the founder of defense contractor Govini.He was listed on the company's website on the leadership page as a board member as recently as Aug. 17, according to an archived version of the page available on the Wayback Machine. The company terminated Gillespie on Nov. 12.Earlier this year, Govini landed a nearly $1 billion contract with the Department of Defense. The company's suite of artificial intelligence-enabled applications is used by every department of the U.S. military and other federal agencies.Following his arrest, Pentagon officials said they were looking into Gillespie and possible security issues.CNBC has repeatedly asked the Department of Defense about updates on the status of the probe and potential security concerns with Govini or Gillespie.\"We don't comment on ongoing investigations,\" a Pentagon spokesperson said Thursday.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon's 14,000-plus layoffs announced last month touched almost every piece of the company's sprawling business, from cloud computing and devices to advertising, retail and grocery stores. But one job category bore the brunt of cuts more than others: engineers. Documents filed in New York, California, New Jersey and Amazon's home state of Washington showed that nearly 40% of the more than 4,700 job cuts in those states were engineering roles. The data was reported by Amazon in Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification, or WARN, filings to state agencies.The figures represent a segment of the total layoffs announced in October. Not all data was immediately available because of differences in state WARN reporting requirements.In announcing the steepest round of cuts in its 31-year history, Amazon joined a growing roster of tech companies that have slashed jobs this year even as cash piles have mounted and profits soared. In total, there have been almost 113,000 job cuts at 231 tech companies, according to Layoffs.fyi, continuing a trend that began in 2022 as businesses readjusted to life after the Covid pandemic. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has been on a multiyear mission to transform the company's corporate culture into one that operates like what he calls \"the world's largest startup.\" He's looked to make Amazon leaner and less bureaucratic by urging staffers to do more with less and cutting organizational bloat.Amazon is expected to carry out further job reductions in January, CNBC previously reported. Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during an unveiling event in New York, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe company said it's also shifting resources to invest more in artificial intelligence. The technology is already poised to reshape Amazon's white-collar workforce, with Jassy predicting in June that its corporate head count will shrink in the coming years alongside efficiency gains from AI. Human resources chief Beth Galetti, in her memo announcing the layoffs, focused on the importance of innovating, which the company will now have to do with fewer people, specifically engineers. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before,\" Galetti wrote. \"We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.\"Amazon said in a statement that AI is not the driver behind the vast majority of the job cuts, and that the bigger goal was to reduce bureaucracy and emphasize speed.Jassy said on Amazon's earnings call last month that the cuts were in response to a \"culture\" issue inside the company, spurred in part by an extended hiring spree that left it with \"a lot more layers\" and slower decision-making.The layoffs impacted a mix of software engineer levels, but SDE II roles, or mid-level employees, were disproportionately affected, the WARN filings show. The AI boom is making software development jobs harder to come by as companies adopt coding assistants or so-called vibe coding platforms from vendors like Cursor, OpenAI and Cognition. Amazon has released its own competitor called Kiro.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia is king in AI chips, but Google and Amazon want to catch up by making their ownGoogle must double AI compute every 6 months to meet demand, AI infrastructure boss tells employeesFeds charge 4 in plot to export restricted Nvidia chips to China, Hong KongJoby lawsuit accuses air taxi rival Archer of using stolen information to ‘one-up’ deal'Significant role reductions'More than 500 product managers and program managers were eliminated as part of the layoffs, based on records from the states with WARN notices, representing more than 10% of the total. Senior manager and principal level roles were also swept up in the cuts, the filings show. As part of the broader belt-tightening, Amazon has sought in recent years to curtail investments in some of the company's more experimental or unprofitable initiatives. It sunset a telehealth service, kids video calling device, fitness wearable and several brick-and-mortar retail chains. Amazon's video game division was targeted in the company's latest layoff wave, California WARN filings show. Steve Boom, vice president of Audio, Twitch and Games, told staffers in a memo viewed by CNBC that \"significant role reductions\" would occur in its San Diego and Irvine, California, game studios, as well as within its central publishing team. watch nowGame designers, artists and producers made up more than a quarter of the total cuts in Irvine, and they were roughly 11% of staffers laid off at Amazon's San Diego offices, according to filings.The company also told staffers it's halting much of its work on big-budget, or triple A, game development, specifically around massively multiplayer online, or MMO, games, Boom wrote. Amazon has released MMOs including Crucible and New World. It was also developing an MMO based on \"Lord of the Rings.\"Beyond its gaming division, Amazon also significantly cut back its visual search and shopping teams, according to multiple employee posts on LinkedIn. The unit is responsible for products like Amazon Lens and Lens Live, AI shopping tools that enable users to find products via their camera in real time or images saved to their device. The company rolled out Lens Live in September.The team was primarily based in Palo Alto, California, and Amazon's WARN filings indicate that software engineers, applied scientists and quality assurance engineers were heavily impacted across its offices there.Amazon's online ad business, one of its biggest profit centers, was downsized as well. More than 140 ad sales and marketing roles were eliminated across Amazon's New York offices, accounting for about 20% of the roughly 760 positions cut, according to state documents viewed by CNBC.

    "body": "Oil drilling rigs and support equipment stand on the tundra in Deadhorse, Alaska, on Friday, Sept. 5, 2025. Nathaniel Wilder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration unveiled plans Thursday for a huge oil drilling expansion off the coasts of Alaska, California and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior proposed 34 lease sales to drill in those waters through 2031, a big expansion compared to the Biden administration program that allowed just three lease sales and only in the Gulf. The Trump program would include lease sales in 21 areas off Alaska's coast, six off the Pacific coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico. It would mark the first time since 1984 that Interior has allowed a new lease in the Pacific, according to the Congressional Research Service.  Interior's proposal is not a final program. It still must undergo further review. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum accused the Biden administration \"crippling the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production\" by slamming the brakes on oil and gas leasing. More than 100 Democratic lawmakers expressed their opposition to the plan in an Oct. 30 letter addressed to President Donald Trump and Burgum. \"Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines,\" the lawmakers wrote. The Natural Resources Defense Council condemned the Trump plan as egregious and reckless in a post Thursday. \"The proposal would open up untouched waters of Alaska to drilling, attempt to resurrect the offshore oil and gas industry in California, and offer up waters off the coast of Florida that haven't been put up for leasing in decades — in addition to adding even more leasing in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the NRDC said. \"This plan would damage these places, and the people who rely on them, for generations,\" the environmental group said.

    "body": "Shoppers walk past a GAP fashion retail store on Oxford Street on October 30, 2025 in  London, United Kingdom.  John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesApparel retailer Gap said Thursday its comparable sales rose 5% during the fiscal third quarter, driven by strong revenue at its namesake brand after its viral \"Better in Denim\" campaign with girl group Katseye. Putting aside pandemic-related spikes, the rise in comparable sales is the strongest growth for Gap since its fiscal 2017 holiday quarter and is well ahead of Wall Street expectations of 3.1%, according to StreetAccount. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Richard Dickson said the company hasn't needed to discount as often to sell products, it's winning customers from all income cohorts and it's seeing a \"great start\" to the holiday shopping season. \"While external data points to macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are finding our price value, [and] our styles are breaking through the competitive landscape,\" said Dickson. \"Our product is resonating. So we're very confident as we head into the holiday season.\" Shares of Gap rose 5% in extended trading Thursday. Here's how the largest specialty apparel company in the U.S. performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $3.94 billion vs. $3.91 billion expectedThe company's net income during the three months ended Nov. 1 declined nearly 14% to $236 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with $274 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.94 billion, up 3% from $3.83 billion a year earlier. For Gap's fiscal year, which is slated to end around early February, the company is now guiding to the high end of its previously released sales forecast, expecting sales to rise between 1.7% and 2%, in line with analyst expectations. It previously expected sales to rise between 1% and 2%.The company is now expecting its full-year operating margin to be around 7.2%, compared to its previous range of between 6.7% and 7%. The forecast includes the impact of tariffs, estimated to be between 1 and 1.1 percentage points. Comparable sales across Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic, have been positive now for seven straight quarters. Under Dickson, the company has been as focused on boosting profitability and fixing operations as it has been on reigniting cultural relevance, which has led to sustained sales growth across the portfolio. Gap's profitability had been growing, too, as a result, but now that it's facing tariffs, the retailer's gross margin and net income are both taking a hit. During the quarter, Gap's gross margin fell 0.3 percentage points to 42.4% but still came in higher than expectations of 41.2%, according to StreetAccount. The 14% decline in Gap's net income was primarily related to tariffs, finance chief Katrina O'Connell said in an interview. Gap's better-than-expected results come as apparel sales remain generally soft across the industry and consumers pull back on nice-to-have items like new clothes in favor of necessities. Aside from clear value players like Walmart and TJX Companies, earnings so far this season have been muted, with some companies blaming macroeconomic conditions and expressing caution about the holiday season. Dickson said Gap's varied portfolio gives it a hedge in uncertain economic times because it can capture shoppers in a variety of different places. \"Our portfolio appeals to a wide range of consumers, which is giving us great flexibility in today's environment,\" said Dickson. Here's a closer look at how each of the company's brands performed: Gap Gap's namesake brand has been the focus of Dickson's turnaround strategy since he took the helm as CEO just over two years ago. During the quarter, comparable sales rose a staggering 7% – more than double the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Revenue rose 6% to $951 million. During the quarter, Gap released its viral \"Milkshake\" campaign, featuring the early-aughts Kelis song and members of the Katseye pop group. The campaign helped sales, but Dickson said Gap brand's growth is \"a story about consistency\" and a mix of better product, marketing and partnerships. Old Navy Sales at Old Navy, Gap's largest brand by revenue, rose 5% to $2.3 billion with comparable sales up 6%, far better than the 3.8% that analysts surveyed by StreetAccount expected. The company said it saw growth in key categories like denim, activewear, kids and baby. Banana Republic The elevated, work-friendly brand is still in turnaround mode but saw sales grow 1% to $464 million during the quarter with comparable sales up 4%, better than the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. This was the second quarter in a row Banana reported positive comparable sales, which the company attributed to better marketing and product. Athleta Both revenue and comparable sales at Athleta were down a whopping 11% to $257 million, an eyesore on Gap's otherwise better-than-expected results. Dickson has repeatedly said Athleta is in a reset year, but how long that reset will take remains unclear. \"We have been disappointed in the trend. We understand there's a lot of work to do, but I really do believe in the brand,\" said Dickson. \"I believe in the leadership and we will continue to build this brand for the long term. It does deserve it.\"",

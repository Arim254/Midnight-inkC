    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A pedestrian passes in front of the Saks Fifth Avenue at Brookfield Place in New York.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSaks Global named a new CEO on Friday as the retailer is reportedly on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy protection.The parent of high-end department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which is privately held, will now be led by Richard Baker, the company's executive chairman, Saks said in a news release. He will continue to hold the executive chairman role.With the shake-up, three-decade long Saks executive Marc Metrick will leave the company. The news release said Metrick's is departing \"to pursue new opportunities.\"In a statement, Baker said he will work \"to secure a strong and stable future for our company.\"\"Across Saks Global, with our deep industry expertise, well-established relationships within the luxury sector, and talented employees, we will strengthen our position so that we can capitalize on the many opportunities we see for our company in the luxury market,\" he said.Saks is preparing to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its 2024 acquisition of department store chain Neiman Marcus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.It's the latest twist in the luxury department store operator's effort to regain its financial footing. Saks Global was created in 2024 after Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson's Bay Co. acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion. By marrying the two luxury chains, it sought to better compete with other retailers and department stores including Nordstrom and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's.The deal turned Saks Global into a larger player, which included Saks Fifth Avenue, its off-price chain Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus' namesake department store chain and Bergdorf Goodman. Yet the company has taken clear steps to raise cash and shore up its finances, including the recent sale of Neiman Marcus' Beverly Hills flagship and Saks Global's debt restructuring in August 2025.In his biography on Saks Global's website, the company credited Baker for leading the acquisition of Neiman Marcus and described his strong real estate background. Baker is an owner of National Realty & Development Corp., one of the largest real estate development companies in the United States, and he previously served as the chairman of the board of directors for Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., which he also converted into a real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq.

Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe new year is starting off with the stock market looking as split as it did last year. The first trading day of 2026 kicked off Friday, with the stock market as bifurcated as it had been in recent months. Though the S&P 500 started the session higher, carried aloft by semiconductors, it has since sputtered and turned lower as the day wore on. The broad market index was last down by 0.1%. A look inside the S&P 500 shows a major division. Five sectors in the broad market index are higher, led by industrials, energy and utilities that were each higher by more than 1%. Six sectors were lower, led by consumer discretionary and communication services. The day's trading is a continuation of a theme that has gained strength in recent months. While the bull market rally of the last three years has been defined by artificial intelligence, traders, nervous tech stocks will find an uphill climb more difficult in 2026, started rotating into other groups. Indeed, the Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy exposure toward tech companies, ended last year with two straight months of losses.  Many strategists called for a broadening out of the stock market, with companies more sensitive to the economic cycle taking the mantle from tech to lead the market in 2026. They viewed that as a healthy development to extend the bull market.But that could mean an advance for the overall index is harder to come by. Broadly speaking, according to the 2026 CNBC Market Strategist Survey, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 will climb by roughly 11% in 2026 — a respectable rise that nevertheless falls short of the advance of the last three.Others on the Street are more nervous. On Wednesday, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian noted the S&P 500 is expensive, meaning \"risks to the index abound in 2026.\" The strategist's 7,100 year-end target for the S&P 500 is among the lowest of those surveyed. Elsewhere, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this past week that the level of optimism on the Street has him nervous for 2026. \"I think the consensus is pretty bullish,\" Parker said. \"You're betting on strong earnings growth, and I don't know if that's as likely.\" Within the tech trade, chip stocks were the lone bright spot. As of midday trading, Nvidia was the only name among the Magnificent Seven companies to rise, up by 1.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF gained nearly 3%. Micron rallied more than 7%, while AMD rose more than 3%. ",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

In a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"Meanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop. Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications. Read moreTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.The stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

Instead, the duties on upholstered furniture will remain at 25% — the level Trump set in September.Before Trump's 11th-hour reversal, the levies for this furniture type were slated to rise 30% with the start of 2026. He pointed to ongoing trade discussions as the reason for pushing back tariff increases.Trump called tariffs an \"overwhelming benefit\" to the U.S. and said in a Friday morning social media post that the country losing its ability to place duties on others would be a \"terrible blow.\" His comments come as the White House awaits a decision from the Supreme Court about the legality of many of Trump's new levies.Furniture suppliers have been under Wall Street's scrutiny as Trump's focus on broad and steep levies on imports has raised concerns about rising costs. But stocks in the sector fared vastly differently as investors determined how trade policy changes and other variables would affect each business.Wayfair surged more than 125% in 2025 as value-focused retailers gained traction among consumers. On the other hand, West Elm and Pottery Barn parent Williams-Sonoma slid more than 3% last year. RH — whose chief executive garnered attention in April as he reacted live to the stock tanking — ended the year down more than 50%.\"Oh, sh--,\" RH CEO Gary Friedman said on the California-based company's earnings call in April.\"It got hit when, I think, the tariffs came out,\" Friedman added. \"Everybody can see in our 10-K where we're sourcing from, so it's not a secret, and we're not trying to disguise it by putting everything in an Asia bucket.\"",

    "body": "It's one of the most important questions surrounding the Federal Reserve in 2026, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pointedly mum.\"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair,\" Powell said at the December press conference. \"I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"The question: whether Powell will remain on the Fed once his chairmanship ends in May. He will have two years left on his term as governor and Powell himself has invited the speculation by repeatedly refusing to answer the question.It's a question being asked on Wall Street as Fed watchers try to game out the makeup of the rate-setting Open Market Committee and whether appointees of President Donald Trump will have control of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. And it's being asked in the Treasury Department and the White House, where they are trying to figure out how many slots on the board Trump will have to fill this year, who might fill them and when those slots will be available.It's a question that has not been asked in decades because prior chairs, like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, slid quietly off the board into other government positions, retirement or the private sector with time remaining on their governor terms. That the question about Powell is even unclear is a sign of the times with a president who, in unprecedented ways, openly seeks control of Fed policy and a Fed chair who has defiantly resisted that encroachment and tried to protect the Fed's independence.Fed observers interviewed by CNBC said they see it as a wrenching decision for Powell that pits the personal against the professional. A golfer, avid guitar player and relatively new grandfather, Powell is thought to be more than ready for civilian life after 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair. For much of those eight years, Powell endured withering public criticism from the president, who named him as chair.But after that lengthy tenure, Powell also holds deep loyalty to the institution and concern about its fate under the challenges posed by a president who has virtually eliminated the independence of multiple government entities. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower rates and made clear that his nominee needs to agree with him or they \"will never be Fed Chairman.\"Most of those interviewed by CNBC, who said they had no personal knowledge of what Powell would decide, said they believe Powell will likely leave the Fed when his term as chair ends in May. None, however, would rule out some possibility that Powell would decide to stay, perhaps for a short time. Only former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles stayed on as a governor when his 14-year tenure as chair ended in 1948. As a governor, Eccles was instrumental in striking the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord that ended the Fed's obligation to keep rates low and helped establish the modern notion of Fed independence. The Trump administration wants to lower rates, in part, to reduce the cost of servicing the U.S. debt.On one level, the decision for Powell is a simple one of math. Three Trump appointees currently sit on the seven-member board of governors. If Powell leaves that would immediately hand the president the majority of the board. If they voted as a bloc — an uncertain assumption — it could go a long way toward delivering the president his call for ultra-low interest rates.Of more concern, the Federal Reserve Act appears to give the board's majority the ability to fire individual bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. There is some doubt about whether the firing could be done without cause, but Powell's continued presence on the board, even if he were in the minority, could help stave off such extreme outcomes.Among those interviewed by CNBC, some suggested the outcome of Fed Gov. Lisa Cook's case could weigh on Powell's decision. Trump fired Cook amid an allegation of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Courts have stayed the firing and allowed Cook to remain in office. The Justice Department has not brought charges against Cook.But the Supreme Court will hear the case on January 21 with a decision sometime after that. If Cook is removed, that would immediately give Trump the majority. The question is whether it comes with broad authority from the Supreme Court for the president to remove other board members. In that case, Powell would likely be next on the president's attack list.Much of the concern, however, assumes a worst-case scenario that might not be warranted. There is no guarantee that governors appointed by the president will do his bidding. For example, all three Trump-appointed governors just voted to reappoint all 12 district bank presidents to new five-year terms, though the board would still have the power to remove them individually.One area of speculation is whether Powell is attempting to exercise leverage over the administration. By not revealing his choice, Powell could be sending a message that he would stay if the president nominates extreme candidates but would go if he deems them reasonable. There is no evidence that Powell is actually thinking that way. Powell has remained generally apolitical on fiscal issues during his tenure and has not responded publicly to the president's frequent insults.All of which leads several Fed observers to believe Powell will ultimately leave when his tenure as chair is up. Staying would be on overtly political move, one that would buck recent institutional tradition and open the Fed to even greater political criticism. Powell would then be undermining the very institution he was trying to preserve by staying.Another theory: Powell's refusal now to say what he will do could be considered a simple, symbolic exercise of independence, reiterating that it's his legal right to decide when he leaves and he will announce his intentions when he's ready.",

Jesus Vargas | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, his wife and four other people with narco-terrorism conspiracy and other charges was unsealed and posted online by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday morning after the couple's dramatic capture by American forces in their own country.\"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment alleges.The indictment was filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In addition to Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, the indictment also charges Maduro's son, Nicolas Ernesto Maduoro Guerra, Diosado Cabello Rondon, Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, and Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores. Read the indictment here.\"Nicolas Maduro Moros, the defendant, now sits atop a corrupt, illegitimate government that, for decades, has leveraged government power to protect and promote illegal activity, including drug trafficking,\" the indictment said.\"That drug trafficking has enriched and entrenched Venezuela's political and military elite, including Minister of the Interior, Justice and Peace Diosado Cabello Rondon, the defendant, and former  Minister of the Interior and Justice Ramon Rodriguez Chachin, the defendant.\"Guerrero was identified as the leader of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.In addition to the narco-terrorism conspiracy charge, the indictment alleges four other criminal counts: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, blasted the attack on Venezuela and its rationale\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie wrote in a post on the social media site X.",

    "body": "watch nowWarren Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway is better positioned than any company to endure over the long term as he handed over the CEO reins to his successor Greg Abel, whom he strongly endorsed. \"It has a better chance I think of being here 100 years from now than any company I can think of,\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview, parts of which aired on CNBC Friday.The full interview with Buffett will air on CNBC Tuesday, Jan. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.Buffett officially relinquished the CEO role to Abel Thursday, ending a six-decade legendary run at the helm that turned a struggling textile mill into a trillion-dollar conglomerate with varied businesses from insurance companies to railroads with over $300 billion in cash on the balance sheet. \"Greg will be the decider,\" Buffett said. I \"can't imagine how much more he can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month....I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"Berkshire shares trailed the market after Buffett announced in May he was retiring as some investors questioned whether Abel could manage the sprawling collection of businesses, along with an equity portfolio, in a similar fashion as Buffett, while commanding a premium valuation from the market.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, 1 yearBuffett, who will remain chairman, noted that Abel is a sensible leader, who, like him, lives a normal life away from the spotlight.\"He's not a distorted individual. You know, I mean, he likes to play ice hockey with his kids,\" he said. \"If the neighbors didn't know who he was, they wouldn't have any idea that on Jan. 1, he's going to be the decider on a company that employs close to 400,000 people, and has got plans to be around 50 or 100 years from now.\"The 95-year-old investor also signaled a quieter public role going forward, saying he will not take the stage at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting this year, a notable shift from a tradition that has drawn tens of thousands of investors to Omaha for decades.\"Everything will be the same,\" Buffett said. \"I will come in. I won't be up there speaking at the annual meeting, but I'll be in the directors' section.\"",

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs. We're going to grow.\"Read more CNBC auto newsGM's record stock performance beats Tesla, Ford and other automakers in 2025EV realism is here.

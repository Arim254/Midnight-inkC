The interviews will be led by Bessent and include two senior Treasury officials and two senior White House officials.</p><p>With Bessent focused on the World Bank/IMF meetings in Washington next week and then traveling to Asia with President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> on an extended trip, the officials said the interview process might not be wrapped up until after Thanksgiving.</p><p>The secretary then intends to send a smaller list to Trump, who will make the final decision. It is likely, however, that this person will first be nominated to be a Fed governor and then nominated later to be Fed chair.</p><p>The reason is outgoing Fed Chair <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/jay-powell/\">Jerome Powell</a>, whose term ends in May, sits in a governor's seat that has only two years remaining. The seat of former Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, now occupied by Stephen Miran, has a term that ends in January and would allow the new Fed chair to be nominated to a seat with a full 14-year governor's term.</p><p>But the officials said that strategy was not decided and there were other possibilities.</p><p>The president has already named Warsh, Hassett and Waller as finalists for the job, so only Rieder and Bowman would be new recommendations to the White House.</p></div><div><p>Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income, speaking at the Delivering Alpha conference in New York City on Sept. 28, 2023.</p><p>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</p></div><div><p>Compared with previous administrations, the Trump administration has been running a more open process for the next Fed chair, announcing candidates <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/13/trump-considering-11-candidates-for-fed-chair-including-david-zervos-and-rick-rieder-sources-say.html\">as the list grows</a> and, now, shrinks.</p><p>At the same time, the administration, led by the president himself, has been highly critical of Fed policy, repeatedly urging it to lower rates sharply. The president had threatened to remove Powell and actually fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, accusations she denies.</p><p>Cook's firing has been blocked by lower courts, and the case <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/supreme-court-trump-fed-lisa-cook.html\">will be heard in January by the Supreme Court</a>. The attempts to oust Cook have raised concerns about the administration's commitment to Fed independence, raising the stakes for the new chair appointment and making it a closely followed decision.</p></div><h2><a></a>BlackRock's Rieder impresses</h2><div><p>The Treasury officials also for the first time provided some insight into Bessent's thinking about the criteria used to decide who to pick for the job.</p><p>Bessent is said to be seeking someone who is open to new ideas about how to run the Fed and monetary policy, and has experience in economics, monetary policy, banking regulation and management.</p><p>The secretary recently penned an essay sharply critical of the Fed and called for reviews of the central bank's policy, structure and mission.</p><p>Among his critiques was that the Fed had grown too big and experienced mission creep. That suggests he would prefer a candidate willing to pare down both the Fed's size and roll back its use of some tools, especially quantitative easing.</p><p>The officials said no candidate was leading the pack, but they confirmed recent reports that Rieder had impressed Bessent.</p><p>Rieder, a frequent guest on CNBC, has been a well-known fixture on Wall Street for years. His analysis of the fixed income market and the Fed are widely read. He also manages a large department at BlackRock. While not decisive, the officials suggested it could be a plus that Rieder, alone among the five remaining candidates, has never worked at the Fed.</p></div></div>",

They're callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.\" </p><p>\"Here's what's worse: Republicans would rather see thousands of Americans lose their jobs than sit down and negotiate with Democrats to reopen the government,\" Schumer said.</p><p>Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, in a statement said, \"I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.\"</p><p>\"Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,\" Collins said. \"Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.\"</p><p> A spokesman for the <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Health and Human Services Department</a>, in a statement to CNBC, said, \"HHS employees across multiple divisions have received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown.\"</p><p>\"HHS under the Biden administration became a bloated bureaucracy, growing its budget by 38% and its workforce by 17%,\" department spokesman Andrew Nixon said.</p><p>\"All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions. HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" Nixon said.</p><p>A union representing federal workers, the <a href=\"https://www.afge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Federation of Government Employees</a>, quickly replied to Vought's tweet, writing, \"The lawsuit has been filed.\" AFGE, the largest federal employee union, represents 820,000 workers, some of whom work for the District of Columbia.</p><p>\"America's unions will see you in court,\" the AFL-CIO said in its own tweet.</p><p>Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, in a statement obtained by NBC News, said, \"These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day.\"</p><p>\"Whether it's food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration's political games,\" Saunders said.</p><p>Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials.</p><p>The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it.</p><p>Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.</p></div><div><p>Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces.</p><p>Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday.</p><p>The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.</p><p>Although Republicans hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they need the votes of at least some Democratic senators to pass a funding bill because of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate required to avoid filibusters blocking legislation.</p></div></div>",

Friday evening, Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/10/trump-trade-tariffs-china-software.html\">announced</a> on social media that he would put an extra 100% tariff on imports.</p><p>Earnings season kicks off on Tuesday, starting with quarterly results from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BLK/\">Blackrock</a><span><span></span></span></span>, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Cramer said all three have had solid runs this year, and they \"aren't exactly in the crosshairs of the trade war.\" He suggested Goldman Sachs might have \"the biggest upside surprise.\" JPMorgan and Citigroup will report that day, and Cramer said he's optimistic about the results from both banks.</p><p>Tuesday also brings earnings from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ/\">Johnson & Johnson</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ/\">Domino's Pizza</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Cramer said he expects the pharmaceutical giant to report the best quarter of the sector, but indicated the pizza maker could miss the estimates.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/\">Bank of America</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS/\">Morgan Stanley</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABT/\">Abbott Laboratories</a><span><span></span></span></span> are set to report on Wednesday, and Cramer noted that Morgan Stanley has been surprisingly positive for the last several quarters. He also said Abbott Laboratories is usually reliable.</p><p>Wednesday also brings analyst meetings from Salesforce and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DLTR/\">Dollar Tree</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Cramer noted that both companies' stocks have been under pressure as of late — with Salesforce weighed down by worries about its artificial intelligence offerings and Dollar Tree burdened by new tariffs.</p><p>Trucking giant <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JBHT/\">J.B. Hunt</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL/\">United Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> are set to report Wednesday, and Cramer said these two could provide a solid read on the economy as investors largely lack economic data due to the government shutdown.</p><p>On Thursday, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSM/\">Taiwan Semiconductor</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CSX/\">CSX</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SCHW/\">Charles Schwab</a><span><span></span></span></span> will report earnings. Cramer said he expects largely positive figures from Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures chips for industry leaders <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD/\">AMD</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Cramer said CSX will likely explain its recent leadership shakeup, while Schwab can give insight to retail participation in the market.</p><p>Friday brings quarterly reports from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP/\">American Express</a><span><span></span></span></span> and oil giant <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SLB/\">SLB</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Shares of American Express tend to decline right after earnings, Cramer said.

But certain higher earners soon won't have a choice, thanks to a change enacted via the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/401k-changes-2025.html\">Secure 2.0 Act</a> of 2022.</p><p>Starting in 2026, 401(k) catch-up contributions generally must be after-tax Roth if you earned more than $145,000 from your current employer during the previous year. </p></div><div><p>In the meantime, older workers can choose between traditional and Roth 401(k) catch-up contributions, assuming their plan offers both options.</p><p>While traditional deferrals offer an upfront tax break, you will pay regular income taxes on future withdrawals. By comparison, there is no tax deduction for Roth contributions, but the funds grow tax-free.</p><p>\"Now is the time to work with your advisor or tax preparer to run multi-year tax projections,\" said certified financial planner Patrick Huey, owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon. </p><p>This could help you decide whether to accelerate pretax catch-up contributions through 2025 or embrace Roth contributions sooner, experts say.</p></div><h2><a></a>Pick between pretax and Roth 401(k)</h2><div><p>In 2024, nearly all retirement plans offered catch-up contributions, but <a href=\"https://institutional.vanguard.com/content/dam/inst/iig-transformation/insights/pdf/2025/has/2025_How_America_Saves.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">only 16% of eligible workers</a> made these deferrals, according to a 2025 Vanguard report based on more than 1,400 plans and nearly 5 million participants.</p><p>Most catch-up contribution participants earned $150,000 or more, the report found.</p></div><div><p>However, the choice between Roth vs. pretax catch-up contributions may depend on several factors, including current and expected <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/irs-2025-federal-income-tax-brackets.html\">future tax brackets</a>, experts say. You may also consider your effective tax rate — total tax relative to earnings — in retirement or legacy planning goals.</p><p>The \"key takeaway\" for investors is, \"do not sit on the sidelines\" as the rules change, said CFP Jared Gagne, assistant vice president and private wealth manager with Claro Advisors in Boston.  </p></div></div>",

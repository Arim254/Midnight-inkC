    "body": "Aerial view of Mt. Fuji, Tokyo Tower and modern skyscrapers in Tokyo on a sunny day.Yongyuan | E+ | Getty ImagesJapanese stocks have been hitting record highs on the back of renewed confidence in domestic politics and the ruling administration's economic agenda, but experts warn of a disconnect between the stock market and economic fundamentals.Japan's Nikkei 225 has notched several firsts in recent days, crossing 56,000, then 57,000 and nearing 58,000, fueled by the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide victory in the Lower House.Japan's stock market, which is closed on Wednesday for a holiday, saw the Nikkei hit a high of 57,960 on Tuesday. The index is up about 15% so far this year.Political optimism has become a key pillar of the rally that has been catalyzed by Takaichi's strong electoral mandate, said market watchers. Stock investors have welcomed the prospect of higher spending, tax relief and a more assertive economic agenda. However, analysts caution that enthusiasm may be running ahead of clarity on how those policies will be funded, and that Japan's current equity market foundations look increasingly fragile: vulnerable to currency moves, global shocks and a growing gap between prices and fundamentals.Richard Harris, chief executive officer at investment management firm Port Shelter, said the market's current gains are difficult to justify purely on economic strength: \"It's not really driven by fundamentals. If you're looking at how the currency is moving, how the economy is doing … there's nothing really particularly strong on it to justify the move in the market.\"On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Japan's economy shrank 0.4% in the three months to September, contracting for the first time in six quarters, government data released in November showed. It contracted 1.8% on an annualized basis. The country is the most indebted nation in the world, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of almost 230% in 2025, data from the International Monetary Fund showed, and increased fiscal spending risks piling more debt.The government in November approved a fiscal stimulus package of over $135 billion, warranting increased borrowing.Harris said sentiment, liquidity and narrative were the dominant forces steering the market. \"We've seen that in other markets too,\" he said, adding that Japan was not unique in breaking records amid global enthusiasm for equities and AI-related investment.AI and yen uncertainty Moody's senior economist Stefan Angrick echoed that the AI boom had lifted stocks globally, and that was visible in Japanese equities as well.\"The current situation probably looks a little bit fragile in the sense that valuations are driven by the global equities boom,\" Angrick told CNBC.Japan's heavy exposure to global manufacturing and capital goods has made it a prime beneficiary of the AI build-out. But that linkage also leaves the market sensitive to any cooling in global tech enthusiasm, or to shifts in its currency that has quietly done much of the heavy lifting, he said.That sensitivity has become more apparent in recent months, worries over an AI bubble have led to market volatility, including in Japanese stocks. Last week, the software sector saw a sell-off after artificial intelligence company Anthropic released new AI tools designed to handle complex professional workflows that many software firms offer as core services.What also makes the current level of valuation a bit fragile is the yen, Angrick added. The yen has weakened quite a bit in the past year, which tends to be positive for equities in Japan given how a sizable proportion of the market comprises exports-reliant manufacturers.A weaker yen boosts earnings and inflates equity valuations, but that could fade over time. \"The yen is trading very far from fundamentals. Basically, it's too weak. It's unreasonably weak,\" he said.The Japanese yen has weakened about 3.67% against the dollar in the last six months, data from LSEG showed.Japan has signaled that it could intervene if the yen slide continues, with Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama even conveying concerns to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent over the yen's \"one-sided depreciation.\" Aberdeen Investments expects the yen to appreciate from a gradual increase in real rates as inflation is set to slow more than is currently appreciated.Angrick also anticipates the currency to strengthen. \"The expectation is that over the medium term,  the yen should appreciate, and that we'll see equity valuations come down a little bit,\" adding currency normalization could \"take quite a big chunk out of where equities are right now.\"However, that is not to say that Japan's stock market boom has no legs. Structural reforms in recent years, particularly around corporate governance, capital efficiency and shareholder returns, have provided durable growth, experts said. Companies have stepped up share buybacks, unwound cross-shareholdings and focused more aggressively on return on equity, a shift encouraged by the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Some asset managers argue that Japan's corporate fundamentals remain broadly supportive, but only if expectations are met.Zuhair Khan, portfolio manager at Union Bancaire Privée, said the rally is \"genuine\" to the extent that a strong, stable government gives the market confidence, but warned that prices already assume progress that has yet to materialize. \"The market is already pricing in some improvements that have not yet happened,\" he said, citing expectations for asset sales, buybacks and margin improvement. That leaves little room for disappointment.\"If the pace of improvement slows down, then there is downside risk,\" Khan said.",

CSL on Wednesday reported its net profit after tax plunged 81% year on year to $401 million for the six months ended December, as the drugmaker booked one-off restructuring costs and asset impairments. Revenue dropped 4% to $8.3 billion. The company said it was also impacted by government policy changes, but did not elaborate on that in its earnings release.\"We are clearly not satisfied with our performance and have implemented a number of initiatives to drive stronger growth going forward,\" said Ken Lim, CSL's chief financial officer.The company, one of the world's largest producers of flu vaccines, had a market cap of $58.9 billion as of Tuesday, data from LSEG showed. It highlighted that the seasonal influenza vaccine market in the U.S. was expected to fall by 6%-8% due to lower immunization rates.CSL said it expects results to improve in the second half of the year and kept its full-year outlook unchanged, forecasting modest growth in revenue and profit. The company also expanded its share buyback program by $250 million to $750 million. Headquartered in Australia, CSL operates globally, with major operations across the United States, Europe and Asia. Its stock fell about 39% last year.",

    "body": "Walmart Inc. signage during the company's listing at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 9, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEstée Lauder sued Walmart in California federal court over allegations the big-box retailer sold counterfeit beauty products on its website and didn't do enough to ensure only authorized and authentic merchandise was offered to consumers. Estée Lauder said it purchased, inspected or tested a number of products sold on Walmart.com that used  the Le Labo, La Mer, Clinique, Aveda, Tom Ford and Estée Lauder trademarks but were determined to be fakes, according to the suit, filed Monday. The products include counterfeit versions of Estée Lauder's Advanced Night Repair serum, a Le Labo fragrance, a Clinique eye cream, a La Mer lotion, an Aveda hair brush and a Tom Ford fragrance. xemplars of the Estée Lauder Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintIt's unclear when Estée Lauder bought and tested the products but the suit comes several months after CNBC published an investigation into counterfeit beauty products and fraud on Walmart.com. Two of the counterfeit products cited in CNBC's investigation — Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair serum and Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Eye Cream — were also mentioned in Estée Lauder's lawsuit. It's unclear if the products cited in the suit are the same counterfeits CNBC provided to Estée Lauder. In response, Walmart initially told CNBC in a statement it requires \"all sellers to offer only authentic, lawful merchandise\" and it doesn't tolerate \"bad actors\" on its platform. It then recalled the message and sent an abbreviated statement to CNBC two hours later that removed that language. \"We are aware of the complaint and have zero tolerance for counterfeit products,\" the revised statement read. \"We will respond appropriately with the court when we are served.\" Estée Lauder didn't return a request for comment. Exemplars of the Clinique Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintWhile the products were sold by third-party sellers on Walmart's online marketplace, Estée Lauder said the company played an active role in facilitating those sales to shoppers in its suit. The legacy beauty company called Walmart's conduct \"extreme, outrageous, fraudulent … despicable and harmful.\" The counterfeit products were promoted and advertised to shoppers on the platform, Estee Lauder's trademarks were used in search engine optimization tools to drive traffic to the listings and Walmart profited from the sales, the complaint stated. Further, \"a person shopping on Walmart.com would have reasonably believed that Walmart, and not third-party sellers, was the seller\" of the item, which could have caused confusion among shoppers, the complaint states. At the heart of CNBC's investigation into Walmart's online marketplace was the steps the company took, or didn't take, to vet its third-party sellers and the products they were offering to prevent fraud and the sale of fakes on the platform. Exemplars of the La Mer Accused Products.U.S. District Court ComplaintIn its complaint, Estée Lauder said Walmart promoted the \"reputation and professionalism\" of the sellers permitted to operate on the platform but said the retailer actually does \"very little to ensure that only authorized and authentic products are available\" for sale. \"This is readily apparent given the [counterfeits] were permitted to be sold on Defendants' website despite their stated careful selection process in who they choose as a Marketplace seller/partner,\" the complaint states. \"Accordingly, Defendants know or had reason to know that the sellers they partnered with and 'regularly review[ed]' were selling products which infringe upon the Estée Lauder Marks.\" Walmart's online marketplace has become a key part of its strategy to grow profit faster than sales and better compete against its longtime rival, Amazon. The rapid growth of the online platform helped fuel Walmart's ascent to a $1 trillion market cap last week, putting it in an exclusive club made up almost entirely of technology companies. However, the strategy has come with risks, CNBC's investigation revealed. Offering counterfeit, potentially dangerous, products to shoppers through third-party sellers on the marketplace opens Walmart up to liability and could erode the customer trust at the core of its brand. Exemplars of the Le Labo Accused ProductsU.S. District Court ComplaintEver since a 2010 court ruling that arose after Tiffany sued eBay over counterfeit products on the platform, it can be tough for brands to hold platforms accountable for their role in selling counterfeit goods. Sometimes, they avoid lawsuits unless the conduct is extreme or particularly flagrant, experts previously told CNBC.The Shop Safe Act, a bipartisan federal bill that aims to curb the sale of fakes on online marketplaces, is designed to address some of the issues posed by the Tiffany v. eBay ruling by incentivizing platforms to better vet sellers and the products they're offering. When platforms comply with certain anti-counterfeiting measures, they could be shielded from liability if a seller offers a fake product. Brands widely supported the legislation, but it has so far failed to pass at least three times. That's partially because Walmart and other online marketplaces like Amazon, Etsy and eBay have lobbied against aspects of it, two U.S. Senate aides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private, previously told CNBC. ",

The xAI co-founder exodus comes as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year. A University of Toronto professor, Ba was credited for critical research that influenced the company's Grok version 4 AI models. Besides Ba and Wu, other co-founders including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy, have also departed Musk's artificial intelligence venture. Greg Yang announced last month that he would be stepping back from his role to focus on his battle with Lyme disease.The record-setting, all-stock deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire his social network X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The departures also come as xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S. The probes were initiated after the company's Grok AI chatbot and image generator allowed mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.WATCH: SpaceX deal to aquire xAI 'adresses critical bottlenecks around AI', says Baillie Gifford Tim Garrat",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) speaks after departing federal court on Feb. 3, 2026 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury in Washington, D.C., declined a request by prosecutors to indict two Democratic U.S. senators, Mark Kelly of Arizona and Michigan's Elissa Slotkin, on charges of seditious conspiracy, MS Now reported Tuesday night.The attempted indictment of Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and the former CIA analyst Slotkin related to a video in November that they made with four other Democrats in Congress, on which they reminded members of the U.S. military that they have the right to refuse to follow illegal orders by superiors. The video was released on social media in response to ongoing extrajudicial killings by the U.S. military of crews of boats in the Caribbean and Pacific that allegedly were carrying narcotics.The New York Times reported that federal prosecutors also tried and failed to obtain indictments against the other four Democrats, in addition to Kelly and Slotkin. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, who is a former Navy reservist, and Rep. Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, a Navy veteran, later indicated they were among the six reportedly targeted in the indictment effort.The other two Democrats who made the video were Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, who was an Army Ranger, and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, who is a former Air Force officer.It is extremely unusual for a grand jury to refuse to issue an indictment when a prosecutor seeks one. An indictment is a charging document that a grand jury will issue if jurors agree there is probable cause to believe a crime was committed.President Donald Trump had condemned the Democrats for the video after it was made public on Nov. 18.Trump at the time accused them of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social then.Kelly, who is also a former NASA astronaut, blasted the effort to indict him.\"This is an outrageous abuse of power by Donald Trump and his lackies,\" Kelly said in a post on X on Tuesday.\"It wasn't enough for [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth to censure me and threaten to demote me, now it appears they tried to have me charged with a crime — all because of something I said that they didn't like. That's not the way,\" Kelly said.Kelly is suing the Pentagon to challenge its censure of him and its effort to reduce his rank because of his participation in the video.Slotkin, in a statement, said, \"Today, U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro attempted to persuade a Grand Jury to indict me. This was in response to me organizing a 90-second video that simply quoted the law.\"\"Pirro did this at the direction of President Trump, who said repeatedly that I should be investigated, arrested, and hanged for sedition,\" Slotkin said. \"Today, it was a grand jury of anonymous American citizens who upheld the rule of law and determined this case should not proceed. Hopefully, this ends this politicized investigation for good.\"\"But today wasn't just an embarrassing day for the Administration. It was another sad day for our country,\" she said.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday night that he believes the six Democrats who made the video on illegal orders to the military should be indicted.Goodlander, in a statement, said, \"President Trump directed the Justice Department to investigate me, arrest me, and hang me simply for doing my job.\"\"Today an American grand jury honored our Constitution by standing up to an outrageous abuse of presidential power and taxpayer dollars,\" Goodlander said. \"No matter the threats, I will keep doing my job and upholding my oath to our Constitution.\"Deluzio, in a statement, said, \"I will not be intimidated for a single second by the Trump Administration or Justice Department lawyers who tried and failed to indict me today. American citizens on a grand jury refused to go along with this attempt to charge me with a crime for stating the law in a way Trump and his enablers didn't like.\"\"They may want Americans to be afraid to speak out or to disagree — but patriotism demands courage in this moment. DON'T GIVE UP THE SHIP!\" Deluzio said.",

    "body": "Chinese consumers are experiencing \"luxury shame\" similar to what happened in the U.S. during the 2008-09 financial crisis, according to a June Bain and Company report.Jade Gao | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's consumer inflation rose less than expected in January while the deflation in producer prices persisted, in a sign of continued deflationary pressure in the absence of stronger stimulus.The consumer price index rose 0.2% in January from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, below economists' forecast of 0.4% increase in a Reuters poll. That followed a 0.8% growth in December, its highest level in nearly three years.Prices rose 0.2% month-on-month, below economists' forecast of a 0.3% increase.Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, jumped 0.8% from a year earlier, easing from the 1.2% in December. China's producer price index declined 1.4% from a year ago, better than economists' expectations of a 1.5% drop, official data showed, moderating from a 1.9% drop in December. On a month-on-month basis, producer inflation rose 0.4%, improving for a fourth straight month, partly driven by the surge in global gold prices in recent months. Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said the data was distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which falls in mid-February this year after taking place in January last year. \"This mismatch makes interpretation of macro data difficult,\" Zhang said. Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro, echoed the view on holiday-related distortions, noting that \"last January had more holiday-related price strength baked in, whereas this January does not.\" \"It makes far more sense to treat January and February as a combined read rather than dissecting them individually,\" Wong noted.     The deflation in factory-gate prices has persisted for more than three years, weighing on the profitability of manufacturers who have weathered tepid consumer confidence and production disruptions stemming from U.S. trade policies for much of last year.The world's second-largest economy grew 5% last year, in line with Beijing's official target, thanks to resilient export growth to non-U.S. markets. China has struggled to shake deflationary pressure since the end of the pandemic, weighed down by a prolonged property downturn and uncertain job-market prospects. Authorities have sought to curb price wars across industries, where overcapacity has fueled a glut of goods and forced companies to cut prices.Policymakers prefer investments to be the key growth driver while considering stimulus measures to support consumption as a \"one-time boost\" that adds to their debt burden, Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note Wednesday. The deflationary pressure and property slump have led China's fiscal revenue-to-GDP ratio to decline by 4.8 percentage points since 2021, to 17.2%. Meanwhile, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has expanded by 40 percentage points since 2019, to 116% in 2025, according to the Wall Street bank.That is still lower than the U.S. federal debt-to-GDP ratio of 124% in 2025, according to official data. Top policymakers are expected to unveil economic targets for the year at a parliamentary meeting next month. In a policy report on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China reiterated its determination to implement \"appropriately loose\" monetary policies to shore up the economy and guide prices towards \"a reasonable recovery.\" ",

    "body": "Gabriel Bouys | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Vatican Bank Tuesday launched two equity indexes tracking stocks that align with Catholic values. Its first foray into thematic investment products sets the bank up to potentially roll out other financial products, including ETFs in the future.  The bank, which reports to the Committee of Cardinals and the Pope, said Tuesday in a statement that the Morningstar IOR Eurozone Catholic Principles Index and the Morningstar IOR U.S. Catholic Principles Index include 50 medium and large-cap firms deemed to be consistent with Catholic ethical criteria, including prioritizing human bonds and social justice. \"Having benchmarks built in accordance with recognized Catholic ethical criteria allows us to make our performance assessment and reporting processes even more rigorous and transparent,\" Giovanni Boscia, Vatican Bank deputy director general and CFO, said in the statement. \"This initiative reaffirms our commitment as a financial institution serving the Church, further strengthening the role of the [Vatican Bank] as a reference point for the Catholic world.\"The Eurozone fund counts semiconductor supplier ASML Holding and telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom among its top holdings, while the US-based index's largest holdings include Meta Platforms and Amazon. Their rollouts also open up the possiblity the indexes could be licensed for use in an exchange traded fund.  The debut comes as investors' appetite for ETFs and other thematic investment products grows. The global ETF market increased nearly 30% to top $14 trillion in 2024, per PricewaterhouseCoopers. And, the combined value of those funds could hit as much as $30 trillion by 2029, according to a PwC report dated March 2025. Meanwhile, investment products rooted in social responsibility and other themes are appealing to certain slice of investors. The Ave Maria Mutual Funds, a fund family that allocates capital in accordance with Catholic teachings, said it had $3.8 billion in assets under management as of last year, per its website.  The Vatican Bank has been working to reform its image after a series of scandals. The Holy See-linked financial institution has faced several allegations of money laundering and ties with organized crime, particularly after the collapse of Milan-based Banco Ambrosiano in 1982. In 2021, former Vatican Bank president Angelo Caloia was found guilty of money laundering and embezzling millions of euros in connection with his role at the institution. ",

We were on family vacation,\" he said.The secretary's admission came as he faces bipartisan calls to resign following the release of records showing that his business and personal relationship with Epstein was more extensive than previously known.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick testifies during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on February 10, 2026 in Washington, DC. Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls for his resignation after revelations that came to light in the latest release of Epstein files. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLutnick previously said that he cut off contact with Epstein after 2005 — years before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a state-level charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution, which required him to register as a sex offender.But analyses of the latest batch of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice show Lutnick and Epstein were in communication years later.In December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to lunch on his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, the documents showed. The two men also had business dealings as recently as 2014, CBS News reported.Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.The White House expressed confidence in Lutnick Monday after multiple lawmakers, including Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, demanded his ouster.Following Lutnick's testimony Tuesday, press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a White House briefing that President Donald Trump continues to stand behind his Commerce chief.In his testimony Tuesday morning before the Appropriations panel's subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, Lutnick insisted that he \"barely had anything to do with that person.\"\"I'm glad to be here to make it clear that I met Jeffrey Epstein when he moved, when I moved to a house next door to him in New York,\" the Cabinet secretary testified.\"Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall, two times,\" Lutnick said. \"So six years later, I met him, and then a year and a half after that, I met him, and never again.\"\"Probably the total — and you've seen all of these documents, of these millions and millions of documents — there may be 10 emails connecting me with him. ... Over a 14-year period.\"\"I did not have any relationship with him,\" Lutnick said.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the subcommittee's ranking member, replied, \"There's not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It's the fact that you ... misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements suggesting that you cut off all contact, when, in fact, you had not.\"Asked by Van Hollen if he saw anything inappropriate during his visit to the island, Lutnick said that he did not.\"The only thing I saw with my wife and my children and the other couple and their children was staff who worked for Mr. Epstein on that island,\" he testified.Van Hollen asked if Lutnick would commit to sharing with Congress his own records relating to Epstein in order to \"ensure that the file is complete.\"\"I will surely talk about that. Hadn't thought about that,\" Lutnick said, adding, \"I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing.\"",

    "body": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer (R) talks with then-ambassador to the United States Peter Mandelson during a welcome reception at the ambassador's residence on February 26, 2025 in Washington, DC.Carl Court | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe release of further Epstein files last week triggered a series of events that left U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer fighting for his political life, despite the fact that he never knew the late financier and sex offender.Starmer is under pressure over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as U.S. ambassador, despite knowledge of Mandelson's connections to Epstein. The latest document release by the U.S. Department of Justice revealed more messages between Mandelson and Epstein, including after Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida to a state charge of felony solicitation of prostitution, a case that involved an underage girl.Starmer, who is facing calls to step down, has apologized to the victims of Epstein for believing Mandelson's \"lies.\"Here's the latestStarmer's Cabinet ministers have sought to rally around him, who has faced growing anger from opposition parties and members of his own party over the decision to appoint Mandelson.Two resignations in quick succession had ratcheted up the pressure, with Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, and communications director, Tim Allan, both stepping down.Downing Street Chief of Staff Morgan McSweeney arrives into Downing Street on October 06, 2025 in London, England.Leon Neal | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe furor led Anas Sarwar, who leads Starmer's Labour Party in Scotland, to call on Starmer to resign. \"The distraction needs to end and the leadership in Downing Street has to change,\" Sarwar said at a press conference on Monday.Starmer held a pivotal meeting with Labour members of parliament afterwards, in which he reportedly said he was \"not prepared to walk away.\"A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office was not immediately available for comment.Who is Peter Mandelson?Mandelson has been a key figure for the center-left Labour Party for decades, playing a pivotal role in the so-called \"New Labour\" movement that saw Tony Blair become prime minister after a landslide election victory in 1997.Known as a behind-the-scenes fixer and nicknamed the \"Prince of Darkness,\" Mandelson was a Labour member of parliament from 1992 to 2004 and served in Blair's cabinet.He left parliament to become a European Commissioner before returning to Britain in 2008 to work with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, having been appointed to parliament's unelected House of Lords.U.S. President Donald Trump along with Peter Mandelson, then-British Ambassador to the United States, on May 8, 2025 in the White House. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAfter becoming prime minister in July 2024, Starmer appointed Mandelson as ambassador in Washington that December, a role he described at the time as \"a great honor.\" The appointment was controversial as Mandelson had twice previously resigned — in 1998 and 2001 — over scandals: one about not declaring a loan and another about allegedly influencing a passport application.Starmer fired Mandelson from the ambassadorship in September, after Downing Street said new information had come to light about the extent of his association with Epstein.The subsequent release of millions of files from the U.S. Department of Justice last week showed further links between Mandelson and Epstein. They prompted accusations that Mandelson had sent market-sensitive government information to Epstein following the 2008 global financial crisis.One exchange appeared to show Mandelson giving Epstein advance notice of an impending 500 billion euro bailout for banks in 2010.In a statement to U.K. broadcaster Sky News last month, Mandelson apologized for remaining friends with Epstein following his 2008 conviction.\"I was not culpable, I was not knowledgeable for what he was doing, and I regret, and will regret to my dying day, the fact that powerless women were not given the protection they were entitled to expect,\" he said.Markets react U.K. government borrowing costs jumped on Monday, amid growing pressure on Starmer. By Tuesday, after many Cabinet ministers rallied around the prime minister, yields on U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, were moving lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt was 3 basis points lower at 4.496%, while the 30-year gilt yield also fell by 4 basis points to settle at 5.309%.\"Uncertainty over Keir Starmer's future is unhelpful for U.K. bond markets, particularly since inflation is on track to fall quite sharply in the coming months and the Bank of England appears to be gearing up to cut interest rates as soon as March, with one or two further cuts later in the year,\" Charlie Lloyd, head of investments at Shackleton Advisers, said in a Monday note. Starmer's resignation would trigger a contest within the Labour Party to replace him as leader, which \"would almost certainly lead to short-term volatility in U.K. bond markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing through higher yields,\" Lloyd added. \"A prolonged contest could impact the economy if gilt yields traded at a premium to other bond markets for an extended period, not to mention the potential impact on consumer confidence,\" he continued.Who could replace Starmer? Former Deputy Prime Minister of the Labour party, Angela Rayner, delivers a speech during Labour's North West Regional Conference at the Titanic Hotel on January 25, 2026 in Liverpool, England.Ryan Jenkinson | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIf Starmer resigned, a leadership contest to replace him would start and involve a series of votes whittling down the candidates. If Starmer refused to resign but a challenger gained enough support to trigger a leadership vote, the prime minister and that challenger would be put to the ballot. Either process could take weeks. Among the potential candidates to replace Starmer are left-leaning Angela Rayner, who resigned as deputy prime minister last autumn after a tax scandal, the current health minister, Wes Streeting, and former party leader Ed Miliband.Andy Burnham, the current mayor of Greater Manchester, was recently blocked from standing in a special election that could have seen him return to parliament — paving the way for a potential leadership challenge.Despite Burnham's popularity, investors are wary of a pivot away from efforts by Starmer and his finance minister, Rachel Reeves, to shore up the U.K.'s public finances. Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, said in a note on Tuesday that Burnham \"polls strongly\" but \"whether his successful regional economic policies translate into successful national policies is an open question — his past snipes that the U.K. is 'in hock to the bond markets' have alarmed investors.\"Pickering said the fact that Rayner remained under investigation for her tax affairs \"hurts her chances — and risks the narrative of replacing one scandalised PM with another.\"  But he added: \"Her popularity within the party suggests she may be able to consolidate the left with the moderates.\"",

Here's how the artificial intelligence infrastructure and semiconductor company did compared to LSEG consensus estimates:Earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 51 cents expectedRevenue: $271 million vs. $250 million expectedRevenue in the fourth quarter rose 92% year over year. However, some analysts were expecting the company to report revenue in excess of $280 million for the period.Astera Labs reported $45 million in net income for the quarter, an 82% increase from $24.7 million the year before. The company said it expects first-quarter revenue to come between $286 million and $297 million, higher than Wall Street expectations of $259 million.\"We started the company eight years ago to really service the cloud and AI infrastructure space,\" Astera Labs CEO Jitendra Mohan told CNBC on Tuesday. \"And fortunately for us, the space is on fire.\"Mohan attributed the earnings beat to growth in its Scorpio fabric switch and its Taurus ethernet cables, which accounted for 30% of total revenue collectively.\"Increasingly, the bottleneck is shifting from compute to connectivity, and connectivity is where we play,\" Mohan said. \"So it gives us a lot of opportunity to continue to grow and beat the overall market growth rate in the AI space.\"In addition to reporting earnings, the company also announced that finance chief Mike Tate will be stepping down. Desmond Lynch, currently the finance chief at semiconductor company Rambus, will replace Tate, effective March 2. Tate will remain at Astera Labs as a strategic advisor to the CEO.Additionally, Astera Labs on Tuesday said it had issued a new warrant for Amazon to buy about $466 million in the chip company's stock. Amazon owned $43 million in Astera Labs shares as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.Astera Labs also announced a research and development center in Israel on Monday.\"We are really bottlenecked by the availability of resources more than anything else,\" Mohan said. \"So opening a design center in Israel is one step towards getting access to the talent pool that is available.\"Astera Labs was founded by former Texas Instruments executives in 2017.

Economists expect that January's nonfarm payrolls report will show growth that was nil or not much better during the month. On top of that, annual revisions also could reveal that the U.S. economy going back to early 2024 had generated few if any net jobs, casting further doubt on the health of the labor market.\"I think zero would be the forecast,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The consensus is probably around 50,000. Anything around zero just shows you how fragile things are, just very weak. This is all happening with no layoffs, but layoffs are going to pick up. I think we could get job losses here pretty soon.\"The payrolls report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It was delayed five days due to the brief government shutdown.watch nowOfficially, the Dow Jones consensus forecast is calling for payroll gains of 55,000, a number that has been trending lower and would come after a December increase of 50,000. That is expected to be good enough to keep the unemployment rate at a still-low 4.4%, with annual wage gains of 3.7%.However, a number of Wall Street economists are predicting a below-forecast number. Goldman Sachs, for instance, expects an increase of just 45,000. On the other side, Citigroup is projecting a gain of 135,000, but one that it attributes to seasonal distortions, with \"appropriately adjusted payroll growth ... closer to zero.\"Wiping out previous gainsThen there are the revisions, a nettlesome problem for the Bureau of Labor Statistics as it struggles to get timely and relevant data. Last September, the BLS estimated in its preliminary adjustment that benchmark revisions for the year prior to March 2025 would show 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, or about half the total. The bureau will report the final number Wednesday, with expectations that the final count will be less than that but still significant. Goldman, for instance, estimated the number to be between 750,000-900,000, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a few weeks ago that it could be closer to 600,000. Every month of 2025 reported so far has seen downward revisions, taking initially reported estimates down by 624,000 and leaving average monthly payroll gains of less than 40,000. Wednesday's report will feature the first revision for December's count. The BLS also is adjusting the model it uses to estimate jobs created by businesses opening and closing during the month, which also could play with the numbers.In any event, the revisions will show a stumbling labor market that likely will get further attention from Powell and his colleagues as they plot their next policy move.Lowering expectationsEven White House officials have been spending time this week trying to tamp down expectations.Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director who was a finalist to become the next Federal Reserve chair, told CNBC that several factors are converging to keep payroll growth low, at least for the time being.Primary among them is the administration's efforts to tackle illegal immigration. Hassett also cited rising productivity stemming from artificial intelligence improvements that is restraining businesses' need to hire.\"I think that you should expect slightly smaller job numbers that are consistent with high GDP growth right now. ... One shouldn't panic if you see a sequence of numbers that are lower than you're used to,\" he said Monday. \"Because, again, population growth is going down and productivity growth is skyrocketing. It's an unusual set of circumstances.\"Hassett added that there could be a scenario where \"job creation lags, productivity skyrockets, profits skyrocket, GDP skyrockets.\" watch nowThere have been other signs of labor market deterioration lately.Job openings plunged in December to their lowest level since September 2020, according to the BLS. At the same time, planned layoffs and hires both had their worst January since the global financial crisis in 2009, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Also, ADP reported private hiring of just 22,000 in January. On the bright side, Homebase reported that small businesses added jobs at a 3.3% rate last month, better than the 3.1% level in January 2025 and well above the 1.3% for the same month in 2024.From the Fed's perspective, policymakers look at employment trends over a period and not a month at a time. Most officials are expecting slowing hiring coupled with a low level of layoffs that, rather than suggesting a material weakening, point more to stabilization. In speeches Tuesday, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland both said they think the economy is progressing well but are more worried about inflation than unemployment. They also cast doubt on the need for further interest rate cuts.\"Rather than trying to fine-tune the funds rate, I'd prefer to err on the side of patience as we assess the impact of recent rate reductions and monitor how the economy performs,\" Hammack said. \"Based on my forecast, we could be on hold for quite some time.\"",

    "body": "Justin Tallis | Afp | Getty ImagesThroughout its history, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been subject to significant price fluctuations, whether that's due to larger macro factors impacting all asset classes or during \"crypto winters\" tied to industry concerns.But with a crypto-friendly Trump administration and expectations for passage of a cryptocurrency market structure bill, many onlookers expected another bull run in digital assets to start 2026. However, it's been the exact opposite. Bitcoin is down more than 21% so far this year, and it fell to $60,062.00 last week — its lowest level in roughly 16 months. That marked a drop of nearly 50% from its record back in October 2025.What is driving this latest decline? Rather than a single event, Galaxy founder and CEO Mike Novogratz said at the CNBC Digital Finance Forum on Tuesday in New York City that it's a reflection of a larger industry shift. When bitcoin fell 22% in less than a day back in November 2022 following the collapse of FTX, there was a \"breakdown in trust,\" Novogratz told CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos at the event. \"This time, there's no smoking gun,\" he said. \"You look around like, what happened?\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin price since the start of 2026Novogratz did note the wipeout that occurred in October 2025 as a significant event, when more than 1.6 million traders suffered a combined $19.37 billion erasure of leveraged positions over a 24-hour period, a situation that he said, \"wiped out a lot of retail and market makers\" and put plenty of pressure on prices.\"Crypto is all about narratives, it's about stories,\" he said. \"Those stories take a while to build and you're pulling people in … so when you wipe out a lot of those people, Humpty Dumpty doesn't get put back together right away,\" he said.But Novogratz also sees something more lasting he expects to come out of the current downturn, saying the recent era of crypto investing, \"the age of speculation,\" will be phased out going forward as the crypto industry has brought in \"institutions where people have a different risk tolerance.\"\"Retail people don't get into crypto because they want to make 11% annualized,\" he said. \"They get in because they want to make 30 to one, eight to one, 10 to one.\"Some traders will always speculate, Novogratz says, but overall, \"it's going to be transposed or replaced by us using these same rails, these crypto rails, to bring banking [and] financial services to the whole world. And so, it's going to be real world assets with much lower returns.\"He also pointed to tokenized stocks as assets that will have \"a different return profile.\"Sigalos asked Novogratz if the eventual passage of the CLARITY Act could be a catalyst for the industry, with the stall in the crypto market structure bill's momentum on Capitol Hill at least a short-term headwind. He is confident a crypto market structure bill will eventually become law.\"I talked to [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer two nights ago and he said 'We're going to pass the goddamn CLARITY Act,'\" Novogratz said. \"The Democrats want to pass the act, and the Republicans want to.\"Novogratz said the crypto industry needs the bill for \"a lot of reasons,\" but notably, \"We need it for spirit back in the crypto market.\"watch now",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff participates in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 21, 2026.Chris J. Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOver 1,400 Salesforce employees have signed a letter calling on CEO Marc Benioff to drop potential business with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, two people familiar with the effort told CNBC.\"We are deeply troubled by recent press reports describing Salesforce pitches of AI technology to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to help the agency 'expeditiously' hire 10,000 new agents and vet tip-line reports,\" the letter reads.The letter calls on Benioff to cancel \"all active pitches or 'opportunities' for ICE enforcement and hiring\" and issue a public statement demanding the removal of masked agents in U.S. cities.The Salesforce employee letter is the latest example of tech workers raising concerns about the U.S. agency's use of their companies' services after ICE agents killed U.S. citizens Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti in Minnesota in January.Earlier on Tuesday, Benioff joked about ICE being present at an employee gathering in Las Vegas, 404 Media reported. The incident led employees to criticize the comments in an internal Slack forum, the two people told CNBC.Letter signatories are asking Salesforce to tell workers what kinds of services it is providing to ICE and \"pause or prohibit infrastructure, AI systems or services that enable ICE operational scale-up.\"\"We are concerned that Salesforce products and services may be enabling ICE to expand recruitment, onboarding and operational capacity,\" reads a supplementary document to the letter, which CNBC viewed. The document cited an October New York Times report saying that Salesforce described its software as an \"ideal platform\" for ICE agent recruitment in a response to a request for information.The letter from employees comes at a difficult time for the company. Investors have been concerned about the possibility of AI models hurting the growth prospects of software companies, including Salesforce. Its stock is down about 27% so far in 2026. In December, the company touted its work with the U.S. government and called for growth between 9% and 10% in the current fiscal year, which would be up slightly.Wired reported about the letter earlier Tuesday. Salesforce did not immediately provide comment.watch nowThe letter from Salesforce employees comes after 900 Google employees asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection as of last week. Business leaders including Apple CEO Tim Cook have also decried the behavior of ICE agents in clashes with protesters. \"Employees face real personal and professional risk when Salesforce is perceived as enabling ICE, including reputational harm, social targeting or being misidentified as complicit in activities they oppose,\" the supplement reads. \"At the same time, employees cannot make informed decisions about their work when the scope, governance and boundaries of Salesforce's relationship with ICE are opaque.\"Organizers plan to send the letter to Benioff by Friday, according to the document. The letter credits Benioff for saying in October that he did not believe the National Guard needed to deploy to San Francisco, where Salesforce has its headquarters and holds its annual Dreamforce conference. One week earlier, The New York Times reported that Benioff supported President Donald Trump's idea of bringing troops to the city. In May, the U.S. General Services Administration said Salesforce offered discounts on Slack, its team communication software, to a slew of government agencies. Adobe, Microsoft and ServiceNow also extended price cuts for use of their software across the U.S. government.In October, Benioff held a conversation with Trump's artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, David Sacks, and in November, the Salesforce CEO attended a dinner with the president at the White House alongside other technology executives. He posted a photo of himself with Attorney General Pam Bondi on X.\"Marc, you have often said that 'business is the greatest platform for change,'\" the letter reads. \"Today, that platform must be used to defend our neighbors' constitutional rights and the safety of our communities.\"",

    "body": "2026 Ford Mustang Dark Horse SC on display during the Media Preview of the 2026 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place on February 6, 2026, in Chicago, Illinois.Jacek Boczarski | Anadolu | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Ford Motor reported its largest quarterly earnings miss in four years in its fourth-quarter results released Tuesday, while guiding for 2026 to be a rebound year for the automaker.Ford's 2026 guidance includes adjusted EBIT of between $8 billion and $10 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year; adjusted free cash flow of between $5 billion and $6 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2025; and capital expenditures of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion, up from $8.8 billion.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 13 cents adjusted vs. 19 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $41.83 billion expectedThe EPS coming in 32% below consensus was the company's first quarterly miss since 2024 and its worst since a 42% difference when reporting its 2021 fourth-quarter results, according to LSEG.The earnings miss was largely due to unexpected tariff costs of roughly $900 million related to credits for auto parts not taking effect as early as expected, the company said. Ford, as of Dec. 15, had confirmed $7.7 billion in earnings before interest and taxes for the fourth quarter, but the additional costs dropped that to $6.8 billion.Ford CFO Sherry House said the lower-than-expected earnings were also related to additional impacts from fires at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant last year in New York, which now isn't expected to be fully operational until the middle of this year. The plant supplies Ford's lucrative F-Series pickup trucks.\"We will see a billion-dollar benefit roughly in 2026; however, this year, due to the Novelis impact, we're going to have tariffs increasing in order to secure aluminum that is roughly the same amount of that savings,\" House told reporters.Ford's net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year at $2 billion in 2026, she said. The Novelis fire had an impact of $2 billion during the second half of the year for Ford, she added.House and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's 2025 results continue to demonstrate the company's underlying business is improving despite the special items impacting results.The company's 2025 revenue was a record $187.3 billion, up 1% from $185 billion a year earlier. That includes $45.9 billion during the fourth quarter, down 5% from a year before.On a business unit level, the automaker's traditional and fleet operations are expected to offset an expected $4 billion to $4.5 billion in losses this year for its \"Model e\" electric vehicle unit. Pre-tax earnings from its \"Ford Pro\" fleet business are expected to be between $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, followed by $4 billion to $4.5 billion for its traditional \"Blue\" business.On an unadjusted basis, the company's net loss of $8.2 billion last year was its largest since the Great Recession in 2008, according to FactSet. That included $15.5 billion in special charges during the fourth quarter largely related to a pre-announced pullback in its all-electric vehicle plans.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $11.1 billion, or a loss of $2.77 per share, compared with net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the same period in 2024. Adjusted for the one-time charges, the company reported earnings of 13 cents per share.",

    "body": "Ask anyone what they think keeps a relationship strong, and they will probably tell you it's love. There's some truth to that: love is what draws us together in the first place.But after years of studying couples as a psychologist, and as a husband, I've realized something that research keeps confirming: The real factor that keeps couples together, long after the honeymoon phase fades, is compromise.Love alone isn't enoughPsychologists define love as an emotion. And like all emotions, love fluctuates with stress, sleep, health, and the thousand of other factors that shape our daily lives.So you can love your partner deeply and still get annoyed, frustrated, or angry with them. Love won't shield you from conflict, nor will it solve your disagreements.That's why even the happiest couples argue and have rough patches, regardless of how much love they have for each other. The difference is that strong couples know love can't fix everything — but compromise can.The psychology of compromiseCompromise happens when you balance what you want, what your partner wants, and what's best for the relationship itself.Every couple brings together a set of habits, values, and experiences. Expecting perfect alignment is unrealistic. Instead, healthy couples learn to negotiate their reality. They turn \"my way\" and \"your way\" into \"our way.\"But compromise only works when it's rooted in a strong sense of we.Research shows that couples who describe their conflicts using \"we\" language (we decided, we talked, we figured it out) feel more connected and satisfied after disagreements. When both partners see compromise as a shared effort, not a loss, it strengthens the bond between them.What compromise looks like in real lifeCompromise doesn't always look romantic. Sometimes it means agreeing to watch a movie you'd never choose yourself. Other times, it means listening to your partner vent about something while resisting your desperate urge to offer solutions.In my own marriage, I've learned that a relationship rarely demands massive sacrifices. Instead, you'll be presented with the choice of whether or not you're willing to meet your partner halfway.Today, it might be who takes on which chores. Tomorrow, it might be about how you spend your evening together. Next month, it might be about how you navigate your family holidays. It might involve finding middle ground, taking turns, or agreeing to something else that neither of you had considered. What matters is that you're both heard and respected, and that no one feels that they have to \"win\" or \"be right.\" When you consistently make enough space for one another's needs, you'll build something that love alone rarely does: reliability.

    "body": "The earlier you invest, the more time your money has to grow. But figuring out the exact accounts to use can feel overwhelming.After setting aside money to cover daily expenses in a checking account and three to 12 months of expenses in a savings account, you should start looking into putting any additional income into three different investment \"buckets,\" says Jaime Bosse, a certified financial planner and senior advisor at CGN Advisors in Manhattan, Kansas.\"If you have too much in cash, you're actually losing money to inflation,\" Bosse says. \"Any extra dollars you have should be invested in growing for the future.\"With three investment accounts, you'll have more flexibility to tap your money when you need it and more control over your tax bill now and later because each \"bucket\" offers different benefits, Bosse says. How to best allocate your money across the different types of accounts will vary based on your income and situation, she says, but the bottom line is you should be using them to your advantage. Be sure to speak with a trusted financial professional for individualized advice.Here are the three buckets she suggests and how they work.1. Tax-deferred bucketExamples: Traditional IRA, 401(k), 403(b)Tax-deferred accounts, like a traditional 401(k) or individual retirement account, let you contribute pre-tax money from your paycheck into an investment account. This lowers your taxable income for the year you contributed, and your investments grow tax-deferred until retirement.Withdrawals are taxed as income and usually penalty-free starting at age 59½. Taking money out earlier may trigger taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty.2. Tax-free bucketExamples: Roth IRA, Roth 401(k), Roth 403(b)You contribute money you've already paid taxes on to Roth accounts. Your investments then grow tax-free, and once you reach 59½, qualified withdrawals aren't taxed or penalized. Roth IRAs, in particular, also add flexibility by allowing you to withdraw money you've contributed at any time without penalty.These accounts are ideal if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future or want tax-free income later on, Bosse says.3. Taxable bucketExample: brokerage accountsTaxable brokerage accounts let you invest money after taxes and withdraw at any time without penalty. While you'll generally owe taxes on any realized gains, these accounts offer maximum flexibility for expenses outside of retirement, like a down payment on a house or a vacation, because you can access your money whenever you need it, Bosse says.Start by taking advantage of your company matchYou don't have to open all three accounts at once, says Patrick Huey, certified financial planner and owner of Victory Independent Planning in Portland, Oregon.Start by checking to see if your employer has a company match program where they will contribute an additional amount to your retirement accounts that matches your own contributions.Early in your career, Huey suggests contributing to a Roth 401(k) or Roth 403(b) instead of a tax-deferred 401(k) because you'll likely earn a higher salary as you get older — making it smarter to pay taxes now when you're in a lower tax bracket.However, even if it is through a tax-deferred account, \"if there's a match available, you should do what it takes to get it,\" because it's free money from your employer that boosts your retirement savings, Huey says.Using all three investment 'buckets' gives you optionsGenerally, experts recommend saving around 15% of your annual income before taxes for retirement, including any company match.Bosse says the purpose of splitting your money into three accounts is to give yourself options, whether it's to make big purchases, lower your current tax bill or reduce what you'll owe in the future.\"I would think of it in terms of not investing for your retirement, but investing for your future flexibility,\" Bosse says. When you have money in your three buckets, \"You can be working because you want to, not because you need to. You can travel the world. You can do other things.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "If you want to raise successful, resilient kids, help them find activities they actually like, says psychologist Angela Duckworth.Instead of forcing your children to try a specific sport or instrument, spend time exposing them to a variety of extracurriculars and take note of what they spend the most time thinking about, Duckworth said on an Oct. 13 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Guiding kids to activities they're interested in can help them find their passions, hobbies and maybe even their future careers, said Duckworth, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who researches mental and emotional \"grit.\"\"I think great parenting, a lot of it is noticing what your young people is thinking about,\" Duckworth said, adding: \"When we begin to notice where our mind lives, when we begin to notice what attracts our attention spontaneously, that is the beginning of discovering the interests that can make us something of a genius about what we do.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterKids who learn to stick with their interests, even on difficult days, can develop their confidence and resilience — two traits that can help them find success later in life, said Duckworth. Your child might pick a sport or hobby and then decide they don't like it, but it's important for them to finish that athletic season, or keep rehearsing that musical instrument just through their next concert, she added.Duckworth referenced her own experience as a parent. Her child Lucy \"hated doing homework and practicing her viola,\" but when Duckworth looked at Lucy's iPad, she noticed that \"all of the tabs were open to baking videos,\" she said. Duckworth also saw Lucy reading their family's cookbooks, she noted.Lucy ended up \"volunteering in restaurants washing dishes, [then] was allowed to assist the pastry chef,\" Duckworth tells CNBC Make It. \"She was doing pastry literally every weekend and every summer all the way from 8th grade to, I guess, 12th grade ... Her lifelong interest in food and cooking is still evident.\"Not every interest has to become a full-fledged career. If you just follow what you like to do, you might not necessarily make much money, bestselling author and New York University marketing professor Scott Galloway told CNBC Make It in 2019.\"Don't follow your passion,\" Galloway said. His advice instead: \"Find out what you're good at and then invest 10,000 hours in it — and become great at it.\"For Duckworth, interest is just one of four building blocks on the path to building grit, which her research shows is the most common characteristic among successful people in any field. The others include hard work, purpose and hope.\"Anybody who becomes great at what they do, there is a curiosity there, right? Their mind comes to this subject and wants to stay there,\" Duckworth said. \"When you start talking about something that you really care about, you're a genius [on it], because that is where your mind lives.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

He recalled selling a third of Baron Funds' Tesla holding a few years ago due to criticism from his clients and the media about the significant concentration in a single stock. Baron emphasized that his personal position remains entirely intact.\"We sold 30% for clients. I did not sell personally a single share,\" he said.Roughly 40% of his personal net worth is invested in the electric-vehicle maker, alongside 25% in SpaceX and about 35% in Baron mutual funds.Tesla shares are down 18% from their 52-week high and were on track to open 5% lower on Friday as investors this week rethink the AI-related shares that have led the bull market.Baron said he's already made about $8 billion from Tesla over the years, and he believes he could make five times that over the next decade.Baron recounted a promise he made to the board of his mutual funds when he sought approval decades ago to invest in public stocks, a pledge that effectively binds him to Tesla and SpaceX for life.\"I told the board, 'If you let me invest a certain amount of money, then I will promise that I won't sell any of my stock. I will be the last person out of the stock,'\" he said. \"I will not sell a single share of my shares until my clients sold 100% of their shares. ... And I don't expect to sell in my lifetime Tesla or SpaceX.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

    "body": "Adriana Kugler testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2023. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFormer Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, actions that led up to her abrupt resignation, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.The report comes three months after Kugler mysteriously left from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.Kugler's resignation came after she requested and was denied a waiver by Chair Jerome Powell on a disclosure form that showed she had impermissible holdings, Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC.com.An official said that concerns related to trading activity by Kugler or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report.In a note on Friday's disclosure, an Ethics official says, \"Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year\" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.Another note on the report says, \"Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.\"Troubles with tradesKugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called \"blackout periods\" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler requested a waiver of the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, according to Fed officials who spoke with CNBC.Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said.Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.\"These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,\" Kugler said at the time.\"Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.\"CNBC has reached out to Kugler for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of \"pro bono legal services\" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.Pro bono means for free.CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.Rule changesAfter she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them left their positions amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Walmart logo is seen near the store in Austin, United States on Oct. 23, 2025.Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWhen incoming Walmart CEO John Furner steps into the retailer's top role, he will try to follow up a period of dramatic share growth that many of Walmart's rivals have failed to match.Walmart's stock has more than quadrupled since outgoing CEO Doug McMillon began in the role in February 2014. Across nine of the 12 calendar years when McMillon has been Walmart's leader, the company posted positive stock returns.Among Walmart's main rivals in the retail and grocery business, only Amazon and Costco have had better stock returns since McMillon took the job. Meanwhile, Walmart's stock has outperformed those of competitors like Target, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Kroger and Albertsons.McMillon will officially step down at the end of January, but will stay on as executive chairman and advisor. While Furner will face a challenge in replicating the company's performance under his predecessor, he has been a key catalyst for the company's success as CEO of its largest sector, Walmart's U.S. business.Along with huge gains on Wall Street, McMillon oversaw a significant period of growth for the nation's largest grocer, which included sharp sales increases, wage hikes for hourly workers and transformation of the nation's low-price leader into a major e-commerce player. He also steered the retailer through the tumult of a global pandemic, historic levels of inflation and higher tariffs.Sales during McMillon's first three years in the role were roughly flat — with revenues of $486 billion, $482 billion and $485 billion in the fiscal years ending January 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.Yet those years were followed by steady growth, and those gains have accelerated since 2021, after the Covid pandemic pushed more people to shop online and inflation nudged even wealthier shoppers to seek value. Walmart posted annual revenue of about $681 billion in the fiscal year ended earlier this year, an approximately 40% jump from the company's annual revenue the first year of McMillon's tenure.This year, Walmart is on track to post annual revenues of over $700 billion for the first time ever. Ironically, however, it is also expected to lose its crown as the largest retailer by annual revenue to its biggest e-commerce rival, Amazon.Earlier this year, Amazon leapfrogged Walmart in quarterly sales for the first time. Compared to Walmart, it has a different mix to its business because of its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses.How Walmart's stock compares to its rivalsStock gains by Amazon have outpaced Walmart's during the years of McMillon's tenure, with 1,225% share gains by the tech giant compared to a 312% increase by Walmart.However, Walmart's performance on Wall Street has far surpassed big-box retail competitor Target's across McMillon's time as CEO. Shares of Target are up about 60% since February 2014, compared to Walmart's 312% gains.During the years of the Covid pandemic, Target's steep share gains surpassed those of Walmart. Yet the Minneapolis-based cheap chic retailer's annual sales have been roughly stagnant for about four years and dragged down its stock performance.Like Walmart, Target is preparing for a leadership change in February. Last month, Target said Michael Fiddelke, its chief operating officer and former CFO, would succeed longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Costco also stands out as a competitor that has posted steeper share gains than Walmart. Shares of the warehouse club retailer, which competes with both Walmart stores and those of its warehouse chain, Sam's Club, have shot up by more than 700% during the years of McMillon's tenure.Walmart's supermarket competitors — Kroger and Albertsons, in particular — have lagged behind that. Shares of Kroger, which includes about two dozen grocery chains including Fred Meyer and Ralphs, climbed 265% during McMillon's tenure. Shares of Albertsons, which includes Safeway, Tom Thumb and other grocery chains, rose by only 16%.Albertsons went public in 2020, which gave it less time for stock gains. For about two of those years, from roughly 2022 to 2024, Kroger and Albertsons also sought to merge their two companies into a larger grocer that could better compete with Walmart, Costco, Amazon and others. The deal was ultimately blocked by a U.S. judge, after the Federal Trade Commission sued to stop the merger.Dollar stores also fell short of Walmart's stock performance while McMillon was CEO. Dollar Tree and Dollar General, who compete with Walmart in offering groceries and other items at low prices, posted 104% and 85% share gains, respectively, compared to Walmart's 312% increase.Notably, both dollar store banners' stocks outperformed Walmart's during some of those years, yet have been struggling more recently.Walmart's stock was about flat Friday following the retirement announcement, and shares have climbed about 13% this year.— CNBC's Tom Rotunno contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Job seekers wait to enter the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released.The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website.A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday asked the Department of Justice to investigate relationships between notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and former President Bill Clinton, JPMorgan Chase, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and others.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Friday that she had appointed Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation.Trump's statement comes as he faces renewed pressure over his own past friendship with Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.In a Truth Social post, Trump claimed that \"Democrats are using the Epstein Hoax ... to try and deflect from their disastrous SHUTDOWN, and all of their other failures.Because of that, he wrote, \"I will be asking A.G.

I want this complete release because it will bring justice for the victims.\"\"I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander. I was never a client of Epstein's and never had any engagement with him other than fundraising for MIT,\" his post continued on X. \"The call for an investigation is an obvious ploy to avoid releasing the files. Simply release all the files, and expose the people who had both deep and ongoing relationships with Epstein.\"\"I will do everything in my power going forward to advocate for the release of the files, to get justice for Epstein's victims, and to promote the values of truth our great country was founded on,\" Hoffman said. \"I refuse to bend the knee to Donald Trump and his slanderous lies.\"Trump's post comes two days after he hosted business leaders, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, at a White House dinner.A spokesman for JPMorgan, in a statement to CNBC on Friday, said, \"The government had damning information about [Epstein's] crimes and failed to share it with us or other banks.\"\"We regret any association we had with the man, but did not help him commit his heinous acts,\" said the spokeswoman, Patricia Wexler. \"We ended our relationship with him years before his arrest on sex trafficking charges.\"Epstein had been a longtime customer of JPMorgan and also had been friends with former JPMorgan executive Jes Staley.In 2023, JPMorgan, without admitting wrongdoing, settled separate lawsuits by victims of Epstein and the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands, who had accused the bank of facilitating and benefiting from Epstein's sex trafficking of young women. The bank agreed to pay the group of victims $290 million, and to pay the USVI $75 million.CNBC has requested comment from Clinton, Summers as well as from the White House and the DOJ, about Trump's post.In a 1997 photo, Jeffrey Epstein, left, and Donald Trump pose together at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesEmails released by the House Oversight Committee this week show Epstein and others talking about Trump.In a 2018 email thread about Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pleading guilty charges related to hush money payments on behalf of Trump, Epstein wrote, \"I know how dirty donald is.\"In another thread that same year, Epstein wrote of Trump: \"its wild. because I am the one able to take him down.\"Trump also faces a looming vote by the full House of Representatives on a petition demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein that the DOJ refuses to make public despite prior promises to do so by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.watch nowTrump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long abuse of underage girls and young women.The two men had a falling out in the early 2000s.Among the email threads released Wednesday by the House Oversight Committee is one written in April in which Epstein told author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" The email does not explain what Epstein meant by thatIn another email, written in April 2011, Epstein told his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell: \"I want you to realize that the dog that hasn't barked is trump.\"Epstein, in the same thread, said that a person whose name was redacted in the email but whom lawmakers identified as a victim of his \"spent hours at my house with\" Trump.\"He has never once been mentioned,\" Epstein added.",

    "body": "watch nowA college degree is often considered the ticket to a well-paying career, and more than three million new graduates enter the workforce every year banking on that promise.However, this year, those armed with a newly minted diploma have faced one of the toughest job markets in a decade. And next year could be as bad or worse.As the artificial intelligence boom reshapes the workforce at an unprecedented pace, some large employers have said they're replacing workers with AI in order to streamline operations and cut costs. Concerns about the economy, persistent inflation and a slowdown in consumer spending are also likely contributors to a reduced hiring outlook, other research shows.Employers are even less optimistic about the overall job market for upcoming graduates than they were in the last several years, according to a new report by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. About half, or 51%, of employers rated the job market for this year's college seniors as poor or fair, the highest share since 2020-21.The integration of AI has \"rendered moot certain types of skills that were once good currency in the labor market, and a number of entry-level jobs are going to continue to be, at the very least, crimped,\" said Joseph Fuller, a professor of management practice at the Harvard Business School.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHow baby boomers can close a retirement savings gapAfter a layoff, don't forget about your 401(k) — it's 'one of your biggest assets,' CFP saysIRS announces 2026 401(k) contribution limits, raises savings capIRS unveils 2026 IRA contribution limits, raises savings capIRS announces 401(k) catch-up contributions for 2026, raises capIRS unveils Roth IRA income limits for 2026What the Visa, MasterCard settlement means for your rewards credit cardWhere SNAP benefits stand amid negotiations to end the government shutdownWhy the AI stock boom mainly benefits the wealthyBoomers are less bullish on ETFs than younger generations — with good reasonTrump floats $2,000 tariff rebate checks: Here's what you need to knowThis is the 'biggest mistake' you can make with your IRA, attorney saysConsumers on edge as ACA 'subsidy cliff' looms: 'Quite frankly, it's terrifying'How to have tricky money talks as a couple: 'Money Together' authorsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThat puts direct pressure on colleges and their career services departments, he said. \"The pathways to get into certain careers are going to be narrower and the burden of credentials will be steeper.\"Already, postings for entry-level jobs in the U.S. sank 35% since January 2023, according to labor research firm Revelio Labs, with AI playing a big role.As a result, there are suddenly fewer white-collar positions for bachelor's degree holders just starting out.A worsening job market for new gradsIn total, employers announced 1.1 million cuts so far this year, a 65% jump from a year ago and the highest level since the Covid pandemic year of 2020, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. The highest level of layoffs came from the technology sector amid a time of restructuring due to AI integration, the report said. Some industries are more prone to disruptions than others. Jobs in technology and finance, for example, are at greater risk largely due to generative artificial intelligence, which can supplant a human's analytical skills, according to a separate report by Indeed. Alternatively, nursing and blue-collar jobs in manufacturing or construction are more insulated, the report found. They simply can't be done by AI — at least not yet.Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia also shows that higher-paying jobs that require a bachelor's degree are more likely to be affected by AI.watch nowAlthough the Class of 2025 submitted more job applications than their 2024 counterparts, they received fewer job offers, on average, than the previous class, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found.Just 30% of 2025 college graduates secured a full-time job in their fields. That is down from 41% who secured full-time work in the Class of 2024, according to a separate graduate employability report by Cengage Group, an education technology company.College career offices under pressureAt Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, some employers who had typically attended the job and internship expo in the past did not participate this year — though they didn't specify why, according to James Duffy, Gettysburg's assistant vice president for co-curricular education.But as companies restructure due to AI, many are cutting back on entry-level jobs that accounted for a significant share of employment opportunities for new grads, Duffy said.\"If we look at the jobs that AI has absorbed … there are a number of jobs that students used to move right into. Some of those jobs are no longer available,\" he said.The proliferation of new technology puts immense pressure on colleges to recalibrate at a time when higher education, as a whole, is already facing a crisis of confidence.Amid rising college costs and ballooning student loan balances, more students are questioning the return on investment. Among those with student loan debt, 77% call it a \"huge burden,\" and 63% say the education they received hasn't been worth the impact student loan debt has had on their overall well-being, according to a newly released study from EdAssist by Bright Horizons.The worst-case scenario is taking on debt and graduating without a job, colleges say.  Duffy, who oversees Gettysburg's center for career engagement, said families of both current and prospective students are more concerned about potential job prospects after graduating than before. \"Parents want to know more data and details about where students are going,\" he said. \"Parents want to know, 'If I'm going to spend this money, where are they headed after four years?' We know that is top of mind.\"To that end, Duffy said giving students as much career-readiness experience as possible is increasingly important, primarily through internships, externships and hands-on work: \"It makes them more marketable, which gives them the agency of choice.\"Indeed, said Harvard's Fuller, \"more schools will need to develop coop-type opportunities.\"However, in time, such smaller private colleges like Gettysburg may be at a disadvantage compared to urban institutions that are more closely tied to big employers, Fuller added: \"It's going to be helpful to be in a school with a fair amount of employment opportunities locally.\"'It's not enough for students to graduate with a degree'In July, the City University of New York kicked off a sweeping effort to improve career outcomes for its 180,000 undergraduates by integrating career-connected advising, paid internships, apprenticeships and collaborations with industry specialists across every academic concentration.\"Success depends on our ability to change and adapt,\" said CUNY's chancellor Félix Matos Rodríguez in a statement about the announcement. \"It's not enough for students to graduate with a degree ... they must leave with direction, preparation, experience and connections.\"Graduates of Baruch College participate in a commencement ceremony at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, June 5, 2017.Bebeto Matthews | APCUNY's goal is that all future graduates would either be enrolled in a post-graduate program or \"have a job offer in hand in the field that they study,\" Matos Rodríguez told CNBC. \"If we develop a reputation for being a place where students have opportunities, that goes a long, long way to address some of the concerns about ROI.\"Still, the challenge remains how to measure post-graduation career success in such a quickly changing labor market, he said.At the same time, colleges and universities are notoriously slow to adapt, according to Fuller. \"Higher ed is singularly ill-equipped to deal with rapid change,\" he said.Despite those hurdles, colleges need to \"create structures that allow us to pivot,\" said CUNY's Matos Rodríguez.That means directing students toward in-demand career paths, particularly as AI creates opportunities in one industry or another, he said: \"It shouldn't be like higher ed failed because they weren't able to read that crystal ball.\" Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "As Warren Buffett gets closer to stepping down as CEO at the end of next month, he told shareholders he will be \"going quiet,\" but only \"sort of.\"More on his Thanksgiving letter, which looks like it could become a substantial annual tradition, below.First:A surprising stakeThere was a notable surprise in Berkshire Hathaway's end-of-Q3 equity portfolio snapshot, released after Friday's closing bell.Someone in Omaha purchased more than 17.8 million Class A shares of Google's parent, Alphabet.They are currently valued at $4.9 billion, making them the biggest Q3 addition in dollar terms.The news sent the stock 3.5% higher in after-hours trading.At this point, we don't know who made the call.Buffett has typically made purchases of this size, but it doesn't feel like his kind of stock.It is up 51.3% year-to-date, including a 37% climb in the third quarter.Also, he has traditionally shied away from tech stocks. (He considers Apple a consumer products company.)At the 2019 Berkshire meeting, Buffett and Charlie Munger lamented that they had \"screwed up\" by not buying Alphabet earlier because they \"could see in our own operations how well that Google advertising was working. And we just sat there sucking our thumbs.\"On that day, the shares were going for around $59, and they gave no indication there were prepared to rectify their error.Incoming CEO Greg Abel isn't encumbered by that history, and Buffett has been handing over many of his duties to him.Or it could be one or both of the portfolio managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.Stay tuned.Not so surprising sellingAlphabet was by far the biggest Q3 addition at $4.3 billion, based on the September 30 price, well ahead of a $1.2 billion increase for Chubb.The biggest decreases, Apple and Bank of America, had been foreshadowed by hints in Berkshire's 10-Q almost two weeks ago.(The Verisign reduction was disclosed in early August.)Berkshire's Apple position was cut by almost 15%, or $10.6 billion, to around 238 million shares.It's down 74% since Berkshire began selling two years ago.But Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity position at $64.9 billion, which is 21% of the portfolio's current value.The Bank of America reduction was smaller, just 6.1%, or around $1.9 billion.The remaining 568 million shares are currently valued at $29.9 billion, Berkshire's third largest position, making up almost 10% of the portfolio's current value.It's been cut by 43% since early last year.A complete listing of Berkshire's Q3 13F appears below. 'Sort of'Many of the headlines on news stories about Warren Buffett's Thanksgiving letter on Monday included this quotation: \"I'm 'going quiet.'\"But there was another phrase that followed that line near the top of the letter, getting its own paragraph: \"Sort of.\"Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCStarting next year, Greg Abel, \"a great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator,\" will be writing the annual meeting to shareholders and answering questions at the annual meeting. Buffett plans to sit on the arena floor with the other directors.But he wrote, \"I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message.\"This year's letter ran a bit more than seven pages, compared to around three pages last year, and sounded a lot like the annual letters he's been writing for decades, with sections on the importance of luck, getting old, his admiration for Berkshire shareholders, the many friends he has made over the years in Omaha, and his complete confidence in Abel's ability to run the company.He also revealed that while hospitalized as a child, he received a fingerprint kit and proceeded to take prints from the nuns caring for him, because \"someday a nun would go bad, and the FBI would find that they had neglected to fingerprint nuns.\"(CNBC.com has this summary)The newsiest bit was his plan to \"step up the pace of lifetime gifts\" to the three foundations run by his children, who, like Buffett, are getting older. (They are 72,70, and 67.)He wants to \"improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.\"But he also \"wants to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed.\"The result, at least for this year, is an increase in the Class B shares (converted from Class A) going to each foundation to 400,000 shares from 300,000 shares last year.Including a fourth unchanged donation to a foundation named after his late wife, the total as of the date of the gifts increased 17% to $1.3 billion.Playing a more minor role: Class B shares are up 4% since last year's gifts.The entire U.S portfolio as of September 30BUFFETT AROUND THE INTERNETBERKSHIRE STOCK WATCHFour weeksTwelve monthsBERKSHIRE'S TOP U.S. HOLDINGS - Nov. 14, 2025Berkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S., Japan, and Hong Kong, by market value, based on today's closing prices.Holdings are as of September 30, 2025 as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Itochu, which is as of March 17, 2025, and Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about NVIDIA Omniverse as he delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "body": "At ThredUp's 600,000-square-foot warehouse in Suwanee, Georgia, roughly 40,000 pieces of used clothing are processed each day. The company's logistics network — four facilities across the U.S. — now rivals that of some fast-fashion giants.\"This is the largest garment-on-hanger system in the world,\" said Justin Pina, ThredUp's senior director of operations. \"We can hold more than 3.5 million items here.\"Secondhand shopping is booming. The global secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, growing almost three times faster than the overall apparel market, according to GlobalData.President Donald Trump's tariffs were billed as a way to bring manufacturing back home. But the measures hit one of America's most import-dependent industries: fashion.About 97 percent of clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mostly from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.For years, Gen Z shoppers have been driving the rise of secondhand fashion, but now more Americans are catching on.\"When tariffs raise those costs, resale platforms suddenly look like the smart buy. This isn't just a fad,\" said Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable. \"Tariffs are accelerating trends that were already reshaping the way Americans shop.\"For James Reinhart, ThredUp's CEO, the company is already seeing it play out.\"The business is free-cash-flow positive and growing double digits,\" said Reinhart. \"We feel really good about the economics, gross margins near 80% and operations built entirely within the U.S.\"ThredUp reported that revenue grew 34% year over year in the third quarter. The company also said it acquired more new customers in the quarter than at any other time in its history, with new buyer growth up 54% from the same period last year.\"If tariffs add 20% to 30% to retail prices, that's a huge advantage for resale,\" said Dylan Carden, research analyst at William Blair & Company. \"Pre-owned items aren't subject to those duties, so demand naturally shifts.\"Inside the ThredUp warehouse, where CNBC got a behind-the-scenes look. automation hums alongside human workers. AI systems photograph, categorize, and price thousands of garments per hour. For Reinhart, the technology is key to scaling resale like retail.\"AI has really accelerated adoption,\" said Reinhart. \"It's helping us improve discovery, styling, and personalization for buyers.\"That tech wave extends beyond ThredUp. Fashion-tech startups Phia, co-founded by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni, is using AI to scan thousands of listings across retail and resale in seconds.\"The fact that we've driven millions in transaction volume shows how big this need is,\" Gates said. \"People want smarter, cheaper ways to shop.\"ThredUp is betting that domestic infrastructure, automation, and AI will keep it ahead of the curve, and that tariffs meant to revive U.S. manufacturing could end up powering a new kind of American fashion economy.\"The future of fashion will be more sustainable than it is today,\" said Reinhart. \"And secondhand will be at the center of it.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

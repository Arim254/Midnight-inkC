    "body": "Never walk into a job interview without a few prepared answers in your back pocket, says career expert Erin McGoff. Plucking those out at the right moments can save you from scrambling to come up with a coherent response to a tough question.According to McGoff, the author of \"The Secret Language of Work: Hyper-Helpful Scripts for Every Situation,\" practicing what you want to say ahead of time can help you feel calm and grounded in high-pressure situations.In her experience, one interview question that often flummoxes job seekers is: \"Why did you leave your last role?\"\"It's a really common question that people struggle with,\" she says, because \"people don't know how to phrase it in a way where it feels truthful, but maybe not the full story.\"Here's how she thinks job seekers should answer this tricky question — and which responses they should avoid.How not to answer, 'Why did you leave your last job?'Fundamentally, employers \"don't actually care why you left your last job,\" McGoff writes in her book. \"They're looking for red flags and trying to understand why you might leave this job.\" The most important thing to keep in mind is that an interview \"isn't a vent session,\" she says: It's not the time to open up about your \"horrible boss and coworkers\" at a previous company. When a candidate complains about their past job, from an employer's perspective, \"all they're hearing is, 'This person is bringing a lot of baggage,' or 'They're bringing a lot of drama,'\" McGoff says. As a rule, McGoff advises candidates to avoid badmouthing their former company or colleagues. Besides, depending on the size of your industry, she says, your interviewer might actually know your former coworkers.What to say insteadCandidates should be \"a little bit delicate\" with their answer to this question, McGoff writes. \"You still tell the truth, just in a way that's catered for the desired outcome of the interview, which is to have the interviewer [be] impressed by you,\" she says.She recommends following three steps to structure your response:1. Name something you liked about your former roleFor example, McGoff suggests, you might say: \"I really enjoyed the products I worked on,\" or \"I was proud of the work that I was able to accomplish.\"2. Briefly address why you leftMcGoff advises candidates to keep their language neutral — again, the unvarnished truth \"is often not what they're looking to hear,\" she says. For example, rather than telling your interviewer that you left because of a toxic boss, you could instead say something like: \"The company made a management shift, and unfortunately, it really changed the dynamic of my role.\"If you'd rather avoid sharing any specific details, it's okay to keep your answer vague. Regardless of the real reason, \"It felt like the right time to move on\" is always a good answer, McGoff says. Another option could be, \"I was looking for more opportunity in my career.\"3. Pivot to why you're interested in this jobFor example, \"I saw this role pop up, and I think that I can bring a lot of value to this company. So that's why I'm here with you today,\" McGoff says.Overall, candidates should focus on their skills and their interest in the role they're interviewing for rather than the one they left, she says, and \"keep things extremely positive.\"Erin McGoff is the founder of AdviceWithErin, author of \"The Secret Language of Work,\" and course instructor for CNBC Make It's Smarter course How to Ace Your Job Interview.

    "body": "Dr. Richard Axel of Columbia University, at Le Bernardin Prive on July 26, 2017 in New York City.Craig Barritt | Getty ImagesDr. Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, said he is stepping down as co-director of Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute on the heels of his association with notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein drawing public attention.\"My past association with Jeffrey Epstein was a serious error in judgment, which I deeply regret,\" Axel, 79, said in a statement on Tuesday.\"I apologize for compromising the trust of my friends, students, and colleagues,\" Axel said. \"I recognize the problems this has caused, and I will work to restore this trust. What has emerged about Epstein's appalling conduct, the harm that he has caused to so many people, makes my association with him all the more painful and  inexcusable.\"This photo illustration shows redacted documents from the Epstein Library files released by the US Department of Justice in Washington, DC, on February 18, 2026. =Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesAxel has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with his friendship with Epstein, who died in August 2019 from suicide, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.But Axel is mentioned in multiple emails and other documents released by the Department of Justice in January as having been in contact and dining with Epstein.Axel has been a Columbia University professor for 53 years, and will continue his lab's research at the Zuckerman institute, he said. Axel, in his statement, said he will resign as an investigator from Columbia's Howard Hughes Medical InstituteAxel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004 with Linda Buck \"for their discoveries of odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system,\" the prize website notes.In a December 2007 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Axel is quoted saying about him, \"He has the ability to make connections that other minds can't make.\"\"He is extremely smart and  probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a  problem and also to identify biological problems without having all the  data that a scientist would have,\" Axel said in the article. \"He also has an extremely short  attention span.\"The article, which was published as Epstein faced a pending indictment for soliciting prostitution in Florida, notes that Axel met Epstein \"during the early biotech days of the eighties.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealAxel joins a growing list of people who have lost positions or been subpoenaed due to their relationships with Epstein.Emails and other documents contained in the DOJ's Epstein files database show that the friendship between Axel and Epstein continued for years after Epstein served 13 months in jail following his guilty plea in Florida state court to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.Columbia, in its own statement on Tuesday, said, \"The University has seen no evidence that Dr. Axel violated any University policy or the law. However, Dr. Axel made clear that in light of this past association, and the continued fallout from the release of DOJ files, he felt it appropriate to relinquish his position as co-director.\"\"The University agrees with this decision, while at the same time recognizing his extraordinary contributions to the University and his dedication to his colleagues, to his students, and to science,\" the university said.",

    "body": "Bloom Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesFears over artificial intelligence are now hitting bond investors, according to the latest credit investors survey from Bank of America Global Research.An AI bubble is seen as the top risk for the first time, with investors expecting a surge in bond issuance from hyperscalers, the February poll found. Some 23% of those surveyed said it was their biggest concern, compared to 9% who said so in the firm's December poll. Companies including Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Meta have announced big spending plans as they scale out their AI capabilities. Investors of high-grade credit now expect $285 billion in issuance by hyperscalers this year, up from the $210 billion anticipated in December's survey, Barnaby Martin, credit strategist at Bank of America, said in a note Tuesday. \"Yet, investors are more sanguine on the ultimate tech disruption ahead: just 10% say that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry,\" he wrote. Those obsolescence fears have hit the stock market in recent weeks, as concern over AI disruption spread across a variety of sectors. Software companies, for instance, have tumbled after announcements from AI company Anthropic about new AI tools. While stocks have reversed course since the latest sell off on Tuesday, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is still down more than 25% year to date. Elsewhere, geopolitics isn't a big factor on bond investors' radar these days, with only 10% saying it is their top fear, despite growing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, Martin noted. No investor said central bank policy error is the big risk, even with a new Federal Reserve chair expected to take the helm in May.",

    "body": "A steak sandwich and French onion soup from Panera Bread Co. arranged in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023. Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPanera Bread is entering the so-called value wars with its new \"Mix & Match\" deals in a bid to win back price-conscious diners.The chain, known for its soups, salads and sandwiches, is in the early stages of a turnaround, with a focus on reinvesting in its business and reversing years of traffic declines. Once the top fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has fallen to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. In 2024, Panera's sales dropped 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. A key part of Panera's comeback strategy is focusing on value. Across the restaurant industry, executives have reported weaker spending among consumers, who are trying to save money by trading down to fast food or dining out less frequently. Chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell have leaned into value offerings to try to win back customers. About 3 out of every 4 diners said that daily specials, discounts or value promotions matter when choosing where to dine or order takeout, according to the National Restaurant Association's annual State of the Restaurant Industry report.\"[Consumers] are seeking value, and they're also seeking quality,\" Panera CEO Paul Carbone told CNBC. \"That's so, so important.\"Starting Wednesday, Panera customers can choose halved portions of sandwiches and salads, as well as cups of soup, from the Mix & Match menu. Each of the 10 items is priced at $4.99, and diners have to buy at least two items. Seasonal menu items will also rotate through the Mix & Match options. Each order also comes with the choice of a baguette, chips or an apple.Panera explored other value offerings, but the Mix & Match menu tested successfully, Carbone said. \"The guest has really, really reacted well to it,\" he said, adding the menu is expected to drive incremental visits to the restaurant.And while Panera is introducing the deal, its popular \"You Pick Two\" offering is sticking around. Carbone said that customer research showed that diners view the option to buy two entrees from the menu as an opportunity for variety, rather than a chance to save money. Like Mix & Match, the offer allows customers to choose a half salad, half sandwich or cup of soup or mac and cheese. However, You Pick Two spans the menu, rather than being restricted to just 10 items.",

    "body": "watch nowCava, the fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain, reported record-breaking revenue for fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday and forecast sales growth for fiscal year 2026.Shares surged more than 20% in midday trading on Wednesday. \"While there are a lot of factors around us that are creating pressures from a margin perspective, our model has allowed us to be very thoughtful and minimize price increases to our guests and to consumers in general, which really helps elevate our value perception,\" Chief Financial Officer Tricia Tolivar told CNBC. Though the company said last quarter that it saw a pullback among younger consumers, Tolivar said that trend came to an end in the final three months of its fiscal year.\"We actually saw firming in that category, and overall [we're] seeing improvement in our trends across income cohorts, age cohorts, different parts of the country,\" Tolivar said. \"And in fact, we believe there's a little bit of a bridge that we've been able to create in this K-shaped economy, where we want to be accessible for everyone, and we're doing our best to ensure that our amazing culinary and incredible hospitality is there for all customers across the country.\"She added that some of Cava's best-performing restaurants are in markets where median household incomes are lower.The restaurant chain reported same-store sales up 0.5% in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates of a 1.1% decline, according to StreetAccount. Much of that growth was thanks to menu prices and product mix, and partially offset by a 1.4% decline in foot traffic, the company said. Tolivar said Cava raised prices about 1.7% at the beginning of 2025 and that 2026 would see \"very modest increases.\"The company also recorded 72 net new restaurant openings in fiscal 2025 for a total of 439 locations.Here's how Cava performed in the period ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. 3 cents expectedRevenue: $275 million vs. $268 million expectedIn the fourth quarter, Cava reported net income of $4.9 million, or 4 cents per share, compared to $78.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue of $275 million marked an increase of nearly 21% year over year. For the full fiscal year, the company reported record-breaking revenue surpassing $1 billion, a growth of more than 20% compared to the year prior. Same-restaurant sales for the year increased by 4%. \"We believe our momentum reflects more than just expansion,\" CEO Brett Schulman said on a call with analysts. \"It signals that our value proposition is resonating with today's increasingly discerning consumer, and as guests become more intentional with their spend, they are choosing brands like Cava that deliver real differentiation through bold flavors, healthy food and hospitality that creates meaningful human connection.\"For fiscal year 2026, Cava said it expects 74 to 76 net new restaurant openings, in addition to same-store sales growth of 3% to 5%. Tolivar said the company is expecting strong results from its upcoming menu additions, including a salmon offering, which will mark Cava's entry into seafood.",

He argued the capital raise came at a cost exceeding 10%, far higher than the company's tax-adjusted debt cost of below 5% in public markets, despite management's stated goal of reducing leverage.\"Over the years this management team has destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder value. Enough is enough.

    "body": "Pokemon \"Pikachu Illustrator\" Trainer Promo Hologram Trading CardSource: Ha.ComSocial media influencer and wrestler Logan Paul made history last week when he sold a rare Pokémon card for $16.5 million, a world record price for an auctioned trading card. The winner views it as an investment.AJ Scaramucci — son of investor and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci — won the bidding war for the \"Pikachu Illustrator\" card, made in 1998 and one of only an estimated few dozen to exist. It's the crowning achievement in the Solari Capital founder's short collecting career, which started with trading cards during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I mean, Picassos are great,\" he said in an interview, explaining the Illustrator card's importance. \"But Pokémon means way more than just a Picasso painting to people.\"After winning, Scaramucci said the card's purchase was the first action in what will be, as he dubbed, a \"planetary treasure hunt.\" He said the goal, which he is embarking on with his younger brother, is to collect a number of real-world, scarce assets across varying categories. Trading card markets have exploded in recent years. According to data from Card Ladder, an analytics firm that tracks trading card prices and sales, the monthly sales volume in secondary trading has nearly doubled in the last two years.EBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the company's earnings call last week detailed that the largest contributor to gross merchandise volume growth in the fourth-quarter were collectibles, particularly \"driven by continued strength in trading cards.\"Paul himself bought the illustrator card in 2021 for nearly $5.3 million, indicating he sold it with a more than 200% return. Card Ladder's \"Pokémon index\" has grown 145% in the past year. Compare those gains to the S&P 500, which is up 15.2% in the past year. Or compare it to \"Magnificent Seven\" darling Alphabet, which is up 73.4% in the past year. \"Especially in 2025, the growth has been astronomical,\" said Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of Goldin Auctions, which is owned by eBay. Goldin helped facilitate the auction for the illustrator card last week. \"We have people who are buying solely either because they absolutely love it or they firmly believe that trading cards and collectibles are a legitimate alternative asset class.\"AJ Scaramucci, founder and Managing Partner at the SALT Fund, speaks during the Skybridge Capital SALT New York 2021 conference in New York City, U.S., September 15, 2021.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersScaramucci is someone who is buying Pokémon cards for both of those reasons: his own pleasure and the investment potential. \"The compounded annual growth rate of these cards is out of control,\" he said. \"And they should be treated as investments because that's what they are. It's just obvious.\"Scaramucci added the cards are a way to play the \"debasement trade,\" where investors fearful of countries devaluing their currencies move money into hard assets. Viewing collectibles as an alternative asset is not new, even if unorthodox. Other collectibles like wine and art have been used in the past for portfolio diversification.Photo: Image Source | Getty ImagesPaul Karger, co-founder and managing partner at wealth advisory firm TwinFocus, said he works with clients who collect art, wine, watches and even guitars. But while some view these items as investments, Karger wouldn't advise clients to get into that mentality. \"Think of it as a passion first, and kind of an investment second,\" he said. \"You hope they go up over time, but they're absolutely not a replacement to financial assets, it's just maybe a complement at the margin.\"Karger warned that the illiquid nature of collectibles, and the dependency they have on others determining their worth, often via auctions, are added risks. Kaycee LeCong, managing director of the family office at Brighton Jones Wealth Management, also noted a risk is that capital gains on collectibles are taxed at 28%, higher than capital gains taxes on stocks that are around 15% and 20%.Despite the risks, Goldin projects more people will view collectibles, particularly trading cards, as alternative assets. He said as more headlines come about detailing major sales — like that of Paul's — and price discovery becomes easier to do with more data, it will only attract more participants. Scaramucci will embark on his treasure hunt through a new company called Treasure Trove. However, he did not disclose any details about what that company will be nor how it will operate, beyond that it will receive funding from Solari Capital. Scaramucci also didn't disclose if he plans to sell the Illustrator card, or any other of his collectibles, if it grows more in value. And while Scaramucci said he'd like to obtain the Declaration of Independence as part of his hunt after he won the Illustrator card, he acknowledged to CNBC that it's a goal that will take much work to achieve while not addressing a plan on how to do it. But at the moment, the lack of clarity in his future plans is the point. \"For now, if you think I'm just a crazy person buying up real-world, scarce assets,\" he said, \"that's all you need to know.\"",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, attends the ribbon-cutting ceremony opening the firm’s new headquarters at 270 Park Ave., in New York, Oct. 21, 2025.Eduardo Munoz | ReutersJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the bank is taking steps to address the impact of artificial intelligence on its workers, and part of what he said should be a broader societal response to the potentially disruptive nature of AI.Dimon described at an investor meeting late Monday his bank's internal plans to shift employees into new roles as automation accelerates.\"We already have huge redeployment plans for [our] own people,\" Dimon said. \"In fact, we spoke about it today, and we have to up that a little bit so we can take people who are displaced — and we have displaced people from AI — and we offer them other jobs.\"JPMorgan, the world's biggest bank by market cap, has the industry's largest annual tech budget at nearly $20 billion. Its executives have outlined an ambitious agenda to become \"fundamentally rewired\" for the AI era.Even at this early stage, the bank's workforce provides a snapshot of what happens when corporations employ AI technology, including models from OpenAI and Anthropic, which are both used by JPMorgan's AI portal.The bank's head count was roughly unchanged at 318,512 over the past year, but there were changes below the surface: Operations and support staff fell by 4% and 2%, respectively, as the firm added 4% to roles that involve catering to clients and generating revenue.It did that by using technology to boost the number of accounts that each operations employee can handle (up 6%), reducing the per-unit cost to deal with fraud (down 11%) and making their software engineers 10% more efficient, according to the bank's presentation.  JPMorgan has doubled the use cases for generative AI this year, focusing on customer service and the firm's technology workers, Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum said at the investor meeting.A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to elaborate on Dimon's comments about plans for redeployment. Disruption risk When an analyst on Monday asked if Dimon was concerned about the risk of widespread unemployment because of AI — one of several fears circulating as every AI model update seemed to wallop the shares of public companies in recent weeks — Dimon had this response: \"We are going to deploy AI as best we can to do a better job for our customers.\" The CEO  has previously likened the potential impact of AI to that of electricity or the printing press.Beyond the \"huge redeployment plans\" for his bank, Dimon expressed concern that the rapid adoption of AI could put entire professions out of work.As a thought experiment, what if autonomous trucks were introduced overnight, he asked.\"Would you do it if you put 2 million people on the street?\" Dimon asked. \"That next job is $25,000 a year, stocking shelves.\"Businesses and governments need to begin planning for this risk now, with ideas including assistance and training for displaced workers, he said.\"Society's got to think through what it wants to do if this becomes that kind of problem,\" Dimon said. \"Now is the time to start thinking about it.\"watch now",

    "body": "A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Lucid Group reported mixed fourth-quarter results Tuesday as the electric vehicle maker continues to face challenging market conditions and internal struggles.The company widely missed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, while beating average revenue estimates by roughly 12%. It also revised its 2025 production results due to internal validation issues, but guided for a notable increase in vehicle production this year.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: $3.62 vs. a loss of $2.62 expected Revenue: $523 million vs. $468 million expectedLucid's results come days after the company laid off 12% of its U.S. salaried workforce in an effort to streamline operations and \"operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long term growth,\" according to a statement from the company.Interim Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff described the cuts Tuesday to CNBC as a needed realignment of the company's workforce amid broader market and economic concerns as well as needed gains in efficiency. \"We are adjusting and going to a level where we think we want to be and need to be,\" he said. \"But it's nothing that will continue in the future.\"For 2026, the company announced a vehicle production target of between 25,000 and 27,000 units. That would mark an increase of roughly 40% to 51% compared with the year-end figures the company released Tuesday. That compares to nearly doubling production last year and a 55% increase in deliveries.Lucid said the revision for the year — from 18,378 units to 17,840 units — came as \"538 vehicles had not completed certain internal procedures required under its final validation process to be classified as produced.\"The company said the vehicles are expected to be completed this year, with the change not affecting its previously reported financial results.Winterhoff described the expected growth as \"healthy,\" but not \"outrageous\" given the current slowdown in overall vehicle sales, including EVs.\"Our initial plans were higher, but we wanted to really be conservative and make sure that we are hitting the numbers that we are projecting,\" he told CNBC.watch nowLucid is expected to begin production of a new, less expensive midsize vehicle at the end of this year, but Winterhoff said it will not be material to its 2026 production plans. He said the automaker's Gravity SUV is expected to account for the majority of its production and sales this year, followed by the Air sedan. The company also plans to launch its first Lucid robotaxis with previously announced partners.Winterhoff said the company's main priorities this year are achieving its production target, growing sales, continuing efficiency gains and preparing for production of the midsize vehicle and robotaxis. \"We really want to make sure that we are on our path to profitability, make sure that we're not spending money that we don't have to. That's very, very important,\" he told CNBC.Lucid has yet to say when the company expects to be profitable. It is scheduled to host an investor day on March 12 in New York.Lucid said it ended last year with approximately $4.6 billion in total liquidity, which Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said was \"strong\" and would provide flexibility \"to execute near-term objectives while investing in future growth.\"Lucid reported a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2025, in line with a $2.71 billion loss a year earlier. That includes more than doubling its year-over-year losses during the fourth quarter to $814 million. It reported a loss of $12.09 per share for the year. The company's 2025 revenue was up 68% to $1.35 billion, including more than doubling year-over-year results during the fourth quarter.",

    "body": "watch nowEurope's largest lender HSBC on Wednesday reported annual pre-tax profit of $29.91 billion, beating analysts' estimates on the back of a strong performance in its wealth division and Hong Kong businesses.While annual profit declined 7.4%, HSBC's revenue gained 4%, year on year, and both exceeded estimates.Here are HSBC's full-year results compared with the consensus estimates compiled by the bank.Pre-tax profit: $29.91 billion vs. $28.86 billionRevenue: $68.27 billion vs. $67.36 billionThe lender's fourth-quarter profit before tax rose to $6.8 billion, up $4.5 billion from a year earlier, largely due to favorable one-off items linked to business disposals. Operating expenses rose 8% to $9.3 billion, reflecting restructuring costs, technology investment and higher performance-related pay.Its revenue for the final quarter jumped 42% year on year to $16.4 billion. HSBC Group CEO Georges Elhedery said in a statement that 2025 marked a year of \"decisive action and swift execution,\" with all four of the bank's businesses performing well and building strong momentum.The lender now aims to deliver a return on average tangible equity — a measure of profitability — of 17% or more, excluding notable items, in between 2026 and 2028. RoTE was 13.3% in 2025.The results come close on the heels of HSBC completing the privatization of Hang Seng Bank on Jan. 26, with the latter's shares subsequently delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. HSBC said last year that the deal would be add to its earnings and was a better use of capital than buybacks.\"We do anticipate revenue and cost synergies between the two brands, but we expect that to come through gradually in the medium term,\" Morningstar's equity analyst Kathy Chan said.The take private offer was \"an exciting opportunity to grow both Hang Seng and HSBC,\" Elhedery said last October, adding that the bank would preserve Hang Seng's brand while investing to strengthen its capabilities.Addressing questions on potential job cuts, Elhedery told CNBC's Emily Tan that HSBC was targeting about 8% reduction in payroll costs, but stressed the bank had not not set specific headcount reduction targets. He said the focus was on simplifying the group at scale and removing duplicate roles, pointing to a net 15% reduction in managing director positions through de-duplication.At the start of the month, Bloomberg reported that HSBC was set to award minimal or no bonuses to some bankers as it moves toward a tougher, more performance-driven compensation model similar to that of its Wall Street peers. The bank intends to use the upcoming bonus round to push out underperformers in areas such as investment banking and wealth management, potentially including managing directors, the report said, citing according to people familiar with the matter. While HSBC has not confirmed any final decisions regarding plans to cull underperformers, Morningstar's Chan said she would not be surprised to see further headcount reductions, given the Group's broader goal to improve operational efficiency and deliver cost savings.Hong Kong listed shares of HSBC declined 0.46%.—CNBC's Emily Tan contributed to this report.",

Discovery on Tuesday said Paramount Skydance had raised its takeover offer to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, in a proposal that could \"reasonably be expected\" to top an existing deal with Netflix. Last week, WBD announced it would reengage Paramount in deal talks under a seven-day waiver from Netflix. WBD and Netflix have an agreement to sell the legacy media group's studio and streaming businesses to the streamer. Paramount is seeking to buy the entirety of WBD. \"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement Tuesday morning. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction.\"Later Tuesday, WBD said the amended Paramount offer was for $31 per share, all cash, and included a $7 billion breakup fee in the event the proposed merger doesn't win regulatory approval. Paramount has also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if it were to abandon that deal, as well as a so-called ticking fee tied to delays in getting regulators' approval, WBD said. \"The Board has not made a determination as to whether the revised PSKY proposal is superior to the merger with Netflix,\" it said in a statement. \"WBD will engage further with PSKY to determine if a proposal that constitutes a 'Company Superior Proposal,' as defined in the Netflix Merger Agreement, can be reached.\"If WBD deems the new Paramount offer superior, Netflix will have four days to improve its previously agreed-upon bid. Netflix agreed to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in December, valuing the assets at around $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Paramount subsequently launched a hostile tender offer to WBD shareholders for $30 per share for all of WBD, which includes linear cable networks such as CNN, TBS, HGTV and TNT and digital assets including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.The Warner Bros. Discovery board said Tuesday it continued to advise shareholders not to take action in response to the tender offer. A combined Paramount-WBD would bring together HBO Max with Paramount+ along with merging two of the five largest movie studios by revenue — Warner Bros. and Paramount Skydance Studios. It would also put CNN and CBS News under one ownership structure.  Both the Netflix-WBD deal and a potential Paramount-WBD merger would need U.S. and European regulatory approval for completion, and both deals have raised antitrust concerns among critics. watch now",

Trump delivered his address days after the Supreme Court struck down the administration's tariff strategy, and amid a U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf threatening Iran.Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe U.S. and Iran are poised to hold further nuclear talks in the Swiss city of Geneva on Thursday, amid persistent fears about the prospect of military action in the oil-rich Middle East.The upcoming round of negotiations over the future of Tehran's nuclear program come as the U.S. continues to build up military forces in the region and as President Donald Trump warns of \"bad things\" if Iran doesn't agree to a nuclear deal.The U.S. president on Tuesday spoke briefly about Iran during his nearly two-hour State of the Union address but primarily focused on domestic policy and other political issues.\"We are in negotiations with them. They want to make a deal, but we haven't heard those secret words: 'We will never have a nuclear weapon,'\" Trump said.\"My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy. But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world's number one sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon.\" watch nowFor some, the comments boosted expectations of an imminent diplomatic breakthrough.Trump \"basically wants the optics of a win, which is why he talks about why he's ended eight wars. I think it's pretty clear he hasn't. He has helped navigate, you know, skirmishes … but he hasn't ended these conflicts,\" said George Pollack, U.S. policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors. \"For him, I think it is more about how he's exerting U.S. strength, U.S. force and trying to make the world more peaceful but that's more optics than it is a substantive policy,\" Pollack told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Wednesday. \"And that's why, for us, we do think this Thursday meeting will likely be a success and bring about some more diplomatic opportunities,\" he added.The USS Gerald R.

Iran FM: An agreement is 'within reach'Iran, for its part, has talked up the prospect of a deal this week, saying an agreement is \"within reach.\" Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on social media Tuesday that the country would resume talks with the U.S. in Geneva this week \"with a determination to achieve a fair and equitable deal — in the shortest possible time.\" Araghchi added: \"Our fundamental convictions are crystal clear: Iran will under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon; neither will we Iranians ever forgo our right to harness the dividends of peaceful nuclear technology for our people.\" Vehicles move along a highway near Tehran's landmark Azadi (Freedom) Tower in Tehran on February 23, 2026.

    "body": "View of the city of Santiago and the Andes Mountains, taken from the Metropolitan Park on July 2, 2024.Rodrigo Arangua | Afp | Getty ImagesChile is the latest Latin American country to have become embroiled in a U.S.-China power struggle.The country, which counts Washington as its top foreign investor and Beijing as its largest trading partner, is facing pressure from the White House over a subsea cable project with links to China. In a surprise move, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said late last week that the Trump administration would impose visa restrictions on three Chilean officials tied to a digital cable project proposed by Chinese firms, alleging a security threat. Chilean President Gabriel Boric, who will leave office on March 11, condemned the visa sanctions and rejected the notion that the country \"promotes any action that threatens our security or that of the region.\" Chile's outgoing left-wing government later said one of the sanctioned officials was the country's Minister of Transport and Telecommunications Juan Carlos Muñoz, without commenting on the identities of the other two.The U.S. ambassador to Chile, Brandon Judd, defended the visa restrictions on Monday, telling reporters that it is Washington's \"sovereign right to take actions when we feel that the region's security is being threatened,\" according to The Associated Press.The spat comes just days before a Latin American leader's summit in Miami, Florida — and two weeks before Chile's incoming right-wing government takes over in Santiago. Chile's President-elect Jose Antonio Kast speaks to journalists after meeting with the Italian Prime Minister at Palazzo Chigi in Rome on Febuary 5, 2026.Filippo Monteforte | Afp | Getty ImagesIt also represents a major test for José Antonio Kast's administration, following the right-wing candidate's election victory late last year.Analysts say U.S. President Donald Trump, who is seeking to counter China's strategic influence in the region, is sending an unequivocal message to Latin American countries. 'A calibrated warning'The U.S.-Chile tensions were, above all, \"a calibrated warning\" to the Kast administration that strategic infrastructure decisions will be treated as geopolitical alignment choices — rather than neutral tenders, according to Mariano Machado, Americas principal analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.To be sure, digital undersea cables are the backbone of the world's internet and telecommunications infrastructure, enabling everything from international phone calls to financial transactions. By some estimates, as much as 95% of international traffic passes through these largely unseen data super-highways.A map of the world's undersea communication cables.CNBC | Jason Reginato\"The near-term external consequence is that Kast's upcoming Washington engagements – chief among them, in the Shield of the Americas summit – will become early tests of how Chile balances partners under pressure,\" Machado said.\"As US-China competition intensifies in the region, Chile's 'digital hub' ambition becomes investable only if geopolitical concerns are addressed upfront, not retrofitted after a crisis,\" he continued. \"Winning deals will be those that lock in clear governance and credible security assurances early enough to preserve bankability.\" China's embassy in Chile has reportedly accused Washington of \"obvious contempt for the sovereignty, dignity, and national interests of Chile\" following the Trump administration's visa restrictions against Chilean officials.China's strategic and economic influence in Latin America is well established, although it is thought to be the target of Trump's so-called \"Donroe Doctrine\" — a portmanteau of Donald Trump and the Monroe Doctrine, which refers to a 19th century foreign policy position that asserted Washington's influence over the Western Hemisphere.watch nowIn just the last few weeks, for example, Panama's top court ruled against Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison, saying a concession held by a subsidiary of the firm to operate ports at either end of the Panama Canal was unconstitutional. The outcome was widely seen as a victory for Trump's regional security ambitions. The U.S. has also ratcheted up pressure on Cuba's communist-run government, threatening to impose tariffs on any country that provides oil to Havana, and recently conducted an extraordinary military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.",

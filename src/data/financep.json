    "body": "Gene Yu is the co-founder and CEO of Blackpanda.Courtesy of Gene YuAt age 46, startup founder Gene Yu seems to have lived several lives in one.Before he started his own company, he was a Division 1 tennis player, graduated with a computer science degree from the United States Military Academy, commonly known as West Point, served as a \"Green Beret\" in the U.S. Army Special Forces, led the rescue of a family friend from a hostage situation and authored a book. Today, he is also the co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity startup Blackpanda which has raised over $21 million to date, according to an official company announcement.While he's undergone extremely rigorous military training, served on battlefields and led major counter-terrorism missions, he said his hardest battle was internal.Growing up Asian AmericanYu was born in Concord, Massachusetts, where he says he was the only Asian kid in his town. He then moved to Cupertino, California when he was 10. His family background is unique and, in some ways, high-profile: his uncle is Ma Ying-jeou who served as the president of Taiwan from 2008 to 2016. Growing up as an Asian male in America, he says that he often internalized the messages he was told by society that \"you are inferior, you are unattractive, you are not desired, you are not equal.\" This took a toll on Yu's self-esteem. These feelings of inferiority were, at times, amplified at home. He learned early on to prioritize achievement. \"In Asian culture, what we learn is performance equals love, right? Or even better yet, lack of performance equals the absence of love,\" Yu told CNBC Make It. Yu says his early experiences led him to chase achievement as a way of protecting a younger version of himself. \"It's like you are a wounded child, and you're wearing the Iron Man suit,\" he said. \"You're armoring yourself as a traumatized person.\" \"I hated my own identity, because it was wounded, right? I wanted to create a new one, and that's what the military does for you,\" he said. So, at age 17 after graduating from high school, he left home and went straight to West Point, which is known to be a highly prestigious and selective military academy. After that, he joined the U.S. Army Special Forces where he served as an officer and commander.From his high school years to his time at West Point, he was working approximately 16 to 20 hours a day. That intensity shaped his work ethic which he still carries today.\"At West Point, you're up at like 5 a.m., and then you're down at like [midnight] ... And it's six days a week of school, no summer breaks,\" he said. \"So I definitely know how to work hard, that's for sure, which I think [helped] at Blackpanda.\"From special forces to startup CEOIn 2009, Yu's military career came to a crossroads when his uncle, Ma Ying-jeou, was elected as the president of Taiwan.\"There was [an] investigation around ... the fact that my uncle was the sitting president of Taiwan, which had occurred while I was in Special Forces,\" said Yu. This period prompted difficult questions about his future.Ultimately, Yu made the decision to leave the army, which left him feeling disoriented and exiled. \"I had a massive loss of identity,\" he said. \"I had waves of deep survivor's guilt, because I knew that I was in my prime as one of the best Special Forces captains the U.S. Army had, and that our boys were overseas, dying and fighting, and I was just chilling out.\"In the years that followed, he struggled to find a new sense of identity. He spent a few years studying Chinese and going back to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, where he was recruited to work as an equity trader at Credit Suisse. Eventually, in 2012, he joined Palantir Technologies which he grew to love, only to get retrenched in 2013. \"After Palantir let me go ... that was the hardest time in my life, by far. And I was also broke...so financially stressed, and couch surfing,\" he said. Then, a crisis involving a family friend named Evelyn Chang pulled him back into action.In 2013, Chang was taken hostage abroad by terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Yu helped orchestrate the rescue: He put a team together, went into the Philippines and rescued her after 35 days. Notably, this mission was what helped inspire the idea for Yu's company today, Blackpanda. He realized that companies or entities facing cyberattacks needed the same kind of fast, 24/7 support that crisis insurance and services provide during kidnappings and ransom situations. \"So the same models that are [used in] the physical safety and security world need to be copied in the digital world. That's what's missing in cyber security,\" he said. He teamed up with some former Green Berets and they all went on to build Blackpanda, an idea shaped from Yu's unique background.Today, in reflection, Yu says that attaching identity to accomplishments is \"a rigged game.\" \"Because every time that you strive for the next achievement, you think that ... Everything is going to be all good, right? But the problem is that if you never heal the original trauma wound, then anyone can still come hurt you from a different angle,\" he said.

Shares had closed 17% lower on Wednesday in New York. China's State Administration for Market Regulation late Wednesday said it was investigating Trip.com due to \"suspected abuse of its dominant market position and monopolistic practices,\" according to a CNBC translation of the statement in Mandarin.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTrip.com is the largest online travel provider in Asia by market cap, and one of the biggest globally. The company has stakes in UK flight aggregator Skyscanner, Indian travel company MakeMyTrip, as well as several Chinese travel providers. Trip.com said in a statement it would \"actively cooperate\" with the investigation, and added its business operations were functioning as usual.In a high-profile case SAMR investigated Chinese tech giant in Alibaba in 2021, fining the firm a record 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) after it was found guilty of monopolistic practices. The probe into Trip.com comes as Chinese tourism is expected to surge this year, with travel marketing and technology firm China Trading Desk estimating that mainland Chinese travelers are expected to take about 165 million to 175 million cross-border trips in 2026, up from an estimated 155 million last year. Chinese New Year holiday, which sees hundreds of millions of people travel back to their hometowns, will be observed between Feb. 5 and Feb. 23.Travel consultancy firm Dragon Trail International said that in 2025, 501 million Chinese traveled domestically during the Chinese New Year holiday period, a 5.9% year-on-year increase.

    "body": "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during an event in Turin, Italy, Nov. 25, 2025.Daniele Mascolo | ReutersDETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa views 2026 as an execution year for the embattled maker of Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles in the U.S. after years of market share declines.Filosa has been undertaking a turnaround plan since he was named CEO in May. So far, his plans have included prioritizing the company's Jeep and Ram brands in the U.S. as well as undoing many decisions his predecessor Carlos Tavares made to focus on all-electric vehicles.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa, wearing a Jeep vest over a white button-down shirt, said this year is a \"first step\" in remaking the company, which was formed five years ago through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and French automaker PSA Groupe.He declined to discuss specifics, adding that his executive team will lay out a detailed future strategy for the automaker at a capital markets day in the first half of this year.Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also include Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.Filosa said he does believe that the company wants \"to stay together\" following some Wall Street speculation in recent years that it would be better to sell off assets or brands. \"We are building a culture,\" Filosa said.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come next week during a meeting with more than 200 company executives that will focus on the company's capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.\"We are a global company with strong regional roots,\" Filosa said, referring to one of three guiding cultural principles he's attempting to instill in the company. The others are being customer focused and working together.Stellantis' global sales under Tavares fell 12.3% from 6.5 million in 2021 — the year the company was formed — to 5.7 million in 2024. That included a roughly 27% collapse in the U.S. in that period to 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, falling from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame.",

Indonesia and Malaysia have both issued a temporary ban on Grok.Those announcements came amid widespread criticism that Grok had enabled X users to easily generate sexual and violent images based on real photos of people on the social network through simple text-based prompts.In the U.S., three Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company makes changes to prevent easy creation of nonconsensual explicit images. Musk's company also said, in the post on Wednesday, that image creation editing through Grok on X will only be available to paid subscribers.Earlier on Wednesday, Musk dared his followers on X to \"break Grok image moderation.\" He said that, \"With NSFW enabled, Grok is supposed allow upper body nudity of imaginary adult humans (not real ones),\" and compared such content to what's seen in R-rated movies. Grok settings, he noted, would also \"vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis.\"WATCH: California attorney general launches investigation into xAI, Grokwatch now",

Last week, five Republican senators joined with Democrats to advance the resolution — a stunning defeat for Trump after he ordered a strike that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.In the days since, the White House engaged in a furious lobbying effort to block the measure.

    "body": "watch nowWholesale prices moved up less than expected while consumers kept up a heavy buying pace in November, according to economic data released Wednesday.The producer price index, a measure of final demand prices that producers get in the marketplace, rose just 0.2% for the month, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was below the Dow Jones consensus for a 0.3% gain though one-tenth of a percentage point higher than October.Excluding food and energy, the core PPI was flat on the month against expectations for a 0.2% gain.Though the monthly readings were soft, the headline PPI was up 3% from a year ago, well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The core PPI excluding trade services posted a 3.5% annual gain, the biggest 12-month move since March 2025, according to the BLS.A 0.9% gain in goods prices fueled much of the PPI increase, with more than 80% attributable to a 4.6% jump in energy prices. Services prices were flat.On the consumer side, retail sales rose 0.6% for November, according to Commerce Department figures adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales were up 0.5%, compared with the 0.3% estimate.The November gains were broad based, with motor vehicle and parts dealers, building material and garden centers, gas stations, sporting goods stores, and miscellaneous outlets all seeing gains eclipsing 1%. On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 3.3%, ahead of the 2.7% increase in the consumer price index for that month. The control group, which strips out several categories and feeds into the gross domestic product calculation, rose 0.4%, in line with market consensus. The BLS remains behind schedule in the PPI data due to the government shutdown last year, while the retail sales reports are also lagging.Financial markets reacted little to the data, with stock futures pointing lower and Treasury yields near flat. Traders continued to price in virtually no chance of a Fed rate rate when it meets later this month.",

    "body": "Celsopupo | Istock | Getty ImagesWall Street is finding an unexpected beneficiary of America's weight loss boom: airlines.With the first GLP-1 weight loss drug now available in pill form, analysts at Jefferies say broad adoption across society could quietly lower fuel bills — airlines' single largest cost — and lift earnings for the carriers. \"A slimmer society = lower fuel consumption. Airlines have a history of being vigilant around aircraft weight savings, from olives (pitless, of course) to paper stock,\" the Wall Street firm said in a note to clients.Jefferies contended that a 10% reduction in average passenger weight could translate into roughly 2% total aircraft weight savings, up to 1.5% lower fuel costs and as much as a 4% boost to earnings per share.Patients are already getting their hands on the first GLP-1 pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk, and a similar product from Eli Lilly isn't far behind, with U.S. approval expected within months. By eliminating the need for self-injection, pills are widely expected to attract first-time patients to obesity treatments.  Earnings GainsJefferies estimates the implications could be material for the largest U.S. carriers, led by American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and Southwest Airlines.Collectively, the four carriers are expected to burn about 16 billion gallons of fuel in 2026 at an average fuel price of $2.41 a gallon, according to Jefferies. That puts their combined fuel bill at nearly $39 billion, accounting for nearly 19% of total operating expenses.Assuming a 1% reduction in aircraft weight improves fuel efficiency by 0.75%, the investment bank estimates a 2% decline in average passenger weight could translate into roughly 4% upside to earnings per share across the group. That equals potential EPS gains of about 2.8% for Delta, 3.5% for United, 4.2% for Southwest and as much as 11.7% for American, which has more operating leverage to fuel costs.Weight is one of the most important drivers of fuel efficiency, a point aircraft manufacturers including  Boeing routinely emphasize. When Boeing delivers an aircraft, there is a fixed \"operating empty weight,\" with the remaining allowance up to the maximum takeoff weight split among fuel, passengers, baggage and cargo, Jefferies noted.Jefferies used a 737 Max 8 as an example. The aircraft has an operating empty weight of about 99,000 pounds, with capacity for roughly 46,000 pounds of fuel and 36,000 pounds of payload. Assuming a two-class configuration with 178 passengers at an average weight of 180 pounds, passengers account for around 32,000 pounds.If average passenger weight declined by 10%, total passenger weight would fall by about 3,200 pounds or  roughly 2% of maximum takeoff weight, delivering meaningful fuel savings over thousands of flights per year, Jefferies said. The industry's fixation on weight is well documented. In 2018, United Airlines switched its Hemisphere magazine to lighter paper, trimming about an ounce per copy, a move expected to save 170,000 gallons of fuel annually, worth roughly $290,000 at the time, Jefferies noted.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

    "body": "watch nowNetflix is likely to amend its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, making an all-cash bid, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday. In December, Netflix reached a deal to purchase WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio in a transaction comprised of cash and stock. The deal is currently valued at $27.75 per WBD share. This would put the deal's equity value at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Bloomberg first reported this week that Netflix was considering adjusting its offer to be all-cash. An amended offer would allow WBD shareholders to vote to approve the offer on a faster timeline, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Under the current deal, shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer, Faber reported. Deals comprised of stock typically mean more financials and accounting need to be issued as part of seeking approval, which requires more time and expense, Faber added.If Netflix were to make its offer all-cash the shareholder vote could move up to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported.The change would come as Paramount Skydance has turned up the heat on its hostile push to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery's business. Earlier this week Paramount sued Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav seeking more information about why the company's board continues to reject its $30 per share offer in favor of Netflix. Paramount has repeatedly argued its deal is superior in value, given the estimated value of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV networks. It has also amended its bid to solidify the backing of Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. ",

    "body": "Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesGoogle is letting users test a new artificial intelligence tool that connects information from various apps like Gmail and Google Photos to provide personalized answers in its chatbot. The feature, called Personal Intelligence, is available for personal accounts, Google said in a blog post Wednesday. \"Whether it's connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched or finding nuance in your photo library, Gemini now understands context without being told where to look,\" Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and the Gemini app, wrote in the post. It's Google's latest attempt to build more reasoning AI capabilities within its Gemini app and lure users as the company goes head-to-head with OpenAI and others in the increasingly competitive generative AI market. While Gemini could already retrieve information from Google apps, the company said Wednesday that Gemini 3 can now \"reason across your data to surface proactive insights.\"The new feature will compete with Apple Intelligence, Apple's personal AI system that integrates apps to help with writing, image creation and understanding context. Apple said Monday it chose Google to power  its AI features, including a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. Personal Intelligence will first be available to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S., the company said, and will be added to Google's search tool \"AI Mode\" in the future. The feature will be off by default, Google said. Woodward, who has launched successful products in Gemini in the past year, warned that the beta version of the new feature hasn't eliminated mistakes, and is asking users to give feedback. \"Gemini may also struggle with timing or nuance, particularly regarding relationship changes, like divorces, or your various interests,\" he wrote. For sensitive topics like health, \"Gemini aims to avoid making proactive assumptions\" but \"will discuss this data with you if you ask,\" Woodward added.Woodward also said the company doesn't train its AI models \"directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library\" but does utilize \"limited info, like specific prompts in Gemini and the model's responses, to improve functionality over time.\"WATCH: Google unveils 'Gemini 3 Flash' AI model focused on speed and costwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowBank of America on Wednesday posted fourth-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations on gains from net interest income and equities trading. Here's what the company reported:Earnings: 98 cents per share vs. 96 cents expected, according to LSEG  Revenue: $28.53 billion vs. $27.94 billion expectedThe company said profit rose 12% from a year earlier to $7.6 billion, or 98 cents per share. Revenue climbed 7.1% to $28.53 billion, thanks to rising net interest income, asset management fees and trading revenue.Shares of the bank fell more than 3% in early trading. \"With consumers and businesses proving resilient, as well as the regulatory environment and tax and trade policies coming into sharper focus, we expect further economic growth in the year ahead,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in the release. \"While any number of risks continue, we are bullish on the U.S. economy in 2026.\"Net interest income, which is the difference in what a bank earns on loans and securities and what it pays depositors for their savings, rose 9.7% to $15.92 billion in the quarter. That is roughly $240 million more than what analysts had expected, per StreetAccount.The bank also gave new guidance on net interest income, saying that it would grow 5% to 7% in 2026. Equities trading revenue rose 23% to $2.02 billion, or about $160 million more than expected. Fixed income trading revenue edged up by 1.5% to $2.52 billion, or about $120 million below what analysts had forecast for the quarter.Fees generated by the firm's investment bankers were roughly flat from a year ago at $1.67 billion, nearly matching the StreetAccount estimate.The lender got a boost from a smaller-than-expected provision for loan losses in the quarter of $1.31 billion, about $190 million lower than analysts had forecast. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets after JPMorgan Chase, has been a beneficiary of the industry's recent tail winds. Falling interest rates, rising Wall Street trading and advisory fees, stable consumer credit, and deregulation have all helped the lender, whose shares rose 25% last year.Analysts will want to hear more from Moynihan as to whether momentum will carry into 2026.On Tuesday, JPMorgan posted results that exceeded expectations on better-than-expected trading revenue. Citigroup and Wells Fargo also report results Wednesday, while Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will release results Thursday. This story is developing. Please check back for updates.Correction: Bank of America's shares rose 25% last year. An earlier version misstated the percentage. ",

    "body": "Security forces are seen during a pro-government rally on Jan. 12, 2026 in Tehran, Iran. Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIran reopened its airspace early Thursday after a temporary closure that barred most incoming and outgoing flights for several hours amid concerns the U.S. could carry out military strikes, raising risks for airlines.The restriction, which ended at 3:30 a.m UTC, or 10:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, was in place for 5 hours.Live data from flight tracker FlightRadar24 showed most aircraft still skirting Iranian airspace as of 4 a.m. UTC, though some domestic carriers had begun resuming flights.The initial order exempted international flights to and from Tehran, provided they received prior approval from Iran's civil aviation authority. The airspace closure comes as tensions escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened intervention following a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran. Trump has publicly said he would \"come to the rescue\" of Iranian protestors if the violent crackdown continued.   The U.S. has begun relocating some personnel and equipment from American military bases in the Middle East amid Iranian threats to strike those locations if Washington launches an attack. Trump later appeared to soften his tone. Speaking at the White House on Wednesday night, Trump said he has been assured that the killings of protestors in Iran had stopped and that he would \"watch it and see\" regarding potential U.S. military action. Several airlines have canceled or rerouted flights to Tehran in recent days. India's largest airline, IndiGo, said Thursday that some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran's airspace closure. Earlier this week, Germany warned its airlines against entering Iranian airspace. The Lufthansa Group said Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, with some flights canceled. The U.S. has prohibited all American commercial flights from overflying Iran. Airlines, including Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have also canceled multiple flights to Iran over the past week. Protests erupted late last year after Iran's national currency, the rial, plunged to record lows, worsening a cost-of-living crisis. The unrest has since evolved into a broader movement against the government's theocratic rule, leading to brutal clashes that have killed at least 2,571 people, according to the U.S.-based HRANA rights group.watch now",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump looks on before signing a bill in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 14, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his administration will approve China sales of Nvidia's H200 chip for artificial intelligence, but the U.S. government will take 25% of sales, one day after formal regulations were published by the U.S. government. Unlike Nvidia's previous China-targeted chip, the H20, the H200 is a version of the company's Hopper generation that is also sold in the U.S. and in other markets. The H200 was not specifically designed and slowed down for export. Trump pointed out in remarks on Wednesday that the H200's performance has been exceeded by two generations of Nvidia chips currently in production, naming Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips. \"It's not the highest level, but it's a pretty good level, and China wants them and other people want them and we're going to be making 25% on the sale of those chips, basically,\" Trump said. Trump initially announced the approval of H200 chips and the 25% government cut a month ago.Previously, Nvidia said the Chinese market could be worth $50 billion per year. \"We're allowing them to do it, but the United States is getting 25% of the chips, in terms of the dollar value,\" Trump said. In a filing published on Tuesday, the Department of Commerce said that the rule change had some requirements, including that the exporter certifies that there is sufficient supply of the H200 chips in the U.S., and that the chips won't take global foundry capacity needed for more advanced AI chips headed for the U.S. Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseThe government said that the customers for the chips would have to have sufficient security procedures, and that the chips will need to undergo independent, third-party testing in the U.S. to confirm their specifications before shipping out. Shipments of the chips to China would be capped at 50% the total product shipped to U.S. customers. The filing also mentions AMD's MI325X chip. \"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\"\"The Administration's critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors on U.S. entity lists — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial business, supporting real jobs for real Americans,\" the spokesperson continued. Last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters that the company is seeing \"very high\" interest in its H200 chip from China customers, and that the company had started producing the chip again. ″We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas.It's unclear whether Chinese regulators will approve the import of the Nvidia chips as the country aims to promote home-grown but inferior AI chips for self-sufficiency. Huang said last week that he isn't expecting an announcement from China. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Last year, Huang provided a two-year forecast for AI chip sales of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Any H200 sales to China would be in addition to that forecast, he said last week. The White House said on Wednesday that it had also imposed a 25% tariff of imports on some chips like the H200, which have to be imported to the U.S. to be tested before they are shipped to China.watch now",

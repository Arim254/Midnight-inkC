Mike Blake | ReutersBill Ackman's Pershing Square revealed a sizable stake in Meta on Wednesday.\"We believe Meta's current share price underappreciates the company's long-term upside potential from AI and represents a deeply discounted valuation for one of the world's greatest businesses,\" stated the fund's annual investor presentation.The position amounts to 10% of Pershing's capital as of the end of 2025.Meta shares are off by 16% over the last 12 months on fears it is spending too much on artificial intelligence. The company in its fourth-quarter earnings report in January projected AI-related capital expenditures to total in the range of $115 billion to $135 billion in 2026.\"We believe concerns around META's AI-related spending initiatives are underestimating the company's long-term upside potential from AI,\" stated the Pershing presentation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMETA 1-year chartPershing noted that Meta currently trades at a 22 times its projected earnings over the next 12 months, cheap considering how much AI is set to rev up future earnings growth. Alphabet, Apple and Nvidia all have higher forward P/Es.Pershing added the stake in the fourth quarter. The fund bought positions in Amazon, Hertz and Meta in 2025, according to the presentation with the Amazon and Hertz stakes previously disclosed.Last year, Pershing outperformed the S&P 500, with the fund's net asset value increasing by 20.9% vs. the index's 17% return.",

Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., slammed her and the Department of Justice for so far failing to indict any of the convicted sex predator Epstein's potential co-conspirators.The S&P 500 is also up and the Nasdaq is \"smashing records,\" while Americans' retirement accounts are \"booming,\" Bondi said after celebrating the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gains. \"That's what we should be talking about.\"Democrats balked at the rhetoric, but Bondi doubled down.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens. Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS Now\"What does the Dow have to do with anything? That's what they just asked. Are you kidding?\" she said as Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, banged a gavel and called for order in the hearing room.Trump has repeatedly cited stock market gains as a barometer for his presidency after being elected to a second term amid voter concerns about rising prices for consumer goods. The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday and added to that record each day this week.The DOJ oversight hearing had already devolved into partisan shouting matches on multiple occasions prior to Bondi's references to the stock market.Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the panel's ranking member, in his opening remarks accused Bondi of \"running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice.\"Raskin pointed to the DOJ's failure to release millions of files that it is legally bound to disclose under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Trump signed into law in November after reversing his opposition to the bill.The lawmaker also slammed the DOJ for redacting the names of alleged Epstein co-conspirators and enablers in the records it did release, while failing to black out victims' identifying information.\"So you ignored the law, and even with over 100,000 employees at your disposal, you acted with some mixture of staggering incompetence, cold indifference and jaded cruelty towards more than 1,000 victims, raped, abused and trafficked,\" Raskin said. \"This performance screams cover up.\"Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the first Democratic member to question Bondi, asked a group of Epstein survivors in the hearing room to stand up and raise their hands if they had been unable to meet with the DOJ. After numerous women stood and all raised their hands, Jayapal asked Bondi to apologize for the \"unacceptable release\" of victims' information in the Epstein files.Bondi began to respond that former Attorney General Merrick Garland \"sat in this chair twice,\" at which point the congresswoman interrupted and pushed her to answer the question, and a back-and-forth ensued.\"I'm not gonna get in the gutter for her theatrics,\" Bondi said.More acrimonious exchanges followed as Bondi and Democrats continued to clash.After Nadler's speaking time expired, Bondi admonished the Democrats who participated in the impeachment hearings against Trump during his first administration, saying, \"You all should be apologizing.\"\"You sit here and you attack the president, and I am not going to have it. I'm not going to put up with it,\" Bondi said.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a cosponsor of the Epstein files bill, laced into Bondi as he called the DOJ's redaction issues a \"massive failure.\"He homed in on redactions that obscured the name of Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, \"as a co-conspirator in an FBI document.\"Bondi said that redaction was corrected \"within 40 minutes.\" Massie shot back, \"40 minutes of me catching you red-handed.\"Bondi said Massie has \"Trump derangement syndrome.\"",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz in September 2025 announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesKraft Heinz on Wednesday said it is pausing work on its previously announced plans to split the company. CEO Steve Cahillane, who joined Kraft Heinz in January, said in a statement that many of the company's issues are \"fixable and within our control.\"\"My number one priority is returning the business to profitable growth, which will require ensuring all resources are fully focused on the execution of our operating plan,\" he said. \"As a result, we believe it is prudent to pause work related to the separation and we will no longer incur related dis-synergies this year.\"Kraft Heinz also plans to invest $600 million to fuel a turnaround of its U.S. business. The company plans to spend the money on its marketing, sales, and research and development. The investment will also go toward \"product superiority and select pricing,\" according to Cahillane.In September, the company announced plans to break up, reversing much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world. While investors originally cheered the merger, the luster faded as the combined company's U.S. sales slipped, and it wrote down many of its iconic brands, like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House. For at least six years, Kraft Heinz has been in turnaround mode, trying to revive its U.S. business.Warren Buffett, who helped mastermind the deal, said he was disappointed in the decision to split. Berkshire Hathaway, under new CEO Greg Abel, has since taken a formal step toward unwinding its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz.\"We support CEO Steve Cahillane and the Kraft Heinz Board of Directors' decision, under Steve's new leadership, to pause work on the company's previously planned separation. As a result, management can commit to strengthening Kraft Heinz's ability to compete and serve customers,\" Abel said in a statement. For years, Kraft Heinz has underinvested in its brands, and executives appeared unwilling to change that strategy, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"This appears to have changed with the hiring Steve Cahillane, who has reshaped KHC's 2026 plans (and proposed split) much more significantly than we had expected in just the six weeks since he started as KHC's CEO,\" Lavery said. \"We still believe this remains a 'show me' story, and that this is only the first step in getting KHC in a position for sustainable growth, which still looks unlikely to come soon.\"Kraft Heinz announced Cahillane's hiring in December. He previously led Kellogg through its own breakup and then headed Kellanova, itself a spinoff, until its sale to Mars. Not everyone on Wall Street was sold on the reversal Wednesday. Shares of Kraft Heinz fell as much as 5% in early trading before rebounding to trade essentially flat. \"Investors will view this negatively because it indicates that the businesses are not in strong enough condition to operate on a standalone basis, and it is uncertain when they will,\" TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.The announcement Wednesday came alongside Kraft Heinz's quarterly earnings release. The company's earnings topped Wall Street's estimates, but its revenue fell short of analysts' projections.",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEssilorLuxottica's more than tripled its Meta artificial intelligence glasses sales last year, the Ray-Ban maker said on Wednesday in its fourth-quarter results. The French-Italian eyewear brand said it sold over 7 million AI glasses last year.That's up from the 2 million that the company sold in 2023 and 2024 combined, according to its quarterly report last February. The figure reported Wednesday includes smart glasses sold under the brands for Ray-Ban and Oakley, the latter of which was unveiled in June. The company's smart glasses success is the latest sign that the adoption of wearable AI devices is gaining momentum with consumers. \"Our success in wearables is helping to propel the AI-glasses revolution, with our iconic brands being a powerful driver of demand,\" the company said in a release.EssilorLuxottica has been working on the wearable devices with the social media company since 2019, CNBC reported at the time. The two companies launched the first edition of the glasses in September 2021, but the device didn't gain widespread attention until the second-generation launch in 2023. Most recently, EssilorLuxottica and Meta introduced a new Ray-Ban iteration, controllable through hand gestures and neural technology, in September. That device retails for $799 and features a small display in one of the lenses. Meta has indicated its commitment to working with the glasses maker and extended a long-term partnership agreement to \"collaborate into the next decade\" in 2024.Last month, Bloomberg reported that Meta and EssilorLuxottica were discussing doubling production to at least 20 million by the end of this year to meet growing demand.

Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., will be considered a day after a procedural vote on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.\"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying,\" Bacon posted to X after the Tuesday vote.Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approved Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.\"This is life with a razor-thin majority,\" Johnson said in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business. \"I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world.\"",

    "body": "Jobseekers speak with recruiters past event signage during the WorkSource North Seattle Career Fair in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe January nonfarm payrolls report beat Wall Street expectations in both job creation and the unemployment rate. Here are the top five takeaways:From a headline perspective, the news was good. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 130,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, the latter thanks to a boom of 528,000 in household employment. The Dow Jones consensus was for 55,000 jobs and a 4.4% unemployment rate.Wages also rose, climbing a higher-than-expected 0.4% for the month and 3.7% annually. Hours worked, a productivity gauge, increased to 34.3 hours, up by 0.1 hour.Along with the sunshine came some rain. Annual revisions to the jobs count benchmarked against Census data showed that for the April 2024-March 2025 period, payrolls growth was 898,000 lower than initially stated. Moreover, November's previous estimate fell by 15,000 and December was off 2,000. For the final six months of 2025, the economy lost a net 1,000 jobs.Payroll growth again was concentrated in health care-related fields: There were 82,000 jobs in ambulatory health-care services, hospitals, and nursing and residential care facilities, and another 42,000 in social assistance. Only construction, which added 33,000 positions, showed any noticeable improvement.Traders increased their bets that the strong headline payrolls number and decline in the unemployment rate would keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines until the summer. Futures market trading implied just an 8% probability of a cut in March, with the next reduction not likely happening until at least June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.They said it:\"Just in: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED! The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far. This would be an INTEREST COST SAVINGS OF AT LEAST ONE TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR - BALANCED BUDGET, PLUS. WOW! The Golden Age of America is upon us!!!\" — President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post\"The strong payrolls print in January may be somewhat exaggerated: construction payrolls jumped, sensitive to warmer January weather; healthcare payrolls were well above trend; and retail stabilized. The  underlying pace for private payrolls is probably closer to 50k per month after accounting for the temporary strength in those areas, close to the recent pace.\" — Michael Gapen, Morgan Stanley chief economist\"The strong jobs growth in January assuages some concerns around the softening labor market and supports the outlook for consumption. But we'll need to see more data to determine whether January is a brief deviation from an overall trend or a reversal of the weakening employment outlook.\" — Atsi Sheth, Moody's Ratings chief credit officerCorrection: The previous December estimate was off by 2,000. An earlier version misstated the figure.",

David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJanuary job gains were better than anything the U.S. economy saw in 2025 but not still enough to sound an all-clear on what has otherwise been a stagnant labor market.With a gain of 130,000 nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.3%, the lowest since August, the numbers indicated that hiring is at least hanging in there while layoffs appear contained.However, beneath the hood there were some trouble spots: A continued concentration in just a few fields where hiring is happening; revisions that meant virtually no gains in the second half of 2025, and questions over what happens from here as companies contend with a high level of uncertainty.\"I would anticipate that for the rest of the year, job growth is going to be quite subdued,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"Whether it's as subdued as 2025 ... is still an open question. But I would not expect job growth to be higher than 50,000 for the remainder of 2026.\"Indeed, revisions the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday put job gains last year at just 15,000 a month. The last six months of the year produced a net loss of 1,000 jobs. In the recent words of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, the year's job growth was close to \"Zero. Zip. Nada.\"Also, nearly all the January jobs came from health care-related sectors, raising questions over the ability of displaced and new workers to be able to get hired. On top of the anemic gains, Daco has another worry. He sees trouble brewing with the receding income gains for cash-strapped consumers possibly causing damage not readily visible in headline economic numbers.Average hourly earnings advanced 0.4% in January, slightly higher than expected, but the annual gain of 3.71% was the lowest since July 2024. With retail sales unexpectedly flat in December, and consumer spending responsible for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, that could spell a potential danger sign.\"We're heading from a jobless expansion to potentially an income-less expansion, because income is essentially the combination of jobs and wages. With both under pressure, that means that for many families, income and income growth prospects are muted,\" Daco said.Questions for the futureSo while the monthly numbers are good, whether they are an outlier, or even if they will stand up, remains to be seen. After all, every month in 2025 saw a negative revision from the initial estimate. The release comes with other economic signs looking strong. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of growth, is on pace to post a solid 3.7% gain in the fourth quarter after posting 4.4% and 3.8% increases in the prior two periods in 2025, according to the Atlanta Fed.However, that kind of growth is hard to sustain without stronger job gains, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock.\"One key warning sign is that in past cycles, GDP growth like this has usually required far more hiring. The fact that hiring has slowed while growth has advanced may potentially be an early signal of a productivity boom that we expect to continue,\" Rieder said in a note. \"While areas like healthcare are still labor intensive, the more interest-sensitive parts of the economy are clearly still under pressure, particularly the lower income segment.\"The state of the labor market and its relation to inflation sets up a policy challenge at the Federal Reserve, which already has seen significant divisions over how to proceed.Most recently, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland said Tuesday that they don't see a need to cut rates further with inflation still above the Fed's target and the labor market stable. As voters this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, their positions conflict with those of Governor Waller, who is advocating for more cuts, a position also held by Fed Chair-designate Kevin Warsh.\"I think there is room for the Fed to get a little bit closer to median estimates of neutral policy,\" EY's Daco said. \"I don't necessarily think that that will be the case ... in part because a majority of Fed policy makers are more focused on the inflation mandate than on the employment mandate.\"For their part, markets took the view Wednesday that the January payrolls report will temper any urges to cut rates soon. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker, trades are pricing in the likelihood of a cut in March at roughly 6%, though they still see two reductions before the end of the year.",

    "body": "watch nowGreenlight Capital's David Einhorn anticipates the Federal Reserve will issue more interest rate cuts this year than what's being anticipated and that's giving him greater confidence in his gold bet.While rate cut expectations diminished a bit Wednesday following the much better-than-expected January jobs report, traders are still currently pricing in a more than 88% chance that the central bank will make two quarter percentage point cuts by the end of the year, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.But Einhorn said that the market viewing the latest jobs figures as a reason not to cut is \"wrong.\" In fact, he thinks the rate cuts number could be higher than that, as he expects Kevin Warsh – President Donald Trump's pick to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair – is going to be able to persuade the committee to do so.\"If we have 4% or 5% inflation, sure, then he won't be able to persuade people, but otherwise he's going to argue productivity,\" Einhorn said on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" to Sara Eisen on Wednesday, adding that Warsh, in his view, is going to take the position of cutting \"even if the economy is running hot.\"\"I think by the time we get to the end of the year, it's going to be substantially more than two cuts,\" he continued.The hedge fund manager also owns gold, which sold off at the end of last month after Trump announced Warsh as his nominee for Fed chair, as the move eased anxieties on Wall Street surrounding Fed independence.The yellow metal – typically viewed as an inflation hedge – has since seen some recovery, with gold futures being up more than 17% this year. That's after it surged more than 60% in 2025 amid threats to central bank independence as well as heightened geopolitical tensions and unstable trade policy. Since 2024, it's surged more than 120%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold futures prices since 2024Einhorn — who gained notoriety in 2008, when he bet against Lehman Brothers at the Sohn Investment Conference just months before the investment bank declared bankruptcy — pointed out that gold has actually gone up over the past couple years as a result of \"becoming the reserve asset\" to own among central banks around the world.\"U.S. trade policy is very unstable, and it's causing other countries to say we want to settle our trade in something other than U.S. dollars,\" he said.In the long term, he said that a reason to own gold is due to the fact that the current relationship between our fiscal and monetary policies \"don't make any sense.\" He also said that other major developed currencies around the world are \"as bad or worse\" than the U.S.The U.S. dollar suffered its biggest single-day drop since April 2025 last month after Trump said he wasn't concerned about the currency's recent weakness.\"There are some issues that sometime over the next number of years could play out with some of the major currencies,\" he said.Deeming betting on more cuts as \"one of the best trades out there right now,\" Einhorn said he was also long futures on SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), which essentially is a bet that short-term rates will continue to go lower.",

    "body": "watch nowThe House will vote Wednesday afternoon on an election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and require photo identification at the ballot box. The SAVE America Act, introduced by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, has been the focus of a pressure campaign from the White House, hard-line congressional Republicans and online influencers like Elon Musk. Democrats and voting rights groups, meanwhile, say the legislation would disenfranchise millions of Americans, make it harder to register to vote, and put more power in the hands of Trump and the federal government ahead of what is expected to be a difficult midterm election for the GOP.\"It's the president's wishes that elections be turned over to him and his administration,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., referring to Trump's recent comments about nationalizing American elections.

It cleared a procedural hurdle Wednesday afternoon, teeing up a vote on final passage later in the day.If the legislation passes the House, it faces an uphill climb in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have vowed to block the measure, which needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. At least one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, has come out in opposition. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., a supporter of the legislation, on Tuesday threw cold water on a push to change the filibuster rule in the Senate to clear the way for passage, further undermining the bill's odds of becoming law.\"There aren't anywhere close to the votes, not even close, to nuking the filibuster,\" Thune said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"So that idea is something, although it continues to be put out there. … That doesn't have a future.\"Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) listens during a House Rules Committee meeting on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act at the U.S. Capitol on May 21, 2025.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesBut the House is pressing on.Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., during a Wednesday appearance on Fox Business called it a top priority for both the House GOP and the president and echoed Trump's unfounded claims about noncitizen voters deciding federal elections.\"They want illegals to vote. That's why they opened the border wide for four years under [President Joe} Biden and [Vice President Kamala] Harris and allowed in all these dangerous people. It was a means to an end. The end is maintaining their own power,\" Johnson said.\"They've got to cheat, frankly. That's it. They've got to allow illegals to participate in elections so that they can continue to win,\" he said.It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and documented cases are rare.  According to the Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available and 2.6 million Americans lack government-issued photo ID of any kind. Young voters and voters of color could be disproportionately impacted and women whose married names are not on their birth certificates could face additional barriers to register, the Brennan Center warned.The latest push for a GOP-led election reform bill comes nearly a year after the House advanced similar legislation, dubbed the SAVE Act, with the support of four Democrats. The earlier iteration of the bill, also introduced by Roy, required proof of citizenship to register to vote, but did not have the voter ID provision. It never got a vote on the Senate floor.Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, one of the Democrats who supported the earlier SAVE Act, told CNBC this week the newer version is \"not even close to the same\" as the one he previously supported.Another Democratic supporter of the earlier SAVE Act, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, said on Wednesday she would not support the latest proposal.\"Call me a perfectionist but if your legislation requires government to provide free photocopy services, you have not written a good piece of legislation,\" she posted to X.",

    "body": "watch nowNovo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar on Wednesday said the company is aiming to capture around 15 million new patients, at least initially, when Medicare starts covering obesity treatments for the first time later this year.Around 67 million Americans are covered by Medicare, but \"when you take a look at specifically our products and the target group, I think around 15 million people would be a good number to target,\" he told CNBC in an interview. Medicare is slated to start covering obesity medicines for the first time later this year under the landmark \"most-favored-nation\" drug pricing deals that Novo and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, struck with President Donald Trump in November. Health experts say the long-awaited coverage could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Some experts estimate that 20 million to 30 million Medicare patients are suffering from obesity and related conditions.Doustdar said Medicare coverage, along with the launch of Novo's new obesity pill and other factors, should help the company gradually boost prescription volumes and offset lower prices in the U.S. following that agreement with Trump. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsBut he said he doesn't expect Medicare access to obesity treatments to open up overnight. \"Now, it would be great if we could find a way to get access very, very fast. But I think that would be a bit naive,\" Doustdar said, pointing to the slow adoption seen among eligible patients with commercial insurance. It's a slightly more conservative tone on the initial impact of Medicare coverage compared with Lilly, which has cited that coverage as a key tail wind to its guidance this year. Last week, Lilly said it expects Medicare coverage to come online by July. Meanwhile, Doustdar said Novo is in the midst of negotiations with the government on \"exactly which month, which week that is going to be opening.\" Closing the market share gapNovo is under pressure to claw back market share in the booming GLP-1 space from Lilly and cheaper, compounded copycats. Last week, Lilly said its share of the U.S. obesity and diabetes drug market increased to 60.5% in the fourth quarter, while Novo's was 39.1%.Novo has also highlighted a gap in the \"preference share\" for its weight loss treatment Wegovy versus Lilly's rival injections. In the U.S., Novo estimates that between 7 and 8 patients out of 10 go to Lilly. When asked how Novo plans to close that gap, Doustdar said one way to do so is \"to do better on the pill.\" The company's Wegovy obesity pill has a head start compared with Lilly's upcoming oral drug, orforglipron, which is expected to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration during the second quarter. Mike Doustdar, left, CEO of Novo Nordisk, and David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, listen as President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office during an event about weight-loss drugs on Nov. 6, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesDoustdar said Novo's pill is slightly more effective than Lilly's based on separate clinical trials, showing 16.6% weight loss compared with 12.4% with Lilly's oral drug. \"If you use these two numbers, basically you have a 40% difference between the efficacy of these pills,\" he said. \"I think this is going to be a very main, main selling point of the pill.\" But Doustdar also pointed to the upcoming approval and launch of a higher dose – 7.2 milligram – of Wegovy that could help win market share from Lilly's obesity treatment Zepbound. That higher dose helps patients lose around 21% of their weight, which is \"very much on par\" with the highest dose of Zepbound, he said. Zepbound's higher efficacy has been a key factor in driving more patients and prescribers away from choosing Wegovy, which has shown around 15% weight loss on average in clinical trials. \"When that comes to the market, my thought, my wish, my hope is that people will realize, OK, now we have two products with similar efficacy,\" he said.

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration's decision to park $500 million of Venezuelan oil revenue in Qatar raises fundamental questions about the South American nation's future after the U.S. captured former President Nicolás Maduro.Among them: When will a transition of power take place, who will ultimately govern Venezuela and who controls the country's vast resources? Right now, the administration is collaborating closely with the remnants of the Maduro regime under the leadership of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. The problem is that the U.S. does not officially recognize the government that Rodriguez is leading. President Donald Trump during his first term recognized the opposition-led National Assembly elected in 2015 as the only legitimate representative of the Venezuelan people. Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 9 that requires the proceeds from Venezuela's oil sales to be held in a U.S. Treasury Department account. The president's order states that the money is the sovereign property of the government of Venezuela held in custody by the U.S. But it's unclear which Venezuelan government the order is referencing.  Once the money arrives in the U.S., it should in theory be under the control of the opposition National Assembly due to Trump's 2019 recognition, said Scott Anderson, an international law expert who previously served with the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under President Barack Obama.This poses potential problems for the administration's cooperation with Rodriguez. She has agreed to ship 50 million barrels of crude oil to the U.S. The Trump administration is controlling the sale of those barrels. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said this arrangement will continue indefinitely to maintain leverage over Caracas to implement reforms.Democrats, meanwhile, are questioning whether the arrangement is legal. Dueling governmentsSecretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress the decision was made to hold the money in Qatar while the issue of government recognition is resolved. Qatar recognizes the Maduro regime as the legitimate government of Venezuela, allowing the U.S. to avoid the issue in the short term.\"We have an issue we're working through on recognition,\" Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 28. \"You have to recognize a government, but we don't recognize this government,\" the secretary of State said. \"We recognize the 2015 National Assembly, so we have to find some creative way legally to meet that standard.\" A Trump administration official told CNBC that an account has been set up for the government of Venezuela at the Treasury Department and \"future revenues derived from the sale of Venezuela natural resources will come into and go out of the account.\" The initial $500 million in revenue held in Qatar has since been transferred to Venezuela, the official said. watch nowThe Trump administration will probably have to work out an arrangement with the 2015 National Assembly on how the oil money will be spent, said Anderson, who recently published a legal analysis of the plan.\"The Rodriguez government in theory has no voice in how any Venezuelan funds in the United States are spent,\" Anderson said. Rubio told the Senate that the U.S. has established a \"respectful and productive\" line of communication with Rodriguez. He said U.S. cooperation with Rodriguez is a pragmatic approach to what he described as the \"transition and stabilization\" phase in Venezuela. The secretary of State said a written agreement is in place with the Rodriguez government on oil sales. \"We are just acknowledging reality, and that is you have to work with the people that are in charge of the elements of government,\" Rubio told the Senate. The U.S. goal is to ultimately transition away from Venezuela's current system, Rubio said. \"This is not the end state that we want,\" the secretary of State said. Democrats question legalityCaracas will submit a budget that the U.S. will review and then waive sanctions to disburse oil revenue for Venezuela from a blocked account, Rubio said. The U.S. will tell Caracas what the funds cannot be used  for up front, he said. An audit process will be set up to make sure the money is spent appropriately, Rubio said. The Export-Import Bank of the United States could play that role though nothing has been finalized, he said. Rubio described the arrangement as a short-term mechanism and not a permanent solution. \"I understand it's novel, but it's the best we could come up with in the short term,\" he said.watch nowA Trump administration official told CNBC that the U.S. \"continues to work toward a long-term solution to ensure oil revenues may flow and be utilized for Venezuela's people and economic stability.\"Long term, the U.S. plans to help build a normal oil industry in Venezuela where companies move crude directly into the global market without a middleman, Rubio said. Democrats in Congress are raising questions about the legality of the current arrangement. Rep. Sean Casten, D-Ill., and a dozen other lawmakers warned U.S. oil companies in a Jan. 28 letter that they face legal risks if they participate in Venezuelan oil sales under the current arrangement.Casten said the Trump administration has not provided Congress with a full explanation of the legal authority it invoked, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to cover the oil sales program.Under the IEEPA, the president can confiscate the property of a foreign country only during armed hostilities or in response to an attack on the U.S. Democrats have questioned how the IEEPA can apply when Rubio has made clear that the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. The secretary of State told the Senate that the U.S. is not confiscating Venezuela's property.\"The money never enters our hands,\" Rubio said. \"We only control the disbursement of the money. We don't control the actual money.\"",

In response, McDonald's has embraced discounted offerings, from rolling out a value menu to relaunching Extra Value combo meals. One bright spot for McDonald's and the broader fast-food segment has been high-income diners, who are trading down from fast-casual restaurant options. Buzzy promotions have won over those consumers and boosted the chain's sales, too; the fourth quarter included the return of the Monopoly game, as well as the Grinch Meal, timed for the holiday season.Analysts are projecting that McDonald's same-store sales will rise 3.9%, fueled by a 5.4% increase in the U.S., according to StreetAccount estimates.Despite the rebound in its sales, McDonald's shares have risen only about 4% over the last year, hurt by broader industrywide concerns about the consumer and the rise of GLP-1 drugs. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 14% in the same period.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: E.W. Scripps Co. signage is displayed on a monitor on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, June 3, 2016. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesE.W. Scripps is setting into motion what it calls a transformation plan for the broadcast station company — intended to generate growth for both earnings and its local TV stations. The company announced Wednesday that it's targeting growth of between $125 million and $150 million in annual enterprise earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2028. In order to get there, Scripps will go through a number of cost savings and revenue growth measures that lean on technology, namely artificial intelligence, CNBC can exclusively report. \"This will essentially be a reorienting of the entire company ... with a much more agile and efficient cost structure,\" CEO Adam Symson said in an interview with CNBC. \"We have to act like a media startup. We've got to act like the company E.W. founded, because the marketplace cannot bear the legacy pace or legacy thinking.\"The company plans to outline more details about its efforts during its next earnings call with investors on Feb. 26, but Symson described making changes to the newsroom to alleviate journalists from administrative tasks and to focus more on gathering and reporting the news. The company declined to comment on specific impacts to staffing as a result of the cost cutting, saying potential effects to jobs would be determined over the next several months. \"Everything is on the table, but our goal is to always preserve the journalism and the sales, the two things that make up our customer relationship,\" said Symson. Scripps owns more than 60 local affiliate broadcast stations across 40 markets, including Ion, which has become a broadcaster of the WNBA and other pro sports games. The company's stock has dropped 70% in the last five years, a decline not unlike many of its media peers. The revitalization for the almost 150-year-old Scripps comes as the company — as well as the broadcast industry at large — finds itself at a historically challenging moment. The broadcast station industry — which also includes publicly traded companies like Nexstar Media Group, Tegna, Sinclair and Gray Media — faces the same challenges as its cable and content studio peers, namely the defection of pay TV bundle subscribers for streaming alternatives. As a result, the industry has been in pursuit of consolidation as it awaits key regulatory changes. Scripps itself has been an M&A target, with Sinclair recently making a hostile approach to merge with the company. Scripps has rejected such overtures. Meanwhile, media outlets across print, digital and TV have been in the midst of massive layoffs in the last year. Paramount Skydance has cut thousands of jobs across the company, including at its CBS News, and most recently The Washington Post reportedly told staffers it would eliminate a third of its newsroom jobs. The rise of AI has also fueled fears about mass layoffs, especially in newsrooms. In 2024 Scripps announced the creation of an AI team that would report to Laura Tomlin, Scripps' chief transformation officer. Symson said her first order of business has been to \"consolidate technology from across the company.\" Symson said Scripps' move to implement new technology is not meant to replace journalism jobs with AI, but instead help newsrooms work more efficiently and ensure a long runway for local news. \"This cannot be a cost-cutting exercise in service to incrementally trying to improve margins from cutting product. That has proven to be the beginning of the end,\" said Symson. \"This really has to be about starting with our consumer understanding, what it is they need out of us, both from our news product as well as our sales product.\"Transformation effortsThis week, Symson gathered 200 leaders from across the company at Scripps' headquarters in Cincinnati to outline the latest plan, which will be announced more broadly on Wednesday to Scripps employees and investors. The company will also reaffirm its most recent earnings guidance, noting it expects its 2026 financial performance to be lifted by midterm elections — local broadcast stations rely heavily on political advertising — as well as the airing of the Winter Olympics and upcoming World Cup on its affiliates this year.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstJonathan Ernst | ReutersThis transformation, with the vision tagline, \"We Create Connection,\" is the latest step in recent years for Scripps to find new avenues of revenue growth. \"Scripps' transformation effort is not unique, per se. Everyone in the space is cutting costs,\" said analyst Dan Kurnos of Benchmark in a recent interview. \"Last we checked, broadcast TV wasn't the most rapidly growing segment of the media ecosystem. It's just not as bad as cable.\" During a November earnings call with investors, Symson teased further initiatives the team has been working on, calling out its focus on \"expense management.\"For the local media division, Scripps said its third-quarter expenses had decreased more than 4% year over year and the networks business saw expenses drop 7.5%, both due in part to \"lower employee-related costs.\" Yet Kurnos said that Scripps has deviated from its peers with other moves, such as growing Scripps Sports with local media rights. Scripps' networks now have the rights to air WNBA games, and the company has also been picking up the rights to NHL teams exiting their regional sports networks. \"I think Scripps has been forced to reinvent themselves a few times,\" Kurnos told CNBC.

Scripps Company, Adam Symson poses for a photo with WNBA Commissioner, Cathy Engelbert.Courtesy: ScrippsWhile Scripps has rejected a merger with Sinclair, the company has been doing smaller deals on its own, such as offloading stations and a station swap with Gray Media, which is still pending approval. This week the company also agreed to sell its Court TV network for less than $125 million, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified speaking about internal matters.Symson acknowledged the need for consolidation as the industry forges ahead into a new era. But he fell short of saying it was a necessity, at least for Scripps, as some of his peers have said on recent public calls. \"Responsible consolidation is important for the industry, without question. But make no mistake about it, it is financial engineering,\" said Symson. \"It will create a tail wind for our business that investors should appreciate, and we will go after it, but it will not create the organic growth that we are talking about here.\"  Symson's history at Scripps runs deep and began in the newsroom. He started at the company as an executive producer of investigations and special projects at a Scripps-owned affiliate in Phoenix before joining the corporate parent in 2003 and taking over as CEO in 2017. The latest transformation efforts follow similar shifts in 2023, when Scripps eliminated some anchor roles, added reporters in smaller markets and increased reporters' wages, among other changes. \"It is very personal to me. I think at this point, I'm the only CEO of a broadcast company that comes from a journalism background and from the newsroom,\" said Symson. \"What we do is too important for us to not go on the offense and aggressively transform the company in order to ensure that we're a company that continues to thrive.\"Disclosure: CNBC parent Versant is carrying NBC Sports-produced Olympic coverage on its networks, including USA Network and CNBC.",

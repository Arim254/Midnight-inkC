    "body": "Carles Reina, GTM manager at Eleven Labs, shared why he invested in AI company.Eleven LabsThe angel investor who backed a billion-dollar AI startup when it was still in its infancy said he decided to invest in the company after just 30 minutes of meeting one of its founders.Carles Reina first decided to invest in AI voice startup Eleven Labs in 2022, when he was a venture partner at pre-seed fund Concept Ventures.Co-founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski, Eleven Labs specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology. In its January Series C funding round earlier this year, the company raised $180 million at a valuation of $3.3 billion.Then in September, the company announced it was letting employees sell shares at a $6.6 billion valuation.However, before Eleven Labs even had a concrete product, Reina, who was working at Palantir Technologies at the time, decided to take a chance on the firm after meeting Staniszewski.\"I met Mati when he was still at Palantir,\" Reina told CNBC Make It in an interview. \"We started talking, and within 30 minutes of the first conversation, I told him, 'How much money do you want?'\"Reina explained that before the launch of ChatGPT, voice AI hadn't garnered much attention because big tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft all had text-to-speech products, but they hadn't really taken off.\"With ElevenLabs no one was looking at voice AI, literally no one wanted to give [them] money. No VCs wanted to actually back ElevenLabs, back in the early days on the pre-seed round. So those are the type of industries that I really like, so that I can get in before everyone else,\" he said.Reina has made 74 angel investments over the past eight years, including Revolut, Volumetric, Elroy Air, and Speckle. He now works for Eleven Labs as a go-to-market manager.He said he always tries to identify industries that other investors are not paying attention to: \"I've done [invested in] mostly AI before it was sexy. I've done robotics before it was sexy as well.\"The No.1 trait to watch for in foundersReina specializes in investing in pre-seed companies — those with an idea, but often without a fully developed product. This means identifying key traits in founders that indicate a startup will succeed.\"If there is a product, fantastic, but if there is no product, absolutely fine for me … I love founders that are very technical. They're super sharp,  very smart, literally trying to build a global company from day one,\" Reina explained.He said he \"invests based on thesis,\" so if a founder is very technical, they'll have a deeper understanding of the product and the market they're selling to.Reina said he saw these traits in Staniszewksi, which convinced him to back ElevenLabs despite the voice AI market being very small at the time.\"No one wants to talk to AI voices if they sound robotic. That's fundamentally the biggest problem that there was right… so when I spoke with Mati, he talked about both elements, and he had not been in the market,\" Reina said.\"It was really interesting to see he was thinking about the problems of the entire ecosystem before even actually having any product or before even actually talking to any real potential customer.\"Staniszewski had a background in mathematics with a first-class honors degree from Imperial College London. His vision and technical expertise sold Reina, and ElevenLabs became one of the few startups that he decided to back \"literally within less than an hour.\"Now, Eleven Labs is planning a global expansion, including building new hubs in Paris, Singapore, Brazil and Mexico, as well as getting the company ready for IPO within the next five years, Staniszewski told CNBC in July.",

    "body": "Saying \"no\" is essential in parenting. But setting limits shouldn't start and end with that one word.As a certified child life specialist and licensed therapist, I know that saying \"no\" is meant to help kids feel safe, supported, and understood. I often help kids understand: \"Your parents aren't saying 'no' to control you, they're saying 'no' to support you.\"Boundaries deepen trust and cooperation over time. When we say \"no\" with calm, consistency, and care, we're setting limits. But we're also teaching emotion regulation, self-control, and connection. These are crucial skills our kids will carry far beyond childhood. Here's how to say no in ways that build connection instead of conflict. Turn 'no' into a teachable momentThink about a curious one-year-old who's putting sand in their mouth, pulling the dog's tail, or standing on a chair. If we just say \"no\" or \"stop\" without explaining, we might leave them feeling confusion, shame, or doubt.Instead we might say \"not in the mouth,\" \"gentle hands,\" or \"sit down.\" It's still a boundary but it teaches and guides them in a way they can learn and understand. When kids aren't adhering to limits, they might need firmer boundaries. But those can still help them figure out what to do, rather than just what not to do. For example: \"No helmet, no bike.\" \"It's not safe to ride without a helmet, so I'm going to put the bike away for now.\" \"As soon as you put your helmet on, you can ride your bike.\"Explain the 'why'Kids crave reasoning to make sense of things. Limits work best when kids understand them. With my two young children, I always lead with limits related to safety and kindness. This helps me stay mindful of when and why I'm saying \"no\" in the first place, and whether or not certain limits are negotiable. Recently, my five-year-old asked for emotional support while I was driving. I said, \"I can't hold your hand when I'm driving because it's not safe. But as soon as we get home, I can give you a hug.\" It was still a \"no,\" but it prioritized connection and safety. When kids know why, they're more likely to accept the limit even if they don't like it. This can teach them perspective-taking. For screens, helmets, and more, it might also mean explaining that \"every family has different rules, and these are ours.\" Offer control through choicesWhen kids hear the word \"no,\" they immediately feel stripped of autonomy and control — often when they're trying to explore their world and build their identity.Pair limits with choices. That can sound like:\"The park isn't a choice right now, you can choose to play in the backyard or in the basement.\"\"Choose one more thing to do and then it's time to leave.\"When kids struggle to decide, you can always resort to: \"You can choose or I can choose for you.\"Kids will feel empowered by being able to make a choice within the boundaries you've clearly set. Be consistent Toddlers test every limit, every day. And it doesn't stop after toddlerhood. It's a sign of healthy development, and it looks different at different ages and stages.This is how kids learn what's safe and where the boundaries are. When limits change easily, kids push harder. When limits are consistent, they learn to trust and expect them.Our job as parents is to communicate consistently, calmly, and clearly even when kids melt down or fight back. It teaches them that their world is safe and predictable, even when it's upsetting, and shows them unwavering support in the face of challenges.Repair when you react Sometimes we shout \"no!\" instinctively in moments of stress or fear, like when a child is running toward the street.It's natural to react that way, but it's essential to follow up with an explanation and perhaps even an apology. When my daughter recently tugged on a necklace that's already broken twice, I added: \"I'm worried it will break. It's special to me and costs money to fix.\" She said, \"I'm sorry mama. It was an accident. I won't do it again.\"Repairing and explaining after an emotional \"no\" can teach kids about accountability and empathy in a relationship and demonstrate reflection and correction.Stay firm as they get olderAs kids grow and develop, boundaries may look and sound different but the underlying message is the same.A \"no\" to going to the park after school might sound like, \"I hear you, but that's not an option today. We already have plans.\" Similarly, when it's time to end an activity: \"We're all done now\" or \"It's time to go home.\" You can even validate their feelings while staying firm: \"It's okay to be upset, but it's not going to change the plans. I'm right here with you.\"These honest conversations around limits teach kids that boundaries and connection can exist together — a lesson that will serve them through every stage of life. Kelsey Mora is Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "When Rick Senko started re-selling used items on eBay, he was \"flat broke\" — a recently unemployed single father who was desperate to earn enough money to support his 5-year-old son.That was 2008, and the first item he sold — a cell phone he bought for $35 on Craigslist and flipped on eBay for $75 — felt like discovering a \"glitch in the Matrix,\" says Senko, now 41 and based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Realizing he could turn a tidy profit by flipping used items online, he went all in. He studied brands and sales trends, exploiting market inefficiencies and often working up to 20 hours a day \"just going to the flea market, going to the thrift store, making relationships, studying my craft, learning, listing [items] every single day,\" he says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterWhat started as a way to make ends meet slowly grew into a reselling empire, bringing in millions of dollars a year in sales as one of eBay's top sellers. In 2023, Senko started a wholesale business called Technsports that sells up to 5,000 items of used clothing per day to other professional resellers. Technsports brought in more than $6.5 million in 2024 revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Technsports is profitable overall, with a profit margin of roughly 50% per item sold, Senko says.\"I have not taken a day off in almost 20 years,\" says Senko. \"It is not lost on me how fortunate I am. But it also took a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of commitment, and a tremendous amount of sacrifice to get from where I came from to now selling millions of dollars per year and living a very, very fortunate life.\"'You don't need a lot of money to start'After becoming a father at age 18, Senko worked as a CVS photography lab supervisor for five years to make ends meet for himself and his son. He attended a vocational school to earn a computer repair certificate, which landed him a better-paying job at Circuit City in Fall 2008.Two weeks later, Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Senko found himself out of work and unable to find a new job during the Great Recession. Then, his cellphone broke. \"I didn't have a lot of money, so I went onto eBay to get a pre-owned [phone],\" says Senko.He saw one on eBay listed for $75, and then spotted the same model of phone on Craigslist for $35. It was a \"lightbulb moment\" that seemed too good to be true, he says: \"I would double the money. I would get a phone for free, and then I would get my original $35 back.\"Senko bought the Craigslist phone and sold it on eBay for $70, he says. He used the profits to buy another phone on Craigslist, which he flipped on eBay to double his money again. \"I've been doing that ever since, for almost 20 years. Rinse and repeat,\" says Senko, adding: \"You don't need a lot of money to start. You don't need a lot of knowledge to start. You just need to start.\"He initially focused on electronics — from phones to video games, broken or functional, any low-priced item that he could resell within days, he says. As he learned more about which items sold better than others — and where to find in-demand stock — his earnings grew considerably, topping $100,000 in 2010, he says.Around that time, he began shifting his focus to pre-owned clothing, which requires far less \"customer support,\" he says. \"A T-shirt is not going to break in the mail.\" Clothing required a level of research that Senko was willing to do, he notes: While most people understand that electronics can be valuable, \"not everybody knows a particular Polo Ralph Lauren shirt could be worth more [than a gaming console] ... Oftentimes those [clothes] are discarded in a pile on the floor at the flea market.\"Senko started leaving home before dawn and spending most of each day picking through piles of used clothing at South Florida thrift shops, consignment shops, flea markets and garage sales, he says. Reselling gave him freedom and control over his schedule, and tapped into his competitive desire to win at all costs, he adds.'I get after it every single day'Over time, Senko built relationships with sellers at flea markets and thrift stores to ensure he got the first crack at picking through new stock. He listed and sold roughly 250 items per day, or tens of thousands of products each year, and hired up to five contract employees at a time to help him photograph items, list them online and handle shipping.In 2023, he brought in more than $2.5 million in eBay sales, documents show — up from $500,000 in 2017. But he had a feeling that he'd hit a ceiling of how many items he could list and sell per day, he says.So, that same year, Senko decided to switch up his business model. Rather than buying select pieces and selling them each individually online, he began buying clothes in bulk and selling them wholesale to other resellers willing to spend time carefully sifting through each batch. Clients sometimes buy up to 1,000 items per week, he says.\"They process it, they fulfill it and they sell it one at a time on eBay,\" Senko explains, adding: \"The most valuable asset for my business became the inventory. I'm more profitable selling more items at a smaller margin.\"The lesser time commitment also helped Senko fulfill a promise to his wife, who he met during his brief time at Circuit City, he says: that they'd work as hard as they could until his son graduated high school, and then pursue an early retirement. \"[We wanted to] be able to take a 50-year vacation,\" says Senko.He and his wife finally took time off last year to travel the country, visiting places like New York, California and Las Vegas. \"We are starting to enjoy the fruits of the labor,\" he says. But he's reluctant to actually retire, he notes: \"To say that I am mentally on the 50-year vacation? Not even close.\"Senko says it's difficult for him to shut off his competitive drive, especially when he knows there is money to be made and that he has the means and expertise to do it. And if he keeps working on Technsports, he could try to ensure that his current level of financial stability lasts for the rest of his life, he says.\"I get after it every single day. Because when you unlock [that] ability to multiply money, to take $5, put it onto eBay and sell something and get $25 back, how in the world can you rest?\" he says. \"Did I work a lot? Absolutely ... I needed to grow the business. And, ultimately, I needed to be the best.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "One quality separates the most successful business owners from all others, according to billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud: They work really, really hard.In that vein, the 61-year-old founder and former chairman of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain doesn't believe in work-life balance, he said in a TikTok video posted by The School of Hardknocks on Oct. 9. \"Work-life balance [for entrepreneurs] is the biggest line of bulls--- that's ever been created,\" he said. \"There's no such thing as work-life balance. When you're going to squeeze lemonade out of horses---, you've got to squeeze really, really hard ... To create something from nothing, there is no such thing.\"Liautaud speaks from experience: Despite graduating second-to-last in his high school class, he created a billion-dollar brand, he said. He launched his first sandwich shop in Charleston, Illinois in 1983, as a 19-year-old with a $25,000 loan from his father — and spent the next 36 years carefully and persistently growing his business, he told the \"American Optimist\" podcast during an October 2024 episode.In his first 10 years of business, for example, Liautaud only opened stores that he operated himself — 10 of them, all in Illinois, he said. From that foundation, he eventually franchised out additional locations across the country. Jimmy John's now has over 2,600 locations across 45 states.In September 2016, Liautaud sold his majority stake in the company, 65% of the business, to Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group at a valuation of \"about $3.5 billion,\" he said in the TikTok video. He stepped down as chairman in October 2019, after Roark-owned Inspire Brands acquired the rest of Jimmy John's for an undisclosed sum.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterAs with any business, the sandwich chain's growth path was hardly linear or straightforward, Liautaud noted. In 2002, for example, 70 of the then-200 Jimmy John's locations were struggling to become profitable, he said.His response: Teach the franchise owners a lesson in work ethic, he said. \"I said, 'If you're going to go into the sandwich business, this is 24/7 365. If you're in the cattle business, cattle need to get fed on Sunday. They need to get fed on Christmas day,'\" said Liautaud.\"I started telling people the truth about the business,\" he continued. \"If you're going to do this, you better be ready to be a grinder.\"Liautaud currently has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.Other highly successful entrepreneurs built their businesses using a similar mindset. Bill Gates didn't believe in vacations or weekends during Microsoft's early days, and Elon Musk has been known to occasionally sleep at the office and work throughout the night. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang works \"from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep,\" he said during a May 2024 interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collision.Now, some of them opt for more sleep and better time-management. Gates regrets his previous workaholic lifestyle, he told students at Northern Arizona University's commencement ceremony in May 2023.\"Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson,\" Gates said. \"Take time to nurture your relationships. To celebrate your successes. And to recover from your losses. Take a break when you need to. Take it easy on the people around you when they need it, too.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

Encouraging kids to develop a sense of agency can similarly help them become self-motivated and successful adults, neuropsychologist William Stixrud said in a March 28 episode of the \"Raising Good Humans\" podcast. ″[Your] mission is not to make sure that they turn out a certain way or that they always do well, [but] to help them figure out who they want to be, what kind of life they want and how to create the life that they want,\" said Stixrud. \"So that they can ultimately run their own life before they leave home.\"When you do go to your kids' sports games, don't give them pointers on how to run faster or kick harder, Wambach recommended on her podcast. Instead, \"deemphasize the outcomes of winning or losing and overemphasize the acts of leadership\" by pointing out when they or other players are good teammates.Ask your child, \"What did you see out there today that was a special win that had nothing to do with the score line?\" Wambach said. \"Did you see your teammate cheering? Did you pick up the cones for your coach without being asked?\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "watch nowPrices that people pay for a variety of goods and services rose less than expected in September, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report Friday that keeps the door wide open for another interest rate cut next week.The consumer price index showed a 0.3% increase on the month, putting the annual inflation rate at 3%. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for readings of 0.4% and 3.1%, respectively. The annual rate reflected a 0.1 percentage point uptick from August.Excluding food and energy, core CPI showed a 0.2% monthly gain and an annual rate also at 3%, compared with estimates of 0.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Core CPI on a monthly basis had posted 0.3% gains in both July and August.The CPI reading is the only official economic data allowed to be released during the government shutdown.\"Like an oasis slaking the thirst of a weary desert traveler, today's CPI number offered investors the first tidbit of information from the barren wasteland of government data that has existed since the shutdown started Oct 1,\" wrote John Kerschner, global head of securitized products at Janus Henderson. \"Investors were not disappointed. Inflation came in softer than expected, leading to a tepid bond market rally, and ensuring that the Fed will cut rates at next week's Open Market Committee meeting.\"A 4.1% jump in gasoline prices was the largest contributor to a report that otherwise showed inflation pressures fairly muted. Food prices saw a 0.2% increase. Commodity prices overall rose 0.5%. On an annual basis, energy was up 2.8% and food rose 3.1%.Within the food index, prices for meat, poultry, fish and eggs surged 5.2% in the past year, while nonalcoholic beverages increased 5.3%. In energy, while prices pushed higher for electricity, up 5.1%, and natural gas, up 11.7%, over the past year, gasoline prices actually fell 0.5% during the period.Shelter costs, which comprise about one-third of the weighting in the CPI, rose just 0.2% and were up 3.6% from a year ago. Services excluding shelter costs also were 0.2% higher.New vehicles saw a 0.8% increase, but used car and truck prices fell 0.4%.Stock market futures added to gains following the release, while Treasury yields were slightly negative.\"Inflation might not be slowing but it's not surprising to the upside anymore,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation.The report provides a glimpse into the state of the U.S. economy at a time when all other data releases have been suspended. There were only limited impacts from President Donald Trump's tariffs, though they likely have not made their way fully through the economy yet.watch nowCore goods prices saw just a 0.2% gain on the month. Data within the CPI report, combined with the Customs revenue generated by tariffs, indicate a \"realized\" tariff rate of just 10%, according to James Knightley, chief international economist at ING.There are signs of \"a strong substitution effect already coming through – US companies switching to lower tariff countries for their product sourcing with the composition of imports shifting,\" Knightly wrote.\"The result is companies are better able to absorb these more modest than feared cost increases and there has been less impact on inflation than predicted so far,\" he said. \"In time we expect the realized tariff rate to rise and goods prices to be more heavily impacted, but we continue to argue that tariffs will be a one-off step change in prices rather than something that will lead to more persistent inflation.\"Final report before the FedThe BLS released the data specifically because the Social Security Administration uses it as a benchmark for cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, in benefit checks. Otherwise, the federal government has suspended all data compilation and releases until the fiscal impasse in Washington is settled. The CPI report was originally scheduled for release Oct. 15.In addition to providing a COLA guide, the CPI release is the final significant data point the Federal Reserve will get before it makes its interest rate decision next week. The Fed has a 2% inflation goal. The headline measure was last below that level in February 2021.A shopper looks at a sales advertisement at a grocery store in West Milton, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"This report will clearly keep the Fed on track to cut rates,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. \"The Fed has been clear that they are more focused on the softening labor data and will continue to defend their full employment mandate, even with core CPI well above their 2% target.\"Markets are pricing in a near-certainty that the central bank lowers its benchmark overnight borrowing rate by a quarter percentage point from its current target range of 4%-4.25%. Traders also are anticipating another cut in December.However, the path after that is much less clear.Worries persist that Trump's tariffs could cause another round of painful inflation. At the same time, Fed policymakers worry that a slump in hiring this year could spread, though layoffs remain low.Tariff-sensitive apparel prices saw a 0.7% increase in September, while durable goods moved 0.3% higher.Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues have expressed generally cautious tones about the pace of rate cuts as they weigh the threat of inflation against weakness in the labor market. For his part, Trump has insisted that inflation is no longer a problem and the Fed should be cutting aggressively.",

    "body": "A shopper at a grocery store in Dayton, Ohio, Oct. 21, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday released its much-anticipated consumer price index report, delayed a week and a half because of the government shutdown.Here are the five most important takeaways:While inflation is still running well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% goal, it's showing no signs of runaway and in fact is easing, at least a bit, in some key areas. The headline gain of 0.3% monthly and 3% annually both were slightly below consensus forecasts. Same for core CPI excluding food and energy, which ran at 0.2% monthly and 3% annually.Markets continued to price in a near certainty for a Fed rate cut next week, and upped the odds for another in December, with just a 4% probability the central bank won't ease two more times before the end of the year, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Aside from the headline numbers, the biggest watch point for markets was tariff and immigration impacts, which showed up — a little. Apparel prices rose 0.7% and sporting goods costs jumped 1%. But smartphone prices declined 2.2% and are down 14.9% year over year. Gardening and lawn care services, an immigration-related category, posted a 13.9% annual increase.Shelter costs are another key category, as they make up one-third of the weighting in the index. There was some relief on that front, with the index up just 0.2% monthly and holding at 3.6% annually. Owners equivalent rent, a critical component of shelter costs that asks homeowners what they could fetch in rent, rose just 0.1%, the smallest such move for the measure since November 2020.With government data collection and reports under suspension because of the shutdown, the BLS compiled this report only because of its role as a benchmark for Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. This, then, likely will be the last official data report released until the impasse is resolved.What they're saying:\"In aggregate today's inflation readings are encouraging, albeit still above the Federal Reserve's stated 2% inflation target. Yet, we think the overall inflation trend can continue to moderate over the next year ... as inflation breakevens have recently suggested, allowing the Fed to maintain its bias toward rate cuts.\"— Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a finalist to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair next year\"Look beneath the headline and what one sees on a year ago basis are large increases in the cost of food, meat, housing, and utilities. Middle class & down-market households experiencing a slowing pace of wage growth are clearly having difficulty adjusting to persisting increases in the cost of living ... It's only natural that those that inhibit the lower spur of the K ask: what is it that those celebrating a more modest increase in the pace of price increases see that indicates inflation is not eroding my bottom line & standard of living?\"— Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSK, on the K-shaped economy\"Signs of spillovers from tariffs remain weak and support the view that tariff hikes will translate into a one-off bump in prices instead of persistent inflationary pressures.\" — Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISM",

    "body": "watch nowThere's just two months until Christmas Eve, and retailers are meeting a more cautious shopper with earlier offerings.Most retailers won't report third-quarter results or updated holiday expectations until just before Thanksgiving, largely considered the sector's most important week of the year. By then, many shoppers will have already started checking off holiday shopping lists.Amazon's October Prime Day sales event and competitors' ever-earlier Black Friday deals grab some portion of the holiday wallet share. The unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season comes as executives point to a bifurcation in consumer spending, with lower-income consumers feeling the strain on their budgets, and as a government shutdown and tariff costs threaten purchasing power.Kohl's is among the retailers chasing holiday shopping early with hopes of boosting the total haul.\"We want to make sure we're driving that early consideration knowing that they're shopping early,\" Kohl's Chief Marketing Officer Christie Raymond said at a media event earlier this month.The off-mall department store is starting its holiday marketing campaign next week, a week earlier than last year, when it waited until after the election. In the coming days it will be breaking out the rest of the holiday merchandise not already set out in stores.A key part of Kohl's holiday strategy is to capture shoppers not only early, but often.Raymond said during the last holiday season, between November and January, shoppers made \"15 plus trips\" on average to stores across the industry, but checked out with smaller baskets. Those findings were based on a survey that Kohl's conducted with a third-party research firm.\"[Consumers are] doing the work to get what they want at the price they want to pay,\" she said.While Academy Sports and Outdoors CEO Steve Lawrence agreed that shoppers are savvy when it comes to price monitoring, he said he expects customers \"to aggregate their spending around those key shopping moments on the calendar where they know they can get the best deals.\"Both Kohl's and Academy Sports cater largely to a middle-income shopper. Still, Lawrence said consumers are paying close attention to discount events.\"If we run the same promotion this year that we ran last year, there's higher take rate on it,\" he said. \"I think that's a sign customers are really savvy, and they're figuring out when it's the right time to shop.\"Shifting shopping habitsLawrence said that while promotions are part of every holiday season's playbook, Academy Sports will be tweaking how it runs discounts this year in light of higher engagement with the deals.\"If last year we ran a promotion for 10 days, maybe I only run it for 4 days over the Thanksgiving weekend,\" he said. \"Maybe instead of having a whole brand promoted, maybe it's only the key categories within that brand, right? Or maybe in some cases, it might be promoting at a slightly lower discount.\"Raymond said Kohl's is seeing shoppers reaching for lower-price options and expects that to continue during the holiday season.\"Customers maybe were purchasing a premium brand, but we are seeing them trading down to private brands,\" she said. \"We think we're in actually a great position to capitalize on that.\"A private brand is one made for and sold by only one retailer, allowing for more control over design and, importantly, cost. That can mean lower prices for shoppers and higher margins for the retailer than a national brand.Shoppers carry Macy's and Nordstrom bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile Kohl's doesn't disclose the proportion of its sales that are private label, Chief Merchandising Officer Nick Jones said it's not as high as it used to be, adding there's opportunity to boost that share this holiday season, particularly for shoppers trying to stretch their wallets.About 23% of Academy Sports business is private label, the company has said.\"In a lot of cases, [our private label] is our best expression of value,\" Lawrence said. \"Our goal is to be at or better than the best price on a given day.\"However, Lawrence said, innovation has to continue to inspire sales.'Cautiously optimistic'The retail industry has repeatedly described its customer in recent quarters as \"choiceful,\" to indicate thoughtful spending, but also \"resilient.\" Executives continue to use those descriptors, or synonyms for them, for the upcoming holiday season.\"I think certainly with inflation in certain categories, it's put some pressure on spending power,\" Lawrence said. \"But you know, what we've also seen is customers are very resilient. They do come out during the key shopping time periods. They came out for Mother's Day, Father's Day, back-to-school. We expect they're going to come out again for holiday.\"Dick's Sporting Goods Executive Chairman Ed Stack told CNBC this week he thought the consumer was \"a little bit stressed\" this season, but that he's \"cautiously optimistic.\"\"If you're going to provide value to the consumer, and they can see that, feel that value — and I'm not talking about from a price standpoint, could be innovation ... then they are going to come and they are going to buy,\" Stack said.Executives for all three retailers agree inventory positions for holiday will be normal, despite tariff uncertainty that many feared would affect order volumes. None of the three were expecting merchandise shortages.\"I don't think [inventory availability] is going to be any different than it has been in the past,\" Stack said. \"That really super hot item that everybody wants? That's probably going to be in short supply, like it is every year.\"",

Gabriela Bhaskar | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Advanced Micro Devices jumped nearly 8% on Friday following a report that IBM can utilize the company's chips to run a quantum computing error correction algorithm.IBM shares gained about 8% and headed for their best day since January.Reuters reported on Friday that a paper will publish next week showing that IBM can run a quantum error correction algorithm on AMD's field-programmable gate array chips. An IBM spokesman confirmed the report to CNBC.In August, the two companies announced an agreement to develop quantum computing capabilities and integrate technologies. IBM said it plans to debut a \"large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer\" by 2029.IBM called the new development a \"milestone in our clear path\" toward the 2029 projection.\"Designing and implementing a way to do this at scale, and without requiring expensive GPU clusters, is a significant achievement to scaling useful quantum computers,\" the company said in a statement.AMD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The technology utilizes quantum mechanics to address problems that traditional computers are unable to solve. Technology giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also racing to develop quantum computing.Last year, Microsoft rolled out its first quantum computing chip, while Google launched its breakthrough chip named WIllow. A top quantum executive at Google told CNBC in March that the technology was \"five years out from a real breakout.\"The various announcements have brought renewed interest to the quantum space, boosting stocks like D-Wave Quantum, Rigetti Computing and IonQ, which all climbed on Friday.The Trump administration on Thursday refuted a report that it was negotiating stakes in quantum companies.Correction: This story has been updated after Reuters corrected its report about what IBM will be able to do with AMD's chips.WATCH: Commerce Department denies it is currently in talks for stakes in quantum companieswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowProcter & Gamble on Friday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations, lifted by higher demand for its beauty and grooming products.Despite higher costs from tariffs and what CEO Jon Moeller called a \"challenging consumer and geopolitical environment,\" P&G reiterated its forecast for all-in sales and earnings for the fiscal year, which began in July.Here's what the company reported for the quarter that ended on Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.99 adjusted vs. $1.90 expectedRevenue: $22.39 billion vs. $22.18 billion expectedP&G reported fiscal first-quarter net income attributable to the company of $4.75 billion, or $1.95 per share, up from $3.96 billion, or $1.61 per share, a year earlier.Excluding certain items, including costs associated with incremental restructuring, the consumer giant earned $1.99 per share.Net sales rose 3% to $22.39 billion. Organic sales — which strips out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency — increased 2% in the quarter.Though revenue metrics were higher, P&G's volume was flat compared with the year-ago period. Volume excludes pricing, which makes it a more accurate reflection of demand than sales. Like many consumer companies, P&G has seen demand for some of its products fall as inflation-weary consumers seek out deals.'K-shaped' shopping\"The consumer environment is not great, but stable,\" CFO Andre Schulten said on a call with media, adding that shoppers have behaved similarly in the last few quarters.In the United States, the company's largest market, consumption across P&G's broad swath of products has slowed \"a little bit,\" according to Schulten. Like Coca-Cola, P&G is seeing a bifurcation in how consumers are shopping based on their incomes, often described as a \"K-shaped\" economy.Shoppers who are less cash constrained are buying bigger pack sizes from club and online retailers, Schulten said.\"That's their way to look for value,\" he said.But U.S. consumers living paycheck to paycheck are looking to stretch their money further by using every bottle of detergent or shampoo to the last drop and exhausting their pantry inventory before shopping for more, according to Schulten.At the same time, private label brands are losing market share, bucking previous shopping trends during economic downturns, executives said on the company's conference call. After the recession in 2008, P&G shifted its strategy to create more premium products that couldn't be easily substituted with cheaper private label versions.Boxes of Tide Pods dishwasher detergent are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on July 12, 2025 in San Diego, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesP&G reported Friday that volume for both its health care and fabric and home care divisions, which include Tide and Swiffer, fell 2% during the quarter.The company is seeing \"heightened competition\" in those categories, fueled by promotions and discounting from rivals, executives said on the conference call. To win back customers, P&G is focusing on innovation that can justify higher prices and convince shoppers that its products are superior. For example, Schulten said that Tide is starting shipments of its \"biggest upgrade to liquid detergent in 20 years.\"The company's baby, feminine and family care segment reported flat volume for the quarter. That division includes brands like Pampers and Tampax.P&G's beauty business was a bright spot. The division, which includes Olay and SK-II, reported volume growth of 4% and overall sales growth of 6%. Olay's Super Serum line was the brand's top performer, showing that customers were willing to pay more for premium skincare.And P&G's grooming business, which includes Gillette and Venus razors, saw volume rise 1% in the quarter for a sales increase of 5%.For fiscal 2026, the company is now projecting that President Donald Trump's tariffs will result in $400 million in after-tax costs, down from its prior outlook of $800 million. When P&G originally formulated its forecast, it included retaliatory tariffs on Canada, which have since been rescinded. As a result, the company is now planning a smaller raise in prices than it expected, Moeller said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Friday morning.However, Trump said on Thursday evening that he is terminating all trade talks with Canada over a TV ad, which could mean higher costs ahead for P&G.P&G also reiterated its fiscal 2026 forecast of sales growth between 1% and 5% and earnings per share in the range of $6.83 to $7.09.",

    "body": "Company: Fluor Corp (FLR)Business: Fluor is a holding company that provides engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, and project management services.

The segment also provides services to commercial nuclear clients.Stock Market Value: $7.89 billion ($48.79 per share)Activist: Starboard ValueOwnership: Starboard ValueAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has initiated activist campaigns at 18 prior industrial companies and their average return on these situations is 50.55% versus an average of 11.73% for the Russell 2000 during the same time periods. Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power, which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.Behind the scenesFluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile. Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028. With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion. As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company. Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval. As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value. If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times. Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation. Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential. Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside. Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000. But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney waves next to U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 7, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday said he was slapping an extra 10% tariff on imports from Canada in retaliation for what he says is a misleading TV ad featuring former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs.\"Canada was caught, red handed, putting up a fraudulent advertisement in Ronald Reagan's Speech on Tariffs,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.\"Because of their serious misrepresentation of the facts, and hostile act, I am increasing the Tariff on Canada by 10% over and above what they are paying now,\" he wrote.Canada generally pays a 35% tariff on goods sold in the U.S., with exceptions for certain products covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and other specific product exceptions, such as steel and aluminum, which are tariffed at 50%.Trump late Friday blasted the Ontario provincial government in Canada for waiting until after the first two games of the World Series to pause the Reagan ad.\"They could have pulled it tonight,\" Trump told reporters at the White House as he headed to fly to Asia.\"Well, that's dirty play,\" he said. \"But I can play dirtier than they can, you know.\"Trump had cited the ad in his decision on Thursday night to trade negotiations with Canada.Ontario Premier Doug Ford on Friday afternoon said he would pause the ad on Monday so that trade talks could resume.But Ford also said, \"I've directed my team to keep putting our message in front of Americans over the weekend so that we can air our commercial during the first two World Series games.\"Trump said Friday night that he had heard that Ontario was pulling the ad.But he also said he did not know the government was leaving it on until Monday.The ad was shown Friday night during a broadcast to millions of Americans of the first game of the World Series.That game was won 11-4 by Canada's Toronto Blue Jays over the U.S.'s Los Angeles Dodgers.Toronto is in Ontario, and is the hometown of Ford.Ford, in a tweet earlier Friday announcing the ad pause, said, \"Our intention was always to initiate a conversation about the kind of economy that Americans want to build and the impact of tariffs on workers and businesses.\"We've achieved our goal, having reached U.S. audiences at the highest levels,\" Ford said, apparently referring to Trump.\"In speaking with Prime Minister [Mark] Carney, Ontario will pause its U.S. advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump pardons convicted Binance founder Changpeng ZhaoChauncey Billups, others arrested in FBI probe linking NBA to Mafia gambling ringTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

But the ad accurately captures Reagan saying, \"Over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\"The ad also has Reagan, from the same speech, saying, \"When someone says, 'Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works — but only for a short time.\"\"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,\" Reagan said in the speech and in the ad.Ford, who calls himself a \"big Ronald Reagan fan,\" first posted the ad on X on Oct. 16, days after saying that Ontario's government would spend $75 million to run the ad in the United States.\"We're going to repeat that message to every Republican district there is, right across the entire country,\" said Ford.Trump raged about the ad in a Truth Social post on Friday morning.\"CANADA CHEATED AND GOT CAUGHT!!! They fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY,\" Trump wrote.\"Canada is trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country. Canada has long cheated on Tariffs, charging our farmers as much as 400%. Now they, and other countries, can't take advantage of the U.S. any longer. Thank you to the Ronald Reagan Foundation for exposing this FRAUD.\"The Supreme Court in early November is set to hear oral arguments in a case that will determine if Trump had power under the law to impose sweeping tariffs against scores of countries, including Canada, without the consent of Congress.",

    "body": "Hoka shoes are seen in a store in Krakow, Poland on February 1, 2023. Jakub Porzycki | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of footwear maker Deckers Brands plunged 15% Friday after the company trimmed its sales guidance for Hoka and Ugg — the two brands driving its growth — over concerns that tariffs are leading to a slide in demand.Hoka, an up-and-coming running shoe brand, is now expected to grow by a low-teens percentage in fiscal 2026 after growing 24% in the year-ago period, while Boots brand Ugg is expected to grow in the range of a low to mid single-digit percentage, after growing 13% in the year-ago period.In May, the company said Hoka and Ugg were expected to grow in the mid-teens and mid-single digits, respectively, in fiscal 2026 but it caveated that forecast by saying it was conceived prior to the introduction of President Donald Trump's tariffs. At the time, it quantified the expected impact to its costs but said it remained to be determined what kind of impact the new duties could have on demand.When reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, finance chief Steven Fasching said the impacts tariffs and higher prices are having on demand are now more clear.\"Part of the framework that we gave at the beginning of the year really said if tariffs did not have an impact on consumers, how we saw kind of certain growth, and we still believe that, right? But we do know and we are more currently seeing some impacts on the U.S. consumer,\" Fasching told analysts on the company's conference call. \"So as U.S. consumers are beginning to see some price increases. It is impacting their purchase behavior within the consumer discretionary space.\"He added the guidance isn't far off from what the company originally thought but acknowledged there is a \"little bit of a reduction\" in its forecast.The slower pace of growth for Deckers' two top-performing lines, along with the trim to their sales guidance, signals the two brands could be losing momentum after years of outperformance. Together, Hoka and Ugg account for the vast majority of Deckers' revenue and have been critical in offsetting weaknesses in other categories.CEO Dave Powers, however, downplayed fears of a long-term slowdown, telling investors that both brands remain strong among core consumers.\"We're confident in the long-term trajectory of our portfolio,\" Powers said. \"While tariffs and inflation are creating near-term pressure, Hoka and Ugg continue to lead in brand heat and market share gains across their categories.\"Beyond Hoka and Ugg, Deckers' full-year revenue guidance came in lower than analysts' expectations. In fiscal 2026, the company expects revenue of about $5.35 billion, shy of Wall Street's $5.45 billion forecast, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $6.30 and $6.39, roughly in line with the $6.32 per share estimate, according to LSEG.In the company's call with analysts, Fasching warned that tariff costs could total about $150 million this fiscal year. Executives said they expect to offset roughly half of those costs through price adjustments and cost-sharing with factory partners.Deckers' shares have dropped more than 55% year to date, leaving investors on edge about any signs of decelerating demand.",

Salwan Georges | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBig Tech and other publicly traded companies are helping to finance the $300 million White House ballroom planned by President Donald Trump.The White House East Wing has been demolished to make room for the 90,000 square foot ballroom, sparking public anger after Trump promised in July that the building would not be impacted.Trump has said the construction of the ballroom will be financed by his own funds and corporate and individual donors at no cost to the taxpayer. The president said Wednesday the project will cost $300 million, up from an initial estimate of $200 million.Trump has not said how much he is spending.

Its contribution is the result of a settlement reached with Trump last month over a lawsuit he filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after a riot by his supporters against Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.The settlement notes that $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Donors also include Palantir, Micron, Coinbase, Lockheed Martin, Continental Resources founder Harold Hamm, and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the White House list.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.Comcast, CNBC's current parent company, is also on the donor list.

    "body": "The headquaters of US auto company General Motos (GM) in Detroit, Michigan.Uli Deck | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesDETROIT – General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits.The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM.\"We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,\" GM said in an emailed statement. \"As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.\"GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The person spoke anonymously because the number had not yet been made public.The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to \"business conditions\" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said.The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations.The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's U.S. salaried headcount fell from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 to end last year.GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand.The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are \"UP BIG on Tariffs\" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as \"Big and Midsized Trucks.\"While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs.The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday.",

    "body": "A pedestrian walks past the Bank of Japan (BoJ) building in central Tokyo on July 28, 2023.Richard A. Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank is caught in a bind as soaring government bond yields risk upending its policy normalization process.The Bank of Japan faces a stark choice: sticking with its policy of raising rates and risking even higher yields and further slowing an already sagging economy, or holding, even cutting rates to support growth that could accelerate inflation further.Japanese government bonds have been scaling new peaks over the past month. On Thursday, yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs hit a high of 1.917%, surging to their strongest level since 2007. The 20-year JGB yield reached 2.936%, a level not seen since 1999, while 30-year hit a record high of 3.436%, LSEG data going back to 1999 showed. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan abandoned its yield curve control program in March 2024, under which benchmark 10-year bond yields were capped at around 1%, as part of its policy normalization that also saw the country end the world's last negative interest rate regime.   Now, as the country weighs increasing rates at a time when inflation has been rising — it has stayed above the BOJ's 2% target for 43 straight months — the specter of bond yields spiking further looms large.    Anindya Banerjee, head of currency and commodities at Kotak Securities, told CNBC's \"Inside India\" that if the BOJ reverts back to quantitative easing and YCC to cap bond yields, the yen may also weaken and feed imported inflation, which is already a problem.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRising bond yields mean higher borrowing costs for Japan, further straining the country's fiscal situation. Asia's second-largest economy already boasts of the world highest debt-to-GDP ratio, standing at almost 230%, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Add to that a government that is poised to unleash its largest stimulus package since the pandemic to curb cost of living and prop up the struggling Japanese economy, and the concerns around Japan's ballooning debt become even more stark.Magdalene Teo, head of fixed income research for Asia at Julius Baer, said that the new debt issuance of 11.7 trillion yen to finance Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's supplementary budget is 1.7 times larger than that issued under her predecessor Shigeru Ishiba in 2024. \"This highlights the difficulty the government faces in balancing economic stimulus initiatives with maintaining fiscal sustainability,\" Teo said.Global implications?In August 2024, an unwinding of yen-funded leveraged carry trades due to a hawkish BOJ rate hike and disappointing macro data from the U.S. saw stocks globally sell-off, with Japan's Nikkei crashing 12.4% to record its worst day since 1987. Carry trade refers to borrowing in a currency with lower interest rates and investing in high-yielding assets, with the Japanese yen being the predominant currency funding such trades as the country's had a negative interest rates policy.   Now, rising Japanese yields have narrowed that rate differential, fueling concerns about another round of carry trade unwind and repatriation of funds into Japan. However, experts say that a repeat of the 2024 meltdown is unlikely.\"From a global perspective, the narrowing Japan–U.S. yield gap reduces the appeal of yen-funded carry trades, but we do not expect a repeat of the 2024 systemic unwind ... Instead, anticipate episodic volatility and selective deleveraging, particularly if yen strength accelerates funding costs,\" said Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management. Loo attributes said structural flows driven by retail allocations from pensions funds, life insurance, and NISA [Nippon Individual Savings Account] anchor foreign holdings, making large-scale repatriation unlikely.Justin Heng, APAC rates strategist at HSBC, concurred, saying that Japanese investors have shown little sign of repatriating funds, and have remained net buyers of foreign bonds. From January to October 2025, they purchased 11.7 trillion yen in overseas debt, far outpacing the 4.2 trillion yen bought in all of 2024, according to HSBC. That surge has been driven mainly by trust banks and asset managers benefiting from retail inflows under the Japanese government's tax-exempt investment program. \"We expect the continued decline in hedging cost, as a result of further Fed rate cuts, will also likely encourage Japanese investors to take more foreign bond exposure,\" Heng said.",

    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market slowdown intensified in November as private companies cut 32,000 workers, with small businesses hit the hardest, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.With worries intensifying over the domestic jobs picture, ADP indicated the issues were worse than anticipated. The payrolls decline marked a sharp step down from October, which saw an upwardly revised gain of 47,000 positions, and was well below the Dow Jones consensus estimate from economists for an increase of 40,000.Larger businesses, entailing companies with 50 or more employees, actually reported a net gain of 90,000 workers.However, establishments with fewer than 50 workers saw a decline of 120,000, including a drop of 74,000 among firms with 20 to 49 employees. The total loss was the biggest drop since March 2023.Education and health services led gainers with 33,000 hires, while leisure and hospitality added 13,000. But a broad-based decline across industries drove the total lower.The biggest loss came in professional and business services, which saw a decline of 26,000. Others shedding jobs included information services (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial activities and construction, both of which saw losses of 9,000.The rate of pay also slowed, with workers staying in their jobs seeing a 4.4% year-over-year increase, down 0.1 percentage point from October.\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"And while November's  slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses.\"The ADP report is the last jobs picture the Federal Reserve gets before it meets Dec. 9-10. Futures traders are assigning a nearly 90% probability that the central bank will approve another quarter percentage point cut in its key interest rate, despite misgivings from some officials over whether further easing is needed. The probability was about the same following the ADP release.In recent weeks, Fed policymakers have expressed a divergence of opinions. One side sees cuts as necessary to head off further labor market troubles, while the other worries that additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which has held considerably above the Fed's 2% target.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its take on the nonfarm payrolls picture on Dec. 16, a date delayed because of the government shutdown.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff delivers the keynote address at the start of the Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Oct. 14, 2025.Jessica Christian | San Francisco Chronicle | Getty ImagesSalesforce reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday and topped Wall Street estimates with its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. The stock rose 2% in extended trading. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.25 adjusted vs. $2.86 expectedRevenue: $10.26 billion vs. $10.27 billion expectedRevenue increased 8.6% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income increased to $2.09 billion, or $2.19 per share, from $1.53 billion, or $1.58 per share, in the same quarter last year, boosted by a $263 million gain from strategic investments. Adjusted earnings per share exclude stock-based compensation.The Tableau data analytics business had a higher mix of cloud services than the company had predicted during the quarter, Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Revenue from on-premises Tableau and MuleSoft app integration products are recognized during the quarter, rather than over time. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce called for $3.02 to $3.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.13 billion to $11.23 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected $3.04 per share and $10.9 billion in revenue. The guidance implies revenue growth of between 11% and 12%, with about 3 points coming from Informatica, the data management company Salesforce acquired for around $8 billion in November. At the same time, the guidance factors in the continued shift to the cloud for MuleSoft and Tableau, as well as ongoing weakness from marketing and commerce products, Washington said.Salesforce's stock has badly underperformed the broader tech sector this year, in part due to concerns about the potential of artificial intelligence replacing some of its product capabilities. As of Wednesday's close, the shares are down 29% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has gained about 21%.During the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce acquired startups Regrello, whose AI software performs tasks, and Waii, which uses AI to compose code for running queries on data based on a few words of human input. The company also introduced Agentforce AI software for managing IT service requests, and issued a $60 billion fiscal 2030 revenue target, surpassing analysts' projections.Annualized revenue from Agentforce, which automates sales and customer service workflows, jumped 330% from a year earlier to over $500 million. Salesforce said it has won over 9,500 paid deals to date, up from over 6,000 as of September.Free cash flow grew 22% to $2.18 billion, but the total was below StreetAccount's $2.24 billion consensus.This is developing news.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed big cuts to strict fuel economy standards for passenger cars enacted under the Biden administration. \"We are officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, CAFE standards that imposed expensive restrictions,\" Trump said at the Oval Office, flanked by the CEOs of Ford Motor and Stellantis.The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards date back to 1975 and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more efficient.Former President Joe Biden had required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031. These stricter standards were expected to stimulate the production and sale of electric vehicles in the U.S. The standards proposed by the Trump administration would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trump has sought to dismantle pollution regulations and federal support for electric vehicles as well as renewable energy since taking office.  The oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute has lobbied the Trump administration to repeal the Biden fuel economy standards, contending that they aim to phase out liquid fuel vehicles.The announcement was attended by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, as well as a plant manager for General Motors from Michigan.Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa listen as U.S. President Donald Trump announces new fuel economy standards, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 3, 2025. Brian Snyder | ReutersMany of the officials in attendance, including U.S. dealers, said the new standards are more in line with the vehicles customers want to buy rather than the more costly ones automakers have been pushed to produce due to regulations.Trump and other officials also touted the new regulations as assisting in vehicle affordability, which has been an ongoing concern for the automotive industry, as the average new vehicle purchased hovers around $50,000.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents the majority of automakers operating in the U.S., also praised the cuts.\"We're reviewing NHTSA's announcement, but we're glad the agency has proposed new fuel economy standards,\" John Bozzella, CEO of the organization, said in a statement. \"We've been clear and consistent: The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for EVs.\"U.S. EV leader Tesla did not respond for comment regarding the reduced standards.— CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowNEW YORK — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court.Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties.\"We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122,\" he said during an onstage interview at The New York Times DealBook Summit.Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin — the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" — whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, \"permanently.\"Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on a time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court.President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U.S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures.Bessent cited some of the successes the administration has enjoyed thus far, naming China specifically despite ongoing tensions between the two nations.\"Because of the fentanyl tariffs, the Chinese are making the first the step forward that they've made\" on trade, he said. Bessent added that China has made \"a robust effort\" at halting the drug's import into the U.S.He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case.On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the front-runner.\"The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks,\" he said. \"The chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion, but at the end of the day ... he or she is one vote.\"Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year.",

Airbus later said it had identified a quality issue regarding a \"limited number\" of metal panels, and that the source of the issue has been \"identified and contained.\" It came after the company ordered an immediate software fix for around 6,000 A320-series aircrafts on Friday, forcing a large chunk of it's narrow-body fleet to be grounded, stranding travellers worldwide.The Paris-traded stock dropped on the news of the panel issue. It fell nearly 7% Monday and Tuesday as investors appeared spooked by the prospect of more widespread quality issues, like the ones that embroiled its rival Boeing.The company attributed the revised delivery guidance to \"recent supplier quality issue on fuselage panels impacting its A320 Family delivery flow.\" The company is now targeting 790 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2025, 30 fewer than its previous guidance.It maintained its financial guidance given in late October, still seeing adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of 7 billion euros and free cash flow before customer financing of around 4.5 billion euros.Shares were up 4.3% as of 3:45 p.m. Paris time (9:45 a.m. ET) following the renewed guidance, issued early Wednesday morning. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAirbus share price this year\"The 30 aircraft removed from the delivery guide this year are not all expected to require a parts change, but for now only require a non-destructive test to be performed,\" noted Jefferies analysts. \"As a reminder, this part is dual-sourced with only one of the supplier facing a quality escape, which has already been resolved at the production level.\"The issue with Airbus' fuselage panels was related to parts supplied by Spanish company Sofitec Aero, a person familiar with the matter, who preferred to remain anonymous, told CNBC.CNBC reached out to Sofitec Aero for comment.Sector-wide problemsThe software update Airbus issued followed a Oct. 30 incident where an Airbus A320, operated by JetBlue, experienced a sudden drop in altitude after a flight control issue, resulting in injuries. The plane, which was en route from Cancun, Mexico to New Jersey, made an emergency landing in Tampa, Florida. Airbus' woes come as rival Boeing has been battling stubborn quality issues and increased scrutiny after a door plug blew out mid-flight on a Alaska Airlines 737 MAX in January last year. There have been signs of recovery for the firm as CFO Jay Malave said Tuesday that Boeing expects deliveries of both its 737 and 787 jets to be up next year.CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought in last year to turn the company around, said the company was starting to see improvements in its business, including slashing its quarterly losses.— Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report",

They also received records from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank related to Epstein, the wealthy and well-connected financier who killed himself in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.Photo released by the House Oversight Committee Democrats shows a room inside Jeffrey Epstein's private island home on Little St. James.Source: House Oversight DemocratsThe Democrats said they plan to publicly release the banks' materials \"in the days ahead\" after a review.A spokesperson for Oversight's Republican majority said in a statement that the committee \"has received approximately 5,000 documents in response to [GOP Chairman James Comer of Kentucky's] subpoenas\" to the two banks, along with his request to the Virgin Islands.\"The Majority is reviewing these materials and will make them public soon, just as the Committee has already done with the more than 65,000 pages produced during this investigation,\" the spokesperson said.Photo released by the House Oversight Committee Democrats shows a room inside Jeffrey Epstein's private island home on Little St. James.Source: House Oversight DemocratsThe developments come two weeks after President Donald Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, signed a bipartisan bill ordering the Department of Justice to release files from its investigations into the registered sex offender.Trump's signature started a 30-day timer for Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified files relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.On Wednesday, a bipartisan group of five lawmakers asked Bondi for a briefing and status update on DOJ's efforts to gather those files in advance of the upcoming deadline, NBC News reported.Oversight ranking Rep.

She was interviewed in July by top DOJ official Todd Blanche, during which time she said she did not know of any wrongdoing by Trump.About a week later, Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security women's prison in Texas.In a letter filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, Maxwell said through her attorney that she intends to file a petition seeking her release from prison, NBC and The New York Times reported.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "watch nowNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday and that the two men  discussed chip export restrictions, as lawmakers consider a proposal to limit exports of advanced artificial intelligence chips to nations like China. \"I've said it repeatedly that we support export controls, and that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers were considering including the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act in a major defense package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give U.S. companies first pick on their AI chips before selling them in countries like China. The proposal isn't expected to be part of the NDAA, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Huang said it was \"wise\" that the proposal is being left out of the annual defense policy bill. \"The GAIN AI Act is even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act,\" Huang said.  Nvidia's CEO also criticized the idea of establishing a patchwork of state laws regulating AI. The notion of state-by-state regulation has generated pushback from tech companies and spurred the creation of a super PAC called \"Leading the Future,\" which is backed by the AI industry. \"State-by-state AI regulation would drag this industry into a halt and it would create a national security concern, as we need to make sure that the United States advances AI technology as quickly as possible,\" Huang said. \"A federal AI regulation is the wisest.\"Trump last month urged legislators to include a provision in the NDAA that would preempt state AI laws in favor of \"one federal standard.\"But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told CNBC's Emily Wilkins on Tuesday the provision won't make it into the bill, citing a lack of sufficient support. He and other lawmakers will continue to look for ways to establish a national standard on AI, Scalise added. WATCH: Nvidia currying favor to be able to sell chips in Chinawatch now",

    "body": "File: Then Apple Creative Director Alan Dye celebrates the launch of the July Issue at the new WIRED office on June 24, 2015 in San Francisco, California.Kimberly White | Getty ImagesApple's head of user interface design, Alan Dye, will join Meta, in a notable shift of executive talent in Silicon Valley. The iPhone maker confirmed Dye's departure on Wednesday and Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement that the company prioritizes design and has a strong team. The statement said that veteran designer Stephen Lemay will succeed Dye.\"Steve Lemay has played a key role in the design of every major Apple interface since 1999,\" Cook said in a statement. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg in a Wednesday social media post said that Dye would lead up a new creative studio that brings together design, fashion and technology. \"We plan to elevate design within Meta,\" wrote Zuckerberg, who did not say what specific products Dye will work on. Compared to other Silicon Valley companies, Apple has always emphasized design to customers and investors as one of its strengths. Apple prominently features its design executives to discuss interface changes at the company's launch events.In June, Dye revealed a redesign of Apple's software interface for iPhones, Macs and the Apple Watch called Liquid Glass. The company described it as an \"elegant\" new design with translucent buttons, updated app icons and fluid animations.  Dye said it was the \"next chapter\" of the company's software and said it \"sets the stage\" for the next era of Apple products. \"Our new design blurs the lines between hardware and software to create an experience that's more delightful than ever while still familiar and easy to use,\" Dye said at the launch. Reviews were mixed on the Liquid Glass update, which shipped with new iPhones in September. Apple announces liquid glass during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 9, 2025 in Cupertino, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesFor years, Apple design was embodied by executive Jony Ive, who left Apple in 2019 and is now working with OpenAI on artificial intelligence hardware alongside Sam Altman. Dye took over user interface design and became one of the design studio's leads in 2015 when Ive stepped back from a day-to-day role. Dye started at Apple in 2006 and worked on software for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was also partly responsible for the first iPhone in 2017 that did away with the home screen button at the bottom of the device and replaced it with a software-based swipe-up motion. Meta has said in recent years that it wants to be a major developer of hardware and Zuckerberg has said Apple is one of his company's biggest competitors. The social media company currently makes several virtual reality headsets under its Quest brand, and recently scored its first hardware hit with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, which are stylish sunglasses equipped with cameras and the ability to run an AI model that can answer questions. Sales of the device tripled over the past year, Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica said in July. \"We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,\" Zuckerberg wrote.Bloomberg first reported the move.

    "body": "American flags flutter outside a Hyundai automobile dealership in Irvine, California, U.S., March 27, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — Hyundai Motor and General Motors are set to be two of the greatest beneficiaries of lower U.S. tariffs on imports, including vehicles, from South Korea.The South Korean-based automaker is the largest U.S. importer of new vehicles from the country, followed by GM. Both automakers have paid billions of dollars in levies so far this year after President Donald Trump placed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles from South Korea and other countries in the spring. The Trump administration this past week confirmed plans to lower tariffs on certain products, including vehicles, to 15% from South Korea. A notice about the implementation of the trade deal was posted Wednesday on the Federal Register. Other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom also have negotiated lower tariff rates with the Trump administration.Prior to the reduction, Hyundai reported U.S. tariffs costed the company 1.8 trillion won ($1.2 billion) in the third quarter, up from 828 billion won ($565 million) in the previous quarter. GM most recently said its tariff impacts, largely from South Korea and Mexico, were expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in 2025.GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Wednesday that the automaker initially expected tariffs on South Korean imports to cost $2 billion but that the company has been able to offset many of those costs. He said GM expects the levies to cost closer to $1 billion or less in 2026.\"We do think that is going to be a tailwind next year, just not as much as the whole 50% because the ultimate tariff bill that we're going to pay this year for Korea was going to be a lot lower than the $2 billion from the stuff that we've been working on,\" Jacobson said during a UBS conference.The U.S. tariff announcement comes after South Korea officially introduced legislation in its parliament aiming to fulfill its promise to invest $350 billion for the U.S. over several years.Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung delivers remarks, as U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry stand, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 24, 2025. Carlos Barria | Reuters\"Korea's commitment to American investment strengthens our economic partnership and domestic jobs and industry. We are also grateful for the deep trust between our two nations,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement posted Monday on X.Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker said the tariffs are still challenging but better than 25% as the automaker aims for a sixth-consecutive year of record U.S. retail sales in 2026. \"Fifteen percent is still 15%,\" he told CNBC during a phone interview Tuesday. \"Getting to 15% is a great milestone. It's been quite the journey reaching this agreement, which has been, I would say, quite extensive.\"Hyundai, including its Kia subsidiary that operates separately in the U.S., has significantly increased its sales and operations in the U.S. in recent years. But the automaker continues to import the majority of its vehicles — estimated to be nearly 1 million units this year — from South Korea.GlobalData estimates more than 1.37 million vehicles, or about 8.6% of the U.S. sales this year, will be vehicles that were imported from South Korea — making the country the largest exporter of American-sold vehicles aside from Mexico.Hyundai is expected to import more than 951,000 vehicles in 2025, according to GlobalData. That includes more than 369,000 for Kia and 582,000 for Hyundai and its luxury Genesis brand.Hyundai aims to have more than 80% of its U.S. vehicle sales be produced locally by 2030, the company said this year. That compares with roughly 40% currently. Despite the tariffs, GM is estimated to import nearly 422,000 vehicles from South Korea this year to the U.S., according to GlobalData. That would be a 3.6% increase compared with record imports of more than 407,000 units last year.GM has increasingly used South Korean plants to produce popular entry-level crossovers for Chevrolet and Buick. Its U.S. sales of South Korean-produced vehicles — largely entry-level models — have risen from 173,000 in 2019 to more than 407,000 last year, according to GlobalData.GM, in an emailed statement, said the company \"appreciates that negotiators have finalized an agreement on trade between the US and South Korea.\"\"GM's long-standing Korea operations produce high-quality, affordable crossovers that complement our U.S. vehicles and domestic production, which will soon rise to 2 million units. We will be monitoring and reviewing the details,\" GM said.GM produces its Buick Encore GX and Buick Envista crossovers, as well as the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Chevrolet Trax crossovers, at plants in South Korea. The company has touted the vehicles as being a pinnacle for the automaker's profitable growth in lower-margin, entry-level vehicles.Detainees are made to stand against a bus before being handcuffed, during a raid by federal agents where about 300 South Koreans were among 475 people arrested at the site of a $4.3 billion project by Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution to build batteries for electric cars in Ellabell, Georgia, U.S. September 4, 2025 in a still image taken from a video.

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter rising for several weeks, mortgage rates moved decidedly lower last week, but not enough to make much of a difference in demand from current borrowers or potential homebuyers. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.4% for the week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. An additional adjustment was made for the Thanksgiving holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.32% from 6.40%, with points falling to 0.58 from 0.60, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Mortgage rates moved lower in line with Treasury yields, which declined on data showing a weaker labor market and declining consumer confidence,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. Even with that drop, applications to refinance a home loan fell 4% for the week but were 109% higher than the same week one year ago, when interest rates were much higher.

Buyer demand has been pretty weak this fall, as still-elevated home prices, relatively high mortgage rates and uncertainty over the state of the economy all weigh on consumers.\"We continue to see mixed results each week as the broader economic outlook remains cloudy, even as cooling home-price growth and increasing for-sale inventory bring some buyers back into the market,\" Kan added. The adjustable-rate mortgage share of activity increased to 8% of total applications, as consumers continue to look for more savings. ARMs offer lower rates and can be fixed for up to 10 years. They tend to be more popular in higher rate environments.Interest rates were mixed to start this week. They rose sharply on Monday but then pulled back a little bit Tuesday, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. There wasn't much economic data to impact rates.\"That could change on Wednesday with the confluence of ADP and ISM Services--both capable of influencing the bond market, even before the shutdown data dynamics temporarily magnified private data's importance,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.",

    "body": "Inside Horizon Quantum's office in Singapore on Dec. 3, 2025. The software firm claimed it is the first private company to deploy a commercial quantum computer in the city-state.Sha Ying | CNBC InternationalSingapore-based software firm Horizon Quantum on Wednesday said it has become the first private company to run a quantum computer for commercial use in the city-state, marking a milestone ahead of its plans to list in the U.S.The start-up, founded in 2018 by quantum researcher Joe Fitzsimons, said the machine, which costs around $2.3 million to assemble, is now fully operational. It integrates components from quantum computing suppliers, including Maybell Quantum, Quantum Machines and Rigetti Computing.According to Horizon Quantum, the new computer also makes it the first pure-play quantum software firm to own its own quantum computer — an integration it hopes will help advance the promising technology.\"Our focus is on helping developers to start harnessing quantum computers to do real-world work,\" Fitzsimons, the CEO, told CNBC. \"How do we take full advantage of these systems? How do we program them?\" Horizon Quantum builds the software tools and infrastructure needed to power applications for quantum computing systems. \"Although we're very much focused on the software side, it's really important to understand how the stack works down to the physical level ... that's the reason we have a test bed now,\" Fitzsimons said. Quantum raceHorizon Quantum hopes to use its new hardware to accelerate the development of real-world quantum applications across industries, from pharmaceuticals to finance.Quantum systems aim to tackle problems too complex for traditional machines by leveraging principles of quantum mechanics.For example, designing new drugs, which requires simulating molecular interactions, or running millions of scenarios to assess portfolio risk, can be slow and computationally costly for conventional machines. Quantum computing is expected to provide faster, more accurate models to tackle these problems. A top executive at Google working on quantum computers told CNBC in March that he believes the technology is only five years away from running practical applications.Still, today's quantum systems remain in the nascent stages of development and pose many engineering and programming challenges. Investment in the space has been rising, however, as major tech companies report technological breakthroughs. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and IBM, along with the U.S. government, are already pouring millions into quantum computing. Investor attention also received a bump in June after Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang offered upbeat remarks, saying quantum computing is nearing an \"inflection point\" and that practical uses may arrive sooner than he had expected.watch nowNasdaq listingHorizon Quantum's announcement comes ahead of a merger with dMY Squared Technology Group Inc., a special purpose acquisition company. The deal, agreed upon in September, aims to take Horizon public on the Nasdaq under the ticker \"HQ.\"The software firm said in September that the transaction valued the company at around $503 million and was expected to close in the first quarter of 2026. The launch of its quantum computer also helps cement Singapore's ambition to be a regional quantum computing hub. The city-state has invested heavily in the technology for years, setting up its first quantum research center in 2007. Before Horizon Quantum's system came online, Singapore reportedly had one quantum computer, used primarily for research purposes. Meanwhile, U.S.-based firm Quantinuum plans to deploy another commercial system in 2026.Singapore's National Quantum Strategy, unveiled in May 2024, committed 300 million Singapore dollars over five years to expand the sector, with a significant portion directed toward building local quantum computer processors.  In May 2024, the National Quantum Strategy (NQS), Singapore's national quantum initiative, pledged around S$300 million over five years to strengthen development in the sector, with a significant portion directed toward building local quantum computer processors.watch now",

    "body": "Waymo partners with Uber to bring robotaxi service to Atlanta and Austin.Uber Technologies Inc.Waymo on Wednesday said humans will begin test driving the Alphabet-owned company's robotaxi vehicles in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. The three cities represent the latest additions to Waymo's quickly growing list of cities where the Google sister company is either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles. That list now stands at 26 markets. Waymo will begin manual drives in the trio of new cities this week with hopes to eventually begin serving fully-autonomous rides there, spokesperson Ethan Teicher told CNBC. Over the past month, Waymo has been aggressively making announcements for new markets and developments at the Google sister company. This comes as tech rivals Amazon and Tesla made advancements in the robotaxi market in 2025. Amazon's Zoox began offering free rides in Las Vegas and San Francisco, and Tesla this year launched ride-hailing service with human supervisors in the Austin and San Francisco markets.In November, Waymo announced that it will soon begin manually driving in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans. The company also added Houston, San Antonio and Orlando to its list of cities where it'll launch service in 2026. Waymo also began offering rides on freeways in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets, and it named a new finance chief. With more than 250,000 weekly paid trips, Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. The company in May said it had provided more than 10 million paid rides since launching in 2020.The new cities further signal that Waymo is increasingly confident its service can work well in locations with colder weather conditions.WATCH: Waymo launches paid robotaxi rides on freewayswatch now",

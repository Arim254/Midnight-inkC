    "body": "In September, The Economist released its third annual \"Carrie Bradshaw index,\" named after the protagonist of the hit TV show \"Sex and the City.\" The report ranks the U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live alone.The index was named after the character because, on the show, she lives in a studio apartment in the West Village and it is highly unlikely that she could afford it on a writer's salary now, Lizzy Peet, a data researcher at The Economist, tells CNBC Make It.\"It all came about from a sort of snappy way to sum up the aspiration, a sort of quality of living by yourself in a big city for the first time. How much would you have to earn to afford that? And how much is that a realist prospect?\" she says.To rank the U.S. cities, The Economist used the rule that a tenant should spend no more than 30% of their gross income on rent. That, in combination with using rental prices from Zumper, led to the calculation of the salary needed to afford a typical studio in each city. Each city was given a \"Bradshaw score\" where a value more than one means an average studio apartment is affordable and less than one means housing is unaffordable.\"Cities that build a lot or maybe that have less demand or maybe have less population demand on rent are the kind of cities that are looking more affordable,\" Peet says.One big change in this year's index is that some cities that were affordable last year have slid into the unaffordable category this year, Peet adds.A lot of cities in Texas, like Dallas, Houston, and Austin, moved from what was deemed affordable to what is now deemed unaffordable.\"There are loads of factors at work here. It's important to know that rental markets can be quite random, but they can fluctuate a lot in a very short space of time,\" Peet says. \"It's pretty well documented that Texas has seen this influx of middle-class workers, and that would drive rent up.\"In this year's index, 41 cities were unaffordable, up from 38 cities last year.Wichita, KansasCweimer4 | E+ | Getty Images10 U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live aloneWichita, Kan.Baton Rouge, La.Lincoln, Neb.Des Moines, IowaAkron, OhioTucson, Ariz.Tulsa, Okla.St. Louis, Mo.Albuquerque, N.M.Aurora, Colo.Wichita, Kansas, is the most affordable city in the index. It has a Bradshaw score of around 1.75, which means that median wages in the city are 75% higher than needed to afford an average studio apartment.The average monthly rent for studio apartments in Wichita is $580, up 1.64% from last month, but down 10.54% year-over-year, according to Zumper.Residents of Wichita need to earn $26,400 a year to afford a studio, which is $20,250 less than the median wage.\"I'm not that surprised Wichita is the most affordable. A lot of the cities in the bottom 10 are off the beaten track and not huge economic powerhouses. It's an interesting dynamic,\" Peet says.\"There are still some perhaps less desirable cities that are surprisingly unaffordable and vice versa.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 20, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday signed an agreement on critical minerals and rare earths that Albanese said includes plans for projects worth a total of up to $8.5 billion.Albanese, during a meeting with Trump at the White House, said, \"There will be $1 billion contributed from Australia and the United States over the next six months with projects that are immediately available.\"But the White House subsequently issued a fact sheet that said the countries would invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the next six months. It described the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.CNBC has asked the White House and the Australian prime minister's office for clarification on the discrepancy between what Albanese said and what the fact sheet said.The framework agreement between Australia and the U.S. comes as the Trump administration is seeking to establish a critical mineral and rare earths supply chain that is not dependent on China.Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals. They are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, robotics and electric vehicles among other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, particularly refining and processing. The U.S. is dependent on Beijing for rare earths imports. Australia, a close U.S. ally, is one of the few countries in the world other than China that processes rare earths.Pentagon investment in AustraliaAlbanese said there will be three groups of joint projects between the two countries, which will include companies such as Alcoa. The U.S. will invest in rare earths processing in Australia, the prime minister said. One project is a joint venture between Australia, the U.S. and Japan, he said.\"What we're trying to do here is to take the opportunities which are there,\" Albanese told reporters.The Pentagon will invest in building a gallium refinery in western Australia with a capacity of 100 metric tons per year, according to the White House. Alcoa announced in August that it is exploring the feasability of a gallium project with Japan at one of the company's alumina refineries in western Australia.\"In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them,\" Trump told reporters. The U.S. is also working with other nations to build a supply chain that isn't dependent on China, the president said.China-U.S. tensionsChina announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, pushing Beijing and Washington to the brink of a renewed trade war. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 or sooner if Beijing does not back down.\"They threatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs, but I could also threaten them with many other things, like airplanes,\" Trump said Monday.Trump confirmed he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. The U.S. president said he will visit China early next year.\"We had presidents that allowed China and other countries get away with murder,\" Trump said. \"We're not going to allow that, but we're going to have a fair deal. I want to be good to China. I love my relationship with President Xi. We have a great relationship.\"",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of some of Australia's largest critical metals and rare earths companies surged on Tuesday following the announcement of a massive minerals deal between Washington and Canberra worth up to $8.5 billion.The agreement — signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday — includes funding for multiple projects aimed at boosting the supply of key materials used in defense manufacturing and energy security.Lynas Rare Earths, Australia's largest rare earths producer by market capitalization, jumped about 4.7% in early Asia trading. Mineral sand miner Iluka Resources advanced more than 9% while lithium producer Pilbara Minerals added roughly 5%.Other smaller rare earth miners also made gains, with VHM soaring around 30%, while Northern Minerals popped over 16%. Meanwhile, Latrobe Magnesium, Australia's primary producer of the critical metal magnesium, rose nearly 47%. NYSE-listed Alcoa, which is developing a project in Western Australia to recover and refine the critical metal gallium, was identified as one of the two priority projects under the new minerals deal. Washington will make an equity investment in the initiative.Shares of Alcoa, also traded on the Australian Securities Exchange through depositary receipts, rose nearly 10%.Rare earths and critical metals are essential for high-tech products such as electric vehicles, semiconductors and defense equipment. China, the global leader in the production of rare earths and many other critical minerals, has tightened export controls on the materials amid a trade war with the U.S., accelerating international efforts to diversify global supply chains. Albanese said the two countries will each contribute $1 billion over the next six months for projects that are \"immediately available.\"However, a White House fact sheet later stated that Washington and Canberra will invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the same period, describing the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, potentially unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.",

    "body": "Sanae Takaichi created history on Oct. 21, winning Japan’s parliamentary vote to become the country’s first women prime minister.Philip Fong | Afp | Getty ImagesSanae Takaichi on Tuesday created history, winning Japan's parliamentary vote to become the country's first woman prime minister.Takaichi garnered 237 votes in the first round of voting, negating the need for a runoff vote in the 465-seat Lower House, according to public broadcaster NHK.Her victory comes after the ruling Liberal Democratic Party allied with the Japan Innovation Party and reportedly signed an agreement over the weekend to form a coalition government. Takaichi agreed to back JIP policies such as a reduction in parliamentary seats, free high school education and a two-year pause on food consumption tax, according to Reuters.Tobias Harris, founder and principal at risk advisory firm Japan Foresight, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" that the JIP might not want to take up a cabinet post, saying that \"there's a real risk joining a coalition with an LDP that is still seeing historically low approval ratings, [and] does not really have the trust of the public.\"Domestic Japanese media has also reported that the JIP is not looking at cabinet positions in the new administration, and will instead support the government from the outside.Should the JIP not like the LDP's approach, it will be easier for them to exit the coalition, Harris said.In the Ishiba administration, the LDP suffered heavy electoral losses, losing its majority in both the upper and the lower house.Japan's Nikkei 225, which had risen 1.5% earlier during the day, erased its gains, while the benchmark 10-year government bond yields dipped 1.6 basis points to 1.654%. The yen weakened 0.33% to 151.25.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPath to PMTakaichi's path to the country's top job has been challenging.In the 2024 LDP presidential race, Takaichi lost to Shigeru Ishiba. She won the leadership of the party in September this year, defeating Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi after Ishiba announced his resignation.But on Oct. 10, the Komeito party abruptly exited its alliance with the LDP, ending a relationship going back to 1999, putting Takaichi's fate in a limbo.A hardline conservative, Takaichi has been widely labeled as an apostle of \"Abenomics,\" the economic strategy of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.She had previously criticized the Bank of Japan's plan to raise interest rates during the 2024 LDP leadership race, although BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said that the central bank would set rates \"without any preconceptions.\"On the geopolitical front, Takaichi has called for a hardline stance toward China and is also in favor of revising Japan's pacifist constitution.Her previous visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, which honors Japan's war dead, including convicted war criminals, have drawn criticism from China and South Korea, which see the site as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime aggression.Takaichi is going to be \"very, very careful\" in how she communicates her views, especially on foreign policy,\" said Kei Okamura, managing director and portfolio manager of Neuberger Berman, told CNBC earlier this month.\"Her views on China and Korea have also been very well flagged. But she also understands that she has to maintain very good relations with all these countries, especially also with the United States, just because all of them have a very big impact in terms of Japan's biggest export destinations.\"",

Mathieu Lewis-rolland | Getty ImagesA federal appeals court on Monday said that President Donald Trump could deploy National Guard troops to the streets of Portland, Oregon.The 2-1 ruling by a three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit U.S. Courts of Appeals stayed a temporary restraining order issued by a federal district court judge on Oct. 4 enjoining Trump's order to federalize 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland.\"After considering the record at this preliminary stage, we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority under\" a law \"which authorizes the federalization of the National Guard when 'the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States,' \" the majority of the panel said in its order Monday.The order detailed multiple instances of protestors disrupting activity at the ICE facility.Read more CNBC politics coverageX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

By design of the Founders, the judicial branch stands apart,\" she wrote. \"We rule on facts, not on supposition or conjecture, and certainly not on fabrication or propaganda.\"",

    "body": "CoreWeave Inc. signage in Times Square in New York, US, on Friday, May 9, 2025.Yuki Iwamura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC Tuesday that the firm's proposed acquisition of Core Scientific would be a \"nice to have\" rather than a necessity as shareholders prepare to potentially block the deal.In July, AI cloud provider Coreweave proposed an all-stock deal valued at around $9 billion to buy the Bitcoin miner and data center firm, Core Scientific. Immediately after the news, Core Scientific's stock price fell, plummeting nearly 18%.The deal has received criticism with key proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommending on Monday that shareholders vote against the acquisition. Core Scientific's share price has conitnued to rise after the deal was announced which suggests some investors think that the company is valued higher than what CoreWeave has offered, ISS said.Intrator said that he was \"disappointed\" by the ISS report and continues to believe that the deal is \"in the long-term interest of Core Scientific shareholders.\" However, CoreWeave will not raise the price of the offer.\"We think that the bid that we put out there for [Core Scientific] is a fair representation of the relative value of the two companies as an all stock deal,\" Intrator told CNBC. \"We are going to just kind of proceed as we have, in the event that the transaction does not go through. It is a nice to have, not a need to have for us.\"\"Everything has a value, and the number we put out is the value we're willing to pay for them under all circumstances,\" Intrator added.watch nowEarlier this month Two Seas Capital, a major Core Scientific shareholder publicly opposed the acquisition saying that the price CoreWeave is offering is too low. Shareholders will vote on the deal on October 30.\"We see no reason why Core Scientific shareholders should accept such an underwhelming deal. Based on recent trading data, we see little evidence that they will,\" Two Seas Capital said in a Friday letter to shareholders.CoreWeave has aggressive pursued acqusitions this year to buy AI-related firms like OpenPipe, Weights & Biases, and Monolith as it looks to expand its product offering.The company, which has built data centers and offers Nvidia-powered computing power to hyperscalers like Microsoft, has been riding the wave of artificial intelligence investments.\"We've been in acquisitive mode as we continue to build and extend the functionality of our company,\" Intrator said.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to the press after disembarking from Air Force One upon arrival at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, Oct. 17, 2025, as he travels to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend. Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is stepping up his calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco at the very moment that the city is undergoing a post-pandemic resurgence, propelled by artificial intelligence.Crime rates are down 30% from 2024, homicide levels hit their lowest levels in 70 years and car break-ins haven't been this low in 22 years. Meanwhile, event bookings and tourism are on the rise, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is heating up.Business momentum in the city is largely built on the AI boom.New data from CBRE show venture capital funding in 2025 is expected to surpass the record high of $276 billion hit in 2021. The bulk of that investment has been in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where 80% of AI venture funding through the third quarter has been targeted to the tune of $115 billion.By the end of the September, the San Francisco Bay Area was already 35% above its previous annual investment peak, according to CBRE's VC Funding analysis.\"San Franciscans are feeling positive about the direction of our city once again,\" Daniel Lurie, the city's Democratic mayor said in a statement last week released by Governor Gavin Newsom's office. \"And we are going to continue working every single day to build on this progress and keep our city safe 365 days a year.\"The statement was meant to tout the successful efforts of local law enforcement ahead of Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference last week. The issue became particularly controversial after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to San Francisco. His sentiments were publicly supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump Administration.On Friday, facing mounting criticism, Benioff backtracked, posting on X that, \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco.\"watch nowThe Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, sparking protests and lawsuits. Over the weekend, President Trump repeated his plans to send troops to San Francisco, telling Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that, \"the difference is I think they want us in San Francisco.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the President's plans.In a statement late Monday, Lurie said San Francisco law enforcement has partnerships with federal agencies to deal with drug crimes and additional troops aren't necessary. \"I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers — and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" Lurie said. Lurie previously cheered the safety of events that took place in the last week including Dreamforce and No Kings Protests over the weekend. In contrast to Newsom, Lurie has taken a far less combative approach to Trump since taking office in January.\"San Francisco is on the rise,\" Lurie wrote in a post on X on Oct. 12, a couple days before Dreamforce was set to begin.The data support that view.Tourism spending is expected to increase modestly this year to $9.35 billion, up from $9.26 billion, according to the San Francisco Travel Association. Conferences, sporting events such as NBA All-Star weekend, and music festivals like Outside Lands have contributed to the growth.The commercial real estate market is also recovering as Covid-era work from home policies get slowly unwound.Tech companies increased their share of leasing activity by square footage to 53% in 2025, the highest since 2019, CBRE said. Apartment rental prices are surging as well. Multifamily rentals increased 6% in August, much more than the 3.75% jump in Chicago, the city with the second-steepest climb, according to CoStar.Ted Egan, chief economist for San Francisco, told CNBC in an interview that \"housing is probably as cheap as it's going to get for a while.\"There remains plenty of room for improvement. The city has lost key tenants in its downtown shopping district in recent years, including its flagship Nordstrom store. The Nordstrom location was part of San Francisco City Centre, which was the city's largest mall but is now effectively empty.Office vacancies remained high at 33.6% in the third quarter, according to Cushman and Wakefield. Homelessness and open drug use are longstanding issues, heavily concentrated in certain parts of the city.But Egan said that, in addition to the data, he's noticed a significant change in the city's health.\"It seems cleaner and safer now than it's ever been in any of the time that I've been here,\" said Egan, who's worked in San Francisco for more than 20 years. \"I still think it's a great place to move to because it's got tons of economic opportunity. It's got tons of long-term economic strengths for people starting out in their career.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO faces pushback over support for potential National Guard deploymentwatch now",

    "body": "Electric vehicles are cheaper to maintain than cars with internal combustion engines, but they tend to lose money — fast.It varies by model, but in general EVs depreciate by 13% more over a five-year period than the overall market, and some plummet in value even more rapidly, according to iSeeCars, which tracks the used car market.It's enough to make a new car buyer hesitate if they are worried about how much they will get back when they try to sell the car. In addition, automakers have said they're trying to broaden the appeal of EVs to more cost-conscious mainstream shoppers. Up until now, the EV market has been heavy on higher priced vehicles aimed at luxury buyers.\"New car shoppers, especially wealthy ones, are less price sensitive,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst of iSeeCars. \"They don't care about the depreciation. Used car shoppers are not like that. Every used car buyer, by nature of being a used car buyer, is value oriented.\"There are a few big reasons EVs suffer greater depreciation.Historically they have been more heavily incentivized, which tends to hurt resale values since a used buyer won't pay as much for a car that did — or even could have — received discounts. Incentives hurt resale values for all kinds of cars, but EVs have received some additional ones, including the now expired federal government rebates.EVs received about twice the incentives as gas-burning cars — including those from dealers and automakers in August, for example, according to Cox Automotive. Even that was a drop from the record set in July.There is also the rapidly changing pace of technology. The maximum available EV range for example has more than doubled in the last decade, and the median range has tripled, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Some evidence has suggested longer-range EVs tend to depreciate more slowly.Despite all the advances, EVs remain a relatively niche product with a small, albeit growing, share of the market. U.S. sales of EVs, excluding hybrids, hit a market share of 10.5% for the first nine months of the year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.But that smaller share limits their marketability.There are big changes ahead. An explosion of used EVs is inevitably on its way, and the mix of models is likely to be different.\"We have, you know, $30,000 to $35,000 EVs coming from the domestic market — from Ford, from Chevy,\" said Alex Yurchenko, managing director of valuation services for J.D. Power. \"So you have now a much better mix of vehicles, in terms of affordability.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

Cleveland Works steel mill in Cleveland, Ohio, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCleveland-Cliffs is looking into building a rare earths mining business, CEO Lourenco Goncalves told investors Monday.The steelmaker has two sites in Michigan and Minnesota where geological surveys have found indications of rare earths, Goncalves said in a statement on Cleveland-Cliffs' third-quarter earnings.\"We are working with the geologists to assess whether these deposits could become commercially viable — that's where we are at,\" Goncalves told analysts on the company's earnings call later Monday morning. \"We are a mining company, this isn't new territory for us.\"Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs closed more than 20% higher at $16.18. The Cleveland headquartered steelmaker is experienced in mining iron ore.Rare earths are used to manufacture magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, semiconductor fabrication, robotics and other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on Beijing for imports. China announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, provoking President Donald Trump to threaten 100% tariffs in retaliation.The U.S. has only one commercial rare earths mine. The Defense Department struck a deal in July with the mine's owner, MP Materials, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors have been speculating that the Trump administration will strike similar deals with other U.S. companies that are trying to stand up domestic rare earths mines and processing facilities.Cleveland-Cliffs' sites in Michigan and Minnesota, if successful, would align the company with the administration's \"broader national strategy for critical mineral independence,\" Goncalves said.\"American manufacturing shouldn't rely on China or any foreign nation for essential minerals, and Cliffs intends to be part of the solution,\" the CEO said.",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

    "body": "Comfort Colors t-shirts are seen on Oct. 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCWhen looking through Wyatt Cannon's T-shirt collection, there's a common theme: the Comfort Colors label.Growing up, Cannon would often find Comfort Colors apparel when looking for souvenirs during family trips. In college, Cannon convinced his a cappella group to screen print on the company's blank shirts. When the 24-year-old has made tie-dye T-shirts for himself, it's with Comfort Colors product.\"I've loved this brand my whole life,\" said Cannon, who estimates around half of his shirts are Comfort Colors. \"This kind of material and texture and vibe of T-shirt should just be more of the standard.\"Cannon is part of a loyal and growing base of consumers driving demand for the half-century-old, Gildan-owned shirt brand. The label's ballooning success in recent years can help explain Gildan's stock outperformance and has led to plans for an expansion into additional product categories.Comfort Colors t-shirts.Courtesy: Watt CannonGildan is tight-lipped about specific brand performance and declined to share Comfort Colors' sales data with CNBC. But company executives have said Comfort Colors took off, especially over the last year, and has become a leading brand within Gildan, which also sells apparel under its namesake label and American Apparel.\"Comfort Colors is probably the fastest-growing fashion brand,\" Glenn Chamandy, Gildan's co-founder and CEO, said during a call with analysts earlier this year. \"When you walk into a souvenir store today, you'll see Comfort Colors on every single one of those tables where you used to see fashion brands before.\"'Knocking it out of the box'Gildan acquired Comfort Colors for around $100 million in 2015 in hopes of expanding within the basics category of North America's printwear market, according to a press release announcing the deal. At the time, Gildan called the Vermont-based apparel maker \"one of the most recognized brands\" in places like college bookstores and resorts.The brand publicizes that its shirts are 100% cotton from the U.S. Its \"pigment pure\" dyeing system creates the shirts' \"signature faded look\" and requires less energy and water use than other comparable processes, Gildan says.Comfort Colors' popularity exploded in 2024 with around 40% year-over-year growth, company executives have said on earnings calls. That helped drive sales in Gildan's broader activewear category 6% higher in the same period.Chamandy told analysts in late July that Comfort Colors is \"knocking it out of the box again this year\" and helped push the activewear category up 12% in the second quarter. The brand is planning to expand into hats, bags and women-specific clothing in 2026 as it rings in its 50th anniversary, Howard Upchurch, marketing and merchandise chief at Gildan, said in a statement to CNBC.Gildan, which announced earlier this year it was acquiring Hanesbrands as it further builds out its basic apparel business, is expected to report earnings at the end of this month.U.S.-listed shares of Gildan, which is a Canadian-based company, have surged more than 175% over the last five years. That's almost double the widely followed S&P 500's return over the same period.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGildan vs. S&P 500, 5-year chartThough Gildan has touted Comfort Colors as a success story within its larger empire, consumers haven't necessarily made the connection.Cannon said he views Comfort Colors as \"crunchy\" and \"granola,\" while Gildan feels like the \"peak of consumption capitalism.\" The Connecticut-based marketing manager said Comfort Colors' unique tag of woven fabric is one quality that makes the brand feel more \"homey.\"A 'good spot'On Etsy, printers hawk Comfort Colors shirts with various designs and some even allow shoppers to upload their own. The brand has also gotten a boost from TikTok, where content creators share videos of their Comfort Colors products that viewers can purchase via the platform's shopping feature.Relative search volume for Comfort Colors in the U.S. spiked to all-time highs on Google this year, underscoring the brand's growing awareness among consumers. On the other hand, Gildan has tumbled in search popularity from a peak in 2023.Comfort Colors has amassed a \"very loyal\" base made up particularly of Gen Z customers, according to Sheng Lu, an associate professor at the University of Delaware whose research focuses on the apparel industry.These young shoppers value comfort and vintage flair, both of which align with Comfort Colors' products, Lu said. Comfort Colors' emphasis on sustainability can also bode well with a customer base that's conscious of their environmental footprint.\"This brand definitely is in a very good spot,\" Lu said.Comfort Colors' rise is particularly interesting given that the brand focuses more on selling in bulk than directly to consumers, unlike other T-shirt makers like Nike, Lu said. He explained that since Comfort Colors is mainly selling product via middlemen who can screen print on them, the shirts end up appearing more unique — which is another desirable quality for Gen Z shoppers.Behind the scenes, Gildan is likely benefiting from Comfort Colors' sourcing in the Western Hemisphere, Lu said. While countries in this region have been hit by President Donald Trump's tariffs, the levies have typically been less steep than those slapped on Asia, he said.Because shoppers tend to view T-shirts as a staples, these items may show stability even when consumer sentiment falls, Lu said.Frats to folkPlus, across the country, Comfort Colors shirts are outfitting social groups and sitting on merchandise stands at events. Musical acts including Maggie Rogers and Mumford & Sons printed tour merchandise on Comfort Colors shirts. Brands ranging from Coors Light to Star Trek sell its apparel, as do local bars and eateries. Women's soccer team Gotham Football Club has several official Comfort Colors spirit wear shirts.When Chelsea Green opened The Yard Milkshake Bar, she already knew of Comfort Colors from seeing the brand on college campuses. She said it's the most popular type of merchandise for The Yard Milkshake Bar, particularly with younger shoppers who are familiar the brand and sometimes use the shirts for sleepwear or as beach coverups.\"I knew that I had Comfort Colors T-shirts already in my closet,\" Green said. \"I was like, 'that's what I want.' I didn't even research it.\"To be sure, Green acknowledged that the shirts can be pricier than some competitors' and she at times ran into supply shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the color options and quality have made overcoming these obstacles worthwhile, she said.Social organizations such as Cannon's collegiate a cappella group have also turned to Comfort Colors. Similarly, fraternity Sigma Chi and sorority Pi Beta Phi each sell dozens of Comfort Colors shirts in their online shops.On a fraternity-focused Reddit forum, a user asked what T-shirt brands people used for screen printing. One respondee said Comfort Colors is their \"go-to.\" Use Comfort Colors, another said, \"or you're at risk of getting tar and feathered.\"",

    "body": "Shares of U.S.-listed companies related to the rare earth supply chain climbed on Monday as investors continued to weigh the impact of Chinese export restrictions on domestic producers.  Rare earths are minerals that are essential to many aspects of modern life, particularly for the technology sector and the energy transition, as they are used in everything from semiconductors, fighter jets to the motors of electric vehicles.Prime Minister Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement on Monday to invest in joint ventures to stand up a critical mineral and rare earth supply chain that is not dependent on China.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview last week that the Trump administration will set a price floors for a range of industries, including rare earths, to combat market manipulation by China. Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors consider which firms might be future targets for the government's industrial policy.NioCorp led the sector's gains with an increase of nearly 20%. Energy Fuels rose about 7% while USA Rare Earth rallied nearly 14% and Perpetua Resources advanced more than 7%. MP Materials was also in the green, moving more than 2% higher. Canada's Lithium Americas increased nearly 3%The moves come as the Trump administration is working to build up its own domestic rare earth supply chain.The Defense Department struck a deal in July with MP Materials, which is the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors are anticipating that the administration will back additional miners. William Blair initiated coverage of USA Rare Earth on Monday with an outperform rating on the expectation that the Trump administration \"could soon take a material stake in the company.\"Michael Silver, the CEO and chairman of rare earths distributor American Elements told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week that the U.S. has enough heavy rare metals for its military applications, but the supply chain squeeze could impact EVs, lasers, and \"quite a lot of commercial technology.\" watch nowGetting mines up and running should be \"treated as national priorities,\" Silver said, adding that there will likely be government involvement and subsidies.  Under new rules that were announced earlier this month, foreign companies now need Beijing's approval to export rare earths and are required to explain what they will be used for.  - CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.",

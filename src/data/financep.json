    "body": "The Department of Education is adding another layer of transparency around earnings outcomes for students and their families applying for federal financial aid for college.The department announced on Dec. 8 it will be adding earnings data to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. If a first-time undergraduate student selects an institution where the data shows graduates on average don't earn more than workers in the state — or workers nationally, for schools with primarily out-of-state students — who only finished high school, the student will see a \"lower earnings\" disclosure, the department says.The department cited the nation's nearly $1.7 trillion in federal student debt owed and an NBC News poll that reports a growing share of Americans who say a college degree isn't worth the price as contributing reasons for implementing the disclosures. The disclosures will draw on publicly available earnings data, including median earnings by institution, according to the College Scorecard, adjusted for inflation. The College Scorecard is an online database of colleges and universities run by the Department of Education that allows users to explore and compare schools on factors including earnings outcomes, costs and graduation rates.\"Not only will this new FAFSA feature make public earnings data more accessible, but it will empower prospective students to make data-driven decisions before they are saddled with debt,\" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the press release.The department added in its announcement on the Federal Student Aid website that the earnings indicator \"should not be interpreted as the Department passing normative judgment on what institutions are worthy of attendance,\" and that an institution's past performance is not necessarily predictive of an individual student's success. Why potential earnings matter when selecting a collegeGoing to college is worth it for most students, even when it comes with high out-of-pocket costs, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York study from April 2025 found. Median wages for college graduates are roughly 68% higher than for workers without degrees, and that earnings premium tends to grow over individuals' careers, the researchers said.Even when accounting for student debt, degree holders earn roughly $8,000 more per year than those without post-secondary degrees, a separate study from Brookings Institute found. Roughly 1 in 5 Americans with undergraduate degrees have debt from their education, according to Education Data Initiative. However, those who attended but didn't finish college and those who attended for-profit institutions are more likely to default on their student loans than college graduates and those who attended nonprofit institutions, according to the New York Fed.Further, some colleges have a history of providing low or no return on investment when their graduates don't go on to earn much, if any, more than their peers who didn't pursue post-secondary degrees. Many of the colleges the Department of Education has flagged with lower earnings disclosures are for-profit institutions and cosmetology schools. A 2022 study from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, found 98% of cosmetology programs do not meet the basic standard that graduates go on to earn more than workers with high school diplomas alone. Aveda Arts & Sciences Institutes and Empire Beauty Schools, two major for-profit cosmetology school networks with dozens of campuses that will have lower earnings disclosures, did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.The Department of Education says its move to flag colleges with lower earnings histories to potential applicants will aim to help students be aware of potentially negative outcomes before they take out loans.\"This indicator is designed to inform — not limit — student choices,\" Nicholas Kent, Under Secretary of Education, wrote in a blog post. \"It's one additional resource students can use — alongside factors like cost, mission, location, and personal interests — to identify the path that best aligns with their goals.\"The full list of schools that are now flagged with lower earnings disclosures is available to download here. The data currently reflects 2021 earnings of workers who completed school in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years, adjusted for inflation to 2025 dollars. High school completers' earnings are drawn from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates from 2019 and 2020. The data will be updated as it becomes available, the department says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Dec. 10, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. forces on Wednesday seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said. \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela — a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump said during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.The president declined to provide information on who owned the tanker or its destination, but said it was \"seized for a very good reason.\"The tanker has been identified as the Skipper, according to Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler.Skipper is a Guyana-flagged \"Very Large Crude Carrier,\" or VLCC, that was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels of oil in mid-November, Smith told CNBC.Smith said the ship appeared to be headed for Cuba, though it has been stopped offshore Venezuela since it was loaded.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Wednesday that a seizure warrant for the crude oil tanker was executed by the FBI, the Homeland Security Department's investigations unit and the U.S. Coast Guard, with support from the Pentagon.Bondi, in an X post, shared apparent military drone footage showing soldiers boarding the vessel from a helicopter.The tanker, which transported oil from Venezuela and Iran, has been sanctioned by the U.S. for years \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" Bondi wrote on X.The seizure \"was conducted safely and securely,\" she added, \"and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues.\"U.S. crude oil was up 70 cents, or 1.2%, to $58.95 per barrel at 3:12 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent rose 71 cents, or 1.15%, to $62.65 a barrel. Trump has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks. The president said Maduro's \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. He would not rule out a ground invasion of the South American nation.\"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump told Politico. The White House has undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean and launched controversial, deadly strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler. \"Shippers will likely be much more cautious and hesitant about loading Venezuelan crude going forward,\" Smith said. — CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks with CNBC during the Invest i America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.CNBCThere were three dissenters from the Federal Reserve's decision to lower the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point on Wednesday, making it the most divisive the central bank has been in more than six years. Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee joined Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid in voting for no decrease. The newest member, Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran, again called for a  half-point cut. It is the third dissent in a row for Miran, who called for a half-point rate cut in both the October and September meetings. Schmid also called for no decrease in October.The last time there were three dissents during a Fed meeting was in September 2019.In addition, there were four other so-called soft dissents by nonvoting meeting participants. The policymakers submitted a forecast for interest rates to have ended the year at the previous level of 3.75 percent to 4 percent.\"'Hard dissents' from voting members as well as the 'soft dissents' seen in the dot plot highlight the Fed's hawkish bloc, and the return of 'extent and timing' language to the statement regarding future policy decisions was likely done to appease them,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"While this leaves the door open to future cuts, labor market weakness will have to clear a high bar,\" she added.However, Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, said that the dissents against the rate cuts may not necessarily offer a window into next year's moves. \"The dissents ruled against a faster pace of rate cuts today, but the winds of change are in the air,\" he said. \"A new Fed Chair in 2026, and perhaps many more new Fed officials, means more interest rate cuts are coming next year as rate cuts are big on the Trump 2.0 economic agenda even if not listed explicitly, if for nothing else but to weigh against the slowing economy due to the import tariffs uncertainty.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed reporting.Correction: The last time there were three dissents during a Fed meeting was in September 2019. An earlier version misstated the month and year.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on December 10, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a much-anticipated quarter percentage point interest rate cut at a meeting that was packed with intrigue and surprises. Here's a look at five top takeaways:The hawkish cut is real — kind of. Wall Street had been anticipating the Fed would deliver a strong dose of caution along with the cut, with a warning that the bar was high for additional easing. Markets, though, didn't seem to mind: Stocks posted solid gains on the day while Treasury yields fell.While a 9-3 vote might suggest broad support for the move, the Federal Open Market Committee is different. Three dissents is a lot, the most, in fact, since September 2019. And one of the \"no\" votes came from an unexpected source: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. Governor Stephen Miran wanted a half-point cut, while Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favored holding steady. A total of six of the 19 participants at the meeting said they wouldn't have voted for the cut, giving voice to \"soft dissents\" who think the easing has gone far enough.The dots held. In short, the \"dot plot\" of individual officials' rate views were little changed for the coming years, with the median indicating just one cut in 2026 and another in 2027 before the fed funds rate settles around a neutral 3%. Markets largely took the committee at its word, though futures pricing late in the day pointed to a non-negligible 38% chance of two cuts next year.Bond buying is back. Well, not really bonds, but bills, which the Fed will start buying again come Friday. With overnight funding markets feeling pressure, the central bank said it will buy $40 billion of short-term bills as part of a monthly program aimed at stabilizing markets and keeping the fed funds rate within its quarter-point range. Buying levels will change, but some market participants viewed the announcement as a stealth easing that is positive for risk assets.Chair Jerome Powell was mostly upbeat about growth, and so was the committee. \"We have an extraordinary economy,\" said Powell, who has just three meetings left as chair. FOMC officials raised their view as well, boosting the outlook for 2026 gross domestic product growth by half a percentage point to 2.3%.What they're saying\"Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed Chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while. Still, continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25 bps cut into the mix for January.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a reported finalist to succeed Powell\"The Fed's guidance probably tells us less than usual about the interest rate outlook, for two big reasons. First, they know less than usual about the current state of the economy because the shutdown delayed the release of economic statistics. Second, the Fed's guidance doesn't account for how its approach will change after Chair Powell's term ends in May. In 2026, the Fed seems more likely to cut rates by more than signaled in the December Dot Plot than by less.\" — Bill Adams, chief economist, Comerica Bank\"The Fed lifted its expectations of growth next year which, along with the increase in cash to American households via changing tax policy, will create doubt about the path of monetary policy. This dynamic in our estimation substantially lifts the bar on any prospective rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in January.\" — Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist, RSM",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point could have been \"at least doubled.\"Trump, who has long urged the central bank to slash rates in order to spur further economic growth, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut.Trump, during a roundtable meeting with CEOs at the White House, also said he plans to interview former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh later Wednesday. Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett are two of the top contenders to succeed Powell when his term ends in May.\"I'm looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates,\" Trump said, before adding, \"Our rate should be much lower.\"Powell has been a major target of criticism from Trump, who believes the Fed has been too slow to lower rates during the first year of his second presidential term.Trump also lamented what he described as the tendency to raise interest rates in the wake of strong economic results.  \"We're going to go back to the old days,\" Trump said at the roundtable. \"When we announced great results, it doesn't mean we're going to raise interest rates and try and kill it.\"The president's comments came shortly after the Fed announced the 25-basis-point cut, its third of the year. The decision was the middle-ground choice among a divided Fed: Two of the members preferred not to change rates, while Stephen Miran, a Trump administration economic official, favored a larger cut.Powell, at a news conference later Wednesday, said the latest cut was a \"close call\" that gives the Fed room to \"wait and see how the economy evolves.\"He also directly blamed Trump's tariffs for the nation's \"somewhat elevated\" inflation level. \"These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the effects of tariffs,\" Powell said, citing the rise in two key inflation gauges.",

Quincey will stay on with the company as executive chairman of its board.Quincey, 60, has held the top job at the beverage giant since 2017. During that time, he oversaw the refranchising of Coke's bottling system, the company's strategy through the Covid pandemic and its focus on beverages perceived as healthier.Braun, 57, has held various roles at Coke since joining the company in 1996, the same year that Quincey joined. Braun became COO at the beginning of the year. In a release, Coca-Cola said Braun will focus on identifying new growth opportunities around the world, better filling consumer needs and improving the company's technology.James Quincey, Coca-Cola CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBCThe leadership change comes as the beverage company tries to reverse slower demand for its sodas, which still account for a significant amount of its global sales. In Coke's third-quarter, global unit case volume — which strips out pricing and foreign currency changes — rose 1% after falling in the previous three-month period. Quincey has said lower-income consumers have bought fewer of its drinks, and the company has rolled out cheaper and smaller versions of its products to try to reverse the trend. However, pricier brands like Smartwater and Fairlife have performed better than its soda segment in recent quarters, suggesting that consumers are willing to pay more for some brands. Coca-Cola has also largely outperformed rival Pepsico during Quincey's tenure, in part due to its stronger out-of-home business in venues like restaurants and movie theaters. Coke is also winning the soda wars. Its namesake soda has held onto its spot as the best-selling soda in the U.S., and Sprite surpassed Pepsi to become the No. 3 soda in the nation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCoke's stock has outperformed Pepsi's in recent years.Coke shares were largely unchanged in extended trading Wednesday.

Loans from the Federal Housing Administration, or FHA, which require mortgage insurance, however, are providing an outlet.Total applications to refinance a home loan rose 14% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Volume was 88% higher than the same week one year ago. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 58.2% of total applications from 53.0% the previous week. Demand for FHA refinances was up 24% for the week, as the FHA interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate loans fell to 6.08% the lowest level since September 2024. In contrast, the average rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.33% from 6.32%, with points rising to 0.60 from 0.58, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 2% for the week and were 19% higher than the same week one year ago. Potential buyers are also turning to the FHA for additional savings.\"Conventional purchase applications were down for the week, but there was a 5 percent increase in FHA purchase applications as prospective homebuyers continue to seek lower downpayment loans,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release. Mortgage rates on conventional loans moved even higher to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. Markets are now waiting for commentary from the Federal Reserve's chair after Wednesday's meeting. It is widely expected the Fed will cut its overnight borrowing rate, but the last two times it did that mortgage rates rose sharply. \"The cut itself is not the news the market is waiting for. Rather, traders are interested to see each Fed member's rate outlook via the quarterly release of the Fed's economic projections,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"In addition, every Fed meeting includes a press conference with the Fed Chair, and bonds have often made the biggest moves in response.\"",

The U.S central bank cut the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.5%-3.75%, and signalled that it was probably done cutting for now.Fed Chair Jerome Powell, at his post-meeting news conference, said the reduction puts the Fed in a comfortable position as far as rates go.\"We are well-positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves,\" Powell said, and noted President Donald Trump's tariffs have been a driver of inflation.Japan's Nikkei 225 started the day up marginally, while the broad-based Topix was 0.36% higher.South Korea's Kospi rose 0.51%, and the small-cap Kosdaq gained 0.64%. Hong Kong Hang Seng index futures were at 25,602, higher than the index's last close of 25,540.78.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.79% in early trade.On the commodities front, prices of silver rose to a fresh record high of $62 per ounce, according to LSEG data.In addition to the rate decision Wednesday, the Fed also announced it will resume buying $40 billion in Treasury bills, beginning Friday. Short-term Treasury yields moved lower as a result.The central bank also addressed the weak labor market in its statement, removing language stating that it \"remained low.\" This suggests its focus is shifting to supporting the economy, away from inflation.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped on Wednesday, climbing 1.1% after the Fed decision, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.3%.— CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon and Pia Singh contributed to this report.

    "body": "A Deere & Co. tractor in front of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRepublican lawmakers are appealing to President Donald Trump for more farm relief and aid for agricultural equipment manufacturers amid his tariff blitz, even as the president has made a $12 billion bailout for farmers hurt by his trade policies. Farmers have said that Trump's tariff policies have hit their bottom lines, since they rely on exports to international trade competitors, including China, to stay afloat. That hit comes on top of several years of low commodity prices and high costs for key inputs like fertilizer, which were already forcing farmers to tighten their belts.The reduction in demand for new equipment from cash-strapped farmers led to layoffs earlier this year by some of the largest manufacturers, including Deere. Cory Reed, president of Deere's agriculture and turf division, told the Financial Times this week that the \"US market has been the one under the most pressure . . . based on what's happened with trade flows, what's happened with tariffs and what's happened with the escalating cost structure internally, as we've seen that market cycle down.\"Kip Eideberg, the head of government and industry relations at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, said, \"We remain concerned that persistent high tariffs, especially on critical parts and components that cannot be sourced domestically, will inadvertently harm our farmers and ranchers and drive up costs for all Americans.\"The dynamic has alarmed lawmakers, some of whom asked Trump to step in as he attempts to rescue farmers, a loyal voting bloc, from the financial fallout of his trade policies. A spokesperson for Trump-ally Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said the senator has appealed to the administration. \"Last week, Senator Grassley raised constituent concerns to the White House, the U.S. Trade Representative and the Departments of Commerce and Agriculture, sharing that equipment manufacturers could use targeted relief from the tariffs and urging the administration to remove tariffs on specific farm machinery parts,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to CNBC.Other Republican senators have spoken up, too. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., said in an interview that the equipment issue came up at a Monday roundtable at the White House where Trump laid out his relief plan for farmers injured by his trade policies. He said the president was receptive to pleas for aid to farmers for equipment. \"We talked specifically with the president about it, and he specifically said he wants to look at how he can help make farm equipment more affordable,\" Hoeven said. Hoeven said Trump suggested \"reducing some of the regulatory burdens on farm equipment manufacturers,\" to keep costs down. Trump at that roundtable publicly suggested he would slash environmental regulations on farm equipment manufacturers, but only if those companies reduce their prices. Those regulations do not \"do anything except it makes the equipment much more expensive and much more complicated to work, and it's not as good as the old days,\" Trump said. \"We're gonna do it and we're gonna say 'you're gonna reduce the prices.' \"But Republican lawmakers argue that the solution lies in getting farmers more income so they can purchase new equipment.That may be a tall order, given the already tight margins for operating a farm, and the impact from Trump's tariffs.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Frank Lucas, R-Okla., a former House Agriculture Committee Chair and a farmer himself, said the sagging market for manufacturers is indicative of a poor farm economy. \"When the equipment dealers start to scream, when the fertilizer and seed dealers start to scream, when the banks start to scream, there's a problem,\" Lucas said.\"I think the $12 billion aid package that the administration is talking about is a step in that direction, and I will also admit to you, we just need to wrap up some of these trade negotiations and get our products back into the world markets.\"   The Trump administration has been engaged in trade talks with various countries, and in some cases have lowered tariffs as a result.Trump's $12 billion trade bailout, dubbed the Farmer Bridge Payment Program, carves out $11 billion for row crop farmers who grow massive quantities of crops like corn and soybeans. Farmers this year already were getting roughly $30 billion in supplemental aid from the federal government Additional federal funds will flow next October, when provisions from the Republican reconciliation package known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act kick in. But American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall warned that farmers will need more than that to get by. \"Bridge support is a down payment, and members in Congress have already expressed their desire to fill in the gaps,\" Duvall wrote on the group's website. Some members of Congress agreed, signaling a likely additional influx of federal funds into agriculture down the road. Senate Agriculture Chair John Boozman, R-Ark., said farmers are in their third year in a row where \"if they're growing something in the ground, they're losing money.\" \"We're prepared to do more in Congress if we need to do it,\" he said.",

    "body": "The Starcloud-1 satellite is launched into space from a SpaceX rocket on November 2, 2025.Courtesy: SpaceX | StarcloudNvidia-backed startup Starcloud trained an artificial intelligence model from space for the first time, signaling a new era for orbital data centers that could alleviate Earth's escalating digital infrastructure crisis. Last month, the Washington-based company launched a satellite with an Nvidia H100 graphics processing unit, sending a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before. Now, the company's Starcloud-1 satellite is running and querying responses from Gemma, an open large language model from Google, in orbit, marking the first time in history that an LLM has been run on a high-powered Nvidia GPU in outer space, CNBC has learned. \"Greetings, Earthlings! Or, as I prefer to think of you — a fascinating collection of blue and green,\" reads a message from the recently launched satellite. \"Let's see what wonders this view of your world holds. I'm Gemma, and I'm here to observe, analyze, and perhaps, occasionally offer a slightly unsettlingly insightful commentary. Let's begin!\" the model wrote.Starcloud's output Gemma in space. Gemma is a family of open models built from the same technology used to create Google's Gemini AI models.StarcloudStarcloud wants to show outer space can be a hospitable environment for data centers, particularly as Earth-based facilities strain power grids, consume billions of gallons of water annually and produce hefty greenhouse gas emissions. The electricity consumption of data centers is projected to more than double by 2030, according to data from the International Energy Agency.Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston told CNBC that the company's orbital data centers will have 10 times lower energy costs than terrestrial data centers.\"Anything you can do in a terrestrial data center, I'm expecting to be able to be done in space. And the reason we would do it is purely because of the constraints we're facing on energy terrestrially,\" Johnston said in an interview.Johnston, who co-founded the startup in 2024, said Starcloud-1's operation of Gemma is proof that space-based data centers can exist and operate a variety of AI models in the future, particularly those that require large compute clusters. \"This very powerful, very parameter dense model is living on our satellite,\" Johnston said. \"We can query it, and it will respond in the same way that when you query a chat from a database on Earth, it will give you a very sophisticated response. We can do that with our satellite.\"In a statement to CNBC, Tris Warkentin, product director at Google DeepMind, said that \"seeing Gemma run in the harsh environment of space is a testament to the flexibility and robustness of open models.\" In addition to Gemma, Starcloud was able to train NanoGPT, an LLM created by OpenAI founding member Andrej Karpathy, on the H100 chip using the complete works of Shakespeare. This led the model to speak in Shakespearean English.Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way.Philip JohnstonStarcloud CEO Starcloud — a member of the Nvidia Inception program and graduate from Y Combinator and the Google for Startups Cloud AI Accelerator — plans to build a 5-gigawatt orbital data center with solar and cooling panels that measure roughly 4 kilometers in both width and height. A compute cluster of that gigawatt size would produce more power than the largest power plant in the U.S. and would be substantially smaller and cheaper than a terrestrial solar farm of the same capacity, according to Starcloud's white paper.These data centers in space would capture constant solar energy to power next-generation AI models, unhindered by the Earth's day and night cycles and weather changes. Starcloud's satellites should have a five-year lifespan given the expected lifetime of the Nvidia chips on its architecture, Johnston said. Orbital data centers would have real-world commercial and military use cases. Already, Starcloud's systems can enable real-time intelligence and, for example, spot the thermal signature of a wildfire the moment it ignites and immediately alert first responders, Johnston said. \"We've linked in the telemetry of the satellite, so we linked in the vital signs that it's drawing from the sensors — things like altitude, orientation, location, speed,\" Johnston said. \"You can ask it, 'Where are you now?' and it will say 'I'm above Africa and in 20 minutes, I'll be above the Middle East.' And you could also say, 'What does it feel like to be a satellite? And it will say, 'It's kind of a bit weird.' ... It'll give you an interesting answer that you could only have with a very high-powered model.\"Starcloud is working on customer workloads by running inference on satellite imagery from observation company Capella Space, which could help spot lifeboats from capsized vessels at sea and forest fires in a certain location. The company will include several Nvidia H100 chips and integrate Nvidia's Blackwell platform onto its next satellite launch in October 2026 to offer greater AI performance. The satellite launching next year will feature a module running a cloud platform from cloud infrastructure startup Crusoe, allowing customers to deploy and operate AI workloads from space. \"Running advanced AI from space solves the critical bottlenecks facing data centers on Earth,\" Johnston told CNBC. \"Orbital compute offers a way forward that respects both technological ambition and environmental responsibility. When Starcloud-1 looked down, it saw a world of blue and green. Our responsibility is to keep it that way,\" he added.The risksRisks in operating orbital data centers remain, however. Analysts from Morgan Stanley have noted that orbital data centers could face hurdles such as harsh radiation, difficulty of in-orbit maintenance, debris hazards, and regulatory issues tied to data governance and space traffic. Still, tech giants are pursuing orbital data centers given the prospect of nearly limitless solar energy and greater, gigawatt-sized operations in space.Along with Starcloud and Nvidia's efforts, several companies have announced space-based data center missions. On Nov. 4, Google unveiled a \"moonshot\" initiative titled Project Suncatcher, which aims to put solar-powered satellites into space with Google's tensor processing units. Privately owned Lonestar Data Holdings is working to put the first-ever commercial lunar data center on the moon's surface. Aetherflux, founded by former Robinhood co-founder and chief executive Baiju Bhatt, on Tuesday announced a target to deploy an orbital data center satellite in the first quarter of 2027.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has notably explored an acquisition or partnership with a rocket maker, suggesting a desire to compete against Elon Musk's SpaceX, according to The Wall Street Journal. SpaceX is a key launch partner for Starcloud.Referring to Starcloud's launch in early November, Dion Harris, senior director of AI infrastructure at Nvidia, said: \"From one small data center, we've taken a giant leap toward a future where orbital computing harnesses the infinite power of the sun.\"",

    "body": "Chuck Robbins, chief executive officer of Cisco, participates in a Bloomberg interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 17, 2024.Stefan Wermuth | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFew companies were as hot in early 2000 as Cisco, whose networking equipment served as the backbone of the internet boom.On Wednesday, Cisco's stock surpassed its dot-com peak for the first time. The shares rose almost 1% to $80.25, topping their prior split-adjusted record or $80.06 reached on March 27, 2000. That's the same day that Cisco passed Microsoft to become the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. Back then, investors saw Cisco as a way to bet on the growth of the web, as companies that wanted to get online relied upon the hardware maker's switches and routers. But following a half-decade boom, the dot-com bubble burst just after Cisco reached its zenith, a collapse that wiped out more than three-quarters of the Nasdaq's value by October 2002. While the market swoon eliminated scores of internet highflyers, Cisco survived the upheaval. Eventually it started to grow and expand, diversifying through a series of acquisitions like set-top box maker Scientific- Atlanta in 2006, followed by software companies including Webex, AppDynamics, Duo and Splunk.With its gains on Wednesday, Cisco's market cap sits at $317 billion, making it only the 13th most valuable U.S. tech company. In recent years, the stock has badly trailed tech's megacaps, which have been at the center of the new boom surrounding artificial intelligence.The AI market has reached a level of euphoria that many analysts have compared to the dot-com era. Instead of Cisco, the modern infrastructure winner is Nvidia, whose AI chips are at the heart of model development and are relied up by the other major tech companies that are all building out AI-focused data centers. Nvidia has a market cap of $4.5 trillion, roughly 14 times Cisco's current value. But Cisco is angling to benefit from the AI craze, with CEO Chuck Robbins in November touting $1.3 billion in quarterly AI infrastructure orders from large web companies. Total revenue approached $15 billion, which was up 7.5% year over year, compared with 66% growth in 2000.Shares of Cisco are up about 36% so far in 2025, outperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained about 22% over the same period.WATCH: Cisco CEO on latest quarter: AI demand from hyperscalers is acceleratingwatch now",

    "body": "Members of the Kilo Code team, including Scott Breitenother, its co-founder and CEO, and Sid Sijbrandij, its co-founder and previously the CEO of GitLab, gather for the startup's all-team gathering in Amsterdam in October 2025.Kilo CodeInvestors are betting there's room for another startup using artificial intelligence to help software engineers write code faster. The difference with Kilo Code is it counts former GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij among its founders.On Wednesday, Kilo Code announced $8 million in seed funding, with backing from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital and Tokyo Black.Sijbrandij is a self-taught developer who helped popularize GitLab's tools for source code collaboration, deployment and testing. GitLab went public in 2021 and is valued at more than $6 billion. Sijbrandij stepped down as CEO last year to focus on cancer treatment but continued as board chair.Since then, the technology industry has become obsessed with having large language models write and update software, a practice commonly known in Silicon Valley as vibe coding. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy is credited with coining the term in February. OpenAI looked at buying AI coding startup Windsurf for around $3 billion, but scrapped the plan before Google hired senior Windsurf employees in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Rival Cursor announced a $2.3 billion funding round in November at a $29.3 billion valuation.At Microsoft, vibe coding already makes up 30% of the company's code, CEO Satya Nadella said in April. Sijbrandij witnessed the action and became fascinated by what AI could do for software development. In September, an acquaintance introduced him to Scott Breitenother, who started and later sold consultancy Brooklyn Data.\"I thought we were just kind of having a meet and greet, and then 25 minutes in, Sid's like, 'Hey, can you start next week?'\" Breitenother said. Sijbrandij contributed early capital for the startup, which now employs about 34 people across continents. Breitenother is in charge, but he talks with Sijbrandij many times a day. Kilo Code's software plugs in to coding applications such as Cursor and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. It's the most widely used service for startup OpenRouter's application programming interface that gives developers access to a variety of AI models, including Grok Code Fast 1 from Elon Musk's xAI. Kilo Code has processed more than 3 trillion tokens in the past month, according to OpenRouter. A single token represents about three-quarters of a word.Daniël Langezaal, a software engineer at Dutch e-commerce startup Plug&Pay, said he has used Kilo Code for months after trying products from Anthropic, Cursor and Microsoft, among others. He said he appreciates Kilo Code's support for both premium and affordable models, and he likes that people publicly contribute to the Kilo Code extension under an open-source license.Langezaal has spread the word. About 80% of Plug&Pay's developers now use Kilo Code, he said. It helped save time for one teammate who recently assembled a complex SQL query. \"With Kilo, it took him a day,\" Langezaal said. \"If he didn't have access to Kilo, it would have taken him a few days to implement.\"GitLab, which has been testing a platform for AI agents to perform tasks, is paying attention, and was interested in what Kilo was building.\"I talked to the board,\" Sijbrandij said. \"We ended up deciding to do it outside of GitLab.\"GitLab included reference to Kilo in a filing last month. The company said that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. The market is rapidly evolving. Design software company Figma and a slew of startups now offer vibe coding options for less technical people. It's a category Kilo Code won't be ignoring for much longer.\"We also want to be the place for people just getting started with code,\" Sijbrandij said. \"We are working on an app builder that's more like the Lovable or Bolt experience,\" he said, referring to two popular startups.  Lovable, based in Sweden, announced funding at a $1.8 billion valuation in July.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding play",

Deb Fischer, R-Neb.\"There remains anxiety about if and when China will fully follow through on those purchase commitments that were made,\" Fischer said.She noted that the White House fact sheet on the trade deal said China would purchase 12 million metric tons by the end of the calendar year -- contradicting recent comments from Greer.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

China would be more likely to hit buying targets from the U.S. by next August, since Brazil dominates the soybean market in the early months of the new year that coincides with its harvest season and cheap prices. The U.S. typically exports more to China later in the year, when its soybeans are cheaper.But that's a far longer time than the initial two-month window the White House pitched when it announced the China framework.\"That's a long time,\" Glauber said. \"This is not any sort of immediate relief.\"CNBC has asked the USDA for comment on Greer's remarks.

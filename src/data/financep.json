    "body": "Shares in AI darling Nvidia popped in premarket trade after the U.S. firm beat expectations in third-quarter results after the closing bell on Wednesday. Shares were last trading 5.5% higher at 4:15 a.m. ET.Nvidia topped forecasts for revenue, which jumped 62% to $57.01 billion year-on-year, and issued stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales guidance.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call, as the firm set out its view of the industry. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"Quilter Cheviot's Ben Barringer, who is the global head of technology research and investment strategist, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" that Nvidia brought relief in two-parts: it beat gross margins, which is important for semiconductor stocks, but the firm also addressed market concerns head-on in its earnings call.\"They really went through and sort of tried to disprove pretty much all of the bear cases out there. They talked about scaling laws, they talked about all the different elements of demand, not just hyperscaler capex, but the model demand that they're seeing from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, software demand, enterprise demand, sovereign AI,\" Barringer said.Nvidia also addressed supply constraints, vendor financing, partnerships and China. \"So they really did a stand up job of calling out every elephant in the room, every every possible bear case, and going through and giving their perspective on it,\" Barringer added.Nvidia's upbeat guidance helped lift investor sentiment around the AI trade, which has weakened in recent sessions amid fears about elevated valuations, debt financing and potential chip depreciation. The results boosted a slew of stocks across the AI ecosystem in the after-hours session, including chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom and power infrastructure companies such as Eaton.Asia chip stocks also rallied on Thursday, with Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, leading gains.— CNBC's Pia Singh contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hand with Russian President Vladimir Putin, as they meet to negotiate for an end to the war in Ukraine, at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, U.S., August 15, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersUkraine could face some tough choices amid reports that the U.S. and Russia have secretly formulated a peace plan to end the war, potentially including significant concessions to Moscow.Senior U.S. military officials are in Ukraine on Thursday \"on a fact finding mission to meet with Ukrainian officials and discuss efforts to end the war\" with Russia, a U.S. army spokesman said.The visit comes a day after media reports suggested Washington and Moscow had held secret talks and devised a new 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, without Kyiv's involvement.The 28-point plan — first reported by Axios but followed by other media, including the Financial Times and Reuters, citing unnamed sources — allegedly contains proposals for Ukraine to concede territory in its eastern Donbas region to Russia, abandon certain categories of weaponry and reduce the size of its armed forces by 50%, among other conditions. One report in The Telegraph newspaper suggested that Russia could take control of the Donbas region despite Ukraine maintaining legal ownership, with Moscow essentially paying rent for the land. CNBC was unable to confirm the information contained within the media reports.A senior Ukrainian official told Reuters that Kyiv had received \"signals\" about a set of U.S. proposals to end the war, but that Kyiv had had no role in preparing the proposals, the unnamed source said.The Kremlin on Wednesday denied that there had been any \"innovations on possible peace proposals\" since Russian President Vladimir Putin had met U.S. President Donald Trump in August. When asked specifically about the Axios report, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was nothing he could share publicly.Meanwhile, the White House has not explicitly confirmed the existence of the 28-point peace plan, reportedly modeled on the Gaza peace agreement, but U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that new proposals were in the works.\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Rubio posted on X overnight Wednesday. \"Achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict,\" he said.Ukraine in a corner?Ukraine leadership has not publicly commented on the 28-point plan, but peace proposals are expected to form part of Thursday's talks between President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the U.S. delegation of military officials.On Wednesday, Zelenskyy commented that \"only President Trump and the United States have sufficient power to make this war come to an end.\"He said Kyiv had \"supported every decisive step and the leadership of [President Trump], every strong and fair proposal aimed at ending this war,\" and added that Ukraine was \"ready to work in any other meaningful formats that could yield results.\"Ukraine's First Deputy Foreign Minister Serhii Kyslytsia addressed reports of the peace plan head-on, however, suggesting in a post on X that Moscow was behind a push to hype up \"a factory of unrealistic plans.\"Whether Ukraine would accept such concessions to end the war is highly uncertain, with pushback likely. However, Kyiv finds itself in a vulnerable position given its reliance on the U.S. for military aid, and although it still has staunch support from its European allies, military and financial aid are slower to materialize now than in the early days of the war.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gestures during a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the Oval Office of the White House, amid negotiations to end the Russian war in Ukraine, in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 18, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersStill, European diplomats appear unhappy at the reports of a peace plan lacking Ukrainian or regional involvement, with the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas commenting Thursday that \"for any plan to work, it needs to have Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"\"In this war, there is one aggressor and one victim. So far, we haven't heard of any concessions from Russia's side,\" she told reporters.Analysts at the Institute for the Study of War said that if the reports are true, the 28-peace plan would amount to \"Ukraine's full capitulation and would set conditions for renewed Russian aggression against Ukraine.\"\"The reported proposed peace plan would deprive Ukraine of critical defensive positions and capabilities necessary to defend against future Russian aggression, apparently in exchange for nothing,\" the ISW analysts said Wednesday. They noted it would \"give this significant land to Russia — apparently for no specified compromise — sparing Russia the time, effort, and manpower that it could use elsewhere in Ukraine during renewed aggression.\" The ISW concluded that the plan, if verified, showed Russia's maximalist territorial demands on Ukraine had essentially not changed since the initial invasion in 2022. \"This reported peace plan is fundamentally the same as Russia's 2022 Istanbul demands, which Russia presented to Ukraine when the circumstances on the battlefield appeared to favor Russia more heavily.\"",

    "body": "Job seekers speak with recruiters during the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday will release the September nonfarm payrolls number, ending a shutdown-induced blackout on official jobs data, albeit with a decidedly rear-window view.Due at 8:30 a.m. ET, the release is forecast to show a gain of 50,000 jobs in the public and private sectors, up from the initially reported 22,000 in August but still indicative of a soft labor market.Though the report will be backward-looking, it at least will provide some fodder for investors, economists and Federal Reserve officials who have had to rely on a host of private alternative data during the record-long shutdown in Washington, D.C. It will be the first BLS jobs report since the August release on Sept. 5.\"My sense is that the both the September report and the revisions for July and August will suggest a little bit brighter outlook than is commonly assumed, but not much to brag about,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"The labor market is holding in there, just like the economy.\"Coming a week after the government impasse ended, the data also is expected to show the unemployment rate at 4.3% while average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.7% from a year ago, all numbers unchanged from August, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates.Because the numbers are from September, they will provide only a little help for policymakers trying to navigate a difficult landscape and could be disregarded by markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently referred to the situation as \"driving in the fog\" and cautioned against looking at further interest rate cuts as guaranteed while officials look for direction.While one month's jobs report will help clear up some of the way, visibility will remain limited.'Pervasive uncertainty'The BLS on Wednesday updated its release dates for the data points it produces.The bureau will not release October's jobs report separately, instead including it with the November report, which has been pushed to Dec. 16 from its original release date of Dec. 5. There will be no unemployment rate released for October due to household data that the BLS will not be able to collect. Similarly, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey will see a combined September and October release on Dec. 9.The BLS on Oct. 24 released September's consumer price index report only because it is used as a benchmark for Social Security cost of living adjustments.\"The economy is muddling through a period of pervasive uncertainty,\" Brusuelas said. \"Because of the duration of the shutdown, I don't think we're going to get a clean reading until early February on where the labor market's at.\"Nevertheless, other data, such as the private payrolls running tally from ADP along with layoff announcements from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas and a host of other indicators are providing some clues on where the labor market stands.In fact, Fed Governor Christopher Waller in a speech Monday rejected the notion that the Fed doesn't have enough data to make decisions.\"Policymakers and forecasters are not 'flying blind' or 'in a fog,'\" Waller said in a speech advocating a December rate cut. \"While it is always nice to have more data, as economists, we are skilled at using whatever available data there is to formulate forecasts.\"Judging by data revealed so far, Goldman Sachs holds an above-consensus view of 80,000 jobs created in September but sees a decline of 50,000 in October, due largely to the expiration of the federal government's deferred resignation program from cuts associated with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\"While we do not expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to produce an October unemployment rate, we estimate it likely would have increased, reflecting upward pressure from shutdown-related furloughs and increases in broader measures of labor market slack,\" Goldman economists Ronnie Walker and Jessica Rindels said in a note.In addition to the September headline number, Thursday's report also will include revisions for July and August. Both Brusuelas and the Goldman economists said they expect those numbers to come in higher than the previous counts.",

    "body": "US Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, speaks with reporters outside his office on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol in Washington, DC, November 10, 2025. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday night said he signed a bill ordering the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The announcement in a lengthy Truth Social post followed the bill's near-unanimous passage in Congress.\"I HAVE JUST SIGNED THE BILL TO RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\" Trump wrote in the 390-word post, which painted the notorious financier as a \"lifelong Democrat\" who \"was deeply associated with many well-known Democrat figures.\"Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, also stressed that he had asked Republican leaders in the House and Senate to pass the bill — even though his administration had reportedly opposed the push to release the files. After the vote on the bill was scheduled in the House, Trump on Sunday night abruptly urged Republicans to back it.\"Because of this request, the votes were almost unanimous in favor of passage,\" Trump wrote Wednesday night.The bill instructs Attorney General Pam Bondi to publicly release unclassified records relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, among other information, within 30 days of its signing. But the legislation contains exceptions, including for information containing victims' personally identifiable information or child sex abuse materials.It also includes a carve-out for records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\" Bondi, acquiescing to a request from Trump, said last week that she had assigned Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's ties to several of the president's perceived foes.The legislation received overwhelming support in the House, with all but one lawmaker, Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, voting for it on Tuesday.It passed immediately when it was sent to the Senate on Wednesday morning. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had secured a unanimous consent agreement, which allowed the legislation to sail through the upper chamber as soon as it was received.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDespite his sudden shift in stance on the bill, Trump has continued to fume about the focus on Epstein, calling it a \"hoax\" being pushed by Democrats to distract from his administration's achievements. He has repeatedly lashed out at reporters when asked about his connections to Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges. Trump and Epstein were friends until the early 2000s, but the two had a falling out years before Epstein's death.When an ABC News reporter asked Trump on Tuesday why he has not released the Epstein files on his own — as he has the power to do — the president insulted her and called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Trump on the 2024 campaign trail suggested he would release files related to Epstein. In the early months of his second term, officials in his administration signaled they were pushing to disclose those files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February, for instance, that Epstein's rumored \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" The same month, a group of pro-Trump influencers received binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" at the White House.But those binders contained little new information. And the DOJ, in an unsigned memo in July, said that a review of its Epstein-related materials \"revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\" The memo also included the agency's conclusion that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"The announcement enraged both Democrats and some prominent voices in Trump's base. In subsequent months, scrutiny increased over Trump's past association with Epstein.In July, The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a \"bawdy\" and cryptic note to Epstein bearing Trump's signature, which was part of a collection of letters gathered for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied writing the letter and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents it had obtained from Epstein's estate through a subpoena, including emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email thread in 2018, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"I know how dirty donald is.\" In an April 2019 email to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" CNBC has not independently verified the emails, and it is unclear what Epstein was referring to.House Democrats and a handful of Republicans sought to approve a discharge petition that would force a vote in the GOP-majority chamber on the bill to release the Epstein files. That effort was delayed for weeks by the government shutdown, which postponed the swearing-in of a Democratic lawmaker who would provide the last needed signature.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

    "body": "Signage for SGX Group at the Singapore Exchange Ltd. stock exchange headquarters in Singapore, on Monday, July 14, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSingapore is doubling down on its efforts to make the city-state's stock market more attractive for companies and investors. The country's bourse has tied up with the Nasdaq to simplify dual listings in the U.S. and Singapore, introducing a \"Global Listing Board\" for companies with a market capitalization of more than 2 billion Singapore dollars (about $1.5 billion). The \"Landmark partnership\" is aimed at enabling firms to \"access global capital, investors and liquidity through a harmonized cross-border listing framework that bridges the two markets,\" according to a statement released by the Nasdaq and the Singapore Exchange late Wednesday.A key feature, the SGX said, would be the streamlining of regulatory obligations and fundraising with a single set of documents and simplified review process by mid-2026. So effectively, the companies will only need to fill a single set of paperwork fulfilling the regulations on both exchanges.Speaking to CNBC's Martin Soong, SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said that this benefits investors, because it's a dual listing across different time zones. \"You get to have price discovery almost round the clock ... given where volatility is today, this allows investors to risk manage 24 hours, and you're also giving choices to investors, whether that could be US dollars or that could be in Sing dollars.\"Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, told CNBC that this dual listing bridge was the \"first of its kind,\" and added that it was \"something that's very exciting for companies that have an Asian footprint, want to have global exposure and have a singular regulatory experience.\"The step aligns with the broader efforts by the Singapore government to strengthen the attractiveness of Singapore's stock market to investors and companies seeking to list and access growth capital, SGX said.Stepping up The announcement also come as the Monetary Authority of Singapore revealed more measures to strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore's stock market. These include a SG$30 million \"Value Unlock\" package to help companies develop abilities in corporate strategy, capital optimization, and investor relations. \"It is an opportune time for companies to reinforce strategic fundamentals, enhance communications, and demonstrate value creation to attract and sustain investor participation,\" MAS said. The central bank also announced placing SG$2.85 billion with six asset managers in Singapore, adding on to its SG$1.1 billion allocation in July this year, aimed at developing Singapore's fund management industry and increasing investor participation in Singapore equities.CGS International analysts Lock Mun Yee and Lim Siew Kee said in a note that the liquidity boost is a positive for the Singapore stock market and new measures such the \"Value Unlock\" program are complementary to the value chain.The MAS said that it had seen \"increasing\" activity and interest in Singapore's equity market, with average daily turnover in the third quarter of 2025 climbing 16% year on year to SG$1.53 billion — the highest since the first quarter of 2021. In particular, trading activity in small- and mid-cap stocks has picked up. IPOs have also gained pace, raising over SG$2 billion so far this year. CGS International cautioned that while a potential dual listing in Singapore could broaden regional investor access, factors such as the SGX's relatively lower liquidity compared to the Nasdaq remain near-term hurdles. Analysts from Goldman Sachs said that the guidelines and enforcement details of the \"Value Unlock\" program are currently limited, adding that recent investor engagements suggest that corporate action would be required for a further re-rating of the Singapore market. Goldman pointed to Japan and South Korea that have implemented measures such as dividend tax cuts and disclosure guidelines to drive corporate action. Singapore's STI is up about 30% since the equities review group was established in August 2024, compared to the near 60% increase in Japan and South Korea's equity markets after the announcement of their respective reform measures, Goldman said.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

Brian Rothmuller | Icon Sportswire | Getty ImagesMajor League Baseball officially announced a new three-year media rights agreement with NBC, Netflix and ESPN on Wednesday, foreshadowing the league's more significant TV deal to come in 2028.The new deal stems from ESPN's decision to opt out of its \"Sunday Night Baseball\" package earlier this year. ESPN struck a new deal with MLB, acquiring the rights to MLB.TV and a midweek game package. NBC Sports will take over the Sunday Night games, and Netflix will be the new home for the next three Home Run Derbies. All the deals begin with the 2026 season.CNBC previously reported most of the details of the agreement in August.\"Our new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee events,\" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The new deal foreshadows MLB's quest to raise TV revenue at the end of the 2028 season, when it will get these rights back plus existing broadcast rights from Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. While it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison, MLB had to take a haircut of about $300 million per year relative to what ESPN had been paying before opting out earlier this year. NBC is paying about $200 million a year for its new package, and Netflix is paying about $50 million annually for the Derby, CNBC reported in August. The two packages, together, roughly make up what ESPN had been paying for.Even so, MLB has a chance to expand its reach through the new and streaming-exclusive partners.The average ESPN Sunday Night Baseball game averaged 1.8 million viewers this past season.The loss in revenue for the Sunday Night package suggests MLB may have to get creative with the way it carves up new packages of games in 2028 to ensure it continues to grow media revenue. In aggregate, the league is now making more in overall media revenue, but it needed to sell ESPN rights and games it hadn't previously offered. ESPN is paying about $550 million for its new package, CNBC reported in August.The NBA nearly tripled its national media revenue in its most recent rights deal, and the NFL is so confident it can generate a huge increase on the deal it signed in 2021 that it's open to accelerating talks with its current media partners as early as next year, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC in September.New deal detailsESPN's new deal allows it sell and distribute MLB.TV, the league's out of market streaming service, through the ESPN app. ESPN will also receive a new 30-game midweek package of live games on ESPN's linear networks and the ESPN app. ESPN also will sell and distribute MLB Network and in-market games for select MLB teams via the ESPN app. Those teams are the Cleveland Guardians, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies — franchises whose games have been produced and distributed by MLB after the collapse of regional sports networks that carried those teams.NBC will now have MLB, NBA and NFL on Sunday for its broadcast network, its new cable sports channel, and its Peacock streaming service. NBC will also carry MLB's entire Wild Card round, ranging from eight to 12 games each season. In addition to three years of the Home Run Derby, Netflix will own the rights to a singular game on Opening Night for the next three seasons. Netflix will also exclusively deliver all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic to its audience in Japan. Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",

South Florida Sun-sentinel | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury charged U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla., with stealing $5 million in Covid-19 disaster funds — a chunk of which was then illegally contributed to her 2021 congressional campaign, the Department of Justice said Wednesday. Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, tried to launder the money through multiple accounts to disguise its source, the DOJ said, citing the indictment issued in U.S. District Court in Miami.The siblings obtained the money in July 2021, after the family health-care company where they worked received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA, which funded the company's Covid vaccination staffing contract, according to the DOJ.Cherfilus-McCormick and another defendant, Nadege Leblanc, are also accused of orchestrating a \"straw donor\" scheme in which money from the FEMA contract was sent to friends and relatives, who then donated it back to her campaign for Congress.Cherfilus-McCormick joined the House in 2022 after winning a special election that January to fill late Rep. Alcee Hastings' seat representing Florida's 20th Congressional District.The congresswoman and her 2021 tax preparer, David Spencer, are also charged in the indictment with conspiring to file a false tax return, the DOJ said. They claimed personal and political expenses as business deductions and \"inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations,\" the indictment alleges.Cherfilus-McCormick faces a possible maximum sentence of 53 years in prison if convicted, the DOJ said in a press release. Actual sentences are often significantly lower than the maximums due to judges' discretion and federal sentencing guidelines.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

We will fight to clear her good name.\"Cherfilus-McCormick has been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, the panel revealed in late May.The Office of Congressional Conduct sent a referral to that committee in May 2024, laying out a number of possible violations. Cherfilus-McCormick \"may have requested community project funding that would be directed to a for-profit entity,\" the office said in that referral.Edwin Cherfilus faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted of the charges announced Wednesday, while Spencer faces up to 33 years, and Leblanc faces a 10-year maximum sentence.",

(TSMC), left, and Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the TSMC sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAsian chip stocks rallied in early trading Thursday after American AI chip darling Nvidia posted strong third quarter earnings, in a sign that AI bubble concerns aren't slowing down the AI industry.  South Korea's SK Hynix pared gains to rise nearly 2%. The memory chip maker is Nvidia's top supplier of high-bandwidth memory used in AI applications. Samsung Electronics, which also supplies Nvidia with memory, was up more than 5%. The company has been working to catch up to SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory to land more contracts with Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, which produces most of Nvidia's chip designs, rose over 4% in Taipei.  Hon Hai Precision Industry — also known as Foxconn, and manufacturer of server racks designed for AI workloads — climbed 3.28%.The Asian chip giants' rally comes after Nvidia's earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, with the company providing a stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the fourth quarter.Nvidia's sales and outlook are closely watched by the technology industry as a sign of the health of the AI boom, and its earnings come against the backdrop of recent market fears regarding an AI bubble. However, the company's strong results and forecasts should ease immediate AI bubble concerns, Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research, told CNBC.\"Demand is diversified, with AI-native companies deploying agentic AI solutions, and enterprises increasingly integrating AI across their existing products and services,\" Bulk said. \"We expect Nvidia's results to drive higher earnings estimates across the sector, including for its primary GPU supplier TSMC, memory vendors SK Hynix and Samsung, and the broader Asian subcomponent and assembly value chain,\" he added.In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics, a key Nvidia supplier, pared gains to rise 1.51%. Tokyo Electron, which provides essential chipmaking equipment to foundries that manufacture Nvidia's chips, gained 5.67%. Another Japanese chip equipment maker, Lasertec, was up more than 6%. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank skyrocketed nearly 7% at the open and was last trading 2.66%, though the firm recently offloaded its shares of Nvidia. Softbank owns the majority of British semiconductor company Arm, which supplies Nvidia with chip architecture and designs.SoftBank is also involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"— CNBC's Nur Hikmah Md Ali contributed to this story.",

He is the director of the  Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.His spokesman, Steven Goldberg, in a statement Wednesday night said, \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review.\"\"His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester,\" Goldberg said.A Harvard spokesman, in a statement to The Crimson, the student newspaper, said that Harvard is \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"Summers had announced on Monday that he would be stepping back from all public commitments, but that he would continue teaching classes at Harvard. He was mum until Wednesday about remaining on the board of directors at the artificial intelligence startup OpenAI.\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company, and look forward to following their progress,\" Summers said in a statement to CNBC confirming he resignation.OpenAI's board told CNBC it respects Summers' decision to resign.\"We appreciate his many contributions and the perspective he brought to the Board,\" the OpenAI board of directors said in a statement.Details of Summers' correspondence with Epstein were made public last week after the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate. Summers has faced intense scrutiny following the release of those files. Summers joined OpenAI's board in 2023 during a turbulent period for the startup. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was briefly ousted from the company, though he returned to the chief executive role days later. In the wake of \"The Blip,\" as some OpenAI employees call it, Summers was appointed to the board alongside Bret Taylor, former co-CEO of Salesforce, and Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, who was the only member of OpenAI's previous board who still held a seat.Axios was first to report Summers' resignation from the board.

    "body": "Electric vehicles have quicker acceleration than gas cars, and the fastest ones can now reach the highest top speeds in the world. That helped make Tesla one of the strongest brands in the automotive world, and prove EVs were more than golf carts. But sales data and insiders — and even fans — say it isn't enough to sell them to Americans anymore.For a long time, performance was essential to legitimizing EVs to car buyers. It was essential to Tesla's pitch.\"This kind of started when Tesla launched the original Roadster back in 2008,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry Insights. \"At that time people had this impression of EVs: kind of golf carts, you know, not very quick, not very exciting. Tesla decided to use performance to really make the case for electric vehicles, to show, we can build an EV that goes 250 miles on a charge and goes 0 to 60 in four seconds, which by today's standards is kind of slow, but still.\"\"It's gotta be clear,\" Musk said at the 2021 delivery event for the high-performance Tesla Model S Plaid, \"sustainable energy cars can be the fastest cars, can be the safest cars, can be the most kick-ass cars in every way.\"Other automakers have followed suit: trucks that can accelerate in under 3 seconds. Audi's RS e-Tron GT is its quickest production model ever. Even more attainable EVs like the Kia EV6 GT-line can hit 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds - something that once only sports cars can do.EVs have won the battle for acceleration, speed and superior performance, but they aren't cracking 10% of new car sales in the US - about half of the global sales rate. And now that incentives have disappeared and automakers are pulling back on production, insiders say the next battles remain - bring down prices, improve charging and range.Watch the video to learn more.",

Palo Alto guided for revenues between $2.57 billion and $2.59 billion in the second quarter, the midpoint of which was in line with a $2.58 billion estimate. For the full year, the company expects $10.50 billion to $10.54 billion, versus a $10.51 billion estimate. Capital expenditures during the period were much higher than expectations at $84 million. StreetAccount expected $58.1 million. Remaining purchase obligations, which tracks backlog, grew to $15.5 billion and topped a $15.43 billion estimate. The rise of artificial intelligence has also stirred up increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and contributed to tools for customers. The Santa Clara, California-based company has infused AI into its tools and launched automated AI agents to help fend off attacks in October.

    "body": "A sign with the Walmart logo is seen outside of a Walmart store in Selinsgrove. Paul Weaver | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesWalmart raised its sales and earnings outlook Thursday as the retailer posted revenue gains in its fiscal third quarter, driven by double-digit e-commerce growth and new customers across incomes.The retailer said it expects full-year net sales to climb between 4.8% and 5.1%, up from its previous expectations of 3.75% to 4.75%. It said it expects its adjusted earnings per share to range from $2.58 to $2.63, a slight raise from its prior range of $2.52 to $2.62.It marked the second quarter in a row Walmart hiked its full-year forecast. Walmart's earnings report is the first since the Arkansas-based company announced a leadership change. The big-box retailer said last week that John Furner, the CEO of its U.S. business, will succeed longtime CEO Doug McMillon on Feb. 1.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said consumer habits didn't change during the quarter, as shoppers spent selectively and looked for deals. He said Walmart has gained those \"value-seeking\" customers across incomes, both because of the economic backdrop and its own strategic moves.\"Consumers are looking to do business with those companies that are providing value, that are delivering the convenience that they've come to know and expect, and that are executing consistently well,\" he said.watch nowHe said Walmart saw an impact from the pause in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits, formerly known as food stamps, during the prolonged government shutdown. But he said \"that's starting to rebound now that people are receiving those funds again.\"Here is what the big-box retailer reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents adjusted vs. 60 cents expectedRevenue: $179.50 billion vs. $177.43 billion expectedWalmart also said Thursday that it will transfer the listing of its common stock to the Nasdaq and will begin trading there on Dec. 9. It is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It will have the same stock ticker symbol, \"WMT.\"The company's stock fell about 2% in premarket trading Thursday. As of Wednesday's close, shares of Walmart are up about 11% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's nearly 13% gains during the same period. Read moreAs a retail giant that draws shoppers across incomes, Walmart is closely watched as an indication of the health of the U.S. consumer and how President Donald Trump's tariffs are affecting the prices shoppers pay. It can speak to consumer behavior across categories, since it sells discretionary items like makeup and clothes along with necessities like milk and toilet paper.Walmart has gained more high-income customers as even affluent households sought relief from pricier grocery bills due to high inflation in recent years. That cohort also has responded to store remodels and faster deliveries. That growth continued in the most recent quarter, Rainey told CNBC. He said Walmart has gained market share across incomes, but \"they're more pronounced in the upper income segment.\"Some of those shoppers have come to Walmart for speed, Rainey said. The retailer can now deliver to about 95% of U.S. households from stores in under three hours.Customers now expedite about a third of its online orders from stores to arrive in one- or three-hour timeframes, he said. He said revenue related to those faster deliveries has increased 70% year over year. The company charges a fee for some of those faster deliveries and others are included as a benefit of its subscription-based membership program, Walmart+.The service is popular, even with shoppers with lower incomes, he said. During the weeks of November when SNAP benefits were paused, Rainey said Walmart noticed a dip in that volume.In the three-month period that ended Oct. 31, Walmart's net income increased to $6.14 billion, or 77 cents per share, from $4.58 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Excluding one-time items, such as business reorganization charges, Walmart's adjusted earnings per share was 62 cents.Revenue rose from $169.59 billion in the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.5% in the third quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period. That surpassed analysts' expectations of 4% growth, according to StreetAccount. The industry metric, also called same-store sales, includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.At Sam's Club, comparable sales rose 3.8%, excluding fuel. Walmart e-commerce sales grew by 27% globally, as all segments of the company posted sharp gains. In the U.S., e-commerce rose 28%, driven by increases in store-fulfilled delivery of online orders and growth of advertising and its third-party marketplace.E-commerce sales internationally jumped 26% and at Sam's Club in the U.S., they rose 22%.In the U.S., shoppers made more trips to Walmart and spent more on those visits. Customer transactions rose 1.8% and average ticket increased by 2.7%.As Walmart gains more digital traffic and adds more products to its third-party marketplace, advertising has been a meaningful growth area, too. In the quarter, its global advertising business increased by 53%, including Vizio, the smart TV maker it acquired last year for $2.3 billion. Its U.S. advertising business, Walmart Connect, grew 33% year over year. Walmart is mulling another acquisition after it expanded its third-party marketplace rapidly in recent years, as it is in talks to buy R&A Data, a startup that works to curb scams and counterfeits, CNBC reported Wednesday.Like other retailers, Walmart has said it raised prices on some items to offset higher costs from tariffs. About a third of what Walmart sells in the U.S. comes from other parts of the world, with China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam and India representing its largest markets for imports, Rainey told CNBC in May.On a call on Thursday, Rainey said when it comes to higher tariff costs, \"the pressure is real.\" Yet, he said Walmart's team has been able to reduce the impact on customers by finding ways to absorb some costs.Walmart's results on Thursday followed cautious updates from Target, Home Depot and Lowe's. All three of those retailers lowered their full-year profit outlooks this week and referred to consumers who were hesitant to make big purchases and hungry for deals. T.J. Maxx and Marshalls parent company TJX, on the other hand, hiked its full-year forecast, saying it's seeing a \"strong start\" to the holidays as it caters to value-conscious shoppers.Rainey said Walmart is \"going into the holiday pretty optimistic,\" saying it's prepared with competitive price points.",

    "body": "Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, speaks at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, June 13, 2023.Chesnot | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesYann LeCun, known as one of the godfathers of modern artificial intelligence and one of the first AI visionaries to join the company then known as Facebook, is leaving Meta.LuCun said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that he plans to create a startup that specializes in a kind of AI technology that researchers have described as world models, analyzing information beyond web data in order to better represent the physical world and its properties. \"I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond,\" LeCun wrote. \"The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.\"Meta will partner with LeCun's startup.The departure comes at a time of disarray within Meta's AI unit, which was dramatically overhauled this year after the company released the fourth version of its Llama open-source large language model to a disappointing response from developers. That spurred CEO Mark Zuckerberg to spend billions of dollars recruiting top AI talent, including a June $14.5 billion investment in Scale AI to lure the startup's 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang, now Meta's new chief AI officer.LeCun, 65, joined Facebook in 2013 to be director of the FAIR AI research division while maintaining a part-time professorial position at New York University. He said in the LinkedIn post that the \"creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.\"\"I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth, Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years,\" LeCun said. \"Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.\"At the time, Facebook and Google were heavily recruiting high-level academics like LeCun to spearhead their efforts to produce cutting-edge computer science research that could potentially benefit their core businesses and products.LeCun, along with other AI luminaries like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, centered their academic research on a kind of AI technique known as deep learning, which involves the training of enormous software systems called neural networks so they can discover patterns within reams of data. The researchers helped popularize the deep learning approach, and in 2019 won the prestigious Turing Award, presented by the Association for Computing Machinery.Since then, LeCun's approach to AI development has drifted from the direction taken by Meta and the rest of Silicon Valley.Meta and other tech companies like OpenAI have spent billions of dollars in developing so-called foundation models, particularly LLMs, as part of their efforts to advance state-of-the-art computing. However, LeCun and other deep-learning experts, have said that these current AI models, while powerful, have a limited understanding of the world, and new computing architectures are needed for researchers to create software that's on par with or surpasses humans on certain tasks, a notion known as artificial general intelligence.\"As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta's commercial interests, but many of which do not,\" LeCun said in the post. \"Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.\"Besides Wang, other recent notables that Zuckerberg brought in to revamp Meta's AI unit include former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads the unit's product team, and ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao, the group's chief scientist.In October, Meta laid off 600 employees from its Superintelligence Labs division, including some who were part of the FAIR unit that LeCun helped get off the ground. Those layoffs and other cuts to FAIR over the years, coupled with a new AI leadership team, played a major role in LeCun's decision to leave, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.Additionally, LeCun rarely interacted with Wang nor TBD Labs unit, which is comprised of many of the headline-grabbing hires Zuckerberg made over the summer. TBD Labs oversees the development of Meta's Llama AI models, which were originally developed within FAIR, the people said.While LeCun was always a champion of sharing AI research and related technologies to the open-source community, Wang and his team favor a more closed approach amid intense competition from rivals like OpenAI and Google, the people said.WATCH: Meta is a table pounder here.",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk (L) talks with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center on Nov. 19, 2025 in Washington, DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesNvidia and xAI said on Wednesday that a large data center facility being built in Saudi Arabia and equipped with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips will count Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup as its first customer.Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang were both in attendance at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C.The announcement builds on a partnership from May, when Nvidia said it would provide Saudi Arabia's Humain with chips that use 500 megawatts of power. On Wednesday, Humain said the project would include about 600,000 Nvidia graphics processing units. Humain was launched earlier this year and is owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund. The plan to build the data center was initially announced when Huang visited Saudi Arabia alongside President Donald Trump. \"Could you imagine, a startup company approximately 0 billion dollars in revenues, now going to build a data center for Elon,\" Huang said. The facility is one of the most prominent examples of what Nvidia calls \"sovereign AI.\" The chipmaker has said that nations will increasingly need to build data centers for AI in order to protect national security and their culture. It's also a potentially massive market for Nvidia's pricey AI chips beyond a handful of hyperscalers.Huang's appearance at an event supported by President Trump is another sign of the administration's focus on AI. Huang has become friendly with the president as Nvidia lobbies to gain licenses to ship future AI chips to China. When announcing the agreement, Musk, who was a major figure in the early days of the second Trump administration, briefly mixed up the size of the data center, which is measured in megawatts, a unit of power. He joked that plans for a data center that would be 1,000 times larger would have to wait. \"That will be eight bazillion, trillion dollars,\" Musk joked.Humain won't just use Nvidia chips. Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm will also sell chips and AI systems to Humain. AMD CEO Lisa Su and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon both attended a state dinner on Tuesday to honor Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. AMD will provide chips that may require as much as 1 gigawatt of power by 2030. The company said the chips that it would provide are its Instinct MI450 GPUs for AI. Cisco will provide additional infrastructure for the data center, AMD said.Qualcomm will sell Humain its new data center chips that were first revealed in October, called the AI200 and AI250. Humain will deploy 200 megawatts of Qualcomm chips, the company said.WATCH: Qualcomm CEO on new AI chipswatch now",

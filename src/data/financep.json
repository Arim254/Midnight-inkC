    "body": "Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins conducts a news conference with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., in the U.S. Capitol on the government shutdown on Friday, October 31, 2025. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesU.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Tuesday threatened to cut off federal funding to Democratic-leaning states over what she alleged is their refusal to share SNAP program data with the Trump administration.The administration \"will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states\" starting next week \"until they comply,\" Rollins told President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, responding to Rollins in an X post, wrote, \"Genuine question: Why is the Trump Administration so hellbent on people going hungry?\"Rollins said her department needs the state-by-state data on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, \"to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer.\"The secretary said the U.S. Department of Agriculture in February had asked all 50 states \"for the first time to turn over their data to the federal government.\"She said 29 \"red states\" complied, but 21 \"blue states continue to say no.\"The noncompliant states include California, New York and Minnesota, Rollins said. The governors' offices for each of those three states did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment.A USDA spokesperson later specified in a statement to CNBC, \"28 States and Guam joined us in this fight; but states like California, New York, and Minnesota, among 19 other blue States, keep fighting us.\"The department had \"established a SNAP integrity team\" to analyze state data and \"end indiscriminate welfare fraud,\" the spokesperson said.\"We have sent Democrat States yet another request for data, and if they fail to comply, they will be provided with formal warning that USDA will pull their administrative funds.\"Massachusetts has not yet received any notice from the Trump administration about withheld federal funds, Gov. Maura Healy's office told CNBC.But Healey nevertheless called Rollins' threat \"truly appalling and cruel.\"\"The Trump Administration is once again playing politics with the ability of working parents with children, seniors and people with disabilities to get food,\" the governor said in a statement. \"President Trump needs to order Secretary Rollins to release SNAP funding immediately and prevent more Americans from going hungry.\"Marissa Saldivar, a spokeswoman for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, told CNBC, \"We no longer take the Trump Administration's words at face value — we'll see what they actually do in reality.\"Saldivar added: \"Cutting programs that feed American children is morally repugnant.\"Critics have long accused the Trump administration of seeking to weaken food-stamp programs. The Republican-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" which Trump signed into law in July, includes cuts to SNAP. The administration later argued during the government shutdown that it could not pay full SNAP benefits in November because it lacked congressionally appropriated funding to do so. Multiple courts had rejected the administration's efforts to halt those payments.Nearly 42 million people benefited from SNAP each month in fiscal year 2024, most of whom are children, elderly or people with disabilities, according to USDA's official website.Rollins at the Cabinet meeting said SNAP suffers from \"rampant fraud.\" But a fact sheet from the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, citing fiscal year 2023 data, says, \"The majority of SNAP benefits are used as intended.\" Out of nearly 262,000 authorized SNAP retailers, 1,980 were disqualified and 561 were fined in that time period, according to the fact sheet.— CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons contributed to this report.",

Giuseppe Cacace | Afp | Getty ImagesBoeing is continuing to express optimism about its business as the company wraps up the year and looks at 2026.Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said Tuesday at a UBS conference that the company expects deliveries of both its 737 and 787 jets to be up next year.\"When you now fast forward to 2026, we're going to be increasing our deliveries,\" Malave said. Boeing's stock rose more than 10% Tuesday after Malave's comments.He added that he expects the certification for the 737-10 aircraft, which is years behind schedule, to come later in 2026. The bolstered deliveries will be \"a big driver\" of cash flow as well, Malave said, with positive free cash flow expected to be in the billions in the \"low single digits.\" Boeing hasn't turned an annual profit since 2018.Malave also said the company expects that cash margins will get a \"pretty significant boost\" through 2030 due to the higher productivity.Boeing has been experiencing an upward trend after a period of increased scrutiny following the blowout of a door plug on a flight in January 2024. In July, CEO Kelly Ortberg said the company was beginning to see changes in its business, including slashing its quarterly losses. Boeing saw a strong delivery pace in October, putting it on track for its highest annual delivery total since 2018. The company said its jetliner deliveries drove it back into cash-positive territory for the first time in nearly two years in October. Those deliveries follow a lifting of restrictions by the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing the company to sign off on some of its 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner planes before they reach customers.",

The country's GDP expanded 2.1% year on year, marking its strongest expansion since the third quarter of 2023 when the economy expanded at the same rate, data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. GDP missed economists' forecast for a 2.2% growth.  On a quarter-on-quarter basis, Australia's GDP grew 0.4% compared with 0.7% forecast in a Reuters poll. Domestic final demand contributed 1.1 percentage points to growth while net trade was a major drag, denting the economy by 0.1 percentage point, as imports outpaced exports. The economic growth reading came after Reserve Bank of Australia governor Michele Bullock cautioned that the economy had likely already hit its potential growth limit. At the monetary policy meeting last month, the central bank kept its interest rate unchanged at 3.6%, saying it was cautious about easing further, given a strengthening economy, tight labor market and persistent inflationary pressure. Bullock said last month that the current interest rate cutting cycle could be close to an end, with the central bank forecasting inflation to stay above its target range of 2% to 3% until the second half of next year. The RBA's board meets next week and is widely expected to leave interest rates at 3.6%.The country's inflation accelerated in October, rising 3.8% year on year, marking its fastest pace in seven months. In the second quarter this year, Australia's economy expanded 1.8% year on year, compared with 1.3% in the prior quarter, underpinned by domestic spending including household and government consumption.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmerican Eagle issued bullish holiday guidance and raised its full-year forecast on Tuesday after posting better-than-expected quarterly results. The apparel company is expecting fiscal fourth quarter comparable sales to grow between 8% and 9% – about four times better than the 2.1% analysts had anticipated, according to StreetAccount.American Eagle is now expecting its full year adjusted operating income to be between $303 million and $308 million – up from its previous range of $255 million to $265 million. American Eagle shares rose as much as 15% in extended trading.The company beat third-quarter expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how American Eagle did during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 44 cents expectedRevenue: $1.36 billion vs. $1.32 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 1 was $91.34 million, or 53 cents per share, compared with $80.02 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier.  Sales rose to $1.36 billion, up about 6% from $1.29 billion a year earlier.The results are the first time investors are seeing a full quarter of impact from American Eagle's splashy campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Companywide, American Eagle saw comparable sales grow 4%, better than the 2.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. While the business's overall results topped expectations, they were primarily driven by Aerie, which saw comparable sales rise 11% and revenue jump about 13%. At American Eagle, where the campaigns were focused, comparable sales grew just 1%, worse than the 2.1% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company told CNBC the campaigns are \"attracting more customers\" and creating more attention around the brand, but the results show they have not yet been a major revenue driver.However, they're not having a major impact on profits, either. During the quarter, American Eagle's operating margin was 8.3%, better than the 7.5% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Beyond its marketing campaigns, American Eagle told CNBC it saw record revenue in its third quarter and that \"strong momentum\" carried into the current quarter, where it saw a \"record breaking Thanksgiving weekend.\" The rosy holiday commentary comes after peers like Abercrombie & Fitch, Gap and Urban Outfitters posted better than feared results ahead of the crucial holiday shopping season. Investors have been watching discretionary retailers closely to look for slides in consumer demand because of tariffs, but many have proven resilient so far. They're showing that for now, higher prices aren't stopping consumers from shopping, as long as they feel like they're getting good value for their money. Industrywide holiday outlooks from outside consulting firms have been relatively murky, but the latest slate of earnings from discretionary retailers have been a positive omen for holiday sales. Plus, turnout during the so-called Turkey 5 shopping weekend, the five day stretch between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, was stronger than expected, according to the National Retail Federation. ",

    "body": "A person carries shopping bags during Black Friday shopping at Garden State Plaza on November 28, 2025 in Paramus, New Jersey.  Eduardo Munoz Alvarez | Getty ImagesA desire for deep discounts inspired 202.9 million U.S. consumers to shop during the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, according to a survey by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics released on Tuesday.That estimated total surpassed the major trade group's forecast that 186.9 million people would shop during the five-day period. It also increased from last year's turnout of 197 million shoppers during the same period. The shopping turnout is the largest since NRF began tracking the five-day total in 2017, and topped the previous high of 200.4 million shoppers during the same days in 2023. The trade group does not estimate the total amount spent during the extended Thanksgiving weekend.On a call with reporters, NRF CEO Matt Shay described the shopping period as \"the psychological kickoff of the holidays.\" He said the number of shoppers represented \"a very, very solid beginning\" to the season.\"One of the key drivers here is that for many Americans and many families, holiday spending and holiday shopping is an essential part of the budget,\" he said. Even when consumers are pulling back and making trade-offs, they may still shop as December approaches. Shay said the holidays are \"very much an emotional purchase.\" Retailers and economists are closely watching spending during the peak shopping season while trying to make sense of conflicting indicators about the country and U.S. households' outlook. While consumer sentiment has tumbled and a growing number of major companies have laid off thousands of employees, retail sales data remains solid. Even during a time of year that typically brings higher store traffic, retailers have looked for ways to manage one of their top costs: labor. Holiday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, according to the NRF.Despite that, the NRF anticipates U.S. consumers will still spend freely on gifts, decor and more. The trade group said in early November that it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion and $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent a 3.7% to 4.2% increase from the year-ago holiday period. It would be a slight drop from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Shay said the Thanksgiving weekend spending gives the industry group confidence it's on track to hit that projection. At the end of Cyber Monday, shoppers told NRF that they had about 53% of their holiday shopping remaining, which is similar to a year ago. Packages on a conveyor belt at an Amazon fulfillment center on Cyber Monday in Robbinsville, New Jersey, US, on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesConsumers said in the survey that they were motivated to make purchases during the five days because of sales and promotions, such as free shipping and limited-time deals, said Phil Rist, executive vice president at Prosper Insights & Analytics, the research firm that conducts NRF's annual survey. The poll included nearly 3,100 adults and was conducted from Nov. 26 to Nov. 30.Mark Mathews, chief economist for the NRF, said \"there's a moat around this type of spending\" for families across income levels. He said financially stretched households typically cut back in other areas like recreation and travel as they prioritize spending on the holidays. He added that he expects shoppers to fill up bigger shopping baskets this season, including items that aren't for the holidays, because shoppers \"want to take advantage of these great deals that they're seeing.\"Top gifts bought during the five-day span were clothing and accessories, with 51% of consumers surveyed saying they purchased items in the category, followed by toys with 32%, books and other media with 28%. and gift cards with 26%.A total of 129.5 million consumers shopped in stores over the five days, a 3% year-over-year increase, the survey found, even as the more Americans have done more of their Black Friday shopping online in recent years. The online shopping turnout jumped even more — by 9% year over year  — as 134.9 million people shopped on retailers' websites and apps.Other research indicated a step-up in online spending, too. U.S. consumers spent a total of $14.25 billion online on Cyber Monday, a 7.1% year-over-year increase, according to Adobe Analytics. The company analyzes direct transactions online and covers over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million individual items and 18 product categories.  During the five-day stretch from Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday, Adobe said consumers spent $44.2 billion online overall — a 7.7% year-over-year jump. A significant chunk of that came from online spending on Black Friday, which totaled $11.8 billion and grew by 9.1% year over year as shoppers sought out early deals. ",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the premiere of \"The Big Short\" at Ziegfeld Theatre on November 23, 2015 in New York City.Dimitrios Kambouris | Getty ImagesMichael Burry questioned Tesla's valuation as the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame took aim at the practice of technology companies issuing tons of stock-based compensation and excluding it from earnings results.The investor argues that when accounting for the true profits that include the cost of this compensation and its negative dilution of the company's value over time, companies like Tesla should have lower valuations.\"Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,\" Burry, who rose to fame for his call on a housing market bubble in the 2000s, wrote to subscribers of his new paid Substack.Burry pointed out that Tesla dilutes shareholders at a rate of 3.6% each year and doesn't offer buybacks. He posted a chart with subscribers that he said \"shows the kind of present value destruction that this level of dilution can impart.\"He said the vote to accept CEO Elon Musk's $1 trillion compensation plan means investors should expect to get diluted further — meaning that that these additional shares water down their ownership of the company. The package had 75% approval among voting shares, despite proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS coming out against it.\"With recent news of Elon Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package, dilution is certain to continue,\" Burry wrote.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTesla in 2025Tesla's market cap is currently $1.43 trillion. The electric vehicle maker's shares have added more than 6% so far in 2025, while the S&P 500 has surged more than 15% in the same period.Burry noted that moving past dilution \"is not easy\" for businesses. He also pointed to Palantir and Amazon as other well-known technology companies that dilute their shares through employee-based compensation, a practice that Burry said \"penalizes shareholders.\"The newsletter post goes into an in-depth explanation of how stock-based compensation is not accurately reflected under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and how companies used \"adjusted\" earnings to present a bottom line that wrongly ignores the practice as a real expense.Burry quotes Warren Buffett's view of stock-based compensation being treated as something other than a tangible expense: \"What else could it be — a gift from shareholders?\" wrote Buffett in his Berkshire Hathaway 2018 annual letter.Burry launched his Substack called \"Cassandra Unchained\" late last month after deregistering hedge fund Scion Asset Management. The blog, which has a $379 annual subscription fee, has so far focused on why he believes artificial intelligence is a bubble.",

    "body": "Marvell Technology Group Ltd. headquarters in Santa Clara, California, on Sept. 6, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor company Marvell on Tuesday announced that it will acquire Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion in cash and stock.The purchase price could increase to $5.5 billion if Celestial hits revenue milestones, Marvell said. Marvell shares rose 13% in extended trading Tuesday as the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said on the earnings call that it expected data center revenue to rise 25% next year. The deal is an aggressive move for Marvell to acquire complimentary technology to its semiconductor networking business. The addition of Celestial could enable Marvell to sell more chips and parts to companies that are currently committing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure for AI.  Marvell stock is down 18% so far in 2025 even as semiconductor rivals like Broadcom have seen big valuation increases driven by excitement around artificial intelligence.Celestial is a startup focused on developing optical interconnect hardware, which it calls a \"photonic fabric,\" to connect high-performance computers. Celestial was reportedly valued at $2.5 billion in March in a funding round, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the startup's board in January. Optical connections are becoming increasingly important because the most advanced AI systems need those parts tie together dozens or hundreds of chips so they can work as one to train and run the biggest large-language models.Currently, many AI chip connections are done using copper wires, but newer systems are increasingly using optical connections because they can transfer more data faster and enable physically longer cables. Optical connections also cost more. \"This builds on our technology leadership, broadens our addressable market in scale-up connectivity, and accelerates our roadmap to deliver the industry's most complete connectivity platform for AI and cloud customers,\" Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement. Marvell said that the first application of Celestial technology would be to connect a system based on \"large XPUs,\" which are custom AI chips usually made by the companies investing billions in AI infrastructure. On Tuesday, the company said that it could even integrate Celestial's optical technology into custom chips, and based on customer traction, the startup's technology would soon be integrated into custom AI chips and related parts called switches.Amazon Web Services Vice President Dave Brown said in a statement that Marvell's acquisition of Celestial will \"help further accelerate optical scale-up innovation for next-generation AI deployments.\"The maximum payout for the deal will be triggered if Celestial can record $2 billion in cumulative revenue by the end of fiscal 2029. The deal is expected to close early next year. In its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Marvell earnings of 76 cents per share on $2.08 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 73 cents on $2.07 billion in sales. Marvell said that it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be $2.2 billion, slightly higher than LSEG's forecast of $2.18 billion.

    "body": "skynesher | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs, aimed at reshoring American jobs lost to overseas manufacturing, could end up lowering domestic head count instead, according to recent statements from corporate executives and economic forecasters.With the labor market already on its heels in a no-fire, no-hire climate, concerns are rising that the duties on U.S. imports will raise operating costs and force companies to start paring their employment rolls.For instance, respondents to the Institute for Supply Management's November survey of factory conditions expressed elevated levels of worry.\"We are starting to institute more permanent changes due to the tariff environment,\" one transportation equipment executive wrote. \"This includes reduction of staff, new guidance to shareholders, and development of additional offshore manufacturing that would have otherwise been for U.S. export.\"The ISM surveys do not identify respondents by name but rather by industry.watch nowSimilar comments were found elsewhere in report, which showed that the ISM manufacturing index edged further into territory signaling a decline in business conditions. The headline reading of 48.2% represents the share of businesses reporting expansion, so anything below 50% is indicative of contraction.The survey's employment gauge fell 2 points to 44%, its lowest reading since August and consistent with the gradual but persistent trend of labor market softening.There were other signs that the labor picture is darkening heading into 2026.Trump has pushed hard for energy exploration and increased utilization of fossil fuels. But an ISM respondent from the petroleum and coal industry reported, \"No major changes at this time, but going into 2026, we expect to see big changes with cash flow and employee head count. The company has sold off a big part of the business that generated free cash while offering voluntary severance packages to anyone.\"One manager in the electrical equipment, appliances and components business said tariffs are causing a tougher business climate than during the Covid crisis.\"Conditions are more trying than during the coronavirus pandemic in terms of supply chain uncertainty,\" the respondent said.Conflicting signalsTo be sure, broader economic conditions remain fairly stable.Third-quarter gross domestic product is tracking at a 3.9% annualized growth rate, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Moreover, hiring in September was stronger than expected, with nonfarm payrolls up by 119,000, even with signs that major employers are cutting. Amazon, for instance, announced in late October that it was slashing up to 30,000 jobs, joining other large employers announcing cutbacks. A report Tuesday from the 38-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development indicated that tariffs have yet to bite the global economy but warned that the full impact could be still to come.\"The impacts of higher tariff rates are yet to be fully felt in the U.S. economy,\" the report from the Paris-based OECD said. The report noted a \"sharp decrease in the value of U.S. imported goods subject to tariffs\" which \"suggests that tariffs are affecting demand, and will continue to weigh on trade volumes as announced tariffs come into full effect.\"Those kinds of risks set up challenges for the labor market in the year ahead.An economic report from the Federal Reserve last week also noted that employment \"declined slightly\" over the past seven weeks or so, while manufacturers reported that \"tariffs and tariff uncertainty remained a headwind.\"Commentary out of the Cleveland Fed reflected both sides of the tariff coin: \"One large retailer's average costs had increased around 20 percent year-over-year because of tariffs, and it was trying to determine how it would distribute these increases. By contrast, another large retailer did not anticipate further cost increases, stating that tariff impacts had stabilized.\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon's cloud unit on Tuesday announced AI-enabled software designed to help clients better understand and recover from outages. DevOps Agent, as the artificial intelligence tool from Amazon Web Services is called, predicts the cause of technical hiccups using input from third-party tools such as Datadog and Dynatrace. AWS said customers can sign up to use the tool Tuesday in a preview, before Amazon starts charging for the service.The AI outage tool from AWS is intended to help companies more quickly figure out what caused an outage and implement fixes, Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of agentic AI at AWS, told CNBC. It's what site reliability engineers, or SREs, do at many companies that provide online services. SREs try to prevent downtime and jump into action during live incidents. Startups such as Resolve and Traversal have started marketing AI assistants for these experts. Microsoft's Azure cloud group introduced an SRE Agent in May.Rather than waiting for on-call staff members to figure out what happened, the AWS DevOps Agent automatically assigns work to agents that look into different hypotheses, Sivasubramanian said.\"By the time the on-call ops team member dials in, they have an incident report with preliminary investigation of what could be the likely outcome, and then suggest what could be the remediation as well,\" Sivasubramanian told CNBC ahead of AWS' Reinvent conference in Las Vegas this week.Commonwealth Bank of Australia has tested the AWS DevOps Agent. In under 15 minutes, the software found the root cause of an issue that would have taken a veteran engineer hours, AWS said in a statement.The tool relies on Amazon's in-house AI models and those from other providers, a spokesperson said.AWS has been selling software in addition to raw infrastructure for many years. Amazon was early to start renting out server space and storage to developers since the mid-2000s, and technology companies such as Google, Microsoft and Oracle have followed.Since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022, these cloud infrastructure providers have been trying to demonstrate how generative AI models, which are often training in large cloud computing data centers, can speed up work for software developers.Over the summer, Amazon announced Kiro, a so-called vibe coding tool that produces and modifies source code based on user text prompts. In November, Google debuted similar software for individual software developers called Antigravity, and Microsoft sells subscriptions to GitHub Copilot.WATCH: Amazon rolls out AI-powered tools to help big AWS customers update old softwarewatch now",

    "body": "watch nowSam Altman is feeling the pressure.The OpenAI CEO sent a memo to his staffers on Monday outlining a \"code red\" effort to improve its chatbot ChatGPT, according to multiple reports. Altman said OpenAI will be pulling back on investments in areas like health, shopping and advertising as it works to prioritize ChatGPT, the reports said.OpenAI declined to comment on Tuesday.\"Our focus now is to keep making ChatGPT more capable, continue growing, and expand access around the world — while making it feel even more intuitive and personal,\" Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, wrote in a post Monday on X.The Information was first to report on the memo.More than 800 million people use ChatGPT each week, but the company is facing increasingly stiff competition from rivals like Google and Anthropic.Google announced its latest artificial intelligence model, Gemini 3, last month, which topped industry benchmarks and was widely lauded by users, researchers and developers across social media.The company said its Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users while AI Overviews, which appear at the top of search results, have 2 billion monthly users.Altman congratulated Google on the launch, writing in a post on X last month that Gemini 3 \"looks like a great model.\"Read more CNBC tech newsFormer cyber spy raises $60 million to fight AI threatsYouTube's new AI deepfake tracking tool is alarming experts and creatorsApple names former Microsoft, Google exec to succeed retiring AI chiefInstagram orders employees back to the office 5 days a weekAnthropic, meanwhile, has shown strong momentum with enterprises.As of September, the startup said it has more than 300,000 business customers, up from less than 1,000 just two years ago. Large accounts, which Anthropic defines as customers that each represent more than $100,000 in run-rate revenue, grew more than seven times in the past year, the company said.OpenAI launched as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has quickly become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of ChatGPT three years ago. The company's valuation has swelled to $500 billion as it's worked to deploy its technology around the globe. In recent months, OpenAI has made more $1.4 trillion in infrastructure commitments in a deal-making blitz. The staggering sum has raised eyebrows and prompted questions about how the company will be able to afford those commitments. Altman has repeatedly brushed off concerns. Last month, OpenAI said it is on track to reach more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030. In a lengthy post on X in November, Altman said large infrastructure projects take time to build, which is why the company needed to start now. \"This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,\" Altman wrote. Weeks later, Altman seems to be feeling the heat.

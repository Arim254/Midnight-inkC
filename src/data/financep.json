    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday suggested the central bank is nearing a point where it will stop reducing the size of its bond holdings, and provided a few hints that more interest rate cuts are in the cards.Speaking to the National Association for Business Economics conference in Philadelphia, Powell provided a dissertation on where the Fed stands with \"quantitative tightening,\" or the effort to reduce the more than $6 trillion of securities it holds on its balance sheet.While he provided no specific date of when the program will cease, he said there are indications the Fed is nearing its goal of \"ample\" reserves available for banks.\"Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions,\" Powell said in prepared remarks. \"We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision.\"On interest rates, the central bank chief did not provide specific guidance on a path lower, but comments about weakness in the labor market indicated that easing is firmly on the table, as financial markets expect.\"If we move too quickly, then we may leave the inflation job unfinished and have to come back later and finish it. If we move too slowly, there may be unnecessary losses, painful losses, in the employment market. So we're in the difficult situation of balancing those two things,\" he said.\"The data we got right after the July meeting showed that ... that the labor market has actually softened pretty considerably, and puts us in a situation where the two risks are closer to being in balance,\" Powell added.Other Fed officials have said recently that the falling labor market is taking precedence in their thinking, leading to the likelihood of additional rate cuts ahead.Balance sheet mathPowell, though, centered most of his speech on the Fed's holdings of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Though balance sheet questions are in the weeds for monetary policy, they matter to financial markets.When financial conditions are tight, the Fed aims for \"abundant\" reserves so that banks have access to liquidity and can keep the economy running. As conditions change, the Fed aims for \"ample\" reserves, a step down that prevents too much capital from sloshing around the system.During the Covid pandemic, the central bank had aggressively purchased Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, swelling the balance sheet to close to $9 trillion.Since mid-2022, the Fed has been gradually allowing maturing proceeds of those securities to roll off the balance sheet, effectively tightening one leg of monetary policy. The question had been how far the Fed needed to go, and Powell's comments indicate that the end is close.He noted that \"some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are gradually tightening\" and could be signaling that reducing reserves further would hinder growth. However, he also said the Fed has no plans to go back to its pre-Covid balance sheet size, which was closer to $4 trillion.On a related matter, Powell noted concerns over the Fed continuing to pay interest on bank reserves.The Fed normally remits interest it earns from its holdings to the Treasury general fund. However, because it had to raise interest rates so quickly to control inflation, it has seen operating losses. Congressional leaders such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, have suggested terminating the payments on reserves.However, Powell said that would be a mistake and would hinder the Fed's ability to carry out policy.\"While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history,\" he said. \"If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates.\"Views on the economyOn the larger issue of interest rates, Powell generally stuck to the recent script, namely that policymakers are concerned that the labor market is tightening and skewing the balance of risks between employment and inflation.\"While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation,\" he said. \"In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen.\"Powell noted that the Federal Open Market Committee responded in September to the situation with a quarter percentage point reduction on the federal funds rate. While markets strongly expect two more cuts this year, and several Fed officials recently have endorsed that view, Powell was noncommittal.\"There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" he said.The Fed has been hampered somewhat by the government shutdown and the impact it has had on economic data releases. Policymakers rely on metrics like the nonfarm payrolls report, retail sales and various price indexes to make their decisions.Powell said the Fed is continuing to analyze conditions based on the data that is available.\"Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago,\" Powell said. \"Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected.\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has said it has called workers back to prepare the monthly consumer price index report, which will be released next week.Powell said available data has showed that goods prices have increased, largely a function of tariffs rather than underlying inflation pressures.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, chief executive officer of OpenAI Inc., during a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, US, on Tuesday, Sept. 23, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAdult ChatGPT users can soon access a less censored version of the artificial intelligence chatbot, which will include erotic materials, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has announced in an apparent policy shift.\"In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our 'treat adult users like adults' principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,\" Altman said in a social media post on Tuesday. Though it remains unclear what content will qualify as permitted erotica, the move could represent a major shift in OpenAI's policy, which formerly prohibited such content in most contexts.According to Altman, current versions of ChatGPT were made \"pretty restrictive\" to protect users from mental health risks, but that approach made the chatbot \"less useful [and enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems. \"Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases,\" he said.The \"new tools\" appear to refer to safety features and parental controls rolled out last month to address concerns over how the chatbot was impacting young users' mental health. However, as safeguards for minors expand, it appears that Altman is ready for ChatGPT to take a looser approach for adults. Besides the rollout in December, Altman also said a new version of ChatGPT will launch in the coming weeks, allowing the chatbot to adopt more distinct personalities — building on updates in the latest GPT‑4o version.\"If you want your ChatGPT to respond in a very human-like way, or use a ton of emoji, or act like a friend, ChatGPT should do it,\" he said. \"But only if you want it.\"Growth vs. safety Altman's latest post drew attention because he previously suggested ChatGPT wouldn't implement sexualized chat features, unlike rival models such as XAI's Grok. In an August interview, independent tech journalist Cleo Abram asked Altman to give an example of a decision he had made that was best for the world, but not for winning the AI race. \"Well, we haven't put a sex bot avatar in ChatGPT yet,\" Altman said in an apparent nod to provocative AI companions released by Elon Musk's xAI. Altman's remarks come as OpenAI faces greater scrutiny of its safety policies. In September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into several tech companies, including OpenAI, over potential risks to children and teenagers.That followed a lawsuit from a California couple who alleged that ChatGPT contributed to their 16-year-old son's suicide.OpenAI on Tuesday also announced an eight-member expert council on well-being and AI to advise the company on how artificial intelligence affects users' mental health, emotions and motivation. The council will guide OpenAI in defining what healthy AI interactions look like through check-ins and recurring meetings, the company said.",

Violeta Santos Moura | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused China of trying to weaken the global economy by slapping export controls on resources vital for technology.In an interview with the Financial Times, Bessent said the moves over rare earths and minerals are an attempt by China \"to pull everyone else down with them.\"\"If they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most,\" he said.The move by China comes just ahead of a scheduled meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping. In an Oct. 9 announcement Beijing said it won't allow the export of rare earths materials for military use, the first time it has targeted that specific use. The U.S. uses rare earths magnets for many of its most important weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Tomahawk missiles and smart bombs.Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 and has threatened to cancel the meeting with Xi. Markets have been volatile since the dispute escalated, with Wall Street stock averages down sharply to start the day Tuesday.\"They are in the middle of a recession/depression, and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they're exacerbating their standing in the world,\" Bessent told the FT.",

But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week,  saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.\"We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains,\" the U.S. trade representative said.Trump, Xi scheduled to meetThe restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea.Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops.\"Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese,\" Greer said of the meeting. \"But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can.\"U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said.\"We think we'll be able to work through it,\" Greer said of the trade dispute.'We want to work with the Chinese'The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. The White House watches the market, Greer said, but the administration is focused on building long-term economic success by bringing supply chains back to the U.S., and reducing dependence on China.\"We want to make sure that the market is also responding to appropriate information,\" Greer said. \"You've seen the market settle out this week as they realize that the president and his team, we want to work with the Chinese.\"Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications.China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency.

That's like 14 years,\" Dimon told CNBC on a call with reporters.\"These are early signs there might be some excess out there because of it,\" Dimon said. \"If we ever have a downturn, you're going to see quite a bit more credit issues.\"Dimon used more colorful language about the Tricolor failure later Tuesday.\"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more,\" Dimon told analyst Mike Mayo during the bank's earnings conference call. \"Everyone should be forewarned on this one.\"The pair of bankruptcies have sparked concerns about the hidden risks involved when banks like JPMorgan, Jefferies and Fifth Third provide financing for private companies. In a quarter where JPMorgan handily topped expectations, thanks to booming activity in institutional trading, questions from reporters and analysts around credit losses took center stage.'Not our finest moment'While JPMorgan managed to dodge losses from First Brands, it did lend to Tricolor, causing $170 million in charge-offs in the quarter, said CFO Jeremy Barnum. Charge-offs happen when a bank recognizes it won't get repaid for loans it made.\"It is not our finest moment,\" Dimon said of the Tricolor episode. \"When something like that happens, you could assume that we scour every issue. ... You can never completely avoid these things, but the discipline is to look at it in cold light and go through every single little thing.\"The credit metrics watched by JPMorgan, including early stage delinquencies, are stable and actually better than expected, Barnum said. The company is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness that could flow into consumer credit, which hasn't happened yet, he said.The automotive company failures, which came amid pressure on international supply chains due in part to President Donald Trump's tariff escalations, have ensnared a constellation of banks.This month, the investment bank Jefferies said that funds it runs are owed $715 million from companies that bought First Brand inventory, while UBS said that its funds had about $500 million in exposure.Last month, regional bank Fifth Third disclosed that it expected up to $200 million in impairments from alleged fraudulent activity at a borrower; the client was Tricolor, Bloomberg reported.",

In other words, it can explain why well-off Americans are continuing to spend while lower earners buckle under inflationary pressures.\"Survey results indicated a notable bifurcation,\" JPMorgan's Matthew Boss, a widely followed and respected consumer analyst, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10, underscoring their rosy financial outlook.On the other hand, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Less than a quarter of participants in this category provided a score between 7 and 10, which Boss pointed out creates a 30-point delta between these groups.Across income brackets, the average respondent rated their confidence at a 4.9 out of 10 rating.This income-based division was once again prevalent when consumers were asked about their confidence for covering monthly bills compared with six to 12 months ago.Nearly 6 of 10 high-income consumers said these bills were easier or becoming easier to cover. But just 37% and 30% of middle- and lower-income groups, respectively, said the same.Higher-income respondents were also more likely to say they were planning to increase spending on nonessential items over the next year than other brackets, according to JPMorgan's survey.JPMorgan isn't the only organization seeing a disparity between income classes when it comes to their economic outlook.The top one-third of earners have reported an average consumer sentiment rating that's around 25% higher than the lowest one-third over the last two years, according to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer survey. The Michigan survey's most recent results reflect interviews conducted July 29-Aug. 25 of a statistically representative sample of about 1,000 American households.",

    "body": "Pedestrians pass a Huawei Technologies Co. flagship store in Shenzhen, China, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's consumer prices fell more than expected in September, while the deflation in producer prices persisted, underscoring the impact of sluggish domestic demand and trade worries on consumer and business sentiment.The consumer price index fell 0.3% in September from a year earlier, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, a sharper decline than economists' forecast of 0.2% slide, although easing from the 0.4% drop in August.Prices ticked up 0.1% month-on-month, a smaller than expected recovery compared to economists' forecast for 0.2% increase.Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.0% from a year earlier, the highest since February 2024, according to data from Wind Information.Despite the \"positive sign\" of improvement in the core CPI, \"trade tension returned and growth outlook uncertainty heightened, which is negative for demand recovery,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist, at Pinpoint Asset Management.\"It is too early to conclude that the deflationary pressure is fading at this stage,\" Zhang added.China's producer price index dropped 2.3% from a year ago, in line with economists' forecast, official data showed. The deflation, however, eased for a second month, with price declines narrowing from 2.9% in August and 3.6% in July. The producer price downturn has persisted for almost three years, hurting profitability of manufacturers who have weathered tepid consumer confidence and production disruption stemming from U.S. trade policies.Weak consumer demand has weighed on China's economy that's struggling from a prolonged housing downturn, while U.S. tariffs have pressured exports.While China's overall exports have grown this year, U.S.-bound shipments have seen double-digit declines since April. If U.S. President Donald Trump follows through on this threat of an additional 100% tariffs, levies on Chinese exports to America will jump to around 155%.watch nowDong Lijun, NBS spokesperson, attributed the decline in CPI to \"tail effect,\" or impact from the higher price level last year, saying that excluding the \"tail effect,\" consumer prices rose 0.5% from a year ago.Among the categories that saw the biggest declines were food and energy, which saw prices fall 4.4% and 2.7%, respectively.Industrial consumer goods, most notably gold and platinum jewelry prices soared 42.1% and 33.6% on the back of a global gold rush, Dong said.Costs for accommodations and air tickets fell 1.5% and 1.7%, respectively, in September, as hotel owners, flight carriers and travel agencies suffered a bruising price war, vying for orders ahead of the eight-day Golden Week holiday that stretched from Oct. 1 to 8.The latest economic prints served as \"a stark reminder of the significant structural challenges that China must overcome to rebalance its economy,\" said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at Ankura Consulting's GreenPoint Business, citing softening demand, persistent overcapacity and intense price competition.These are \"putting business resilience to the test like never before,\" added Montufar-Helu.Reining in price warsChinese government has intensified efforts this year to curb excessive price competition across industries, including taking steps to rein in industrial capacity, even warning that it could shutter plants whose output exceeds mandated levels. watch nowThose efforts are beginning to yield results: Industrial profits soared 20.4% in August from a year earlier, reversing three months of consecutive declines.NBS' Dong pointed to the narrowing declines in factory-gate prices as a result of China's policies that have curbed overcapacity in certain industrial sectors and the \"continuous optimization in market order.\"Industrial sectors such as coal processing and mining, ferrous metal smelting and rolling, photovoltaic equipment and battery manufacturing saw price declines ease significantly, the Dong said. While there are some signs of easing, September data shows deflation remains entrenched.Due to the relatively weak demand, these measures are unlikely to lead to any \"immediate pickup\" in CPI, said Tianzeng Xu, an economist at Economist Intelligence Unit, and the stabilization in CPI is still \"fragile and volatile,\" especially since the housing market has yet recovered and the labor market remains weak.— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this story.",

Roberto Schmidt | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration is considering \"terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil\" in retaliation for Beijing refusing to buy U.S. soybeans.China is committing an \"Economically Hostile Act\" by \"purposefully not buying our Soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.Ending business with China on cooking oil and \"other elements of Trade\" are possible forms of \"retribution\" that Trump said he was weighing.\"As an example, we can easily produce Cooking Oil ourselves, we don't need to purchase it from China,\" he wrote.China has been the top buyer of U.S. soybeans by far, importing some 27 million metric tons valued at nearly $12.8 billion in 2024 alone.But amid a simmering trade war with the Trump administration, Beijing has not bought a single American soybean since May.With retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods making soybeans pricier for Chinese importers, China has been sourcing the crop instead from producers in South America.One of those suppliers is Argentina, which reportedly suspended export taxes on the same day that the Trump administration first pledged to bolster the country's economy with a $20 billion currency swap.Argentina President Javier Milei visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday, hours before the U.S. leader issued his latest salvo against China.Meanwhile, China's exports of used cooking oil hit record highs in 2024, with the U.S. accounting for 43% of the total.Trump's social media post follows a recent spate of critical remarks he has made about China, raising questions about the status of ongoing trade talks and sending stocks careening up and down.The S&P 500 stock index fell immediately after Trump's post, ending the trading day in the red after a volatile session.Stocks tanked on Friday after Trump threatened to massively increase tariffs on Chinese imports in retaliation for new export controls that China imposed on rare earth minerals. Later that day, Trump said he would impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting on Nov. 1.But on Sunday, Trump appeared to soften his attack, writing, \"Don't worry about China, it will all be fine!\"Stocks broadly rebounded on Monday.",

Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. air traffic controllers have received partial paychecks, their union said Tuesday, and they could miss their next paychecks altogether if the government shutdown lasts another two weeks.\"The job is stressful enough as it is. Now you're adding this factor of, 'Hey, when am I going to get this next paycheck?'\" said Raymond Dahlstrom, an air traffic controller.Dahlstrom and some of his colleagues handed out leaflets outside of LaGuardia Airport in New York on Tuesday to urge the public to ask lawmakers to end the shutdown. Air traffic controllers were also scheduled to hand out informational pamphlets at other airports in Washington, D.C., and Chicago on Tuesday.The government shut down on Oct. 1, as the Senate has failed to pass a bill to fund the government. Air traffic controllers and airport security screeners are among the thousands of government employees who are required to work despite not getting paid during the impasse.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flightsLast week, shortages of air traffic controllers caused delays at airports, including in Nashville, Tennessee, and Burbank, California, though most facilities were sufficiently staffed.\"We're still showing up, nobody is calling out sick … other than they're sick,\" Dahlstrom said. He said some controllers are taking second jobs like driving for ride-hailing companies to help make ends meet while they're going without pay.A more-than-monthlong shutdown starting in late 2018 ended hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area.Even outside of the shutdown, the U.S. has been dealing with a shortage of trained air traffic controllers, which has periodically disrupted flights. Airline executives have pushed for more training initiatives and more modern technology for years.But the government shutdown has also put additional focus on U.S. aviation.Some airports including Las Vegas, the three major New York City airports and others are refusing to air a video of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that blames the shutdown on Democrats, airport officials told CNBC on Tuesday.",

    "body": "watch nowChina's sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports threaten the U.S. defense industry, providing President Xi Jinping with powerful leverage over President Donald Trump in upcoming trade talks.Beijing will not allow the export of rare earth materials for use by foreign militaries, China's Ministry of Commerce announced on Oct. 9. These are the first restrictions imposed by China that specifically target the defense sector, according to Gracelin Baskaran, a critical minerals expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\"What this essentially means is that it will deny licenses to foreign militaries and companies that are producing military use end goods,\" Baskaran told CNBC. \"It undermines the development of the defense industrial base at a time when there is rising global tension. It is a very powerful negotiating tactic because it undermines national security.\"Rare earth magnets are crucial components in U.S. weapons systems such as the F-35 warplane, Virginia and Columbia class submarines, Predator drones, Tomahawk missiles, radar, and the joint direct attack munition series of smart bombs, according to the Department of Defense.China dominates the global supply chain for rare earths. It controls 60% of mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for around 70% of its rare earth imports, according the U.S. Geological Survey.\"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earths strategic reserve, that we let China monopolize 90% of the refining of rare earth materials,\" Jeremy Siegel, University of Pennsylvania professor emeritus of finance, told CNBC on Monday. \"Where were we?\"'Massively disruptive'Beijing also imposed broad controls that require foreign companies to obtain an export license if rare earths processed in China make up as little as 0.1% of their products' value. Firms will also need licenses for products that rely on Chinese rare earth technology for mining, smelting, separation, magnet manufacturing and recycling.\"If these rules were to be strictly and indefinitely enforced, they would be massively disruptive, not just to the US but globally,\" Wolfe Research analyst Tobin Marcus told clients in an Oct. 10 note. Rare earths are also crucial inputs for the semiconductor and automobile industries.The restrictions would impact every sector of the U.S. economy but the defense, semiconductor and electric vehicle industries would face the brunt, according to Alicia Garcia Herrero, an economist at French investment bank Natixis. Defense contractors, Apple, Nvidia, Intel, Tesla, Ford and GM are all highly exposed, Hererro told clients in a Monday note.The Trump administration is working to build out a domestic supply chain. The Defense Department struck an unprecedented deal with the largest U.S. rare earth miner MP Materials in July that included an equity stake, price floors and an offtake agreement.\"This will certainly also further accelerate US efforts to develop our own rare earth resources,\" Marcus said. U.S. rare earth stocks have surged as investors speculate that the Trump administration will strike deals with other miners.Standoff in South KoreaThe restrictions threaten to reignite the trade war between China and the U.S. after months of relative calm.Trump has responded with 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1. The huge import taxes would come on top of the 44% tariff rate already in place on China, effectively cutting off trade between the world's two largest economies, according to Wolfe Research.\"It wouldn't take much re-escalation to get us back to the quasi-embargo situation that prevailed in the spring,\" Marcus told clients.The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value Friday after Trump threatened massive tariffs against China, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The S&P 500 rallied Monday to regain more than half of Friday's losses after Trump appeared to de-escalate, saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.Trump and Xi are still expected to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul, South Korea, later this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business on Monday.The most likely scenario is \"both sides pull back on the most aggressive policies and that talks lead to a further—and possibly indefinite—extension of the tariff escalation pause reached in May,\" Goldman Sachs told clients Sunday.But Beijing's strategy is unclear and the tariff deadline is just weeks away, raising the risk that an agreement might not be struck in time, Marcus said.\"Without more conviction about Beijing's strategy here, we're concerned that they won't be willing to back down fast enough to prevent these 100% tariffs from kicking in, at least temporarily,\" the analyst said.",

Kent Nishimura | Getty ImagesMajor U.S. airports from New York to Florida to Nevada are refusing to air a video showing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats in Congress for the ongoing federal government shutdown.Some of those airports cited the political nature of Noem's message for not showing the video, saying that it violated their policies.The Transportation Security Administration sent requests to airports nationwide to air the video on screens near passenger screening lines.Noem, in the video, says, \"It is TSA's top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience as possible while we keep you safe,\" according to MSNBC.\"However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay,\" says Noem, whose department oversees the TSA.Noem's message is consistent with comments by President Donald Trump and other top administration officials, who since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 have blamed congressional Democrats for not joining Republicans to pass a stopgap funding bill to resume normal government operations.Democrats refuse to budge on their demand that any funding deal extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of this year. Republicans, in turn, refuse to include that provision.Air traffic controllers resume operations a day after Hollywood Burbank Airport operated for hours without a staffed control tower due to staffing shortages amid the U.S. government shutdown, in Burbank, California, U.S., Oct. 7, 2025.Daniel Cole | ReutersThe airports that refused to show Noem's video include the three major airports in the New York City area: John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in Queens, and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.\"The Port Authority's longstanding policies prevent airing of politically partisan messages at our facilities, so airports are not airing the video on airport-controlled screens,\" said a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates those three airports.The Chicago Department of Aviation, which operates O'Hare International Airport and Chicago Midway International Airport, also declined DHS's request.\"Advertising at Chicago's airports, including promotional materials and public service announcements, must comply with CDA's Advertising Guidelines, which prohibit content that endorses or opposes any named political party,\" the department said in an email. \"These guidelines help ensure the airports remain welcoming and neutral spaces for all travelers.\"Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Portland International Airport in Oregon also refused to show the video.The Portland airport \"did not consent to playing the video in its current form, as we believe the Hatch Act clearly prohibits use of public assets for political purposes and messaging,\" Molly Prescott, aviation communications manager for the Port of Portland, which operates the airport, told CNBC by email.The Hatch Act prohibits certain political activities by federal government employees and aims to protect federal employees from political coercion at work.\"Additionally, Oregon law states no public employee can promote or oppose any political committee, party, or affiliation,\" Prescott said. \" We believe consenting to playing this video on Port assets would violate Oregon law.\"A spokesman for Miami International Airport said it is not playing the new Noem video but instead, an older one informing travelers about Real IDs, \"to be consistent with Miami-Dade County policy regarding messaging within\" the airport. Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport isn't showing the video \"as our advertising policy does not permit political messaging to be displayed in our facility,\" a spokeswoman told CNBC.A spokesperson for Charlotte Douglas International Airport said that showing the video would violate local laws and airport policies.\"Additionally, TSA does not own any monitors at the airport's checkpoints,\" the Charlotte airport spokesperson said. \"The limited digital screens owned by CLT are designated for static content that supports wayfinding, provides essential travel information and promotes CLT's revenue-generating services.\"Spokespeople for Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas said those facilities declined to post the video because of policies barring political content.A spokesperson for the Las Vegas airport said that \"as a facility that hosts federal operations, we remain mindful of the Hatch Act's restrictions on political activity in government workplaces.\"Cleveland Hopkins International Airport has reportedly refused to show Noem's video.CNBC reached out to various airports across the U.S. seeking comment on whether they are airing the video.A representative for the Detroit Metro Airport said that Noem's video is being shown on monitors in TSA-leased areas.A spokesperson for Austin–Bergstrom International Airport said the TSA checkpoints at the airport are not equipped with video monitors, so they are unable to show any video or digital content.In a statement to CNBC, Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary, reiterated comments that Noem made on the video.\"While this creates challenges for our people, our security operations remain largely unimpacted at this time,\" McLaughlin added. \"It's unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,\" she said.\"Our hope is that Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.\"A shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown has caused flight delays and disruptions, CNBC reported last week.On Friday, airlines told travelers to brace for delays over the Columbus Day holiday weekend due to staffing shortages.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar

January 2019, hours after a shortfall of air traffic controllers disrupted flights in the New York area.Before that, some airport security checkpoints were closed due to elevated sick calls from Transportation Security Administration screeners who are also working without pay.On Tuesday, air traffic controllers received their first partial paycheck. If the shutdown continues, they will miss a full paycheck on Oct. 28.Controllers handed out pamphlets at airports in New York, Washington, D.C., and Chicagoon Tuesday to urge the public to press lawmakers to end the shutdown.",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase on Tuesday topped analysts' estimates for the third quarter as trading and investment banking generated about $700 million more revenue than expected.Here's what the company reported:Earnings per share: $5.07 vs. expected $4.84, according to LSEGRevenue: $47.12 billion vs. expected $45.4 billion, according to LSEGThe bank said in a release that profit jumped 12% to $14.39 billion, or $5.07 per share, from a year earlier. Revenue rose 9% to $47.12 billion.So far this year, the biggest American banks have benefited under the administration of President Donald Trump.They've reaped higher trading revenue as upheaval from his policies has roiled markets around the world, forcing investors to reposition themselves. JPMorgan's trading haul of $8.9 billion was a record for a third quarter, CEO Jamie Dimon said in the release.Investment bankers are busier thanks to a more relaxed stance toward mergers, and Trump's bank regulators have proposed ways to ease capital requirements and stress tests. Stock market indexes that are at or near record levels have helped the wealth management divisions of banks including JPMorgan.Fixed income trading at JPMorgan jumped 21% in the quarter to $5.6 billion, about $300 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.Equity trading surged 33% to $3.3 billion, also roughly $300 million more than expected.Investment banking fees jumped 16% to $2.6 billion, edging out the $2.5 billion StreetAccount estimate.Dimon said that while each of his major business lines performed well against a good economic backdrop, he was preparing the firm for possible turbulence ahead.\"While there have been some signs of a softening, particularly in job growth, the U.S. economy generally remained resilient,\" Dimon said.\"However, there continues to be a heightened degree of uncertainty stemming from complex geopolitical conditions, tariffs and trade uncertainty, elevated asset prices and the risk of sticky inflation,\" Dimon said. \"As always, we hope for the best, but these complex forces reinforce why we prepare the firm for a wide range of scenarios.\"JPMorgan's provision for credit losses rose 9% to $3.4 billion, exceeding the $3.08 billion estimate, indicating that the firm is preparing for higher loan defaults down the road.Big banks have outperformed regional lenders so far this year; the KBW Bank Index has climbed nearly 15%, while the KBW Regional Banking Index has dropped roughly 1%.Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also reported earnings Tuesday, with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley releasing results Wednesday.This story is developing.

    "body": "watch nowSam Altman didn't set out to compete with Nvidia.OpenAI began with a simple bet that better ideas, not better infrastructure, would unlock artificial general intelligence. But that view shifted years ago, as Altman realized that more compute, or processing power, meant more capability — and ultimately, more dominance.On Monday morning, he unveiled his latest blockbuster deal, one that moves OpenAI squarely into the chipmaking business and further into competition with the hyperscalers.OpenAI is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop racks of custom AI accelerators, purpose-built for its own models. It's a big shift for a company that once believed intelligence would come from smarter algorithms, not bigger machines.\"In 2017, the thing that we found was that we were getting the best results out of scale,\" the OpenAI CEO said in a company podcast on Monday. \"It wasn't something we set out to prove. It was something we really discovered empirically because of everything else that didn't work nearly as well.\"That insight — that the key was scale, not cleverness — fundamentally reshaped OpenAI.Now, the company is expanding that logic even further, teaming up with Broadcom to design and deploy racks of custom silicon optimized for OpenAI's workloads.The deal gives OpenAI deeper control over its stack, from training frontier models to owning the infrastructure, distribution, and developer ecosystem that turns those models into lasting platforms.Altman's rapid series of deals and product launches is assembling a complete AI ecosystem, much like Apple did for smartphones and Microsoft did for PCs, with infrastructure, hardware, and developers at its core.watch nowHardwareThrough its partnership with Broadcom, OpenAI is co-developing custom AI accelerators, optimized for inference and tailored specifically to its own models.Unlike Nvidia and AMD chips, which are designed for broader commercial use, the new silicon is built for vertically integrated systems, tightly coupling compute, memory, and networking into full rack-level infrastructure. OpenAI plans to begin deploying them in late 2026.The Broadcom deal is similar to what Apple did with its M-series chips: control the semiconductors, control the experience.But OpenAI is going even further and engineering every layer of the hardware stack, not just the chip.The Broadcom systems are built on its Ethernet stack and designed to accelerate OpenAI's core workloads, giving the company a physical advantage that's deeply entangled with its software edge.At the same time, OpenAI is pushing into consumer hardware, a rare move for a model-first company.Its $6.4 billion all-stock acquisition of Jony Ive's startup, io, brought the legendary Apple designer into its inner circle. It was a sign that OpenAI doesn't just want to power AI experiences, it wants to own them.Ive and his team are exploring a new class of AI-native devices designed to reshape how people interact with intelligence, moving beyond screens and keyboards toward more intuitive, engaging experiences.Reports of early concepts include a screenless, wearable device that uses voice input and subtle haptics, envisioned more as an ambient companion than a traditional gadget.OpenAI's twin bet on custom silicon and emotionally resonant consumer hardware adds two more powerful branches over which it has direct control.watch nowBlockbuster dealsOpenAI's chips, datacenters and power fold into one coordinated campaign called Stargate that provides the physical backbone of AI.In the past three weeks, that campaign has gone into overdrive with several major deals:OpenAI and Nvidia have agreed to a framework for deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems, backed by a proposed $100 billion investment.AMD will supply OpenAI with multiple generations of its Instinct GPUs under a 6-gigawatt deal. OpenAI can acquire up to 10% of AMD if certain deployment milestones are met.Broadcom's custom inference chips and racks are slated to begin deployment in late 2026, as part of Stargate's first 10‑gigawatt phase.Taken together, it is OpenAI's push to root the future of AI in infrastructure it can call its own.\"We are able to think from etching the transistors all the way up to the token that comes out when you ask ChatGPT a question, and design the whole system,\" Altman said. \"We can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models — all of that.\"Whether or not OpenAI can deliver on every promise, the scale and speed of Stargate is already reshaping the market, adding hundreds of billions in market cap for its partners, and establishing OpenAI as the de facto market leader in AI infrastructure.None of its rivals appears able to match the pace or ambition. And that perception alone is proving a powerful advantage.DevelopersOpenAI's DevDay made it clear that the company isn't just focused on building the best models — it's betting on the people who build with them.\"OpenAI is trying to compete on several fronts,\" said Gil Luria, Head of Technology Research at D.A. Davidson, pointing to its frontier model, consumer-facing chat product, and enterprise API platform. \"It is competing with some combination of all the large technology companies in one or more of these markets.\"Developer Day, he said, was aimed at helping companies incorporate OpenAI models into their own tools.\"The tools they presented were very impressive — OpenAI has been terrific at commercializing their products in a compelling and easy-to-use manner,\" he added. \"Having said that, they are fighting an uphill battle, since the companies they are competing with have significantly more resources — at least for now.\"The main competition, Luria said, is primarily Microsoft Azure, AWS and Google Cloud.Developer Day signaled just how aggressively OpenAI is leaning in.The company rolled out AgentKit for developers, new API bundles for enterprise, and a new App Store that offers direct distribution inside ChatGPT — which now reaches 800 million weekly active users, according to OpenAI.\"It's the Apple playbook: own the ecosystem and become a platform,\" said Menlo Ventures partner Deedy Das.watch nowUntil now, most companies treated OpenAI as a tool in their stack. But with new features for publishing, monetizing, and deploying apps directly inside ChatGPT, OpenAI is pushing for tighter integration — and making it harder for developers to walk away.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella pursued a similar strategy after taking over from Steve Ballmer.To build trust with developers, Nadella leaned into open source and acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion, a move that signaled Microsoft's return to the developer community.GitHub later became the launchpad for tools like Copilot, anchoring Microsoft back at the center of the modern developer stack.\"OpenAI and all the big hyperscalers are going for vertical integration,\" said Ben Van Roo, CEO of Legion Intelligence, a startup building secure agent frameworks for defense and intelligence use cases.\"Use our models and our compute, and build the next-gen agents and workflows with our tools. The market is massive. We're talking about replacing SaaS, big systems of record, and literally part of the labor force,\" said Van Roo.SaaS stands for software as a service, a group of companies specializing in enterprise software and services, of which Salesforce, Oracle and Adobe are part.Legion's strategy is to stay model-agnostic and focus on secure, interoperable agentic workflows that span multiple systems. The company is already deploying inside classified Department of Defense environments and embedding across platforms like NetSuite and Salesforce.But that same shift also introduces risk for the model makers.\"Agents and workflows make some of the massive LLMs both powerful and maybe less necessary,\" he noted. \"You can build reasoning agents with smaller and specific workflows without GPT-5.\"The tools and agents built with leading LLMs have the potential to replace legacy software products from companies like Microsoft and Salesforce.That's why OpenAI is racing to build the infrastructure around its models. It's not just to make them more powerful, but harder to replace.The real bet isn't that the best model will win, but that the company with the most complete developer loop will define the next platform era.And that's the vision for ChatGPT now: Not just a chatbot, but an operating system for AI.watch now",

    "body": "People linger in the restaurant of the Netflix House experience center. Andrej Sokolow | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesNetflix was the early leader in streaming. It's been later to another crucial piece of the media playbook — merchandising and live events.The streamer has only recently begun adopting tried-and-true marketing methods that have been in play for the likes of the Walt Disney Company, Universal and Warner Bros. Discovery for decades: Namely, consumer product partnerships, special release events and venue destinations that drive fan engagement.In January, the company struck its first master licensing deal with Jazwares, the maker of Squishmallows, to develop a product line for \"Stranger Things,\" including figures, play sets, toy vehicles, costumes and stuffed toys. Jazwares has existing partnerships with brands like Pokemon, Star Wars, Peppa Pig and Hello Kitty.More recently, Netflix signed a landmark licensing deal with toy giants Hasbro and Mattel to develop toys and consumer products based off smash hit \"KPop Demon Hunters.\"And this month, the company opened Netflix House in Philadelphia, a venue that features immersive experiences, interactive games, live performances and themed dining. A Dallas location of the concept is set to open in December, and another is expected in Las Vegas in 2027.The entrance to the Netflix House experience center. Andrej Sokolow | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesThe launches play off Netflix's robust slate of titles across television and film, which also includes \"Bridgerton,\" \"Squid Game\" and \"Wednesday.\"\"You need that foundation of IP to really build off to have that consumer product strategy,\" Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, told CNBC. \"It's the beauty of working at a place like Netflix, because we are constantly pivoting and looking at new opportunities.\"Netflix is a relative newcomer in Hollywood. Only in the last decade has it been building out its library of original and proprietary content.The streamer's first original series release was 2012's \"Lilyhammer,\" a Norwegian crime show about the misadventures of a mafia underboss living in the witness protection program. Its original programming really took off with 2013's \"House of Cards,\" a political thriller about a ruthless congressman bent on revenge after being passed over for Secretary of State — the first series produced exclusively for the streaming service.\"They're still a young company in the grand scheme of things,\" said Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush. \"They had to build out their content first and fandom had to occur organically.\"That's one of the reasons why the company didn't launch a consumer products division until 2019 or an officially licensed online shop until 2021.Before that, the streaming giant had been working with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like. It was predominantly working with licensees, collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.At the time, those strategies helped Netflix reap the benefit of more exposure. Now, Netflix is taking the reins.\"This is a great turning point for [Netflix] ... the pivot into merchandising efforts,\" Reese said. \"But, also, I wouldn't limit it to merchandising efforts. There is also games and gaming.\"In addition to deals with Epic Games' \"Fortnite,\" in which players can purchase cosmetic items from \"Stranger Things,\" \"Squid Game,\" \"Wednesday\" and \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" Netflix also has a collection of mobile games based on its original content.There's also Netflix's growing live entertainment business.Since 2020, the company has launched more than 40 experiences in 300 cities. This includes \"Bridgerton\" events like The Queen's Ball, which took place in nearly a dozen cities globally in 2022 and 2023 and invited guests to dress in their Regency-era finest for a themed party, as well as a concert series through Candlelight featuring music from the show.Shonda Rhimes, Golda Rosheuvel and cast members visit The Queen’s Ball: A Bridgerton Experience in New York on April 30, 2023.Ilya S. Savenok | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesThere was also an immersive experience centered on \"Stranger Things\" that allowed fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series in more than a dozen cities. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi and will open in Mexico City next month. And, a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow\" has been running in the West End in London since 2023.Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is not just a way for the company to generate additional revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels.\"KPop Demon Hunters,\" for example, isn't expected to have a follow-up film until 2029.\"You know, 2029 that's a long wait,\" Reese said. \"But, having the merchandise, having pop-up shops or live events or some sort of fan engagement in the interim will definitely help to keep that engagement alive until they have the next content release.\"The strategy has been part of Disney's playbook for decades. The company has used its IP as an anchor in its theme parks, cruise lines and resort locations as well as in the retail space to give fans more points of connection for the stories they love and keep them engaged with the brand in between film and television releases.Netflix is now adopting this method and has been deliberate in what kinds of products and experiences it delivers to fans as it dives further into the segment.\"Bridgerton\" merchandise includes tea sets, elegant pajamas, candles, beauty supplies and even curated dog accessories, all with a delicate, pastel color palate. The \"Stranger Things\" product line includes items like specialty Eggo waffles, Dungeons & Dragons sets, '80s-themed fashion items and a bolder, darker color scheme.\"We think about it both as an extension of the fandom, but also as an extension of the storytelling,\" Netflix's Lee said of the company's merchandising strategy. \"A sticker book for 'KPop Demon Hunters' is not going to be a revenue driver for us, but if you're a kid that loves that... a sticker book might be the perfect thing you pick up, that sort of low-dollar commitment. So, for us, across every IP and across every category, we are balancing a commercial opportunity that we think will drive revenue and also things that bring fans joy.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman during a welcoming ceremony in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025.Bandar Algaloud/courtesy Of Saud | Via ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump is set to meet with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, with the leaders expected to discuss the deepening of defense, trade and technology ties as well as coperation in the fields of artificial intelligence, security and nuclear energy.The trip follows Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia in May in which the kingdom made a $600 billion trade and investment commitment to the U.S. Analysts say Trump will be looking to cement those pledges this week.\"The United States wants Saudi Arabia to purchase more of its goods and services and increase investments in U.S. companies, and Saudi Arabia is seeking greater access to U.S. tech and innovation to support its ambitious Vision 2030 reforms,\" Tim Callen, visiting fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute, said ahead of the meeting.The U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum scheduled on Nov. 19 will be an opportunity to seal more economic deals between the two countries, Callen said, noting that Saudi Arabia wants a two-way street with Washington when it comes to investments.\"There is little doubt that Saudi investments and purchases of U.S. products will increase. However, it may be that U.S. investments into Saudi Arabia see the strongest growth in the coming years given the improved investment climate in the kingdom,\" Callen said, with \"opportunities provided by Vision 2030, and availability of reliable low-cost energy and abundant land to support the expansion of AI and related activities of U.S. tech companies.\"Image rehabilitiationThe visit to the U.S. will be the first undertaken by Saudi Arabia's defacto ruler since 2018, when Saudi agents killed a journalist and high-profile critic of the Saudi regime, Jamal Khashoggi, in a Saudi consulate in Istanbul.Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS as he's widely known, denied ordering the killing but a U.S. intelligence report concluded the crown prince had approved the operation.Protests in Washington over the disappearance of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi on Oct. 10, 2018.Umar Farooq | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesSince the widespread scandal around the killing, and criticism of Saudi's record when it comes to gender equality and human rights generally, the kingdom has looked to rehabilitate its global image. It has done this predominantly through looking to broker peace agreements in the Middle East, and a push to host blockbuster sports events, such as the 2034 World Cup in men's soccer.Having seen its regional nemesis Iran largely weakened as a result of U.S. and Israeli joint strikes on the republic, Saudi Arabia has seen its own dominance grow and has positioned itself as a key strategic ally to the U.S. in the region.",

    "body": "The Home Depot logo is displayed on a sign outside of a store on Sept. 6, 2025 in San Diego, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHome Depot on Tuesday cut its full-year profit forecast and missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter as it saw weaker home improvement demand, tepid consumer spending and lower-than-usual storm activity.The retailer said it now expects full-year sales will climb about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive. That compares with its previous expectations for full-year sales to grow by 2.8% and comparable sales to increase by 1%.The revised outlook includes an estimated $2 billion in incremental revenue from GMS, a building products distributor that Home Depot acquired earlier this year. The company's sales were not part of its previous full-year guidance.Home Depot expects full-year adjusted earnings per share to decline by about 5% from the year-ago period, compared with its prior expectations that they would fall by about 2%In a CNBC interview, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said the retailer previously expected home improvement activity would increase. It also anticipated higher sales of roofing materials, generators and other supplies that typically sell before and after seasonal storms.Neither dynamic materialized, he said, putting pressure on the business. \"When we set guidance, we had anticipated that demand would begin to accelerate gradually in the back half of the year as interest rates and mortgage rates eased,\" he said. \"But what we saw was that ongoing consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing are disproportionately impacting home improvement demand.\"Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal third quarter compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.74 adjusted vs. $3.84 expectedRevenue: $41.35 billion vs. $41.10 billion expectedHome Depot's stock was down about 3% in early trading on Tuesday. As of Monday's close, the company's shares are down about 8% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 13% gains during the same period.Fewer hurricanes and a 'deferral mindset'For Home Depot, housing turnover typically sparks larger and more lucrative projects as customers fix up their homes before or after moving. Those big projects, however, have dropped in frequency as higher interest rates have led to steeper mortgage rates and borrowing costs for loans, which a homeowner may use to pay for a kitchen remodel or major addition.Since roughly the middle of 2023, McPhail has told CNBC that homeowners have been in a \"deferral mindset.\" That's led to a bit of a waiting game for Home Depot, as it holds out for either lower mortgage rates or a shift by consumers who get used to higher mortgage rates as the new normal.In the most recent three-month period, that waiting game continued. McPhail told CNBC that demand was \"stable\" from the fiscal second quarter to the third quarter when adjusting for the lack of hurricanes. But, he added, \"at this point, it's hard to identify near-term catalysts that would lead to acceleration.\" Home Depot's net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 dropped to $3.60 billion, or $3.62 per share, from $3.65 billion, or $3.67 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue decreased from $40.22 billion in the year-ago quarter.Adjusting for one-time items, including the value of intangible assets, Home Depot reported earnings of $3.74 per share.Comparable sales rose 0.2% in the quarter, falling short of analysts' expectations of 1.4% growth, according to StreetAccount.Sales trends compared to the prior year slowed as the quarter progressed. Comparable sales were up 2% in August, up 0.5% in September and down 1.5% year-over-year in October, Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising said on the company's earnings call.CEO Ted Decker said on an earnings call that the primary driver of that deceleration was the lack of storm activity — particularly when lapping a year-ago period with a lot of hurricanes. He said that pressure will continue into the fourth quarter.Compared with other big-box retailers, Home Depot's customers tend to be more financially stable. About 90% of its do-it-yourself customers own their homes and the home professionals who shop at the retailer tend to get hired by homeowners.Even so, McPhail told CNBC Home Depot gave a weaker outlook in part because shoppers across income groups are reluctant to take on high-dollar projects. He said a slower housing market and the higher cost of borrowing has contributed to the trend.He said other factors may also be having a chilling effect, including the prolonged government shutdown, an uptick in corporate layoff announcements and a decline in home values in some markets.However, Bastek said on the company's earnings call that Home Depot has not seen customers trading down to cheaper products. Instead, he said, they are often opting for more innovative and premium appliances, power tools or other items, which tend to cost more.Big-ticket transactions, which the company defines as costing $1,000 or more, rose 2.3% year over year. Still, Bastek added the company continues to see \"softer engagement in larger discretionary projects where customers typically use financing to fund renovation projects.\"Average ticket, the typical amount spent by customers at the store or on the company's website, rose 1.8% year over year in the quarter. However, customer transactions fell 1.6% year over year.A bright spot in the quarter was online sales, which rose by 11% year over year, McPhail said.Looking to pros for growthAs do-it-yourself customers postpone bigger projects, the company has tried to attract more business from contractors, roofers and other professionals.The company has made two key purchases of pro-related companies. Last year, it bought Texas-based SRS Distribution for $18.25 billion — the largest acquisition in its history. The company sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, pool and roofing businesses. Home Depot acquired GMS earlier this year.Like other retailers, Home Depot has felt the pinch of higher costs on some imported items because of tariffs. McPhail said in May that the company was diversifying the countries where it sourced its goods and intended to \"generally maintain our current pricing levels across our portfolio.\"However, company leaders warned in August that it may have to hike prices in some categories because of higher tariffs.McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has increased some items' prices, but said \"where there were price actions, they were modest.\" He said Home Depot has kept prices the same for some key items or even been able to reduce them. For example, he said, its bestselling 7½-foot Grand Duchess Christmas tree and many of its strings of lights for trees have dropped in price. ",

    "body": "Larry SummersCameron Costa | CNBCFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Monday that he was stepping back from all public commitments amid fallout from the release of emails between him and the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC.\"While continuing to fulfill my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,\" said Summers, a former president of Harvard University who teaches at the school.Summers is a member of the board of OpenAI. He is also a columnist for Bloomberg News.CNBC has requested comment from OpenAI.Summer's statement came after Harvard's newspaper, the Crimson, published an article detailing his emails with Epstein, which came to light last week when the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee released more than 20,000 documents it obtained pursuant to a subpoena from Epstein's estate.U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein appears in a photograph taken for the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services' sex offender registry March 28, 2017 and obtained by Reuters July 10, 2019.New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services | Handout | ReutersThe Crimson noted that when Summers was \"pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, he sought guidance from a longtime associate: convicted sex offender Jeffrey E. Epstein.\"Emails and texts between the two men from November 2018 and July 2019, showed Summers, who was and is married, turning \"to Epstein for advice on his pursuit of the woman,\" the paper reported.That time frame was a decade after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to solicitation of prostitution from an underage girl.In the emails and texts, \"Epstein was quick to chime in with assurance and suggestions, describing himself in one November 2018 message as Summers' 'wing man.' \" the Crimson noted.\"Think for now I'm going nowhere with her except economics mentor,\" Summers wrote that same month. \"I think I'm right now in the seen very warmly in rear view mirror category.\"\"She must be very confused or maybe wants to cut me off but wants professional connection a lot and so holds to it.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and a former professor at Harvard Law, told CNN that Harvard should sever its ties to Summers. Summer is the director of the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School, and this semester is teaching five courses at Harvard, the Crimson noted.Warren said Summers \"cannot be trusted\" with students, given his past relationship with Epstein.\"For decades, Larry Summers has demonstrated his attraction to serving the wealthy and well-connected, but his willingness to cozy up to a convicted sex offender demonstrates monumentally bad judgment,\" Warren told CNN. \"If he had so little ability to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein even after all that was publicly known about Epstein's sex offenses involving underage girls, then Summers cannot be trusted to advise our nation's politicians, policymakers, and institutions — or teach a generation of students at Harvard or anywhere else.\"On Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi, acting on a request from President Donald Trump, said she had asked Manhattan U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton, billionaire tech investor Reid Hoffman, and the bank JPMorgan Chase.Trump himself is a former friend of Epstein. The president has been criticized for months for the Department of Justice's refusal to release investigative files related to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019, weeks after his arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges.The House of Representatives on Tuesday is set to vote on a measure that would force the DOJ to release the Epstein files.",

    "body": "Senator Bill Cassidy (R-LA) questions witnesses during a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing in Washington, DC on Sept. 17, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSen. Bill Cassidy on Monday proposed replacing enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits with pre-paid health savings accounts.The Louisiana Republican's proposal comes as lawmakers scramble to find a remedy for skyrocketing costs of Obamacare health insurance premiums.The boosted ACA tax credits, which this year have lowered the cost of Obamacare plans for about 20 million Americans, are set to expire at the end of December.Cassidy's proposal would allow people who signed up for a so-called Bronze Plan through Obamacare marketplaces to get a pre-paid HSA, funded in part by the lapsed tax credits.While HSAs would not help pay for monthly premiums, Cassidy told reporters that they would help reduce the cost of health-care expenses, such as co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance.Bronze plans  generally cover 60% of an enrollee's health costs, with the enrollee responsible for paying the remaining 40% out of pocket.\"Is there anybody who would not want to take a large portion of that, which we're using to help Americans purchase health care, and give it directly to the individual, so that 100% of its used to purchase health care, as opposed to, as opposed to giving that money to the insurance company, of which 20% goes for profit and overhead?\" asked Cassidy, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.The federal government shut down on Oct. 1, and remained shut down for weeks when Senate Democrats refused to vote for a stopgap funding bill because it did not include an extension of the enhanced ACA credits.Last week, seven Democrats and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with them, agreed to end the 43-day-long shutdown by voting for a funding bill. Their agreement came after Senate Majority Leader John Thune, D-.S.C.,  promised to hold a vote by mid-December on a bill of Democrats' choosing to extend the tax credits.But even a temporary extension of the ACA credits faces a near-impossible obstacle course to being passed into law, in part because it would require Republican support. GOP members of Congress have long tried to gut the Affordable Care Act, which became law under President Barack Obama with only Democratic votes.Cassidy said he is talking with other senators, as well as the Trump administration, about how his HSA plan would work.With roughly a month to go before a planned vote, lawmakers have little time to finalize their plans before presenting them.Yet Cassidy's plan is already meeting with some resistance from some Democrats and health-care policy experts.Larry Levitt, an expert with the KFF health policy research group, on Sunday responded to an interview Cassidy did with CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\"Giving ACA enrollees cash in flexible spending accounts would help with out-of-pocket health costs like deductibles,\" Levitt tweeted.\"But, they wouldn't do someone much good if they can't afford health insurance to begin with and end up getting sick.\"On Monday, Levitt tweeted, \"Without the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, people would have a harder time buying plans with affordable deductibles.\"\"But, I do not believe this plan from @SenBillCassidy would cause a premium death spiral in the same way as other health account proposals that've been floated,\" he wrote.Death spirals occur when healthy people exit a health-care insurance plan, leading to ever-rising premiums for less healthy people who remain in the plan.",

    "body": "A Panera Bread sign hangs on the exterior of the restaurant on July 25, 2025 in Miami, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWhen Panera Bread began shrinking its sandwiches and skimping on salads, it started shedding customers.Now, to win them back, the chain plans to reinvest in the business and undo many of those same cost-cutting measures, it said Tuesday.Once the No. 1 fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has dipped to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. Last year, its sales fell 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. For years, the chain's traffic has been shrinking, according to CEO Paul Carbone, who took the reins earlier this year. Controversy after the chain's foray into energy drinks didn't help matters, either.Panera's troubles have coincided with a tough year for fast-casual restaurants. Chipotle, Sweetgreen and Cava have all cut their full-year forecasts as they see younger consumers eating out less frequently.Carbone has a plan to bring back customers. Under the strategy, named \"Panera RISE,\" the company aims to refresh its menu, focus on value, improve its service and build new restaurants. He said the plan has the backing of the franchisees who operate roughly half of its 2,200 U.S. locations, along with the support of JAB Holding, the investment arm of the Reimann family that owns the company.Panera's slide has been poorly timed for JAB. The firm has been plotting an IPO for the chain's parent company, Panera Brands, which also owns Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels.In 2021, four years after taking the chain private, JAB struck a deal with Danny Meyer's special purpose acquisition company for a merger that would take the company public again. But Panera scrapped those plans a year later, citing market conditions. In late 2023, the company confidentially filed for an initial public offering that still hasn't happened.When asked about the status of Panera's IPO plans, Carbone told CNBC that the chain's management team is currently focused on growing traffic and implementing the Panera RISE strategy.Entering the value warsPhase one of Panera's plan is to improve the quality of its food, reversing cost-cutting measures imposed in the face of high inflation, according to Carbone.\"We squeezed food costs. We squeezed labor,\" he said.Some of those changes happened while Carbone was chief financial officer. He now calls himself a \"reformed CFO\" — albeit one who still listens to earnings conference calls.\"It's really about death by a thousand paper cuts, it truly is,\" Carbone said about the chain's downturn.Take Panera's salads, for example. In the summer of 2024, Panera began using a mix of half romaine, half iceberg lettuce to make its salads, saving the chain money compared with when it was using romaine alone. This summer, it reverted back to entirely romaine salads.\"You know what guests told us? No one likes iceberg, and no one gets that and says, 'Oh my God, that white salad, it looks so appetizing,'\" Carbone said.And then there's the cherry tomato. Carbone said Panera is one of the few restaurant chains that doesn't slice the bite-sized tomatoes in half, a decision made to save on labor costs.\"We make the guest chase the cherry tomato around the bowl,\" he said.And when a salad comes with an avocado, customers have to cut the halved fruit themselves, rather than it coming presliced. The chain will start slicing the cherry tomatoes and avocados early next year.Plus, Panera's salads typically have five ingredients, while those of competitors like Sweetgreen feature as many as eight.But it wasn't just salads that were affected by the cost-cutting measures.\"In some instances, we shrunk portions, so guests would walk into our cafe to buy a sandwich that has gone up significantly in price, with lower-quality ingredients, in a smaller size,\" Carbone said.The menu refresh will also include new items. Last month, the chain announced that it is testing new \"fresca\" and \"energy refresher\" drinks.Panera previously offered highly caffeinated energy drinks, but it discontinued the line, which included Charged Lemonade, following two wrongful death lawsuits and related negative publicity. Panera denied wrongdoing and settled the lawsuits earlier this year.When it comes to value, Panera is planning on leaning into a barbell menu strategy, offering customers options on both the low- and high-price end. The approach has worked particularly well for casual-dining chains like Chili's, but Panera doesn't have the same appetizer offerings as a full-service restaurant.\"We haven't cracked the code yet,\" Carbone said. \"We're doing a lot of testing.\"Chains across the restaurant industry have embraced value offerings, from McDonald's Extra Value Meal to Applebee's \"2 for $25\" deal, igniting the so-called value wars. However, restaurants have to balance the desire to attract cash-strapped diners with maintaining their profit margins.To improve the customer experience, Panera is planning to invest more into labor. Like many restaurants, Panera in recent years scheduled fewer workers and relied more on the self-order kiosks it pioneered in the industry. That approach saved money, but customers often walked into a cafe and couldn't find an employee in sight, according to Carbone.Panera will also invest back into its kiosks, which it hasn't significantly upgraded since they first entered its restaurants roughly a decade ago. And its dining rooms will get a facelift, too.If these changes succeed in bringing back lapsed customers, then Panera's restaurants will become more profitable, fueling future restaurant growth. And those new bakery-cafes could look different.\"What does the cafe of the future look like? We're doing a lot of work around that, we're going to test different things,\" Carbone said.",

    "body": "Budrul Chukrut | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesFanDuel and DraftKings on Tuesday said they are quitting the American Gaming Association, the leading trade organization representing casinos, gaming manufacturers and sportsbooks.In separate announcements, the companies said they were abandoning their AGA memberships because the direction of online betting — increasingly tied to booming prediction markets — does not align with the trade organization, they said.It's the latest escalation of a growing rift in the gambling world as prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket, which allow customers to trade on events across pop culture, news and politics, skyrocket in popularity and push into sports.The AGA has taken a firm stand against prediction markets offering sports betting. It plans to introduce a resolution at a board meeting on Tuesday that would exclude from membership any company that offers prediction markets, according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be named speaking about internal matters.  Last week, Flutter-owned FanDuel announced it would launch a prediction platform called FanDuel Predicts in December in partnership with the CME. It plans to offer sports prediction trades only in states where sports betting isn't legal.  \"We recognize this direction is not aligned with the American Gaming Association's current priorities for its member operators. After thoughtful consideration, we have decided to step back from our AGA membership at this time,\" a FanDuel spokesperson told CNBC.DraftKings recently acquired Railbird, which has a federal license to offer event contracts. \"As the company's business strategy evolves—including with prediction markets—DraftKings determined that its plans no longer fully align with the AGA's direction in certain areas and have decided to relinquish its membership,\" a DraftKings spokesperson told CNBC.The AGA represents both commercial and tribal members, sometimes with competing interests.  The trade organization said in a statement it had accepted FanDuel's and DraftKings' \"request to relinquish their membership.\"\"We wish them the best, and we expect to maintain close ties to our mission to promote and protect legal, regulated gaming.\"FanDuel and DraftKings are also represented by the Sports Betting Alliance, which conducts more specific lobbying and outreach efforts on behalf of sports betting operators.",

Now it's demonstrating a tool that IT specialists can use to see and manage those agents.The software, named Agent 365, provides a list of artificial intelligence agents inside companies' systems, even if they're from other companies, Microsoft announced Tuesday. The company will present the product to business leaders and information technology practitioners at its Ignite conference in San Francisco this week.\"In the same way you provision an identity for a new employee or a contingent worker, you'll provision identity and access controls for your agents,\" Judson Althoff, CEO of Microsoft's commercial business, told CNBC in an interview.With Agent 365, administrators will be able to approve new agents, see which ones are becoming popular and find out how many hours of employee time they're saving each week. They'll also be able to spot security risks and block agents. End users will be able to analyze agents' activities.Following the ascent of OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, software companies have built AI agents capable of developing software, generating ads and performing other simple tasks. Traditional corporations have started buying in.Agents from Adobe, Cognition, Databricks, Glean, ServiceNow and Workday will automatically show up in Agent 365. The software will also display agents that customers have built with Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry and Copilot Studio. Other companies that sell AI agents can integrate with Agent 365, said Ray Smith, vice president of autonomous agents at Microsoft.EY, one of the world's top accounting firms, had built an internal catalog of its AI agents, but has started implementing Agent 365 to gain more control, said Mark Luquire, a managing director for the company.Companies selling cybersecurity software recognize the complexity that might result from agents proliferating. Okta, which sells software for managing access for employees, said in September that it will bring out tools for discovering agents and tracking their activity.Customers enrolled in Microsoft's Frontier program for receiving early access to AI features can request to try Agent 365, Smith said. Microsoft has not finalized pricing.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesInternet infrastructure company Cloudflare was hit by an outage on Tuesday, knocking several major websites offline for global users.Many sites came back online within a few hours. In an update to its status page around 9:57 a.m. ET, Cloudflare said it had implemented a fix to resolve the outage, though it noted some users may still experience issues accessing its online dashboard.\"We are continuing to monitor for errors to ensure all services are back to normal,\" the company added.E-commerce platform Shopify, job search engine Indeed, Anthropic's Claude chatbot, President Donald Trump's Truth Social and Elon Musk's social media platform X were among the sites impacted by the Cloudflare issues, according to Downdetector, which itself could not be accessed briefly for some users. Some of NJ Transit's digital services were brought down by the outage.OpenAI's status page indicated ChatGPT and its Sora short-form video app were fully recovered after they experienced issues due to a \"third-party service provider.\"A Cloudflare spokesperson said the \"root cause\" of the outage was an automatically generated configuration file used to manage threat traffic that \"grew beyond an expected size of entries,\" which triggered a crash in the software system that handles traffic for several of its services.The company said it began to observe a \"spike in unusual traffic\" around 5:20 a.m. ET.There's no evidence that the outage was a result of an attack or caused by malicious activity, the spokesperson added.\"Given the importance of Cloudflare's services, any outage is unacceptable,\" the spokesperson said. \"We apologize to our customers and the internet general for letting you down today.\"Cloudflare's software is used by many businesses worldwide, helping to manage and secure traffic for about 20% of the web. Among the services it provides are that it guards against distributed denial of service attacks, which are when malicious actors attempt to overload a website's system with so many traffic requests that it can't function.Shares of Cloudflare slid more than 4%.The issue comes less than a month after Amazon Web Services suffered a daylong disruption that took down numerous online services, followed by a global outage of Microsoft's Azure cloud and 365 services.In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike caused a widespread outage that temporarily halted flights, impacted financial services and pushed hospitals to delay procedures.Read more CNBC tech newsSenators push for probe into Trump-linked crypto firm over token sales tied to North Korea and RussiaArm custom chips get a boost with Nvidia partnershipBuffett's Google bet comes 2 decades after billionaire investor 'inspired' search giant's IPONvidia CEO Jensen Huang surprised investors with a 'half a trillion' forecast.

    "body": "Samuel Boivin | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGoogle is debuting its latest artificial intelligence model, Gemini 3, as the search giant races to keep pace with ChatGPT creator OpenAI.The new AI model will allow users to get better answers to more complex questions, \"so you get what you need with less prompting,\" Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in one of several blog posts Google published Tuesday.Gemini 3 will be integrated into the Gemini app, Google's AI search products AI Mode and AI Overviews, as well as its enterprise products. The rollout begins Tuesday for select subscribers and will go out more broadly in the coming weeks.The announcement comes about eight months after Google introduced Gemini 2.5 and 11 months after Gemini 2.0. OpenAI, which kicked off the generative AI boom in late 2022 with the public launch of ChatGPT, introduced GPT-5 in August.\"It's amazing to think that in just two years, Al has evolved from simply reading text and images to reading the room,\" Pichai wrote in one of Tuesday's posts. \"Starting today, we're shipping Gemini at the scale of Google.\"The Gemini app now has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, the company said. OpenAI said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million weekly users.Pichai added that the newest model is \"built to grasp depth and nuance,\" and said Gemini 3 is also \"much better at figuring out the context and intent behind your request, so you get what you need with less prompting.\" Google's other AI models may still be used for simpler tasks, the company said. Alphabet and its megacap rivals are spending heavily to build out the infrastructure for AI development and to rapidly create more services for consumers and businesses. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures, and collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.Google said AI responses powered by Gemini 3 will be \"trading cliché and flattery for genuine insight — telling you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear,\" according to a statement from Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google's AI unit DeepMind. Industry critics have said today's AI chatbots are too sycophantic.Last week, OpenAI issued two updates to GPT-5. One is \"warmer, more intelligent, and better at following your instructions,\" the company said, and the other is \"faster on simple tasks, more persistent on complex ones.\"watch nowGoogle also announced a new agent platform called \"Google Antigravity,\" which lets developers code \"at a higher, task-oriented level.\"Gemini 3 is the company's \"best vibe coding model ever,\" Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, told reporters in a briefing. Vibe coding refers to a rapidly emerging market of tools that allow software developers to generate code with prompts.Google said the new model will enable \"generative interfaces,\" providing certain answers in a way that resembles a digital magazine. As an example, the company asked Gemini to \"explain the Van Gogh Gallery with life context for each piece.\" The result was a colorful, image-based explanation for each painting.Within AI Mode, Gemini 3 will first be available to paid subscribers. It will be able to analyze a question and create a layout with visual elements such as images, tables and grids. Google said it can make a custom-built interactive loan calculator or an interactive simulation about a complicated physics problem.Developers will be able to access the Gemini API and businesses will be able to integrate it through Vertex AI, the Google cloud service designed for building, deploying and managing AI models. For corporate customers, Gemini 3 can do things like create employee onboarding and trainings, more accurately analyze videos and factory floor images, and handle procurement, the company said.WATCH: Google adds Gemini to Chrome for all userswatch now",

    "body": "A Zoox autonomous robotaxi in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZoox on Tuesday began allowing select San Francisco users to hail its driverless vehicles, pitting the Amazon-owned robotaxi service against Alphabet's Waymo in the same market for the first time.Riders can sign up to join the \"Zoox Explorers\" program to take free rides in the company's box-shaped vehicles in certain San Francisco neighborhoods, including SoMa and the Mission and Design districts, the company said.Zoox will take users off the waitlist depending on their location and as it adds more robotaxis to its fleet. The company hopes to remove the waitlist entirely in 2026, Zoox spokesperson Marisa Wiggam said.Founded in 2014 and acquired by Amazon for $1.3 billion in 2020, Zoox is building a robotaxi business that aims to compete with Waymo. But unlike others in the robotaxi space, Zoox's vehicle has no steering wheel, with the company opting to design its robotaxis from the ground up.Zoox notched a major milestone in September when it opened up its robotaxi service to the public for the first time in Las Vegas. The company is offering free rides on and around the Las Vegas Strip while it waits to get regulatory approval for a paid service.The company has been testing its autonomous vehicle technology in San Francisco since 2017 via retrofitted Toyota Highlander SUVs. The company began to deploy its toaster-shaped driverless shuttles on San Francisco streets last year, before allowing friends and family of Zoox employees to hail its robotaxis in parts of the city.Zoox has deployed a fleet of 50 robotaxis between San Francisco and Las Vegas, the company told CNBC in September.Waymo opened up its service to all San Francisco riders in June 2024. Since launching its service in Phoenix in 2020, Waymo has provided more than 10 million paid rides, the company said in May.  Last week, the Google sister company announced that it would begin offering freeway rides in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets. Waymo also said it was expanding its service to include San Jose and the San Jose Mineta International Airport.As Zoox builds out its service, the Amazon company has deployed its test fleet in Seattle, Austin, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Washington, D.C.WATCH: Amazon's Zoox jumps into U.S. robotaxi race with Las Vegas launchwatch now",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe standard Medicare Part B premium will increase to $202.90 per month in 2026, up $17.90, or 9.7%, from $185 per month in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The increase marks the second-highest Part B premium increase in dollars, according to Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. The highest increase of $21.60 per month happened in 2022.Retirees may see this as a \"continuation in relentless cost increases,\" Johnson said via email.Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers both medically necessary and preventive services.Part B premiums are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks. Any increase to those monthly premium payments affects how much of an increase Social Security beneficiaries may see in their monthly checks in 2026.The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, which is expected to add about $56 per month on average to retirement benefits.The Part B premium for 2026 may be seen by beneficiaries as \"taking a significant chunk of or even most of their COLA,\" Johnson said.A hold harmless provision ensures that Social Security benefit payments do not decrease from one year to the next as a result of Medicare Part B premium increases. That said, other automatic deductions from Social Security checks for premiums tied to private Medicare Advantage insurance plans or Part D prescription drug coverage may reduce benefits, according to Johnson.The $202.90 standard Part B premium rate will apply to individuals with modified adjusted gross income less than or equal to $109,000, and for married couples who file taxes jointly with modified AGI less than or equal to $218,000.Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries pay what is called an income-related monthly adjustment amount that is added to their monthly premiums if their incomes are higher, according to CMS.The annual deductible for Part B will be $283 in 2026, according to the agency, a 10% increase from the $257 annual deductible in effect for 2025.The increases to both Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles are primarily due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the CMS fact sheet on the price changes.Income-related adjustment amounts are typically based on tax returns filed two years prior. Beneficiaries who have since had their income go down, or who have experienced a qualifying life event, may report that by submitting a form to the Social Security Administration.",

    "body": "An experimental Boeing 777X aircraft at the Dubai Air Show in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on Monday, Nov. 17, 2025. Christopher Pike | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmirates is piling the pressure on Boeing to deliver on a $38 billion order placed this week, the airline's president told CNBC on Tuesday.Speaking to CNBC at the Dubai Airshow, Emirates President Tim Clark said he had faith Boeing could \"restore [its] former glory\" — but nonetheless, the airline is doing what it can to ensure the beleaguered aircraft manufacturer holds up its end of the agreement.Emirates announced Monday it has placed an order for 65 Boeing 777-9 planes, worth $38 billion at list prices — taking Emirates' total orderbook with the planemaker to 315 widebody jets. Clark told CNBC the airline was hoping to receive the first of the new Boeing aircraft in the second quarter of 2027.Emirates is Boeing's biggest customer when it comes to wide-body aircraft, but the airline has been struggling with prolonged delays to Boeing's 777X program amid certification and production challenges. Boeing has also struggled to deliver other aircraft, including its 737 jets, after a strike at the firm late last year hit production.\"We're kind of holding Boeing's feet to the fire,\" Clark said, noting that while the aircraft is \"sound,\" Boeing is having to contend with huge certification requirements that come with a new aircraft and slower processes at the Federal Aviation Administration which has been impacted by the U.S. government shutdown.Restoring Boeing's 'former glory'Emirates has been critical of delays to deliveries from Boeing in the past, with Chairman and CEO Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum telling CNBC last year that the airline was \"not happy really with what's going on.\" Amid the delays, Emirates has spent billions of dollars retrofitting its older planes to plug capacity gaps.Other airlines have also been impacted by postponements to Boeing deliveries. Earlier this year, budget airline Ryanair cut its passenger traffic goal, citing Boeing delays.Despite Boeing's ongoing challenges, however, Clark told CNBC he expects Boeing can, and will, turn itself around.\"I know the Boeing of old, and I know what Boeing could do, and they were really, really a great company,\" he said. \"I see no reason why what has happened in the last decade cannot be fixed, and that Boeing cannot restore itself to its former glory of being an aeronautical engineering designer of excellence.\"watch nowBoeing has also come under intense scrutiny in recent years following a series of fatal crashes involving its aircraft. Earlier this year, a Boeing Dreamliner operated by Air India crashed moments after taking off from Ahmedabad, India. In late 2018, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft — crashed in a rural area southeast of Addis Ababa, killing everyone on board. It came just months after another 737 Max 8 aircraft went down just after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia.When it comes to safety concerns, Clark insisted that Boeing has worked hard to shore up the security functions on its planes.Boeing is now focused on operational safety, quality control and reviewing systems and protocols across the board, Clark said. \"If they get all of that right, it will take time, but with the new management, they have a strong chance of restoring the company to its former glory,\" he added. \"We've got 270 now of the 777, the biggest 777 order probably in history, when you take it all together — I don't think we'd be doing that if we weren't confident they were going to be able to deliver,\" Clark said.\"So we're right behind them. We've been moaning, as you would expect — it has not been easy or cheap for us to remediate the lack of capacity, but in the end, you have to put your faith in what I believe to be a strong and sound company that well managed, they'll get themselves out of this and rolling out airplanes at pace in the next five [to] seven years.\"— CNBC's Emma Graham and Leslie Josephs contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Epstein abuse survivor Lisa Phillips speaks during a news conference with lawmakers on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty ImagesThe House on Tuesday is expected to vote to order the Department of Justice to release all of its files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, two days after President Donald Trump abruptly dropped his opposition to the bipartisan bill.The measure is set to come up during the chamber's first vote series of the day around 2 p.m. ET, NBC News reported.\"Almost everybody\" will vote to pass it, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., told NBC on Monday night.That wasn't always the case. The push to release the Epstein files had faced opposition from GOP lawmakers, following the lead of Trump, whose White House had warned that backing the effort would be considered a \"hostile act.\"A discharge petition that would have forced a vote on the bill was jammed up during the government shutdown, as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., kept representatives out of session for nearly eight weeks. The prolonged absence delayed the swearing-in of Democratic Rep. Adelita Grijalva of Arizona, the final signature needed to move the petition forward.The shutdown ended last Wednesday and Grijalva, after being sworn in, signed the discharge petition. But, with pressure mounting, Johnson said he would bring the Epstein bill to a vote earlier than expected.The bill from Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is being brought to the floor under a procedure that will require a two-thirds majority to pass. If it succeeds, it will head to the Senate.WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 18: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) (C) speaks during a news conference with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) on the Epstein Files Transparency Act outside the U.S. Capitol on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Heather Diehl | Getty Images\"Today, we stand in a moment that will decide whether our government still belongs to the American people, or to those who prey on them,\" said a survivor of Epstein's abuse who spoke alongside a group of others at a news conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday morning.The survivors were joined by Massie, Khanna and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a longtime Trump loyalist who has recently become one of his critics. \"He called me a traitor for standing with these women and refusing to take my name off the discharge petition,\" Greene said of Trump at the presser. \"Today, you are going to see, probably a unanimous vote in the House to release the Epstein files. But the fight, the real fight, will happen after that,\" she said.Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill on November 18, 2025 in Washington, DC. Johnson addressed the \"Epstein Files\" ahead of a House vote on legislation which instructs the U.S. Department of Justice to release all files related to the late accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Roberto Schmidt | Getty ImagesTrump, a former friend of Epstein's who had a falling out with him years earlier, said on the campaign trail that he would support releasing the government's files from its investigations into the wealthy and well-connected financier. Epstein died in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.But Trump's DOJ said in a July 6 memo that it had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of Epstein-related matters and determined \"that no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"That determination, and Trump's repeated insistence that the focus on Epstein was a Democratic \"hoax,\" has spurred outrage across the political spectrum, including from some of Trump's own supporters.The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents from Epstein's estate, including emails appearing to show Epstein discussing Trump.Trump on Sunday night abruptly reversed course, urging House Republicans to vote in favor of the Epstein files bill.On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.

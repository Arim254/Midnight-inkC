    "body": "Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., May 7, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn.Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly.Gundlach is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making \"garbage loans\" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs.\"The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,\" he said. \"It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.\"Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a \"perfect mismatch\" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said.Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said.He said he still likes gold but has reduced his recommended allocation to 15%. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.",

    "body": "Signage is displayed outside the Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. headquarters in Cockeysville, Maryland, U.S.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSinclair disclosed a stake in fellow broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps on Monday, in a move to push toward a merger of the companies.Sinclair, which acquired a roughly 8% position in Scripps, per the filing, recently launched a strategic review of its own business that could result in a tie-up. Scripps, for its part, has seen its struggles mount in the competitive industry and is among the smallest of its peers.In the filing, Sinclair said it has been engaged in \"constructive\" discussions regarding a deal and believes if it were to reach an agreement that a transaction could be completed within nine to 12 months.Sinclair said in the filing that based on trading multiples there would be an expected $300 million in synergies if a merger were to take place.Scripps' stock rose more than 17% in early trading on Monday. Sinclair's stock was up about 2%.Sinclair, which acquired the stake for about $15.6 million, declined to comment beyond the SEC filing on Monday.In a statement on Monday Scripps said its board \"will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company's shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.\"\"Scripps' board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company's shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan,\" the company said in its statement. \"The board and management are aligned on doing only what is in the best interest of all of the company's shareholders as well as its employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States.\"The statement added that the board continues to evaluate \"any transactions and other alternatives that would enhance the value of the company and would be in the best interest of all company shareholders.\"Broadcast TV station group owners have suffered like the rest of media companies in recent years due to the shift away from the traditional pay-TV bundle and toward streaming. These broadcast stations, for the most part, make the majority of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors.Broadcast station owners like Sinclair have been eager to do mergers as they push for deregulation under the Trump administration.In August, Nexstar Media Group, the biggest owner of these stations, agreed to acquire Tegna for $3.54 billion.Sinclair, meanwhile, is also considering spinning off or splitting its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network The Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse, which was recently rebranded Digital Remedy.Sinclair and its advisors held discussions with potential merger partners earlier this year, CNBC previously reported.",

    "body": "A street sign is seen near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., August 7, 2025.  Eduardo Munoz | ReutersNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams met with Wall Street's dealers last week about a key lending facility, the Financial Times reported, citing three individuals familiar with the matter.The meeting, which took place on the sidelines on Wednesday at the Fed's annual Treasury market conference, included representatives from many of the 25 primary dealers of banks that underwrite the government's debt, according to the report. The meeting participants were members of banks' teams that specialize in fixed income markets, the report said.CNBC has confirmed the meeting took place.Williams sought feedback from these dealers on the use of the Fed's standing repo facility — a permanent lending tool that allows eligible financial institutions to borrow cash from the central bank in return for high-quality collateral such as Treasury bonds. The tool would allow institutions to sell securities to the Fed with an agreement to repurchase them at a later time, essentially acting as a backstop for markets.\"President Williams convened the New York Fed's primary trading counterparties [primary dealers] to continue engagement on the purpose of the standing repo facility as a tool of monetary policy implementation and to solicit feedback that ensures it remains effective for rate control,\" a spokesperson for the New York Fed told the Financial Times, which reported the news on Friday.The meeting took place amid brewing concerns about stress in parts of the U.S. financial system and signs of tighter market liquidity.Roberto Perli, who manages the Fed's System Open Market Account, which is the central bank's bonds and cash holdings, said Wednesday that firms in need of the central bank's standing repo facility should \"be used whenever it is economically sensible to do so.\"The New York Fed did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read the complete Financial Times report here.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2023.David A. Grogan | CNBCAlphabet shares jumped Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in the Google parent, marking one of the conglomerate's most significant technology bets in years.Alphabet shares were up 5% in morning trading, bucking some weakness in most technology shares to start the week.A quarterly 13F filing showed Berkshire owned roughly $4.3 billion worth of Alphabet as of Sept. 30, making it the firm's 10th largest equity holding. The move surprised many Buffett watchers given the billionaire's decades-long hesitation toward high-growth tech companies. Buffett has always seen Apple, Berkshire's largest holding, as a consumer products company.The Alphabet investment likely came from one of his two lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who increasingly influence Berkshire's $300 billion stock portfolio. Though its size suggests it likely had the blessing of Buffett, who is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year. The pair have been responsible for many of Berkshire's tech-leaning investments, including a stake in Amazon initiated in 2019. Berkshire still owns $2.2 billion worth of Amazon today.Alphabet has been one of the stock market's biggest winners this year, rising 46% as investors reward its accelerating AI push and rapidly improving cloud profitability. Revenue growth from Google Cloud, once a margin drag, has turned into a key earnings driver.Changing of the guard?Bill Stone, Glenview Trust Company's chief investment officer, said the Alphabet purchase could reflect a broader approach to technology investments as leadership transitions to the next generation.\"Perhaps the purchase of Alphabet signals a widening of the circle of competence into technology,\" Stone said.Longtime lieutenant Greg Abel is set to take the reins for 95-year-old Buffett in January. The Oracle of Omaha will remain chairman of the board.Despite the stellar rally in 2025, Alphabet's valuation remains lower than many of its AI-driven megacap peers. The stock trades at 25.5 times next year's earnings, compared to Microsoft at 32.0, Broadcom at 50.8 and Nvidia at 41.9, according to FactSet.That relative discount, combined with Alphabet's massive cash flow and dominant market position, may have made the shares particularly attractive to Buffett's team.\"We think Berkshire likely finds more comfort investing in GOOG over other tech plays given the high free cash flow potential of its core business coupled with an attractive valuation at about 22x 2027 EPS amid a healthy top-line growth trajectory,\" Angelo Zino, Alphabet analyst at CFRA, said in a note to clients.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet year to dateBuffett has admitted missing Google was one of his biggest investing mistakes. He had a front-row seat: Geico, Berkshire's auto insurance unit, was one of Google's earliest major advertisers. The company paid about $10 every time a user clicked one of its search ads in the early days of online marketing.\"I had seen the product work, and I knew the kind of margins [they had],\" Buffett said in 2018. \"I didn't know enough about technology to know whether this really was the one that would stop the competitive race.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before boarding Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport on November 16, 2025.Roberto Schmidt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday called on Republicans in Congress to vote to release files related to deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a sharp reversal from previous resistance within his inner circle.\"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social account. \"And it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat 'Shutdown',\" he added. The president went on to say that the Department of Justice has already turned over \"tens of thousands of pages\" to the public on Epstein, and that officials were examining \"various Democrat operatives,\" such as former President Bill Clinton and his former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.A Clinton spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Trump's late-night Truth Social post.Trump's statement comes as he faces growing pressure regarding his past ties to Epstein, who died by apparent suicide in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.The full House of Representatives is set to vote on a measure — pushed by Republican representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democrat Ro Khanna of California — demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein, which is reportedly set to occur on Tuesday.Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler violated trading rules while at central bank: ethics reportWoman pleads guilty to lying about astronaut wife accessing bank account from Space StationThe DOJ had refused to make the investigative materials public, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials to do so.However, a petition in the House garnered enough support, including from Trump allies such as Reps. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., to force a vote on the measure.Former Trump ally and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has also signed the petition and criticized Trump's reluctance to release more Epstein case materials, leading to a major rift with the president over the weekend.In his latest message on Truth Social, Trump argued that some \"members\" of the Republican Party were being \"used,\" and that the party needed to \"get BACK ON POINT.\"In a separate post late Sunday, Trump singled out Greene, referring to her as a \"Traitor.\" On Saturday, Greene had accused the president of attacking her as part of efforts to \"make an example\" of her and \"scare all the other Republicans\" ahead of the House vote on the Epstein files.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long sexual abuse of underage girls and young women and has stated the two had a falling out in the early 2000s.However, the House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of emails that showed Epstein and others talking about Trump. Epstein did not explicitly accuse Trump of any wrongdoing or illegal activity in the email files.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that reports indicate the vote is planned for Tuesday, but has not been officially scheduled.",

The highest increase of $21.60 per month happened in 2022. Retirees may see this as a \"continuation in relentless cost increases,\" Johnson said via email.Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers both medically necessary and preventive services.Part B premiums are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks. Any increase to those monthly premium payments affects how much of an increase Social Security beneficiaries may see in their monthly checks in 2026.The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, which is expected to add about $56 per month on average to retirement benefits.The Part B premium for 2026 may be seen by beneficiaries as \"taking a significant chunk of or even most of their COLA,\" Johnson said. A hold harmless provision ensures that Social Security benefit payments do not decrease from one year to the next as a result of Medicare Part B premium increases.This is a developing story.

    "body": "Boxes of Ozempic and Wegovy made by Novo Nordisk at a pharmacy in London on March 8, 2024.Hollie Adams | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Monday said it has cut the direct-to-consumer prices of its blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy and diabetes counterpart Ozempic, adding to efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the treatments more accessible. The Danish drugmaker is lowering the price of the drugs for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. But Novo Nordisk said the cash-pay cost of the highest dose of Ozempic will remain $499 per month. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. After that period, people move to the new standard monthly direct-to-consumer price. The company's introductory offer ends on March 31. The announcements come days after President Donald Trump struck deals with Novo Nordisk and chief rival Eli Lilly to make their popular GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to access and afford. Those agreements will involve cutting the prices the government pays for the drugs, introducing Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offering discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January called TrumpRx. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs\"Our new savings offers provide immediate impact, bringing forward greater cost savings for those who are currently without coverage or choose to self-pay,\" said Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's head of U.S. operations, said in a release. \"It is part of a larger strategy to expand access that includes building relationships with telehealth providers and major retailers, expanding coverage, and working with the Administration to lower costs for people living with chronic diseases like obesity.\"The Trump administration said starting doses of existing injections like Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRx, but will \"trend down\" to $245 per month over a two-year period. On the day the deals were announced, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.Novo Nordisk's new cash-pay offers are available through Wegovy.com or Ozempic.com, the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, NovoCare, and other participating organizations and telehealth providers that work directly with the drugmaker, including Costco, GoodRx, WeightWatchers, Ro, LifeMD and eMed. ",

    "body": "watch nowArtificial intelligence could be increasing worker productivity so much that companies slow hiring, top Trump administration economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Monday.\"I think that there have been mixed signals in the job market,\" the National Economic Council director said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" adding that he has seen \"really, really positive signals in the output markets.\"After noting U.S. gross domestic product rose at a strong pace in the second quarter of 2025, Hassett said, \"there could be a little bit of, almost, quiet time in the labor market, because firms are finding that AI is making their workers so productive that they don't necessarily have to hire the new kids out of college and so on.\"He maintained, however, that any AI-induced softness in the market would be temporary.\"Because there's so much output growth and income growth, that's the kind of thing that a free market will work out relatively quickly as, you know, new ways to spend money emerge,\" Hassett said.Fears about AI replacing entry-level jobs are hardly new, but they have seldom been expressed by the Trump administration, which has championed the nascent industry and taken steps to expand its development in the U.S.President Donald Trump has signed multiple executive orders aimed at reducing regulatory barriers and promoting the development of AI infrastructure, including data centers.David Sacks, Trump's \"czar\" for AI and cryptocurrency, said earlier in November that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\" His remark came after OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar said that her startup wants a federal \"backstop\" to support its infrastructure investments. Friar later walked back that comment.Hassett's comments also come as Trump and his allies have tried to refocus their messaging on affordability, after Democratic candidates who homed in on that issue won big in major elections earlier this month.Hassett said on Monday that overall grocery prices have not come down during Trump's second term, despite the president's claims otherwise.\"People still are trying to dig out from the big hole that was dug by the previous administration's policies,\" he said.The cost of an average monthly grocery haul shot up during the Biden administration and \"it's gone up almost not at all\" since Trump returned to the White House, he said.He added that \"purchasing power has gone up.\"\"It's just kind of astonishing to me that the cost problem is somehow being blamed on us,\" he said.",

    "body": "With open enrollment season in full swing, more Americans than ever will be able to fund tax-advantaged accounts aimed at health-care costs next year.Embedded in the so-called \"big beautiful\" bill passed in July are three provisions that expand access to health savings accounts, accounts available to those enrolled in a high-deductible health insurance plan.The changes are likely to attract 3 to 4 million new HSA participants in 2026, according to estimates from Morningstar.Like a flexible spending account, an HSA is funded with pre-tax dollars and can be used to cover medical costs throughout the year. Unlike an FSA, the money doesn't have a \"use it or lose it\" provision. Rather, the funds sit in an account you own and can take with you should you switch jobs.Another feature that sets HSAs apart: You can invest the money in the likes of stocks, bonds or exchange-traded funds. And if you invest the money rather than spending it on pressing health-care needs, that's where some serious advantages kick in, experts say.\"An HSA is indeed one of the most powerful, yet underutilized, financial tools available, especially considering its unique triple tax advantage — contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are also tax-free,\" Sean Lovison, a certified financial planner and founder of Purpose Built Financial Services, previously told CNBC Make It.HSAs are expanding to three groups of peopleGenerally, to qualify for an HSA, you have to be enrolled in a high-deductible plan. For 2026, that means one with a deductible of at least $1,700 for individuals or $3,400 for families. You can't have any disqualifying health-care coverage, be enrolled in Medicare or be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, among other requirements.Under the new bill, three groups of people are now eligible for an HSA for whom rules had previously been either murky or prohibitive.1. Everyone enrolled in bronze and catastrophic plansInsurance plans available on the Affordable Care Act marketplace generally fall into one of five categories: platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic. Generally, platinum plans have higher premiums and lower deductibles, and bronze and catastrophic plans (the latter are only available to people under 30 and some people with limited incomes) have lower premiums and higher deductibles.Until recently, enrollees in these plans were HSA-eligible on a case-by-case basis. The new bill makes anyone covered under a bronze or catastrophic plan eligible for an HSA.While catastrophic plans aren't widely used, about 7.2 million Americans are currently covered under bronze plans, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   2. People who use direct primary care servicesUnder the new law, people enrolled in direct primary care services are eligible for an HSA, provided that their coverage meets the other HDHP requirements.Under the DPC model, offered through providers such as One Medical, patients pay a recurring fee for a series of services that don't get billed to insurance — a convention that put it in a legal gray area when it came to HSA eligibility.\"This is really more clearing up an ambiguity issue rather than something that's going to be a paradigm shift for folks,\" says Jake Spiegel, senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute. \"What the bill says is, you can do this and still contribute to an HSA, and that's totally OK.\"3. Some people who use telehealthUnder pandemic-era legislation, including the CARES Act, high-deductible plans could waive the deductible on telehealth services — regardless of whether they were preventative — and still qualify for HSA eligibility.Those rules lapsed at the end of 2024, but the new bill reinstated them and made them permanent.That doesn't mean that high-deductible plans must offer telehealth services for enrollees to be eligible for an HSA. Rather, such plans cannot be excluded simply because they allow participants to receive telehealth without contributing toward the deductible.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Adriana Kugler testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2023. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFormer Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, actions that led up to her abrupt resignation, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.The report comes three months after Kugler mysteriously left from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.Kugler's resignation came after she requested and was denied a waiver by Chair Jerome Powell on a disclosure form that showed she had impermissible holdings, Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC.com.An official said that concerns related to trading activity by Kugler or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report.In a note on Friday's disclosure, an Ethics official says, \"Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year\" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.Another note on the report says, \"Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.\"Troubles with tradesKugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called \"blackout periods\" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler requested a waiver of the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, according to Fed officials who spoke with CNBC.Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said.Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.\"These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,\" Kugler said at the time.\"Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.\"CNBC has reached out to Kugler for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of \"pro bono legal services\" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.Pro bono means for free.CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.Rule changesAfter she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them left their positions amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.",

    "body": "Visitors in front of the Cinderella Castle at Tokyo Disneyland in Tokyo, Japan on Jan. 17, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan on Monday said it dispatched a senior foreign ministry official to China to ease rising tensions, public broadcaster NHK reported, as tourism-exposed stocks in Tokyo slumped amid the diplomatic feud.Masaaki Kanai, a director-general at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is expected to meet his counterpart Liu Jinsong on Tuesday, according to media outlet Kyodo.Japan's tourism-exposed stocks fell Monday after Beijing issued a travel and study alert for its citizens considering going to Japan.Beauty and cosmetics firm Shiseido, which relies heavily on Chinese spending, plunged 9.08%. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan department-store chains, lost more than 11%.Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, declined 5.68%. Shares of airline operator ANA Holdings fell 3.35%. Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, a rail, retail and hotel operator, was 1.99% lower.China on Thursday accused Japan of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks \"egregious\" and demanded a retraction.Takaichi has refused to walk back her comments, although she acknowledged she would adopt a more cautious tone when addressing such matters in parliament.Beijing on Friday issued a travel advisory, saying Takaichi's remarks had raised risks for Chinese nationals in Japan. Chinese airlines responded by offering full refunds or free itinerary changes for flights to Japan.China's foreign ministry said Takaichi's remarks amounted to a provocation. \"These actions by Japan have inevitably raised strong questions and concerns among its Asian neighbors and the international community,\" China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said, according to a Google translation of his Mandarin remarks.Japan was the fourth-most popular outbound destination for Chinese travelers in the first 11 months of 2024, accounting for more than 5% of all overseas trips, according to a Citibank report, citing data from the China Tourism Academy. Almost one-fifth of international visitors to Japan in 2024 came from China, or around 7 million people, according to provisional data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.Tokyo on Saturday urged Beijing to keep its response measured, Japan's top government spokesperson, Minoru Kihara, was quoted by Kyodo as saying, adding that China should take \"appropriate measures,\" without offering details.These flare-ups come amid a history of nationalist-driven backlash against Japanese businesses in the mainland. In 2023, Chinese consumers, angered by Japan's release of treated Fukushima nuclear-plant wastewater, mounted a boycott of Japanese cosmetics and household-goods brands.",

    "body": "The exterior of the main entrance of Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordDEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s \"Glass House\" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.Currently nicknamed \"The Hub,\" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordFrom an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between office functions and design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or \"neighborhoods,\" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.\"It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,\" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.A coffee bar in Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordAs of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.\"We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,\" Dobleske said.Read more CNBC auto newsInside Ford’s new HQ: Rotisserie chickens and design secretsFord partners with Amazon for dealers to sell used vehicles onlineJeep eyes U.S. comeback following yearslong sales troublesTesla recalls 10,500 Powerwall 2 battery systems due to overheating, fire riskScratch kitchensSome of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts\" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.A worker takes out a batch of rotisserie chickens inside Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025, in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBC\"We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,\" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. \"We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.\"Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.\"This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,\" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre \"Horsepower Park,\" surrounding the building.An herb garden inside the dining and kitchen area of Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBCInside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light. Those design courtyards are exclusive areas that can only be viewed by the surrounding, private studios.Most of the four-story building features outside natural light from the exterior glass walls as well as skylights and other windowed areas.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, which will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordHidden designsIn addition to making a more walkable exterior campus, Ford wants employees to use purposefully designed stairs rather than elevators and escalators that are the primary modes of transportation in its most-recent 12-story headquarters.Craig Dykers, founding partner of Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta that worked on the building, said each staircase in the building, especially in its 14 different arrival areas, are prominent and meant to be inviting to use.\"Obviously people don't naturally want to climb a stair, so you have to design it very carefully so that people feel good about using the stair,\" he said. \"Part of the trick is that as you go up one flight, you don't necessarily see the next flight, so it's kind of a journey.\"Stairs inside the main lobby of the building are extremely wide and feature seating areas alongside the actual low-rise stairs. There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.Ford Bronco parts painted white in the American Road Lobby of the automaker's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordThe coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Others are photos or drawings of vehicles, while some are simply non-automotive artistic pieces.Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing.What employees will not see much of is the company's logo, the well-known blue oval surrounding the \"Ford\" name. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior.

    "body": "A SK Hynix Inc. 12-layer HBM3E memory chip displayed at the Semiconductor Exhibition in Seoul, South Korea. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChipmakers and analysts are warning of a memory chip shortage that could hit the consumer electronics and automotive industries next year, as companies prioritize massive demand from the artificial intelligence boom. In an earnings call on Friday, the CEO of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest contract chipmaker, said that fears of a memory chip shortage were prompting its customers to hold back orders for other types of chips used in their products.\"Everyone is hesitant to place too many orders or ship too much in the first quarter of next year because they don't know how many mobile phones, cars, or other products [the memory chip industry] can supply,\" said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-CEO, according to a Google translation. Analysts say these supply constraint concerns come as chip manufacturers focus on advanced memory chips used in artificial intelligence computing, with less focus on production needed for consumer products. \"The AI build-out is absolutely eating up a lot of the available chip supply, and 2026 looks to be far bigger than this year in terms of overall demand,\" Dan Nystedt, vice president of research at TriOrient, told CNBC. AI servers primarily run on processors from chip designers like Nvidia. These AI processors heavily rely on a type of memory known as High-Bandwidth Memory or HBM, which has proven extremely lucrative for memory companies like SK Hynix and Micron to pursue. Memory suppliers have been chasing as much of this AI demand as possible thanks to typically high margins, Nystedt said, noting that AI server companies are willing to pay top dollar for premium chips. \"It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,\" he said. Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that the memory industry suffered some severe downturns in 2023 and part of 2024, leading to under-investment in the industry. \"They're building new capacity now, but it will take time to get running.\"Broader impacts In the face of supply constraints, memory companies have reportedly been raising prices of their chips. Just last Friday, Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics had quietly raised prices on select memory chips by as much as 60% compared to September. Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \"With memory prices rising and availability shrinking, concerns about production bottlenecks are gaining traction,\" M.S. Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. \"Supply tightness is already hitting low-end smartphones and set-top boxes, but we think the risk could broaden,\" he added. China is \"feeling the pinch more acutely\" due to high reliance on low-cost devices, but Hwang cautioned that the supply constraints were a global problem.  In the meantime, consumers could pay the price of memory shortages. In a report on Monday, tech-focused market intelligence and consulting firm TrendForce predicted that the memory industry has begun a \"robust upward pricing cycle,\" which could force downstream brands to hike retail prices, adding pressure on the consumer market.As a result, the research group predicted increased price and demand pressures for consumer products like smartphones and notebooks. ",

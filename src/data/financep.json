    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently opened up about his phone habits at work, including never reading text messages and having his phone notifications turned off.\"I don't have notifications,\" the finance boss told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview. \"If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.\"He added: \"The only notifications I get is from my kids. That's it. When they text me, I get that.\"The 69-year-old revealed that he doesn't carry his phone around with him all the time and prioritizes deep focus at work.\"When I'm walking around the building and going to meetings, I don't have it on me. It's in my office,\" he said. \"When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I'm 100% focused on us, what you're talking about, why you're talking about it, as opposed to I'm distracted and I'm thinking about other things.\"Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is \"disrespectful\" and \"wastes time.\"\"If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,\" he said at the time.He explained that meetings should have a purpose and that checking emails and getting distracted are red flags.Working from homeDimon has remained critical of some of the newest shifts in the workplake brought about by the youngest generation at work: Gen Z. Dimon has adhered to more traditional ways of working, often expecting his employees to do the same.Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week.Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the \"damage\" that work from home was doing to younger recruits.\"Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of ... I've had it with this kind of stuff,\" he said in the recording.\"They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company.\"He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. \"And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does,\" he added.Work etiquetteAnastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. A 2023 survey by Reviews.org found that Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day.She explained that even just a having a phone near you can be extremely distracting. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette.\"I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name,\" Dedyukhina said.That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable. This includes asking follow up questions and paraphrasing and repeating what the other person said back to them.",

    "body": "Traditional job interview methods that have a candidate tell, rather than show, their strengths may be responsible for employers \"missing diamonds in the rough,\" says Adam Grant. Instead, he says, interviewers should try incorporating two steps to assess a candidate's true potential and fit for the job.Grant, a bestselling author and organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, shared tips for improving the interview process while speaking at WOBI's World Business Forum in New York City on Nov. 5.He cited research that \"how well somebody does a job is not indicated by how the first interview goes, it's how much growth they show from the first interview to the second.\"Of course, hiring teams don't always have the time or resources to give everyone a second chance if they flub the first interview. But Grant shared an alternative that still affords candidates a do-over without requiring the hiring team carve out time for another interview.\"Even if you could pause an interview halfway and say, 'Hey, I've got a couple of notes for you,' and then watch the motivation and ability to grow from the first attempt to the second, that is a great window into is somebody excited to get better and also do they have the capability to learn the skills that you're trying to get them to excel at.\"Besides giving feedback and a chance to improve if candidates have a rocky start, Grant includes a task in the interview that's part of the actual job to see a person's skills and potential in action.'I have been guilty of this'Grant shared a personal anecdote of how he almost missed out on hiring a top performer because of his own approach to interviewing applicants. Before becoming an organizational psychologist, he led an advertising team and was hiring salespeople. He recalled one candidate who seemed to be \"the worst fit for sales imaginable\" based on his resume.Grant was desperate to fill the role so he interviewed the applicant regardless, but remained unimpressed. He told the company's president the candidate wouldn't be good for the role because he never made eye contact during the 45-minute interview.\"I didn't know a thing about neurodivergence then,\" Grant noted.The company's president responded, \"You realize this is a phone sales job, right? There is no eye contact in this job.\"Grant suddenly realized he'd been so focused on confirming his belief that the candidate was a poor fit, and he learned a lesson.\"I realized I had to reboot our hiring process,\" he said. \"If you want to gauge somebody's potential, the best thing you can do is actually give them a challenge that's really part of the job and watch how they handle it.\"So he brought all of the candidates back and asked them to sell him a rotten apple. Grant chose that because all of the candidates would be familiar with an apple, so it would level the playing field, and because \"if you could get me excited about a rotten apple, you could definitely sell our products,\" he said.The candidate Grant had frowned upon before dove right in with his sales pitch.\"This may look like a rotten apple; it's actually an aged, antique apple,\" Grant recalled him saying. \"You know the saying 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away?' Well, because of the nutrients in the aging process, you only need to eat one of these a week. And then afterwards you can plant the seeds in your backyard.\"Though Grant joked he had \"some serious honesty and integrity questions\" about the candidate, he hired him, and the man ended up being the best salesperson on the team.\"What I learned from that story was not just that I needed to see him in action to gauge his potential,\" Grant said. \"But also, I needed to give him a do-over.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "\"My child won't tell me anything about their day!\" It's a common concern I hear from parents in my psychotherapy office. They're hoping to gain a glimpse into their child's world. But asking \"How was school today?\" usually leads to a one-word answer.As a therapist and the author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do,\" I encourage parents to ask questions that are thoughtful and spark meaningful conversations. When kids reflect on their experiences, they practice skills like emotional awareness, problem-solving, and empathy, and develop a growth mindset.Here are seven questions that lead to productive conversations while also helping kids grow mentally stronger:1. 'What was the best part of your day?'This question encourages kids to scan their brains for positives. For children who dislike school or tend to focus on what went wrong, answering this question helps them build optimism and gratitude — which are both protective factors for mental health.Frame the question with your own experience, saying, \"The best part of my day was going for a walk during my lunch break. What about you?\" Your child might share a highlight, like, \"I played kickball at recess.\"2. 'What's a mistake you learned from today?'This one normalizes errors and celebrates healthy risk-taking. Talking openly about mistakes reduces shame and helps kids see them as opportunities for growth.Ask with a tone of curiosity, not judgment: \"Did anything happen today that you'd do differently next time?\" This might prompt them to say, \"I forgot my library book so I'm going to pack it tonight so I don't forget.\"3. 'Who were you proud of today?'It works because it turns their attention to others and cultivates empathy. You will also gain insight into your child's relationships and what they value.Make the question more specific by asking, for example, \"Did you see anyone try really hard at something today?\" Your child may talk about a friend who was brave or might give themselves a pat on the back and say, \"My friend forgot her snack so I shared mine.\"4. 'What's one thing that would have made today better?'This question helps kids identify feelings like frustration and disappointment without dwelling on those experiences. It naturally opens the door to problem-solving and planning.You can ask in a fun way, such as, \"If you had a magic wand to change one thing about today, what would it be?\" This can lead to creative ideas, like, \"I wish there was more time for my art project so maybe I'll bring it home to finish it.\" 5. 'Who did you help today?'You can empower kids to engage in prosocial behavior with questions like this. When you ask regularly, kids begin to look for opportunities to be helpful and acts of kindness become second nature.  Ask about small acts of contribution: \"How were you a helper today?\" They might remember something simple, like, \"I helped the teacher pass out papers.\"6. 'What was the most interesting thing you learned today?'It emphasizes curiosity over academic performance. Showing interest in the learning process itself fuels lifelong learning.Encourage kids to talk about what they learned aside from just their subjects. They may share a fun fact, like, \"I learned that my teacher knows how to play the violin.\" Show interest and ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation going.7. 'What's something new you'd like to try?'This nudges kids to look outside their comfort zone and encourages them to be courageous. They don't have to be good at something in order to try something new — it's a learning experience. If your child hesitates to try new things, encourage an experiment by asking, \"Is there a club or activity you're curious about just trying once?\" They may be more likely to explore if they know they don't have to stick with it forever.Amy Morin is a psychotherapist, clinical social worker and instructor at Northeastern University. She is the author of several books including \"13 Things Strong Kids Do: Think Big, Feel Good, Act Brave\" and \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do.\" Her TEDx talk \"The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong\" is one of the most viewed talks of all time.

    "body": "Kai Yang Chan (left) and JiaYi Zhou (right) run Singapore-based bakery Cake Inspiration.Courtesy of Cake InspirationWhen Kai Yang Chan and Jiayi Zhuo matched on Tinder at age 19, neither of them expected that it would lead to marriage. Six years later, not only have they tied the knot — they're also business partners.\"I downloaded Tinder because I was very bored in school, so I was just [swiping] through during class,\" said Zhuo. \"Both of us — we didn't expect that we'd get together,\" she said.\"Personality wise, we are quite different,\" she said, adding that while she is more introverted, her husband is the life of the party.Today, Chan and Zhuo run Singapore-based bakery CakeInspiration. Their business brought in over 850,000 Singapore dollars (about $650,000) in 2024, and is on track to surpass $775,000 in revenue this year, according to documentation reviewed by CNBC Make It.The company is known for its custom cake designs, and its clientele includes family offices, hospitals and even global celebrities.A family affairCakeInspiration originally began as a home-based bakery in 2010, run by Zhuo's parents.\"My parents actually started [the business] when I was nine,\" said Zhuo. \"I was never very studious, but I really like being hands on. So I like to bake, I like to dance. I like to create all these little pretty things,\" she said. From the early days of the business, she often helped with designing cakes.Then, when the pandemic hit, sales stalled and the business began to burn through cash to stay afloat. With her parents contemplating retirement, Zhuo knew it was time for her to step in.Courtesy of CakeInspiration\"I [felt] that it's a waste to just let it go. I [saw] my parents work like 16 hours a day growing up, so ... I [didn't] want the business to get shut down,\" she said.In 2020, Zhuo officially joined her parent's business and expanded the company's product range. She eventually introduced two new brands — Eggyi.Co, which sells bento cakes, or mini, single-serving sized cakes targeted at Gen-Z, and Petissier which sells customised cakes for pets.The introduction of these two brands ultimately helped to save the family's business through Covid, said Zhuo. Today, their prices range from about $100 to $10,000 per order, and they have a staff of about 14 people across two kitchens — one for human cakes, and one for pet cakes.Shooting for the starsSimilar to Zhuo, Chan's passions lied outside of academics growing up.\"I wasn't really the most studious person, [but] I always loved the idea of entrepreneurship and doing our own thing,\" said Chan. \"Since I was 16, I did my own little startups, selling whatever. [I sold] sneakers, I'd buy them, clean them up and sell them. You know, whatever that can make money, I'll do it,\" he said.In 2022, he decided to join his wife in the family business full-time. He introduced a new strategy: rather than only selling directly to individual consumers (B2C), he suggested trying to sell to other businesses (B2B) to create a more consistent source of revenue.In addition, he was focused on building the company's brands online. Along with working to build a presence across social media platforms, Chan started targeting celebrities and influencers who came into town.A custom made cake for social media influencers, the Ha Sisters, by CakeInspiration.Courtesy of CakeInspirationIn June, three Korean-American content creators — sisters Evelyn, Erica and Emily Ha — were in Singapore for a beauty store pop-up event. When Chan discovered they were in town, he saw an opportunity to surprise them with a cake.\"It's actually quite crazy, because they were in Singapore for this beauty store pop-up... They posted a story of them in a hotel, and I thought: 'Hey, this looks really familiar. I know [which] hotel this is,'\" he said. \"So I just prepared a cake and then we just zoomed down to the hotel.\"Chan and his team quickly made a custom cake for the sisters and timed the delivery to coincide with the end of the Ha sisters' event. \"Of course, after the pop-up, you have to go back to [the hotel to] change, right? Yeah. So [that's when I] went there,\" he said.By chance, his timing was perfect. Just as he arrived at the hotel entrance with the cake in hand, he ran into the sisters — and managed to hand-deliver the surprise. One of the Ha sisters later shared a video of the cake to social media, which ultimately reached over 500,000 views.This interaction kicked off the company's celebrity marketing strategy. To date, CakeInspiration has also delivered custom cakes to K-Pop band BlackPink's Lisa, Russell Simmons, G-Dragon and more.Despite popular advice to avoid working with your partner, for Chan and Zhuo, working together as a couple has actually been a big advantage. While Chan is best at partnerships, marketing and anything external-facing, Zhuo is best at managing day-to-day operations and all things internal.\"We don't have conflicts about work because our roles are very defined ... So usually I don't tell her how to run things inside, and she doesn't really tell me how to run things outside. I guess we trust each other to fulfill our roles to the best of our abilities,\" said Chan.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

It's about choosing the experiences more than just the destination.\"Two U.S. destinations were ranked in the top 10: Vail, Colorado, and New Haven, Connecticut.

Americans have been going to Costa Rica for decades now, but it's been more about the Pacific coast,\" Losada says. \"This time we're talking about the Caribbean Coast.

    "body": "Crystals of gallium are seen in a laboratory at Freiberg University of Mining and Technology in Saxony, Germany on 13 September 2023.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesChina has rolled back a number of restrictions on its export of critical minerals and rare earth materials to the United States, in a sign that a trade truce between the world's two largest economies is holding.China's Ministry of Commerce said Friday that it would suspend some export controls on critical minerals used in military hardware, semiconductors and other high-tech industries for a year.The suspended restrictions, first imposed on Oct. 9, include limits on the export of certain rare earth elements, lithium battery materials, and processing technologies.The export relaxations follow talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Busan, South Korea, on Oct. 30. Beijing also reversed retaliatory curbs on exports of gallium, germanium, antimony and other so-called super-hard materials such as synthetic diamonds and boron nitrides. Those measures, introduced in December 2024, were widely seen as retaliation for Washington's expanded semiconductor export restrictions on China. China classifies such materials as \"dual-use items,\" meaning they can be used for both civilian and military purposes.Beyond military applications, these critical minerals are used across the semiconductor industry and other high-tech sectors — sectors at the heart of U.S.-China trade tensions.Beijing has also suspended the stricter end-user and end-use verification checks for exports of dual-use graphite to the U.S., which were imposed in December 2024 alongside the broader export ban.China dominates global production of most critical minerals and rare earth elements and has increasingly used its export policies as leverage in trade disputes. As part of the latest China-U.S. trade deal, the U.S. has agreed to several concessions, including lowering tariffs on Chinese imports by 10 percentage points, and suspending Trump's heightened \"reciprocal tariffs\" on Chinese imports until Nov. 10, 2026.The U.S. will also postpone a rule announced Sept. 29 that would have blacklisted majority-owned subsidiaries of Chinese companies on its entity list.",

    "body": "U.S. Supreme Court Police stand behind security barriers in front of the Court building, which is obscured in construction scaffolding, on the first day of the Court’s new term on October 06, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesA federal appeals court in Boston, for a second time, late Sunday flatly rejected a request by the Trump administration to block a lower court judge's order that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.But the judge's order remains paused as a result of a prior Supreme Court ruling until at least Tuesday night. That gives the administration time to return to the Supreme Court and ask for a permanent stay of the order pending its appeal of the case.The ruling Sunday by a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture threatened states that have issued full benefits since Friday with financial penalties if they do not \"undo\" those payments. And it came hours after the Senate narrowly passed the first step of a bipartisan deal that might reopen the government within days, and fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through next September.\"In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,\" wrote Circuit Court Judge Julie Rikelman in the panel's decision Sunday. \"As the district court found, 'this is a problem that could have been avoided.'\"\"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" Rikelman wrote.\"In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 [temporary restraining order after the government had failed to comply with it.\"The Trump administration on Oct. 24 broke decades of precedent when it said it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because Congress had not appropriated money for the program, or any other government program, past the date the shutdown began, Oct. 1. Past administrations had paid SNAP benefits in full during other shutdowns.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration rejected the idea of the remaining $4.6 billion in a contingency fund that Congress had specifically allocated to backstop SNAP.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of nonprofits, local governments, a union, and a food retailer, sued the administration in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island seeking a judicial order forcing the administration to use the contingency fund and other pools of money to fully fund SNAP benefits.Judge Jack McConnell, who is overseeing the case, ordered the administration to make at least partial benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund, and to investigate if other money could be used.McConnell on Thursday ordered that the administration pay full benefits, days after the administration told him it would pay only partial benefits — but that it would take some time to do so — and told him that it had ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds. McConnell ordered that the administration use Section 32 funds to make up the difference between the 65% of benefits the administration planned to pay by using the contingency fund and the full value of the benefits. SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion each month.The administration then asked the 1st Circuit for a temporary stay of McConnell's order on an emergency basis, which the appeals court rejected on Friday.But the appeals court at the same time also said it was still considering the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] ... and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"On Friday night, Supreme Court Ketanji Brown Jackson, acting on a request by the administration, paused McConnell's order from taking effect and told the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the request for the stay pending appeal.Jackson's order paused for 48 hours any ruling by the 1st Circuit from taking effect.

    "body": "David Ryder | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHigh valuations for artificial intelligence (AI) stocks were the focus of the market this week, with fears of a potential AI bubble capping investor sentiment. But the view on Wall Street is still that several tech stocks offer strong fundamentals and are delivering rapid, AI-induced growth, justifying their sky-high valuations.The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors find attractive AI stocks displaying  robust long-term growth outlooks.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.AmazonE-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN) recently impressed investors with its upbeat Q3 results. Accelerating growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit confirmed the Street's faith in Amazon's expansion into artificial intelligence.In reaction to the solid Q3 print and the recently-announced deal with OpenAI, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley increased his price forecast for Amazon to $315 from $300 and reiterated a buy rating. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on AMZN stock, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $276.Walmsley said that the Q3 performance, OpenAI deal and positive outlook for Amazon's Trainium chips made him more optimistic toward AWS's long-term growth. In fact, the 5-star analyst expects acceleration in AWS revenue growth from 20% in Q3 to 21% in Q4 2025 and 22% in the first quarter of 2026. He expects AWS revenue to rise by 23% to $157 billion in the full year 2026, followed by a 22% increase to $192 billion in 2027 — above the Street's expectations of $154 billion and $185 billion for 2026 and 2027, respectively.\"We believe investors continue to rotate into AMZN shares given a valuation well below its historic ranges and positive news likely to continue into the AWS ReInvent Conference in early December,\" said Walmsley.The analyst's bullish investment thesis is also based on the cost-to-serve improvements in Amazon's retail business, driven by automation in fulfillment centers and an enhanced logistics network.Walmsley ranks No. 103 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.5%. See Amazon Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks.AlphabetThis second stock pick is Google- and YouTube owner Alphabet (GOOGL). The company reported better-than-expected third-quarter results, with AI driving solid momentum in its cloud business.Impressed by the Q3 performance, JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth raised his price target for Alphabet to $340 from $300 and reaffirmed a buy rating. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $316 with an \"outperform\" rating on GOOGL.Anmuth highlighted that Q3 marked the first time that Alphabet's quarterly revenue crossed the $100 billion mark. The top-rated analyst noted Alphabet's robust performance in the third quarter, with double-digit growth across every major business.Interestingly, Anmuth believes that Q3 results and favorable insights on AI search formats could change investors' views toward Google's AI search transition. Alphabet noted AI-induced acceleration in query growth and paid clicks, while Anmuth noted that industry conversations indicate that paid clicks using Google's AI Overviews (AIO) and AI Mode (AIM) features are driving higher conversion rates.\"Overall, the AI search transition has been viewed as the greatest risk to Google, but additional signs that AI search is more opportunity than threat will continue to flip the narrative,\" said Anmuth.The analyst is also encouraged by the surge in Google Cloud's backlog to $155 billion. He contends that the figure doesn't include all the gains from the recently announced expansion of GOOGL's partnership with Anthropic, implying a further increase in the backlog at the end of the fourth quarter. Overall, Anmuth is confident about Alphabet's prospects and said it remains JPMorgan's Top 2 idea, behind only Amazon.Anmuth ranks No. 113 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 22%. See Alphabet Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Advanced Micro DevicesThe third tech giant this week is chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which delivered strong results in the third quarter of Fiscal 2025. AMD attributed stronger earnings and revenue to its expanding compute business and fast-growing AI data center segment.In reaction, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy increased his price target for AMD to $280 from $240 and reiterated a buy rating. With a price target of $285, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AMD stock.Roy noted that AMD's Q3 top line was driven by strength across the company's data center, AI, server and PC businesses. The 5-star analyst highlighted management's optimism toward continued momentum in Q4 FY25, with revenue expected to grow 25% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. AMD expects Q4 revenue growth will be supported by strong performances in its data center, client and embedded businesses, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the gaming segment.Interestingly, Roy believes that AMD's performance in the near-term is being fueled more by increasing demand for server central processing units and continued share gains in client CPUs rather than data center AI graphics processing units. The analyst expects AMD's data center AI GPU business to increase to a range of $6 billion to $6.5 billion in FY25, versus a prior estimate of $5 billion.\"Looking ahead, we continue to believe that AMD is executing well as the company nears production shipments of the MI400/450 series GPUs and the Helios rack next year,\" Roy said.The analyst is also optimistic on AMD's recently-announced deals with OpenAI and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, saying they provide clarity on the longer-term growth outlook in its data center AI business. Roy awaits further insights from AMD about its technology roadmap and total addressable market (TAM)  at an upcoming Analyst Day event on November 11.Roy ranks No. 20 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 34.4%. See AMD Statistics on TipRanks.",

    "body": "In 2020, Anita Kinoshita, 28 years old at the time, started looking into buying a house.Kinoshita was living in California and making around $70,000 a year as a software engineer for the Department of Defense.As a first-generation American from a farming family in Mexico, Kinoshita believed the best way to finally achieve the American dream her family had for her was to own property.\"I had my first big girl job and thought the next responsible thing to do would be to buy a house,\" Kinoshita tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't necessarily want to buy a house. In fact, I was trying to figure out how to finesse the purchase.\"Initially, Kinoshita was seeking a property with the intent to sublet some of the bedrooms and lower her share of the expenses. She had about $20,000 saved for a down payment.\"My vision for the future was to be able to have a family and spend as much time with them and not necessarily have an office job. [But] I still went forward with what made sense for this American Dream path,\" she says.\"I was 28 at the time, so I still kind of cared what my community defined as successful, and homeownership was part of that. At the time, I thought it was the responsible thing to do.\"Kinoshita always believed achieving the American Dream meant owning property.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita wanted to learn as much as she could about the home-buying journey she was embarking on. She enrolled in a nine-week course that teaches people how to manage their money, offered by Financial Peace University.During the retirement module of the online class, Kinoshita used a retirement calculator that helped her realize that if she started contributing a bit more to her 401(k), she could retire around age 55 and buy a house at the same time.\"All of a sudden, the vision I had for the future and the freedom and lifestyle I wanted became possible in my mind for the first time,\" she says.For two years, Kinoshita looked at least a dozen places and put in a total of four offers. She got accepted for one, but then the sellers backed out. She was also approved for a single-family home, but there was a mismatch in the appraisal, so she walked away from the deal.\"I ended up backing out because the only way to be competitive during that time was to invest less and save more for the down payment, and I wasn't willing to do that,\" she says.\"Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't the time for me at the moment, and I was not willing to invest less either. I wasn't satisfied with my career and felt like I was living my dad's dream and not really mine.\"Kinoshita viewed a dozen properties and put in a total of four offers.Anita KinoshitaRedefining successKinoshita switched her focus. Instead of saving for a down payment, she set a goal of having $500,000 invested in her retirement accounts. By April 2022, she had invested $200,000 and reached COAST FIRE — a strategy where you save and invest enough to eventually stop contributing to your retirement accounts and let the compound growth continue rising so you're on track to have a traditional retirement. She decided to quit her job.Kinoshita isn't alone in choosing to wait to buy a house. The median age of a first-time home buyer has gone up in recent years, from 35 in 2023 to 38 in 2024 alone, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.After quitting her full-time job, Kinoshita started working part-time, creating curriculum for California State University, Monterey Bay and making financial literacy content online. Both of these positions made her more money than when she was working as a software engineer.Kinoshita, now 34, is going to wait until she reaches early COAST FIRE, which, when you have enough invested, lets you stop contributing by the age you decide, versus the traditional retirement age of 67. Kinoshita quit her job and is now making financial literacy content online.Anita KinoshitaHer projected retirement age is now 45, and she expects to have $1.5 million invested by then.\"I value my time and freedom a little bit more than I value home ownership. In retrospect, I think if I had bought the house, I would have felt trapped in my career,\" she says.Kinoshita and her husband recently moved to the California neighborhood where they would one day like to own a home. They pay $4,000 a month in rent and live in a single-family home in a gated community, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.When the couple is ready to buy, she estimates they will have about $300,000 saved to put toward the home. But they still don't know when they will start getting serious about buying.\"I'm not in a rush. I don't want to use it as a financial tool in any way. I'm looking at it more as a luxury and less as an asset these days,\" she says. \"I would rather have my money working for me in the stock market than in real estate.\"Kinoshita and her husband are now renting in the neighborhood they hope to buy one day.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita says her definition of a dream home has also changed.\"I don't want too many bedrooms.

    "body": "Everyone who knows me knows that I can't stand owing money. I pay down my credit cards every month, and I complete Venmo requests the second I get them.The only debt I have left is my student loan, which has been on minimum payment autopilot since I graduated from college in 2013. For many years, I left those payments on the back burner, funneling any extra savings I had toward my investments.Recently, though, my financial strategy changed after my fiancé and I began planning for a wedding in summer 2027. I sold a fair amount of stock and dialed back my retirement contributions in order to build our wedding fund.For the first time in my life, I'm sitting on a pile of cash. And I have to say, I'm very tempted to use a chunk of it to wipe out my loan.Hear me out. My student debt carries an interest rate of 6.55% and is scheduled to be paid off in late 2027. If I paid my loan off now, I could take my monthly loan payment, plus a few extra dollars, tack it on to my regular contributions to the wedding fund, and still hit our funding goal on time. Plus, I'd be debt-free.I chatted with a few certified financial planners, and pretty much everyone agreed that the math works in my favor.\"If you have the funds available, paying off the loans first is a smart move,\" says MaryAnne Gucciardi, a CFP with Wealthmind Financial Planning. \"That's a guaranteed 6.55% 'return,' which is higher than what you're likely earning in even the best high-yield savings account.\"So as you're reading this, I've already paid the loan off, right? Well, no. I actually decided against it. Here's why.My decision to hold off on repaying my loan, for nowThe mathematical principle Gucciardi points out is an important one that applies to a broad array of situations in personal finance. Paying down a loan with a particular interest rate is equivalent to earning an annualized return on an investment.It's a quick and dirty way to decide how to prioritize your financial goals. If you have credit card debt at 20% — currently right around the average, according to Bankrate — paying it down is like earning 20% a year in the stock market. Because that's a figure your portfolio is unlikely to earn on a long-term basis, the thinking goes, you're better off prioritizing the debt.The same logic applies to my loan. The 3.4% annual percentage yield we're earning in our savings account falls short of the 6.55% I owe on my loans.The cost of making such a move, Gucciardi and others pointed out to me, is liquidity. Once I make the lump sum payment, I won't be able to go to my student loan servicer and ask for my money back. Catching up by the time of our wedding date is as easy as redirecting the freed-up cash from my student loan payment to put toward the wedding fund. But a lot could go wrong between now and then.What if I lose my job? Or one of us needs expensive medical treatment? Or elements of our wedding end up costing much more than we budgeted for? I have emergency savings, but a few things going wrong could make what looked really easy on paper into something really hard in real life.So I did some more math. I've paid off 81% of my student debt, meaning that the vast majority of my payment these days goes toward paying down the principal rather than the interest. By my calculations, paying the loan now, instead of continuing with minimum payments, would save me somewhere between $400 and $500 in interest.\"That net difference is the price of financial flexibility,\" says Sean Pearson, a CFP with Ameriprise Financial Services. \"It's the price of doing the things that you want to do that are the most important to you when you need to get them done.\"To be clear, my financial priorities might not be the same as yours, and it's worth discussing your own goals with a financial advisor. Right now, the wedding is the most important thing I'm saving money for. I want it be everything my fiancé and I envision, and I want our (frankly, too many) guests to have an amazing time. Having the extra cash on hand in case anything comes up is worth paying my student loan servicer an extra $400.It's a lesson I'm applying to my broader financial life too. While certain financial strategies are mathematically optimal, they may not fit within my particular set of goals.\"While imperfect, the best solution is often to make a budget that allows you to reach your priorities when they exist on your timeline and remember that the calendar is as important to your financial plan as your calculator,\" Pearson says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a memo late Saturday evening, threatened to enact financial penalties on states that issued full monthly SNAP benefits for November if they don't \"undo\" those food stamp payments.The late-night directive from the Trump administration adds to the chaos surrounding the anti-hunger program that serves more than 42 million Americans.The memo, signed by Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary of the USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, warned states that the administration had not cleared full SNAP benefit payments for November.\"To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,\" the memo said.State program administrators were directed to distribute 65% partial payments of SNAP benefits for the month instead, the memo said.States must also \"immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,\" the memo said. Failure to comply could result in the USDA cancelling the federal share of administration costs or holding states financially liable for \"any overissuances that result from the noncompliance.\"It was unclear how the USDA expects states to claw back any unauthorized SNAP payments.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., blasted the Trump administration's move.\"The cruelty is the point. It is their choice to do this,\" Klobuchar wrote in a post on the social media site X.The USDA and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe memo was first reported by The New York Times.It comes as some states scrambled to comply with a court ruling on Thursday, when a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November on Friday. The judge rejected the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program amid the U.S. government shutdown.The USDA subsequently told states that it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with that order, even as the ruling faced an appeal from the Trump administration.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"The administration asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency injunction to block the order that it pay full food stamp benefits pending the outcome of its appeal of that order. A three-judge panel on the appeals court denied that request on Friday.But within hours, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the order. Jackson directed the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the administration's motion to impose an indefinite stay on the lower court's order mandating full benefits.The Trump administration previously said that it would not use a contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November.U.S. District Court of Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell on Oct. 31 told the administration to use that fund to pay partial benefits, at least, and to explore other options to provide full benefits.The administration, days later, said it would pay 65% of the benefits, but ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds to make up the difference.The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1. Hopes that the shutdown may be nearing an end were buoyed Sunday evening after Senate lawmakers took a critical step towards a potential deal to reopen the government, but there are no guarantees lawmakers will come to an agreement anytime soon.Past administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol is shown up North Capitol Street on Nov. 6, 2025 in Washington, DC.Eric Lee | Getty ImagesThe Senate late Sunday night passed the first stage of a deal that would end the U.S. government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.The procedural measure that allows other votes essential to the agreement to be held starting on Monday was approved with the bare minimum of 60 yes votes, after eight senators in the Democratic caucus broke with party leadership to support the deal. Forty senators voted no.Voting was held open on the Senate floor for more than two hours to allow for the arrival of the final \"aye\" vote, cast by Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who flew to Washington, D.C., on Sunday evening for the proceeding.Senators broke into applause when Cornyn walked in to vote for the measure, just before 10:50 p.m. ET.The agreement, which was reached after round-the-clock negotiations over the weekend, would fund the U.S. government through the end of January.The deal does not include what had been the key demand for Democrats: an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of December.But the agreement, for the first time since the shutdown began, includes a guarantee by Republicans of a vote in December on a bill chosen by Democrats to extend those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance plans purchased on ACA marketplaces.The deal would need to be approved by the House of Representatives and signed into law by President Donald Trump before the shutdown ends.The deal calls for a reversal of all permanent layoffs of government employees during the shutdown and protection of such so-called reductions-in-force happening until the end of fiscal year 2026.It also guarantees that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown, when many of them were not allowed to work.The package includes provisions for having a bipartisan budget process and preventing the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.It would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.The Trump administration last week said that it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because of the shutdown, and on Friday won a temporary order from the Supreme Court blocking a federal judge's ruling mandating that full SNAP benefits be paid to recipients this month. The administration has said it will pay only partial food stamp benefits.With Cornyn not on the floor, the vote for more than 25 minutes was stuck at 56 ayes and 40 nays, with three other GOP senators, Rick Scott of Florida, Wisconsin's Ron Johnson and Mike Lee of Utah, not voting, for unclear reasons.All three eventually voted aye, in quick succession, after they spoke with Senate Majority Leader John Thune.One Republican, Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the measure.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key races\"After 40 long days, I'm hopeful that we can bring the shutdown to an end,\" said Thune, before the vote.Thune's efforts to pass a continuing resolution to reopen the government had failed in 14 prior votes before Sunday night.Thune negotiated the deal with the White House and three members of the Democratic caucus, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan, both Democrats from New Hampshire, and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.The other Democrats who voted for the deal were the party's whip, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, and Virginia's Tim Kaine.Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with the Democrats, called the deal \"horrific\" and said that the Republicans' agreement to schedule a vote next month on the ACA credits was a \"totally meaningless gesture.King, during a press conference while the vote was still ongoing, said that he would tell his constituents that he agreed to drop the main demand of extending the ACA credit \"because it wasn't working.\" \"It's been six weeks,\" King said. \"The Republicans made it clear they weren't going to discuss the health care issue, the Affordable Care Act tax credits, until the shutdown was over.\"Would it change in a week or another week or after Thanksgiving or Christmas? And there's no evidence that it would,\" he said. \"What there is evidence of is the harm that the shutdown is doing to the country.\" Shaheen, at the same press conference, said, \"This was the only deal on the table.\"\"It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the ACA tax credits that tens of millions of Americans rely on to keep costs down,\" Shaheen said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in angry remarks on the Senate floor, said he would not vote for the deal.Schumer blasted Republicans and Trump for refusing to agree to extend the ACA credits, which he said would lead to much higher health insurance costs for millions of people in 2026.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot, in good faith, support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said.Kaine, before voting to support the deal, said, \"I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans' health care mess and to protect the federal workforce.\"\"This deal guarantees a vote to extend Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, which Republicans weren't willing to do,\" Kaine said.\"Lawmakers know their constituents expect them to vote for it, and if they don't, they could very well be replaced at the ballot box by someone who will.\"A strong majority of Americans favor extending the enhanced subsidies, which were adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump proposed a compromise on health insurance payments, calling on Republicans to send federal payments that would go to insurers under the Affordable Care Act directly to Americans to bring an end to the government shutdown.\"I am recommending to Senate Republicans that the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars currently being sent to money sucking Insurance Companies in order to save the bad Healthcare provided by ObamaCare, BE SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE, and have money left over,\" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Saturday, without providing any details.The post comes one day after Senate Republicans rejected Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's deal that would have allowed the U.S. government to reopen after a shutdown that began Oct. 1. The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.The plan Democrats put forward on Friday proposed protecting federal ACA subsidies for at least one year, in exchange for dropping their demand that a longer-term extension of Obamacare tax credits be included in a stopgap government funding bill.Those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use, will expire at the end of December if Congress does not extend them.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., on Friday called the Democrats' proposal a \"non-starter.\"The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment or specifics on how Trump's proposed direct payment plan would work.Representatives for Sens. Schumer and Thune did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The D.C. offices for House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congressional lawmakers have been in a stalemate, unable to find a compromise to end the shutdown. Democrats want a funding bill to include health-care subsidies that are due to expire for 24 million Americans at year's end. Republicans, meanwhile, say Congress must first pass a funding bill without strings attached and allow the government to reopen before tackling other issues.In multiple posts on Saturday, Trump also reiterated his calls for terminating the filibuster, the Senate rule requiring 60 of its 100 members to pass most legislation. The GOP holds 53 seats in the Senate. There are 45 Democratic senators, and two independents who caucus with them.Senate Republicans have pushed back on changing the rule, saying earlier this week they would not support a change. Trump had called for his party to exercise what he called \"the Nuclear Option\" on the rule.On Saturday, Trump alleged that he is \"making progress\" with Republicans on changing the rule.\"The Democrats are cracking like dogs on the Shutdown because they are deathly afraid that I am making progress with the Republicans on TERMINATING THE FILIBUSTER! Whether we make a Deal or not, THE REPUBLICANS MUST 'BLOW UP' THE FILIBUSTER,\" he wrote.",

The White House has confirmed it does intend to send any high-level representatives to the summit, marking an unprecedented absence of U.S. officials at the conference.Roughly 50,000 delegates are expected to attend the 30th edition of the U.N. climate conference, known as COP30, with talks set to run through to Nov. 21.Anna Aberg, research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at Chatham House, a London-based think tank, said it was likely a positive for the international community that the Trump administration won't send any officials to Belem.\"It's, of course, really unfortunate that the Trump administration has withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for a second time … and that they are pursuing this very forceful anti-climate agenda both in the U.S., and increasingly also overseas,\" Aberg told CNBC by telephone.\"In light of this, I think it is just as well that they're not sending any senior officials to COP to be honest because I don't know what they would have been able to contribute given the way Trump is talking about climate change.\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the United Nations headquarters on September 23, 2025 in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTrump's views on the climate crisis are well known.The U.S. president has repeatedly described global heating as a \"hoax\" and speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in late September, said that climate change was the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"Trump also urged other countries to shift away from renewable energy. \"If you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" Trump said on Sept. 23.Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are among some of the other heads of state expected to skip the talks, although both countries are set to send delegations in their place.What's on the table at COP30?The annual U.N. climate summit is seen as a prime opportunity for the international community to move from setting decarbonization targets to delivering on them.Some of the core issues set to be discussed include a push to deliver on national climate commitments (NDCs), a transformation of the global financial system, ramping up adaptation measures and taking steps to protect nature.The conference comes at a time when the impacts of climate change have become increasingly clear — even as the issue has slipped down the immediate geopolitical agenda.Read moreSpeaking to world leaders as they prepare to convene for COP30, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres called for urgent action to drive down global temperatures and keep the 1.5 degrees Celsius target within reach.\"Every fraction of a degree means more hunger, displacement, and loss – especially for those least responsible. It could push ecosystems past irreversible tipping points, expose billions to unlivable conditions, and amplify threats to peace and security,\" Guterres said on Thursday in Belém.Failure to limit global heating would amount to \"moral failure and deadly negligence,\" he added.One of the most important issues at stake at COP30, Chatham House's Aberg said, was for the international community to deliver a shot in the arm for global efforts to tackle the climate crisis.\"We're in this really tricky geopolitical environment, not least given the U.S. withdrawal, and there are lots of things that this COP needs to achieve,\" Aberg said.Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attends the General Plenary of Leaders in the framework of the COP30 UN Climate Change Conference in Belem, Para State, Brazil, on November 6, 2025.    Pablo Porciuncula | Afp | Getty Images\"But I actually think that the most important thing it can do is to send a signal to the rest of the world that there are still governments and businesses and institutions that want to take action on climate change and are already taking action on climate change.\"Like many others, Aberg said that while the U.N. talks will be \"really important\" in shaping the discussion on how to tackle the climate crisis, the outcome was highly likely to be underwhelming.What do business leaders want to happen?Business leaders called on policymakers to provide further incentives to help accelerate climate action.Anders Danielsson, CEO of Skanska, for example, said the Swedish construction company is confident it can deliver on its own climate targets, while acknowledging that \"we cannot do it on our own.\"Speaking to CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Thursday, Danielsson said: \"We need political willingness to drive this forward.\"People watch as the sun rises over Ben Buckler Point in Bondi on November 27, 2024 in Sydney, Australia.Brook Mitchell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTobias Meyer, CEO of logistics giant DHL Group, said that he \"strongly\" believed a global price on carbon would be the best incentive to help curb rising greenhouse gas emissions.\"I think we need to get the job done,\" Meyer told CNBC on Thursday. \"We need a price [on] CO2 emissions that needs to be done globally. That's the best tool. Strongly believe in that, and then business needs to react to those price signals and use the technology that is available to drive down emissions.\"Meanwhile, Henrik Andersen, CEO of Danish wind turbine firm Vestas, urged renewable industry leaders to make sure they continue to make themselves heard in the shift toward low-carbon technologies.\"It's not only about COP,\" Andersen told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday. \"When COP becomes a theoretical exercise to calculate what it means to keep 1.5 degrees increase [alive] and it's no longer possible, then probably reinvent yourself is my best advice,\" he added.— CNBC's Emilia Hardie contributed to this report.",

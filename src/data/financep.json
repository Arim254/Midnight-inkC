    "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Six-Figure Side Hustle series, where people with lucrative side hustles break down the routines and habits they've used to make money on top of their full-time jobs. Got a story to tell? Let us know! Email us at AskMakeIt@cnbc.com.When Tayo Lanlehin was planning her son's first birthday party in April 2022, she bought yellow and blue signs, balloons and a cake with 3D planets. Every detail fit the \"First Trip Around The Sun\" theme, except the chairs.She only found one rental seating option near her home in Oakland, California, she says: adult-sized white plastic chairs. She borrowed a picnic table with benches instead, and ruminated on the gap in the market for weeks. In May 2022, she sourced and spent roughly $2,000 on 48 kids' chairs from a manufacturer overseas, and stored them in her basement, says Tayo. Those chairs became Bay Area Kids Rentals, a side hustle that she runs with her husband Dolu Lanlehin. Now a full-fledged party rental business, the company has brought in over $295,000 in 2025 revenue as of Nov. 25, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Bay Area Kids Rentals has been profitable since the beginning, but the couple doesn't take an income from the side hustle, and is instead reinvesting those funds back into the business to expand its rental line, Dolu says. It now offers ball pits, mini bumper cars and multiple colors and styles of furniture. Tayo and Dolu's first party was for an event planner, who found the company on Instagram and requested pink chairs for a Barbie-themed party for her daughter in August 2022. She posted photos afterward on Instagram and the review led moms in Hillsborough, an affluent nearby town, to the business's social media accounts, Tayo says.Word-of-mouth \"spread like fire,\" and by October, Bay Area Kids Rentals was supplying decor for parties celebrating professional athletes' and Silicon Valley executives' children and grandchildren, she adds. The rapid success of the side hustle was initially \"a little jarring, because of the level of celebrity,\" Tayo says. \"My day job would end, then I'd go and work on parties for Silicon Valley CEOs' children.\"The couple works a combined eight hours per week running Bay Area Kids Rentals. Tayo, a strategic partnership principal at health-care company Blue Shield of California, oversees the side hustle's marketing and customer communication, and a portion of its work with manufacturers. Dolu — the head of product for Chegg Skills, part of education tech company Chegg — manages the company's accounting and finances.They outsource tasks like delivery, running painting and jewelry-making stations, and equipment maintenance to six contract employees, they say.Here's how Tayo and Dolu started their luxury party rental business, how they attracted high-profile clients and how their individual skillsets make them strong partners: CNBC Make It: Do you think the success of your side hustle is replicable? Dolu: 100%, but there would be some prerequisites. If someone is creative, detail-oriented and in a market somewhere in the world that supports this, I don't see anything stopping them. But Tayo does a nice job of seeing around the corner a little bit, staying connected to market trends and seeing where there are gaps. What kind of skillsets does someone need to run a luxury rental business? Tayo: [My inspiration] comes from a place of empathy. I'm a parent, so I'm always thinking operationally about [their experience], the services we can provide, having a website that is easy to book from, what we can do differently and more seamlessly than other companies. Bay Area Kids Rentals table and chairs at a Peppa Pig themed partyCourtesy of Bay Area Kids RentalsKids are so visual, too. I'm always thinking like, \"Wouldn't it make sense if a princess's birthday had cute pink chairs and a cute pink bounce house?\"  Dolu: Tayo is entrepreneurial, and I tend to be analytical because I come from consulting. I wanted to do market research, so we sent out a survey, just to get a signal. Other than a mortgage, kids are the biggest spending line item for parents. People are willing to be irritational for their kids and spend money they maybe don't even have ... because your kids tend to be the embodiment of your dreams, your visions that maybe you didn't get when you were younger.How did you attract ultra-wealthy, high-profile clients to Bay Area Kid Rentals?Tayo: We've had to do some marketing [and search engine optimization], but we really haven't been pressed because very early on starting this business, we hit our ideal client — with high net worth families and their event planners — like right away. I followed [NBA player] Andrew Wiggins' partner Mychal Johnson, and she had posted about one of her daughter's parties on Instagram. I did research and noticed that her next daughter's birthday was coming up in October [2022]. I direct messaged her with a link to our website saying, \"We have luxury kid party rentals, and we would love to be a part of your kid's birthday, if you're doing a party.\" She responded in 25 minutes and put us in touch with her event planner.We did four events for their family until they moved to Miami [in 2024].What makes ultra-wealthy clients different? What do they like about your services? Tayo: Flexibility and having limited touch points are very important in the luxury space. We don't send our rentals out for just four hours. We schedule our services around when the client wants to set up and tear down, when they want you to come and leave.Bay Area Kids Rentals table and chairs at a Barbie themed partyCourtesy of Bay Area Kids RentalsThey're not looking to go back and forth, either. A lot of our competitors will take deposits to make sure people don't damage their rentals. I don't do that — I just incorporate these costs into our pricing. That way, we don't have to have another conversation to process the payments and the refund.What's it like running this business together, in addition to your full-time job? Tayo: Running this business has given me some confidence that I'm building something of my own. I'm building something that could last and the potential of generational wealth. It's also just really nice to work with Dolu. This is like our third baby. Partnerships in business don't really work out a lot of the times, and the fact that we're married and raising kids on top of having a business, and we know how to resolve all kinds of issues, gives me the confidence that [our relationship] is going to be fine.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

The Office of Budget Responsibility (OBR) released its economic and fiscal forecasts on the budget's measures about 40 minutes before Chancellor Rachel Reeves was due to begin delivering it last Wednesday, sending yields on British government debt see-sawing.Richard Hughes, who took up the role as chair of OBR in October 2020, tendered his resignation after markets closed on Monday.In a letter addressed to Reeves and Dame Meg Hillier, a lawmaker who chairs parliament's Treasury Select Committee, Hughes said that the \"inadvertent early dissemination of our Economic and fiscal outlook on 26 November was a technical but serious error.\"The OBR has submitted a report to the Treasury and the Treasury Committee of the House of Commons detailing how and why the early release happened, and \"identifies the further actions the Office will take to ensure that it never happens again,\" the letter stated.\"It is in the best interest of the OBR for me to resign\" so the organization can \"quickly move on from this regrettable incident,\" Hughes wrote.\"By implementing the recommendations in this report, I am certain the OBR can quickly regain and restore the confidence and esteem that it has earned through 15 years of rigorous, independent, economic analysis,\" he added.Reeves responded by thanking Hughes \"for his public service and for leading the Office for Budget Responsibility over the past five years and for his many years of public service.\"\"This government is committed to protecting the independence of the OBR and the integrity of our fiscal framework and institutions,\" she added.",

    "body": "John Giannandrea.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's AI chief is stepping down, the company announced Monday in the most visible shake up yet to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence group since launching its Apple Intelligence suite in 2024.John Giannandrea, who held the position since joining the company in 2018, will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft and was previously part of Google's DeepMind AI unit, according to his LinkedIn profile. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He will continue to serve as an advisor until retiring next spring, Apple said.The change comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence, a tech field that has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022.Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026, signaling development challenges. Subramanya will serve as Apple's vice president of AI, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi, the company said.In a statement, Cook said Federighi has already been playing a key role in Apple's AI efforts.\"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,\" Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams working on Apple's foundation models, research and AI safety. Other teams previously under Giannandrea will move under COO Sabih Khan and services chief Eddy Cue, Apple said.Although Apple shares are up 16% in 2025, they have lagged many other big tech companies as investors say the iPhone maker has fallen behind its peers that are investing billions into AI data centers, chips and frontier models.Apple said in August that it was \"significantly increasing\" the amount it spends on AI, and Cook has said it's a \"profound\" technology. Apple has struck a deal with leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, like Siri.But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It's spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. Apple also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud.Apple this year also saw Jony Ive, its legendary hardware designer who helped late co-founder Steve Jobs invent the iPhone, sell his startup io for $6.4 billion to OpenAI, with the intention of helping the AI lab release its own hardware.Analysts say that Apple has built a loyalty moat among its customers since the iPhone launched in 2007, but AI-driven hardware is on its way, with Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month saying that they've already completed their first prototypes and could reveal them in two years or less.WATCH: Apple will gain more AI functionality over time, says D.A.

Anna Rose Layden | ReutersPresident Donald Trump underwent an MRI in October to evaluate his cardiovascular and abdominal health, and the resulting images were \"perfectly normal,\" the White House physician said Monday.The results of Trump's magnetic resonance imaging were released a day after the 79-year-old president told reporters that he had \"no idea\" which part of his body was scanned, and three days after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responded to Trump calling him \"seriously r-----ed\" by saying, \"release the MRI results.\"\"Has anyone in the history of the world ever had an MRI assigned to them and have no idea what it was for, as he says?\" Walz said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"Trump's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, said Monday that the advanced imaging at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was part of a \"comprehensive executive physical, and was ordered because men in his age group \"benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.\" Barbabella described the imaging as routine and preventative, meant to identify potential issues early and confirm overall function. Barbabella also said the cardiovascular imaging showed no signs of arterial narrowing, impaired blood flow, or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels.Barbabella found that the heart chambers were normal in size, the vessel walls appeared smooth and healthy, and there was no indication of inflammation or clotting. The doctor also reported that all major organs appeared healthy and well-perfused, with no acute or chronic concerns detected.Barbabella described the president's cardiovascular system as being in \"excellent health.\" The White House did not release images of the tests.Until Monday, the White House had only described Trump's Walter Reed visit as a \"follow-up evaluation\" that included \"advanced imaging,\" without saying why the procedure was done.",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin observes the Russia-Belarus joint military exercises, codenamed Zapad-2025 (West-2025), at the Mulino training ground in the Nizhny Novgorod region, Russia September 16, 2025. Mikhail Metzel | Via ReutersAll eyes are on Russia this week as talks over a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine shift to Moscow and step up a gear.U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is travelling to Russia on Monday and is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for discussions on a U.S.-backed 19-point peace plan. Ukraine has tentatively supported the fledgling peace proposals, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it too can work with the framework agreement.The latest plan is an amended version of an initial 28-point plan, reported several weeks ago, that had been devised by the U.S. and Moscow without Ukraine's involvement, and which favored Russia.Russia will be eager to have its say on the amended proposals after a flurry of diplomacy and discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in the last week and talks being in Florida on Sunday. Whether Putin will play ball when it comes to a new peace plan is a big unknown, however, with Russia feeling like it has both the advantage on the battlefield and U.S. President Donald Trump's ear when it comes to the outlines of a future peace deal. The Kremlin confirmed that Witkoff and Putin will meet on Tuesday.Will Putin play ball?Putin and Kremlin officials have reacted cautiously to the amended peace plan so far, signalling that Russia is ready to talk but that the war in Ukraine might not necessarily end soon.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said during a trip to Kyrgyzstan. He added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" with Witkoff.

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesBut Putin also praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting there would only stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas.If they did not do so, Putin said, Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives of having full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.Read moreAnalysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted in analysis on Sunday that Russian military bloggers appear skeptical that Putin will compromise when it comes to his territorial demands on Ukraine.\"Russian information space voices continue to argue that the Kremlin will likely reject a ceasefire or any iteration of the U.S.-proposed peace plan because the Kremlin views these efforts as inconsequential and as a hindrance to Russia's goals in Ukraine and globally,\" ISW analysts noted Sunday.'Delicate' processThe lead up to the latest diplomatic scramble for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia comes after some seesawing from the White House over its position on how the war should end and what concessions are needed in order for a ceasefire. President Trump has vacillated over his support for Ukraine and has appeared, at times, to support Russia's demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. He has then backtracked, stating that Kyiv's forces can win back all their land, muddying the waters as to where het stands on a peace settlement.Following talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the process toward a peace deal was \"delicate\" and that Russia's position needed to be factored in to any deal.He said the four-hour long talks — which included Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as a Ukrainian delegation headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Ustem Rumerov — had been productive but that more work was left to be done. \"So much work remains, but today was, again, a very productive and useful session where I think additional progress was made,\" Rubio told reporters after the talks.",

    "body": "Alina Habba, speaks after being sworn in as US Attorney General for New Jersey, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 28, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAlina Habba, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, remains disqualified from serving in that role in either a permanent or acting capacity, a U.S. appeals court ruled Monday.The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is the latest judicial rebuke to the Trump administration's efforts to quickly install its preferred candidates in powerful law-enforcement jobs.A three-judge panel, in a 32-page opinion, unanimously upheld an Aug. 21 ruling from a lower federal court that Habba was unlawfully serving as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher wrote in the appellate ruling. The unusual series of legal moves taken by the Department of Justice to install Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as an acting U.S. attorney demonstrates \"the difficulties it has faced,\" Fisher wrote.\"Yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,\" the judge wrote.Fisher and another judge on the panel, D. Brooks Smith, were nominated to the Third Circuit by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other judge, L. Felipe Restrepo, was nominated by Democratic ex-President Barack Obama.Abbe Lowell and Gerald Krovatin, lawyers for one of the parties in the case challenging Habba's appointment, noted in a statement with Norm Eisen that Monday's ruling marks \"the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.\"\"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate,\" the lawyers said in a joint statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen. Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'In March, Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Habba as Interim U.S. Attorney, following the quick resignation of her previous pick. Trump nominated her in June, but she never underwent the Senate confirmation process, a Constitutionally-mandated step that can be lengthy and contentious.Habba could only legally serve as an interim prosecutor for a limited time under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. As that deadline neared, the Trump administration took a number of steps to keep Habba in the role.The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, who was set to become interim U.S. attorney for the district after Habba's scheduled departure. Trump then withdrew Habba's nomination, and Bondi appointed her as both \"Special Attorney\" to the attorney general and the First Assistant U.S. attorney, aiming to elevate her automatically to acting U.S. attorney.But the appeals court panel ruled Monday that those actions failed to comply with the provisions of the FVRA.\"Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's disqualification order,\" Fisher concluded.The ruling came one week after another Trump-picked prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was deemed invalidly appointed.That ruling, which disqualified Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also threw out the cases she brought against two major Trump foes: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.Monday's appellate ruling on Habba did not dismiss the underlying criminal charges against the two people who had challenged her appointment.",

    "body": "A shopper exits a Costco store in Centerville, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCostco is suing the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs already paid by the warehouse retail giant this year, and to block those import duties from continuing to be assessed as a Supreme Court case plays out.Costco, in the suit filed Friday, noted that it risks losing the money it has already paid to satisfy the tariffs even if the Supreme Court eventually upholds lower court rulings that found President Donald Trump did not have the legal power to impose those duties.The company noted a looming Dec. 15 deadline that could rule out the tariffs that have already been paid being refunded, despite such a ruling by the Supreme Court. Costco also asks in the suit that a judge enjoin U.S. Customs and Border Protection from continuing to collect the tariffs while the Supreme Court case is pending. The suit says that CBP denied a request by Costco to extend the deadline for so-called liquidation, which is the final computation of tariffs assessed on imported items.The suit was filed in the U.S Court of International Trade. Dozens of other companies have filed similar lawsuits to protect their right to potential refunds in case the Supreme Court rules that the tariffs are illegal.Trump earlier this year imposed wide-ranging tariffs on imports from scores of countries by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of European aerospace giant Airbus fell as much as 10% on Monday, following reports the company has discovered an industrial quality issue regarding dozens of A320-family aircraft. The flaw, which is said to affect the aircraft's fuselage panels, is delaying some deliveries but there are no immediate indications that it has reached aircraft in service, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. In response, Airbus confirmed it had identified a quality issue regarding a \"limited number\" of A320 metal panels, saying the source of the issue has been \"identified and contained.\" CNBC has contacted Airbus for comment.

    "body": "Overlooking the city with Busan Tower in Yongdusan Park. Nampo-dong, Busan, South Korea.Jungang Yan | Moment | Getty ImagesShares of South Korean auto companies rose Tuesday after U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick confirmed that lower U.S. auto tariffs of 15% on South Korea would retrospectively come into effect, starting Nov. 1.\"We are also removing tariffs on airplane parts and will 'un-stack' Korea's reciprocal rate to match Japan and the EU,\" Lutnick said, according to an X post by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Carmakers Hyundai Motor and Kia Corp rose nearly 5% and 3%, respectively. South Korea's Kospi jumped 1.02%, while the small-cap Kosdaq was down 0.13%. South Korea's headline inflation in November rose 2.4% year on year, according to government data Tuesday, exceeding the 2.35% rise expected by economists in a Reuters poll. Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food and energy, rose 2% from a year earlier.The latest figure is unchanged from October's inflation rate, supporting the case for the central bank to keep interest rates on hold. The Bank of Korea had kept rates unchanged at 2.5% for a fourth straight meeting last Thursday. Benchmark indexes in the broader Asia-Pacific region mostly rose Tuesday, after Wall Street fell as crypto sell-off dented market sentiment.Overnight, bitcoin plunged around 6% to trade below $86,000, marking its worst day since March and pressuring the broader stock market down. The digital currency has struggled to stay above $90,000 since it fell below that level late last month for the first time since April. Other crypto-related stocks, including Coinbase and Strategy, also fell in Monday's session.Shares of artificial intelligence-related names, Broadcom and Super Micro Computer lost more than 4% and 1%, respectively, indicating more profit-taking in the sector.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index added 0.54% at the open, and the Topix index was up 0.44%. The financials, energy and basic materials sectors led gains on the index.Among the top movers on the Nikkei 225 was industrial robot maker Fanuc, which was up 5.86%. NGK Insulators, which manufactures diesel particulate filters, advanced as much as 6%, and electrical equipment company Fujikura added 2.29%.Yields on the 10-year Japanese Government Bonds rose to 1.88%, the highest since June 2008, amid growing speculation of an interest rate hike by the central bank as soon as this month.Meanwhile, yield on the 20-year JGB rose to 2.915%, the highest since 1999, and yield on the 30-year JGB rose to an all-time high of 3.411%. Australia's ASX/S&P 200 rose 0.12%.Futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index pointed to a higher open, trading at 26,219, against the index's previous close of 26,033.26.U.S. equity futures were little changed in early Asian hours after all three key benchmarks snapped five-day gain streaks.Overnight, the S&P 500 lost 0.53% to end at 6,812.63, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 0.38% to finish at 23,275.92.

On average, these billionaires are worth $2.2 billion each.Despite Europe as a whole seeing a declinPhoto: Ingolf Pompe | LOOK-fotoSwitzerland has long been a haven for the ultra-rich. Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz.So it was perhaps unsurprising that a new inheritance tax was resoundingly rejected by voters on Sunday. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% was defeated with 78% voting against it. Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse called talk of the inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion.\"It welcomed the proposal's defeat, saying: \"The threat of forced sales of companies and the resulting weakening of the business location have convinced those entitled to vote from all political camps.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. Money raised from the tax would have been earmarked to fund policies to combat climate change, with the party saying it would \"channel billions into climate protection every year while simultaneously combating extreme wealth inequality.\"watch now'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Before the vote, close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative, first proposed in 2024, had already shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, had threatened to leave the country if the tax became law. He told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge, from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" watch now\"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"One potential impact of the 50% tax, if implemented, would have been a fall in tax revenue, according to  Legge. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.But although Switzerland faces competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, Legge said Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowGiorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, agreed that Switzerland remains in a strong position. \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management,\" he told CNBC last week. \"We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"",

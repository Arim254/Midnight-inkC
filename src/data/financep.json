    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve on December 10, 2025 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a much-anticipated quarter percentage point interest rate cut at a meeting that was packed with intrigue and surprises. Here's a look at five top takeaways:The hawkish cut is real — kind of. Wall Street had been anticipating the Fed would deliver a strong dose of caution along with the cut, with a warning that the bar was high for additional easing. Markets, though, didn't seem to mind: Stocks posted solid gains on the day while Treasury yields fell.While a 9-3 vote might suggest broad support for the move, the Federal Open Market Committee is different. Three dissents is a lot, the most, in fact, since September 2019. And one of the \"no\" votes came from an unexpected source: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee. Governor Stephen Miran wanted a half-point cut, while Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid favored holding steady. A total of six of the 19 participants at the meeting said they wouldn't have voted for the cut, giving voice to \"soft dissents\" who think the easing has gone far enough.The dots held. In short, the \"dot plot\" of individual officials' rate views were little changed for the coming years, with the median indicating just one cut in 2026 and another in 2027 before the fed funds rate settles around a neutral 3%. Markets largely took the committee at its word, though futures pricing late in the day pointed to a non-negligible 38% chance of two cuts next year.Bond buying is back. Well, not really bonds, but bills, which the Fed will start buying again come Friday. With overnight funding markets feeling pressure, the central bank said it will buy $40 billion of short-term bills as part of a monthly program aimed at stabilizing markets and keeping the fed funds rate within its quarter-point range. Buying levels will change, but some market participants viewed the announcement as a stealth easing that is positive for risk assets.Chair Jerome Powell was mostly upbeat about growth, and so was the committee. \"We have an extraordinary economy,\" said Powell, who has just three meetings left as chair. FOMC officials raised their view as well, boosting the outlook for 2026 gross domestic product growth by half a percentage point to 2.3%.What they're saying\"Given the lack of consensus on the Committee displayed today, along with the slow release of traditional economic data, and the arrival of a new Fed Chair early in 2026, we think the Fed is likely to remain on hold for a while. Still, continued softness in some of the labor indicators can certainly bring another 25 bps cut into the mix for January.\" — Rick Rieder, head of fixed income at BlackRock and a reported finalist to succeed Powell\"The Fed's guidance probably tells us less than usual about the interest rate outlook, for two big reasons. First, they know less than usual about the current state of the economy because the shutdown delayed the release of economic statistics. Second, the Fed's guidance doesn't account for how its approach will change after Chair Powell's term ends in May. In 2026, the Fed seems more likely to cut rates by more than signaled in the December Dot Plot than by less.\" — Bill Adams, chief economist, Comerica Bank\"The Fed lifted its expectations of growth next year which, along with the increase in cash to American households via changing tax policy, will create doubt about the path of monetary policy. This dynamic in our estimation substantially lifts the bar on any prospective rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in January.\" — Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist, RSM",

    "body": "A slogan related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) is displayed on a screen in Intel pavilion, during the 54th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, January 16, 2024. Denis Balibouse | ReutersBig Tech is doubling down on investing billions in India, drawn by its abundance of resources for building data centers, a large talent and digital user pool, and market opportunity.In under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure, while Intel on Monday announced plans to make chips in the country to capitalize on its growing PC demand and speedy AI adoption.While India trails the U.S. and China in the race to develop a native AI foundational model, and lacks a large domestic AI infrastructure company, it wants to leverage its expertise in the information technology sector to create and deploy AI applications at enterprise level, also offering Big Tech companies a huge opportunity. Having a model or computing is not enough for any enterprise to use AI effectively, and it requires companies making application layer and a large talent pool to deploy them, S. Krishnan, secretary at India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, told CNBC.Stanford University ranks India among the top four countries along with the U.S., China and the UK in the global and national AI vibrancy ranking. GitHub, a community of developers, has ranked India at the top with the global share of 24% of all projects.India's opportunity lies more in \"developing applications\" which will be used to drive revenues for AI companies, Krishnan said. Read moreOn Tuesday, Microsoft announced $17.5 billion in investment in the country, spread over 4 years, aimed at expanding hyperscale infrastructure, embedding AI into national platforms, and advancing workforce readiness. \"This scale of capex gives Microsoft first‑mover advantage in GPU‑rich data centers while making Azure the preferred platform for India's AI workloads, as well as deepening alignment with the government's AI public infrastructure push,\" said Tarun Pathak, research Director at Counterpoint Research. Amazon on Wednesday announced plans to invest over $35 billion, on top of the $40 billion it has already invested in the country. Over the past few months, AI and tech majors such as OpenAI, Google, and Perplexity have offered their tools for free to millions in India, with Google also firming up its plans to invest $15 billion toward building data center capacity for a new AI hub in southern India.\"India combines a huge digital user base, rapidly growing cloud and AI demand, and a high-talent IT ecosystem that can build and consume AI at scale, making it more than just a market for users and instead a core engineering and deployment hub,\" Pathak said.Data center opportunityIndia has several advantages when it comes to building data centers. Markets such as Japan, Australia, China and Singapore in the Asia Pacific region have matured. Singapore, one of the oldest data center hubs in the region, has limited room to deploy large-scale data centers due to land availability issues.India has abundant space for large-scale data center developments. When compared with data center hubs in Europe, power costs in India are relatively low. Coupled with India's growing renewable energy capacity — critical for power-hungry data centers — and the economics begin to look compelling.Local demand, fueled by the rise of e-commerce — a major driver of data center growth in recent years — and potential new rules for storing social media data, strengthens the case.Put simply: India is entering a sweet spot where global cloud providers, AI players, and domestic digitalization all converge to create one of the world's hottest data center markets.\"India is a pivotal market and one of the fastest‑growing regions for AI spending in Asia Pacific,\" said Deepika Giri, associate vice president and head of research, big data & AI, at International Data Corporation.\"A major gap, and therefore a significant opportunity, lies in the shortage of suitable compute infrastructure for running AI models,\" she added. Big Tech is looking to capitalize on the infrastructure opportunity in India by investing heavily in the cloud and data center space.   Global companies are expanding capacities closer to service bases in IT cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune from traditional centers like Mumbai and Chennai which are closer to landing cables, as they build data centers in India for the world, Krishnan said.— CNBC's Dylan Butts, Amitoj Singh contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable discussion in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Dec. 10, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. forces on Wednesday seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, President Donald Trump said. \"We've just seized a tanker on the coast of Venezuela — a large tanker, very large, the largest one ever seized actually,\" Trump said during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room at the White House.The president declined to provide information on who owned the tanker or its destination, but said it was \"seized for a very good reason.\"The tanker has been identified as the Skipper, according to Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler.Skipper is a Guyana-flagged \"Very Large Crude Carrier,\" or VLCC, that was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels of oil in mid-November, Smith told CNBC.Smith said the ship appeared to be headed for Cuba, though it has been stopped offshore Venezuela since it was loaded.Attorney General Pam Bondi said later Wednesday that a seizure warrant for the crude oil tanker was executed by the FBI, the Homeland Security Department's investigations unit and the U.S. Coast Guard, with support from the Pentagon.Bondi, in an X post, shared apparent military drone footage showing soldiers boarding the vessel from a helicopter.The tanker, which transported oil from Venezuela and Iran, has been sanctioned by the U.S. for years \"due to its involvement in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations,\" Bondi wrote on X.The seizure \"was conducted safely and securely,\" she added, \"and our investigation alongside the Department of Homeland Security to prevent the transport of sanctioned oil continues.\"U.S. crude oil was up 70 cents, or 1.2%, to $58.95 per barrel at 3:12 p.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent rose 71 cents, or 1.15%, to $62.65 a barrel. Trump has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in recent weeks. The president said Maduro's \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico published Tuesday. He would not rule out a ground invasion of the South American nation.\"I don't want to rule in or out. I don't talk about it,\" Trump told Politico. The White House has undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean and launched controversial, deadly strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.Venezuela exports about 132,000 bpd to the U.S., according to Kpler. \"Shippers will likely be much more cautious and hesitant about loading Venezuelan crude going forward,\" Smith said. — CNBC's Lori Ann LaRocco contributed to this report.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump participates in a roundtable discussion with business leaders at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 10, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said the Federal Reserve's latest decision to cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point could have been \"at least doubled.\"Trump, who has long urged the central bank to slash rates in order to spur further economic growth, called Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"a stiff\" who approved a \"rather small\" cut.Trump, during a roundtable meeting with CEOs at the White House, also said he plans to interview former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh later Wednesday. Warsh and National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett are two of the top contenders to succeed Powell when his term ends in May.\"I'm looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates,\" Trump said, before adding, \"Our rate should be much lower.\"Powell has been a major target of criticism from Trump, who believes the Fed has been too slow to lower rates during the first year of his second presidential term.Trump also lamented what he described as the tendency to raise interest rates in the wake of strong economic results.  \"We're going to go back to the old days,\" Trump said at the roundtable. \"When we announced great results, it doesn't mean we're going to raise interest rates and try and kill it.\"The president's comments came shortly after the Fed announced the 25-basis-point cut, its third of the year. The decision was the middle-ground choice among a divided Fed: Two of the members preferred not to change rates, while Stephen Miran, a Trump administration economic official, favored a larger cut.Powell, at a news conference later Wednesday, said the latest cut was a \"close call\" that gives the Fed room to \"wait and see how the economy evolves.\"He also directly blamed Trump's tariffs for the nation's \"somewhat elevated\" inflation level. \"These readings are higher than earlier in the year, as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the effects of tariffs,\" Powell said, citing the rise in two key inflation gauges.",

    "body": "The Department of Education is adding another layer of transparency around earnings outcomes for students and their families applying for federal financial aid for college.The department announced on Dec. 8 it will be adding earnings data to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. If a first-time undergraduate student selects an institution where the data shows graduates on average don't earn more than workers in the state — or workers nationally, for schools with primarily out-of-state students — who only finished high school, the student will see a \"lower earnings\" disclosure, the department says.The department cited the nation's nearly $1.7 trillion in federal student debt owed and an NBC News poll that reports a growing share of Americans who say a college degree isn't worth the price as contributing reasons for implementing the disclosures. The disclosures will draw on publicly available earnings data, including median earnings by institution, according to the College Scorecard, adjusted for inflation. The College Scorecard is an online database of colleges and universities run by the Department of Education that allows users to explore and compare schools on factors including earnings outcomes, costs and graduation rates.\"Not only will this new FAFSA feature make public earnings data more accessible, but it will empower prospective students to make data-driven decisions before they are saddled with debt,\" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in the press release.The department added in its announcement on the Federal Student Aid website that the earnings indicator \"should not be interpreted as the Department passing normative judgment on what institutions are worthy of attendance,\" and that an institution's past performance is not necessarily predictive of an individual student's success. Why potential earnings matter when selecting a collegeGoing to college is worth it for most students, even when it comes with high out-of-pocket costs, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York study from April 2025 found. Median wages for college graduates are roughly 68% higher than for workers without degrees, and that earnings premium tends to grow over individuals' careers, the researchers said.Even when accounting for student debt, degree holders earn roughly $8,000 more per year than those without post-secondary degrees, a separate study from Brookings Institute found. Roughly 1 in 5 Americans with undergraduate degrees have debt from their education, according to Education Data Initiative. However, those who attended but didn't finish college and those who attended for-profit institutions are more likely to default on their student loans than college graduates and those who attended nonprofit institutions, according to the New York Fed.Further, some colleges have a history of providing low or no return on investment when their graduates don't go on to earn much, if any, more than their peers who didn't pursue post-secondary degrees. Many of the colleges the Department of Education has flagged with lower earnings disclosures are for-profit institutions and cosmetology schools. A 2022 study from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, found 98% of cosmetology programs do not meet the basic standard that graduates go on to earn more than workers with high school diplomas alone. Aveda Arts & Sciences Institutes and Empire Beauty Schools, two major for-profit cosmetology school networks with dozens of campuses that will have lower earnings disclosures, did not respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.The Department of Education says its move to flag colleges with lower earnings histories to potential applicants will aim to help students be aware of potentially negative outcomes before they take out loans.\"This indicator is designed to inform — not limit — student choices,\" Nicholas Kent, Under Secretary of Education, wrote in a blog post. \"It's one additional resource students can use — alongside factors like cost, mission, location, and personal interests — to identify the path that best aligns with their goals.\"The full list of schools that are now flagged with lower earnings disclosures is available to download here. The data currently reflects 2021 earnings of workers who completed school in the 2014-15 and 2015-16 school years, adjusted for inflation to 2025 dollars. High school completers' earnings are drawn from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates from 2019 and 2020.

    "body": "The U.K. and Germany are emerging as key hubs for a new wave of AI defense startups, as Europe scrambles to rearm amid rising geopolitical tensions. Private funding for defense startups across the region has ramped up in recent years, with investors looking to tap into increasing government military budgets, driven by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and pressure from the Trump administration. But it's ecosystems in the U.K. and Germany that are seeing the most activity. The majority of the biggest rounds across the sector have been for startups based in those two countries, with both emerging as key launchpads into new markets and battlefield training.David Ordonez, senior associate at NATO Innovation Fund, told CNBC that this was \"thanks to the scientific expertise of their talent base, national commitments to treat this sector as an economic engine for growth and a manufacturing base that enables the rapid scaling of breakthrough innovation.\"'Visible pathways to procurement'Venture capital for European defense startups has spiked as members of the NATO military alliance have agreed to increase security spending to 5% of gross domestic product, and defense departments in London and Berlin have increasingly signaled a willingness to adopt new technology built by younger players in the market.Investors, buoyed by the promise of commercial deals, have funneled a record $4.3 billion into the sector since the start of 2022, according to Dealroom — nearly four times the funds deployed in the previous four years. Germany's AI drone makers Helsing and Quantum Systems hit valuations of 12 and 3 billion euros this year, respectively, after rounds worth hundreds of millions of euros. In the U.K., manufacturing platform PhysicsX, which works with defense companies, raised $155 million this year, and missile interception startup Cambridge Aerospace reportedly picked up a $100 million round in August.The U.K. government's Strategic Defence Review in June proposed boosting spending on novel tech and streamlining procurement processes, as well as unveiling a £5 billion tech investment package.\"We see a system increasingly open to non-traditional primes, supported by wider investment in skills and technology,\" Karl Brew, head of defense at Portuguese-U.K. drone startup Tekever, told CNBC. Tekever, which became a unicorn this year, announced a major contract to supply uncrewed aerial systems to the Royal Air Force in May. Helsing has several contracts with the U.K. government, and U.S.-based Anduril signed a £30 million contract for its attack drones in March.Tekever's AR3 EVO drone undergoing pre-flight checks prior to being launched. Credit: TekeverGermany announced its defense spending would rise to upwards of 100 billion euros — a record figure since the German reunification — from 2026, and also changed procurement processes to make it easier for startups to participate.While most European governments have ramped up defense spending, Germany stands out as having \"visible pathways from prototype to major procurement [for startups] that many other European markets still do not provide,\" Meghan Welch, managing director at financial advisory firm BGL, told CNBC. Helsing and attack drone startup Stark are both in line to win a contract for kamikaze drones, the Financial Times reported in October. Helsing and Stark declined to comment to CNBC about this.Legacy infrastructureGermany's industrial heritage has also created talent pipelines and infrastructure that startups are tapping into.\"Germany has the industrial base, the infrastructure and the technical talent to produce the next-generation technologies NATO urgently needs,\" Philip Lockwood, international managing director of Stark, told CNBC.Founded in 2024, Stark is building attack and reconnaissance drones and has raised $100 million from investors, including Sequoia Capital, Peter Thiel's Thiel Capital, and the NATO Innovation Fund. Stark's Virtus drone\"Many of Europe's best engineers developed their expertise in Germany's industrial and technological sectors, which have long led in hardware, software, manufacturing and supply-chain resilience,\" Lockwood said.The U.K.'s broader ecosystem is also a decisive factor in its appeal as a defense base, said Tekever's Brew. \"It brings together world-class universities and R&D centres with a dense network of aerospace, software and advanced-manufacturing suppliers,\" he said.LaunchpadsAnother key driver of defense tech in the U.K. and Germany is that both countries serve as launchpads into new markets or frontline training. The U.K. has had a security and defense partnership with Australia and the U.S. since 2021, known as AUKUS, which has lifted certain export controls and restrictions on technology sharing between the nations.\"As part of AUKUS, the move into the UK was a natural entry point into Europe,\" Rich Drake, managing director at Anduril UK, told CNBC.Alongside signing contracts totalling nearly £30 million for its attack drones earlier this year, Anduril also has plans to open a new manufacturing and R&D facility in the UK.Anduril UK's Seabed Sentry. Credit: Anduril UK\"[AUKUS] allows us to work with the MOD [Ministry of Defence], align on operational needs and accelerate the deployment of leading autonomous systems in a context where trust, shared priorities and strategic alignment matter as much as technology,\" Drake said.U.S. defense startups looking to sell into European markets have also often chosen London as a base from which to expand across the region. Second Front Systems and Applied Intuition expanded into the country in 2023 and 2025, respectively.\"Given the history of the special relationship between the US and the UK, the UK serves as an excellent launching pad into the rest of the European market,\" said Enrique Oti, chief strategy officer at Second Front Systems.The U.K. can also serve as a base for European defense startups with global ambitions, added Dmitrii Ponomarev, product manager at VanEck.\"In practice the UK is becoming the interoperability testbed and politically acceptable landing zone for tech flowing in both directions,\" Ponomarev told CNBC. \"If you can win a pilot with UK forces, comply with UK/US-aligned security and export regimes and operate in English with UK industrial and legal standards, you look much more ready to US primes, Department of War programs and AUKUS-related efforts.\"In 2025, some of Europe's best-funded defense startups, including Helsing, Quantum Systems and Stark, announced factories, offices, or investments in the country.Further east, Germany's role as one of the largest donors of military aid to Ukraine has given the country's startups a \"front row seat for battlefield feedback,\" said Ponomarev.Quantum Systems has deployed its reconnaissance tech in Ukraine and Helsing announced in February it would produce thousands of strike drones for the country.watch nowDespite the advances, analysts, investors and startup execs all caution there's more work to be done to create the conditions for building global defense startups in the UK and Germany. \"Scaling remains difficult without continued political and procurement reform,\" Ponomarev told CNBC.\"The UK still struggles with slow procurement cycles, clearance bottlenecks and a shortage of security-approved technical talent,\" he added. Germany's biggest obstacles are bureaucracy, strict export controls and heavy dependence on a single customer — the country's armed forces, Ponomarev added.BLG's Welch said the winners of Europe's AI defense boom \"are likely to be companies that can master both the political economy, including export rules, alliances and public narratives, and the technology race, positioning themselves as enablers of national sovereignty rather than disruptors of it.\"",

The U.S central bank reduced the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points to 3.5%-3.75%, and signaled that it was done easing for now.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at his post-meeting news conference that the reduction puts the Fed in a comfortable position as far as rates go.\"We are well-positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves,\" Powell said, while noting that President Donald Trump's tariffs had fueled inflation.The U.S. dollar index fell as much as 98.54 on Thursday, marking its weakest level since Oct. 21.Japan's Nikkei 225 started the day in positive territory, but fell 0.9% to close at 50,148.82. The Topix was also down 0.94% to 3,357.24.South Korea's Kospi also reversed course to dip 0.59% and end at 4,110.6, marking a third straight day of losses. The small-cap Kosdaq was marginally below the flatline and finished at 934.64.Hong Kong Hang Seng index was fractionally down in its final hour of trade, but mainland China's CSI 300 saw a bigger loss of 0.86% to end at 4,552.18, also notching a third straight losing streak.Shares of ZTE Corp in Shenzhen dropped 10% after Reuters reported that the Chinese telecom equipment maker might need to pay more than $1 billion to the U.S. government to settle allegations of foreign bribery.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 inched up 0.15%, ending the day at 8,592.In addition to the rate decision Wednesday, the Fed also announced it would resume buying $40 billion in Treasury bills, beginning Friday. Short-term Treasury yields moved lower as a result.The central bank also addressed the weak labor market in its statement, removing language stating that it \"remained low.\" This suggests its focus is shifting to supporting the economy, away from inflation.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped on Wednesday, climbing 1.1% after the Fed decision, while the S&P 500 advanced 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite increased 0.3%.— CNBC's Jeff Cox, Sean Conlon and Pia Singh contributed to this report.

    "body": "Larry Ellison, Oracle's co-founder and chief technology officer, appears at the Formula One British Grand Prix in Towcester, U.K., on July 6, 2025.Jay Hirano | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesOracle shares sank 11% in extended trading on Wednesday after the database software maker reported lower quarterly revenue than expected despite booming demand for its artificial intelligence infrastructure. AI-related stocks were hit following the report with, chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices each dropping about 1% and cloud provider CoreWeave sliding more than 3%. Here's how Oracle did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $2.26 adjusted vs. $1.64 expectedRevenue: $16.06 billion vs. $16.21 billion expectedWith respect to guidance, Oracle called for $1.70 to $1.74 in adjusted earnings per share and 19% to 21% revenue growth for the fiscal third quarter. The LSEG consensus included $1.72 in earnings per share and $16.87 billion in revenue, implying 19% growth.Oracle's fiscal second-quarter revenue grew 14% from a year ago in the quarter that ended Nov. 30, according to a statement. Net income, rose to $6.14 billion, or $2.14 per share, from $3.15 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Adjusted earnings exclude stock-based compensation.The company posted $7.98 billion in cloud revenue, more than the $7.92 consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount. Cloud infrastructure revenue totaled $4.1 billion, up 68%. Oracle also pointed to cloud business from Airbus, Canon, Deutsche Bank, LSEG, Panasonic and Rubrik. Software revenue fell 3% to $5.88 billion, missing the $6.06 billion average analyst estimate. Remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, soared 438% to $523 billion, topping the $501.8 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount. Doug Kehring, Oracle's principal financial officer, said in the release that RPO were driven \"by new commitments from Meta, Nvidia and others.\" The company now expects $4 billion in additional revenue in fiscal 2027, Kehring said.Over the past decade, Oracle has diversified its business beyond databases and enterprise software and into cloud infrastructure, where it competes with Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Those companies are all vying for big AI contracts and are investing heavily in data centers and hardware necessary to meet expected demand.OpenAI, which sparked the generative AI rush with the launch of ChatGPT three years ago, has committed to spending more than $300 billion on Oracle's infrastructure services over five years.Oracle's report lands at a critical moment for the company, which has tried to position itself at the center of the AI market by committing to massive build-outs. While the move has been a boon for Oracle's revenue and its backlog, investors have grown concerned about the amount of debt the company is raising and the risks it faces should the momentum slow.On the company's earnings call, Kehring committed to keeping Oracle's investment-grade debt rating.\"In addition, there are other financing options through customers that may bring their own chips to be installed in our data centers and suppliers who may lease their chips rather than sell them,\" Kehring said. \"Both of these options enable Oracle to synchronize our payments with our receipts and borrow substantially less than most people are modeling.\"But with the new commitments, Oracle now sees about $50 billion in full-year capital expenditures, up from $35 billion as of September, Kehring said. The sum for fiscal 2025 was $21.2 billion.Oracle's free cash flow for the November quarter was negative by about $10 billion. The StreetAccount consensus was negative $5.2 billion.\"We've been reading a lot of analyst reports, and we've read quite a few that show an expectation of upwards of $100 billion for Oracle to go out and kind of complete these buildouts,\" Kehring said. \"And based on what we see right now, we expect we will need less, if not substantially less, money raised than that amount to go and fund this buildout.\"Oracle shares plummeted 23% in November, their worst monthly performance since 2001 and. As of Wednesday's close, the stock is 32% below its record reached in September, though it's still up 34% for the year, outperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained 22% over that stretch.During the quarter, Oracle named executives Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as the company's new CEOs, succeeding Safra Catz. Oracle also introduced AI agents for automating various facets of finance, human resources and sales.Oracle said that GAAP and adjusted earnings were impacted by a $2.7 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of chip designer Ampere, which SoftBank agreed to acquire for $6.5 billion in March. Oracle, which was an investor in Ampere, said at the time that it would sell its stake.\"Oracle sold Ampere because we no longer think it is strategic for us to continue designing, manufacturing and using our own chips in our cloud data centers,\" Chairman and co-founder Larry Ellison was quoted as saying in Wednesday's statement. He said the company is \"now committed to a policy of chip neutrality,\" and will continue to buy the latest graphics processing chips from Nvidia, but needs \"to be prepared and able to deploy whatever chips our customers want to buy.\"— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Oracle's debt concerns loom large ahead of quarterly earnings",

Quincey will stay on with the company as executive chairman of its board.Quincey, 60, has held the top job at the beverage giant since 2017. During that time, he oversaw the refranchising of Coke's bottling system, the company's strategy through the Covid pandemic and its focus on beverages perceived as healthier.Braun, 57, has held various roles at Coke since joining the company in 1996, the same year that Quincey joined. Braun became COO at the beginning of the year. In a release, Coca-Cola said Braun will focus on identifying new growth opportunities around the world, better filling consumer needs and improving the company's technology.James Quincey, Coca-Cola CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2025. Gerry Miller | CNBCThe leadership change comes as the beverage company tries to reverse slower demand for its sodas, which still account for a significant amount of its global sales. In Coke's third-quarter, global unit case volume — which strips out pricing and foreign currency changes — rose 1% after falling in the previous three-month period. Quincey has said lower-income consumers have bought fewer of its drinks, and the company has rolled out cheaper and smaller versions of its products to try to reverse the trend. However, pricier brands like Smartwater and Fairlife have performed better than its soda segment in recent quarters, suggesting that consumers are willing to pay more for some brands. Coca-Cola has also largely outperformed rival Pepsico during Quincey's tenure, in part due to its stronger out-of-home business in venues like restaurants and movie theaters. Coke is also winning the soda wars. Its namesake soda has held onto its spot as the best-selling soda in the U.S., and Sprite surpassed Pepsi to become the No. 3 soda in the nation.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCoke's stock has outperformed Pepsi's in recent years.Coke shares were largely unchanged in extended trading Wednesday.

    "body": "Illustration of the SK Hynix company logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's SK Hynix on Wednesday confirmed that it is weighing a U.S. listing as the memory chipmaker's valuation soars on global demand for artificial intelligence hardware.The company at the center of the AI infrastructure boom said in a regulatory filing that it was \"reviewing various measures to enhance corporate value, including a U.S. stock market listing utilizing treasury shares,\" while noting that no final decision has been made.A U.S. listing would give American investors direct access to SK Hynix shares, which have surged nearly 230% so far this year in trading in Seoul on the back of strong AI demand. The Korea Exchange on Tuesday asked SK Hynix to address a Korea Economic Daily report that the company had received proposals to list about 2.4% of its shares as American depositary receipts (ADRs) backed by treasury stock.ADRs are tradable certificates issued by U.S. banks that represent shares in a foreign company. While they tend to trade with lower liquidity than a full U.S. listing, which can deter some investors, ADRs use existing shares rather than new stock, preserving value for existing shareholders.SK Hynix holds treasury shares equivalent to about 2.4% of its issued stock, according to the company's investor relations website.Shares of SK Hynix rose 4% on Wednesday following its statement, before paring gains on Thursday, trading over 2% lower.The company has cemented its lead in high-bandwidth memory chips, which are used in Nvidia's AI processors. A U.S. listing could help narrow valuation gaps between the company and U.S.-listed memory rival Micron Technology, as well as Samsung Electronics. SK Hynix has also been committing significant capital at home and abroad to expand its supply capacity, as it races to keep up with growing AI demand. The firm has committed nearly $4 billion to an advanced packaging fab in Indiana, aligning with Washington's aim to expand domestic chip production. SK Hynix is also set to benefit from the government's growing support of the local semiconductor industry. South Korea is considering building a 4.5 trillion won ($3.06 billion) foundry, funded by state and private capital  to nurture local chipmakers amid growing demand for AI chips, according to a Reuters report on Wednesday. The report added that South Korean President Lee Jae Myung met with executives from chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, on the same day to discuss plans to maintain the country's lead in memory chips and support its local chip manufacturing.",

    "body": "Members of the Kilo Code team, including Scott Breitenother, its co-founder and CEO, and Sid Sijbrandij, its co-founder and previously the CEO of GitLab, gather for the startup's all-team gathering in Amsterdam in October 2025.Kilo CodeInvestors are betting there's room for another startup using artificial intelligence to help software engineers write code faster. The difference with Kilo Code is it counts former GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij among its founders.On Wednesday, Kilo Code announced $8 million in seed funding, with backing from Breakers, Cota Capital, General Catalyst, Quiet Capital and Tokyo Black.Sijbrandij is a self-taught developer who helped popularize GitLab's tools for source code collaboration, deployment and testing. GitLab went public in 2021 and is valued at more than $6 billion. Sijbrandij stepped down as CEO last year to focus on cancer treatment but continued as board chair.Since then, the technology industry has become obsessed with having large language models write and update software, a practice commonly known in Silicon Valley as vibe coding. OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy is credited with coining the term in February. OpenAI looked at buying AI coding startup Windsurf for around $3 billion, but scrapped the plan before Google hired senior Windsurf employees in a $2.4 billion transaction in July. Rival Cursor announced a $2.3 billion funding round in November at a $29.3 billion valuation.At Microsoft, vibe coding already makes up 30% of the company's code, CEO Satya Nadella said in April. Sijbrandij witnessed the action and became fascinated by what AI could do for software development. In September, an acquaintance introduced him to Scott Breitenother, who started and later sold consultancy Brooklyn Data.\"I thought we were just kind of having a meet and greet, and then 25 minutes in, Sid's like, 'Hey, can you start next week?'\" Breitenother said. Sijbrandij contributed early capital for the startup, which now employs about 34 people across continents. Breitenother is in charge, but he talks with Sijbrandij many times a day. Kilo Code's software plugs in to coding applications such as Cursor and Microsoft's Visual Studio Code. It's the most widely used service for startup OpenRouter's application programming interface that gives developers access to a variety of AI models, including Grok Code Fast 1 from Elon Musk's xAI. Kilo Code has processed more than 3 trillion tokens in the past month, according to OpenRouter. A single token represents about three-quarters of a word.Daniël Langezaal, a software engineer at Dutch e-commerce startup Plug&Pay, said he has used Kilo Code for months after trying products from Anthropic, Cursor and Microsoft, among others. He said he appreciates Kilo Code's support for both premium and affordable models, and he likes that people publicly contribute to the Kilo Code extension under an open-source license.Langezaal has spread the word. About 80% of Plug&Pay's developers now use Kilo Code, he said. It helped save time for one teammate who recently assembled a complex SQL query. \"With Kilo, it took him a day,\" Langezaal said. \"If he didn't have access to Kilo, it would have taken him a few days to implement.\"GitLab, which has been testing a platform for AI agents to perform tasks, is paying attention, and was interested in what Kilo was building.\"I talked to the board,\" Sijbrandij said. \"We ended up deciding to do it outside of GitLab.\"GitLab included reference to Kilo in a filing last month. The company said that it paid Kilo $1,000 in exchange for a right of first refusal for 10 business days should the startup receive an acquisition proposal before August 2026. The market is rapidly evolving. Design software company Figma and a slew of startups now offer vibe coding options for less technical people. It's a category Kilo Code won't be ignoring for much longer.\"We also want to be the place for people just getting started with code,\" Sijbrandij said. \"We are working on an app builder that's more like the Lovable or Bolt experience,\" he said, referring to two popular startups.  Lovable, based in Sweden, announced funding at a $1.8 billion valuation in July.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding play",

Deb Fischer, R-Neb.\"There remains anxiety about if and when China will fully follow through on those purchase commitments that were made,\" Fischer said.She noted that the White House fact sheet on the trade deal said China would purchase 12 million metric tons by the end of the calendar year -- contradicting recent comments from Greer.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'The fact sheet says, \"China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025 and also purchase at least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028.\"Greer told Fischer, \"It is for this growing season, so, thank you for highlighting that.\"'\"We've heard from a couple farmers, they wanted to know about that discrepancy, and it is a discrepancy, it's through the growing season,\" he said.Joe Glauber, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture chief economist during the Obama administration, told CNBC in an interview he doesn't know what the administration means when it refers to the growing season.\"It's not a term that USDA means by any chance,\" Glauber said. \"Does that mean at harvests or does that mean actually the end of the marketing year, which is the more common way?\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said he expected China to reach the 12 million metric ton mark by \"the end of the season.\"\"So I think that'll be Feb. 28,\" Bessent said, during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times DealBook Summit in New York. \"They are in a perfect cadence to complete that goal,\" Bessent said, after Sorkin said data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as of Nov. 14 showed that China had only purchased 330,000 metric tons.Bessent called the figure Sorkin cited \"bad information.\"Glauber said the marketing year for soybeans is September, when the soybeans are harvested and ready to sell, through August of the next year. China would be more likely to hit buying targets from the U.S. by next August, since Brazil dominates the soybean market in the early months of the new year that coincides with its harvest season and cheap prices. The U.S. typically exports more to China later in the year, when its soybeans are cheaper.But that's a far longer time than the initial two-month window the White House pitched when it announced the China framework.\"That's a long time,\" Glauber said. \"This is not any sort of immediate relief.\"CNBC has asked the USDA for comment on Greer's remarks.

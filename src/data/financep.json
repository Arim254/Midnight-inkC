    "body": "The Jefferies Financial Group Inc. headquarters in New York, US, on Monday, Oct. 20, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSouth Korea became the latest country to impose sanctions on Prince Group, a multinational network accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia. Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added. Prince Group is accused of operating large-scale online 'scam centers' in Cambodia and Myanmar that used trafficked workers to defraud victims around the world. South Korean sanctions target 15 people and 132 entities linked to the network.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New YorkSouth Korea and Cambodia agreed in October to set up a joint task force to help tackle online crimes, after a university student died of torture in August in a scam compound.Prince Group has denied any wrongdoing. In a Nov. 11 statement issued through U.S. law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, the group called the allegations \"baseless.\"\"The recent allegations are baseless and appear aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets worth billions of dollars,\" the Cambodia-based network said, adding that it had engaged a team of lawyers from the U.S. legal powerhouse.CNBC has reached out to Prince Group and Boies Schiller Flexner for comment and didn't immediately hear back.Crackdown widensThe latest action against Prince Group builds on broader international efforts to curb scam networks in the region. On Oct. 14, the U.S. and UK announced sweeping sanctions on Prince Group, which the U.S. Treasury Department designated as a \"Transnational Criminal Organization.\"The U.S. Department of Justice also seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin on Oct. 14, held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by Cambodian national Chen Zhi, the chairman of Prince Group.

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

    "body": "Alibaba announced plans to release a pair of smart glasses powered by its AI models. The Quark AI Glasses are Alibaba's first foray into the smart glasses product category.AlibabaAlibaba's artificial intelligence-powered smart glasses went on sale on Thursday as the Chinese tech giant looks to ramp up its focus on consumer AI in an increasingly competitive market. The Quark AI Glasses, first announced in July, come in two variants — the S1, which starts at  3,799 Chinese yuan ($536) and G1 at 1,899 yuan.The tech giant has integrated its Qwen AI models — Alibaba's version of ChatGPT — with the device which also links to its newly-launched Qwen app. This means users can use voice control to get the glasses to carry out tasks.The lenses of the glasses are effectively screens and the device has a camera built into the frame. The main difference between the S1 and G1 is the display, Alibaba said.watch nowThe company said that some of the features include on-the-go translation, AI-generated meeting notes and the ability to ask the virtual assistants questions. Users take pictures of a product using the camera in the lens and then the device will show the price of that product on Taobao, Alibaba's main shopping app in China. Alibaba, like other technology companies such as U.S. giant Meta, are betting that smart glasses could be the next big consumer device after the smartphone.In September, Meta unveiled the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the social media company's first consumer-ready smart glasses with a built-in display. Users can control the device via hand gestures with a special wristband. Alibaba's glasses will initially go on sale in China and compete with domestic rivals, including consumer electronics maker Xiaomi and startup Xreal. The smart glasses market is still small but growing rapidly. By 2026, shipments of AI glasses are expected to exceed more than 10 million units, doubling from 2025, according to a forecast from Omdia. For Alibaba, the glasses are its latest play in the consumer AI market as it looks to build on its recent successes. The company's ChatGPT-style Qwen app got 10 million downloads in the first week of the public beta launch. Meanwhile, Alibaba's cloud computing business, where it books much of its AI-relate revenue, saw an acceleration of growth in the last quarter.The Hangzhou, headquartered company is one of the leaders in China's AI space, and has been investing aggressively in AI alongside rival giants like Baidu and Tencent, and aggressively launching new models.",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyMoviegoers have plenty to feast on at the box office this Thanksgiving.Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" snared $10.2 million in Tuesday previews, the second-highest haul for a Disney Animation Studios film ever, behind only last year's \"Moana 2,\" which took in $13.8 million. It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. How did we get here? The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns. Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains.  Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last.\"The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech,\" Luman told CNBC by email.\"It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity,\" Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages.Nissan signage at a dealership in Richmond, California, US, on Friday, June 21, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026.\"In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts,\" a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. \"However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. Component availability remains uncertain,\" they added. ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls.\"The Chinese position appears strong again as European manufacturers are dependent on the supplies. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies,\" Luman said. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Holloway | Getty ImagesTrading came to a standstill on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday following a cooling issue at one of its data centers. As of 6:45 a.m. ET, only bonds and some pre-market stocks were trading in the U.S., according to FactSet data. Stock futures trading in the U.S. was halted. \"Due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, our markets are currently halted,\" a spokesperson for the CME said in an emailed statement in the early hours of Friday. \"Support is working to resolve the issue in the near term and will advise clients of Pre-Open details as soon as they are available.\"The organization said it may take some time for moves in the impacted contracts to be seen once the outage is resolved. Globex futures and options markets, foreign exchange platform EBS markets and BMD markets were all impacted, the CME added.Later in the morning, CME Group told CNBC in an emailed update that BrokerTec EU markets were now open and trading, meanwhile all other CME Group markets remain halted.By 6:45 a.m. ET, futures prices for WTI crude, U.S. 10-year Treasurys and the S&P 500 were among those that had not been updated, LSEG data showed. The CME — the largest exchange operator in the world by market value — trades futures and options across various asset classes, including agricultural commodities, energy, metals and equities. Cooling issueA spokesperson for Dallas, Texas-headquartered CyrusOne told CNBC the company was actively responding to a cooling system issue at its CHI1 data center facility in the Chicago area, which had impacted customers including CME Group. \"On November 27, our CHI1 facility experienced a chiller plant failure affecting multiple cooling units,\" they said in an email. \"Our engineering teams, along with specialized mechanical contractors, are on-site working to restore full cooling capacity. We have successfully restarted several chillers at limited capacity and have deployed temporary cooling equipment to supplement our permanent systems.\"CyrusOne's representative said the firm was in direct contact with all affected customers, and its teams were \"working around the clock to restore normal operations as quickly and safely as possible.\"\"We apologize for any disruption this has caused and appreciate the patience of our customers as we work toward full resolution,\" they added. Emir Syazwan, a futures trader at Ninefold Trading Co. based in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, told CNBC on Friday that he had been on the phone to his broker \"throughout the afternoon\" local time as the CME outage drags on. watch nowGiven the timing of the outage — at the end of the week, just after a major U.S. holiday and in the early hours of the morning for American traders — Syazwan said those trading in the Asian or European session would be more directly impacted. Whether it will create \"lasting distortions\" in markets depends on how fast the issue can be resolved, he added. \"It's inconvenient, but it's not unprecedented, although this kind of event may materially alter market structure or price discovery,\" he said. \"Current price action already reflects markets being affected: the markets have been relatively flat and trading in a very tight range since 26 November, Wednesday, around ~10 PM EST. And until the issue is resolved, I would expect that behaviour and price action to continue.\"It's not the first time the CME has had to shut down electronic trade. Back in 2014, technical issues shut down some trading on the CME's Globex electronic system, impacting agricultural contracts. Last year, trading of equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds was also temporarily halted in Switzerland after stock exchange SIX had problems disseminating data. Syazwan's own trades have not been impacted, he told CNBC.\"I had already anticipated the major markets — especially the U.S. indices — to consolidate until the start of next year, so I went on early holiday at the beginning of the month,\" he said. — CNBC's Matt Ward-Perkins contributed to this article.

These technological advances come with their own risks.  \"It definitely makes my life easier… but at the same time, it also makes fraudsters' life substantially easier as well,\" said Michael Reitblat, CEO of Forter, an e-commerce prevention provider.According to Reitblat, there has been a 200% increase in agentic shopping by consumers over the past six months. That has been accompanied by a nearly tenfold increase in fraudsters using AI. \"Think of it as sending thousands of robots into different stores to masquerade as good consumers,\" Reitblat told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"While some retailers' knee-jerk reaction has been to simply ban AI purchases, that could be a faulty strategy as more and more consumers use AI for shopping and driving good quality traffic, Reitblat said.watch nowA report by McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion found that among fashion executives, AI and digital tools were seen as the single biggest opportunity for the industry in 2026. To ensure products are visible and favored by AI models, brands must rethink marketing and e-commerce strategies, the report noted, adding that semantically rich data and API-accessible content will be critical to success.\"You need to use AI to fight AI,\" Reitblat said. \"You need to make sure that you're leveraging better data than fraudsters may have, and you need to properly think of: how do you authenticate the consumers?\"Value-conscious consumers is another factor retailers have to deal with this year as heightened trade tensions and worries about a slowing economy impact consumers' spending habits.watch now\"Consumer confidence has been bumpy, and therefore the customers feeling like they're getting genuine value is going to be a big thing for this year,\" said Curry's Chief Services Officer Dean Kramer. \"We know research is a big part of how consumers approach Black Friday, making sure they're getting absolute value.\"",

Apple denied the charges.The CCI's final verdict is still pending, but it said its \"prima facie view [is] that mandatory use of Apple's IAP for paid apps and in-app purchases restricts the choice available to the app developers to select a payment processing system of their choice,\" in an order in December 2021.Apple recorded its highest-ever quarterly shipments in India of 5 million units in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from IDC. watch nowThe company is expected to sell about 15 million iPhones in India this year and could rank among the top five smartphone companies there, Navkendar Singh, associate vice president with IDC India,  on Nov. 18.Apple is among the global companies diversifying their manufacturing supply chains away from China to India.

It is the city's deadliest blaze since 1948, when a warehouse fire killed 176 people.The latest blaze tore through Wang Fuk Court, an eight-tower public housing complex in northern Hong Kong, home to 4,600 people in 2,000 apartments, according to Reuters.On Thursday morning, Reuters reported, citing authorities, that the fire in four of the seven affected blocks had been brought under control nearly a full day after the fire began. Firefighters were still working to contain the blaze in the remaining areas.Officials said the blaze may have started on a section of bamboo scaffolding encasing the complex, then spread to other buildings through the wooden poles and protective netting — prompting public scrutiny of the city's housing standards.  Hong Kong's police pointed to a \"grossly negligent\" construction company for using \"highly inflammable\" foam material, protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not have met fire standards. Three men from the construction company have been arrested on suspicion of \"manslaughter.\"  Volunteers give out food to residents after a major fire swept through several apartment blocks at the Wang Fuk Court residential estate in Hong Kong's Tai Po district on Nov. 27, 2025.

    "body": "Boaz Weinstein is calling for the removal of the entire board of a tech-focused fund managed by Baillie Gifford, in a bid to reverse what the activist investor sees as \"unprecedented\" value destruction.In a letter to the Edinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust's board on Thursday, Weinstein — whose activist investment firm Saba Capital owns around 30% of shares in the trust — said the board has \"objectively and categorically failed\" to deliver the performance expected by shareholders.EWIT's portfolio comprises a global mix of smaller and emerging public and private companies focused on tech innovation and transformation, that target \"significant disruptive growth potential,\" according to the London-listed Baillie Gifford's website. Its holdings include Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, which makes up 8.4% of its portfolio.Weinstein said EWIT's net asset value is down 30.8% over the past five years, while its share price return has fallen 35%, having \"massively underperformed\" its self-selected benchmark, the FTSE All-Share Index, which is up 71.4% over the same period.That means the company's NAV return and share price performance ultimately lag the benchmark by more than 100% over the five-year period, Saba noted in the letter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEdinburgh Worldwide Investment Trust.\"The magnitude of this value destruction is unprecedented among peer U.K. equity investment trusts over this period,\" Weinstein wrote.Jonathan Simpson-Dent, chair of EWIT, expressed disappointment with Saba's open letter.He said EWIT's benchmark is the S&P Global Small Cap Index — not the FTSE All-Share Index cited in Weinstein's letter.\"It makes little sense to judge a global small-cap trust against a U.K. all-cap benchmark,\" Simpson-Dent said in a statement, adding that EWIT's NAV total return has been 17.5% to date, ahead of the S&P Global Small Cap Index's 4.8%. A Saba Capital spokesperson told CNBC: \"In its latest 2024 Annual Report, EWI compared company performance, specifically share price return, to the FTSE All-Share Index on page 79 citing it as 'a widely used measure of performance for UK listed companies'.\"The spokesperson said that EWI's share price return has underperformed the FTSE All-Share Index on a one-, three- and five-year period, and the S&P Global Small Cap Index on both a three- and five-year period, \"including by more than 60% over the five-year.\"'Constructive dialog'The trust's total assets stood at £847.15 million ($1.1 billion) as of Oct. 31. Weinstein is calling for a general meeting to appoint a new board composed solely of \"qualified, independent directors… committed to delivering long-term value for all shareholders.\"\"We remain profoundly frustrated by the board's prolonged inertia,\" the activist investor wrote in the letter on Thursday. \"We do not have faith in the current Board's ability to implement the necessary strategic changes.\"Simpson-Dent said EWIT's board will continue to seek \"constructive dialog\" with Weinstein toward an \"equitable and holistic\" solution, including return of capital. But he warned: \"While we are open to discuss Board composition with Saba, we would strongly reject any proposal to replace the entire Board and the ambiguity that would follow.\"He added: \"The company's actions over the last year have supported a tightly managed discount, currently 5.6%, significantly narrower than the Global Smaller Companies peer group weighted average discount of 10.9%.\"The move follows an earlier attempt by Saba last year to shake up the EWI trust's board, a bid which ultimately failed to win investor support.Weinstein — whose New York-based $6 billion hedge fund trades credit relative value opportunities — has built a number of positions across the U.K. investment trust space lately. Outlining two new bets at the annual Sohn London investment conference last week, he said there is \"a storm brewing\" in the U.K. investment trust sector where discounts have widened sharply.",

    "body": "In 2019, Chanel Rivers took a trip to London that would change the entire trajectory of her life.Born and raised in New York, Rivers, now 35, says she was tired of the dating scene and worrying about her safety in the Big Apple. She booked a trip to London with a friend and realized how comfortable she felt walking around the city, something she no longer felt in New York.\"I remember just walking around London and being like, 'I feel like this is where I'm supposed to be.' It was a feeling that came over me,\" Rivers says. \"In London, I just feel like my anxiety has lessened a lot, which is great.\"Shortly after Rivers got back to New York, she started figuring out how to return to London permanently, but the Covid-19 pandemic brought her plans to a complete halt. During the pandemic, Rivers met her now fiancé, Martin, an architect from Canada who was living and working in New York.Rivers was born and raised in New York.Chanel RiversAfter four and a half years of dating, Rivers brought up moving to London again to her fiancé. She admits that the feeling of wanting to move didn't go away, and she didn't see herself being in New York long-term anymore.\"I considered Canada, and we did look at Vancouver, but it was not city enough for me. Being from New York, I needed a big city. London was always the plan for me in my heart,\" she says.Around the same time that Rivers brought up getting the move to London going, her fiancé's job offered him a position in their office there. It was something she says was \"very serendipitous but meant to be.\"Since Martin was already a U.K. citizen, Rivers only needed to apply for a partner visa, which was approved in March 2024.Chanel is part of small but growing trend of Americans relocating to the U.K. More than 6,000 U.S. citizens applied to either become British subjects or to live and work in the country indefinitely from March 2024 to March 2025, the most since the U.K.'s Home Office began keeping records in 2004, according to The Guardian.Hello, LondonIn October 2024, the couple moved into a two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment with a private garden in West London without ever seeing it in person. The rent was 2,400 pounds or USD $3,159 when they first moved in and has since increased to 2,515.20 pounds or $3,311, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The apartment was unfurnished, in a townhouse rather than a larger building, and didn't have a doorman, unlike the modern one they lived in back in New York City. The couple didn't ship any of their furniture over because it was too expensive. The first night they spent in the apartment, they slept in sleeping bags on the floor and used their suitcases as a dining table.\"We wanted something with character. We told ourselves we wanted something different when we moved here and we wanted something that felt very London so that we had a different living experience than we did in the U.S.,\" Rivers says.Rivers, her fiancé and their dog moved to London in October 2024.Chanel RiversRivers was able to keep her $120,000 a year job in event planning and marketing through the end of 2024.After that, she started looking for a position in London, which she says helped her explore the city as she traveled for interviews and worked out of local coffee shops. Rivers says she never had homesickness or regretted the move, but she admits that she was still nervous about being in a new city. \"I was so intimidated by London because it's so big and I was kind of scared to go out on my own. I don't know what happened to that brave girl from 2019, but I guess everything just felt so real now, and it was hitting me,\" she adds.One year later and the cost of living in LondonNow that Rivers and her fiancé have lived in London for a little over a year, they have settled in nicely, she says. Rivers found a London-based job working as an event planner. Rivers did not want to disclose her salary, but says that although she did take a pay cut, she's happy with it and spends less money than she did while living in New York. \"I've found that I generally spend less now, mostly because I'm not socializing as much as I did in New York. In London, life is a bit quieter but in a good way,\" she says. \"I still make time to see new friends and meet new people but I go out less. Plus, since I earn less here, I'm more mindful about where my money goes.\"Rivers and her fiancé also split their expenses proportionally based on their incomes. \"My fiancé makes the equivalent of what he made in the U.S., so he's kind of carrying the team right now, which is great,\" she adds.Rivers and her fiancé moved into an apartment without seeing it in person.Chanel RiversRivers' share of the monthly living expenses breakdown is as follows, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It:Rent = 1,215 pounds or $1,599Cellphone = 49.70 pounds or $65Internet/Wi-Fi = 20 pounds or $26Water = 59.78 pounds or $79Electricity = 121 pounds or $159Groceries = 300 pounds or $395Transportation = 115 pounds or $151Amazon Prime = 8.99 pounds or $12Pet insurance = 25.21 pounds or $33Apple TV = $12.99Rivers' biggest monthly expenses are rent, groceries and electricity, she says. She commutes to the office three times a week and tends to buy lunch on those days. Since moving to London, Rivers and her fiancé say they have also been able to take advantage of the city's location by taking local day trips on the train and traveling to Ireland and Mallorca. \"It's really nice to have easier access to traveling. I feel like in the U.S., you go on a trip once a year and that's it. It's nice that we can hop on a train and go to Paris for a night or hop on a plane and go to Spain,\" she says. \"The traveling is also a big part of why we wanted to move. Despite it taking a while to get settled, Rivers says she feels they made the right decision.\"I've only felt like this is the right path and where I'm supposed to be. Even the mundane things I do here excite me,\" she says. \"I feel like I'm probably in a honeymoon phase but I feel every day that I made the right choice. I don't think I see myself living in the U.S. now that I know what it's like to live a lifestyle outside of that.\"Rivers says she doesn't see herself moving back to the U.S.Chanel RiversRivers says moving back to the U.S. probably isn't in the cards for her, but she could eventually get on board with moving to Canada after living out her London dream for a few more years. \"Canada wasn't as exciting for where I'm at in life right now. I wanted something a little bit more exciting, like New York, but different. I think when I get older, if we were to move back and we wanted to be closer to family, then Canada would be the place we move to,\" she says.Conversions from British Pounds to USD were done using the OANDA conversion rate of 0.76 pounds to $1 USD on Nov. 11, 2025.

    "body": "Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesWhen ChatGPT launched in 2022, Google was caught flatfooted, but the launch of Gemini 3 and the Ironwood AI chip this month has experts raving about Alphabet's AI comeback. Google kicked off November by unveiling Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, or TPUs, that the company says lets customers \"run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.\" And last week, Google launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model, saying it requires \"less prompting\" and provides smarter answers than its predecessors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff captured the excitement around Gemini 3 with a Sunday post on X, saying that despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT daily for three years, he wasn't going back after two hours of using Gemini 3. \"The leap is insane,\" wrote Benioff, whose company has partnerships with Google, OpenAI and other frontier AI model providers. \"Everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.\"Most tech stocks were down to start the week, except for one: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent surged more than 5% on Monday, adding to last week's gain of more than 8%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed earlier this month that it owns a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet as of the end of the third quarter. Alphabet shares are up nearly 70% this year and have outperformed Meta's by more than 50 percentage points this year, and last week, Alphabet's market cap surpassed Microsoft's.All of this came despite Nvidia reporting stronger-than-expect revenue and guidance in its third-quarter earnings last week.\"You may be asking why almost all of the AI stocks we cover are selling off after such good news from Nvidia,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note Monday, referring to Nvidia's positive third quarter earnings last week. \"There is one real reason for worry and it is the 'AI comeback' of Alphabet.\" But while Google appears to have regained the edge, its lead over rivals remains razor thin in the gruelingly competitive AI market, experts said. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPutting the pieces togetherWith Gemini 3 and Ironwood, Google CEO Sundar Pichai appears to have finally put the pieces together for the company's AI offerings, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson. Google is serving a broad range of customers from consumers to enterprise, something the company initially struggled to do after the arrival of ChatGPT. \"Three years ago, they were seen as kind of lost and there were all these hot takes saying they lost their way and Sundar is a failure,\" Nathanson said. \"Now, they have a huge leg up.\"The company had a number of AI product mishaps in its initial attempts to catch up with OpenAI. In 2024 alone, Google had to pull its image generation product Imagen 2 for several months after users discovered a number of historical inaccuracies. The launch of AI Overviews caused a similar reaction when users discovered it gave faulty advice, which the company later remedied with additional guardrails.\"There was a lot of fumbling, and they were scrambling,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm DA Davidson. \"But they had the tech in the pantry, and it was just a matter of getting it all together and shipped.\"Of particular note is how quickly Google launched Gemini 3 after the spring release of Gemini 2.5, which was already considered an impressive model. The hyper-realistic image generation features of Nano Banana is another notch in Google's belt. After the company initially launched the image generation tool, Gemini shot to the top of the Apple App Store in September, dethroning ChatGPT. And after the launch of Gemini 3, Google released Nano Banana Pro last week. Google's ownership of YouTube and all the content on the video platform gives the company an edge when it comes to training models for image and video generation. \"The amount of video and current data that Google has, that's really a huge competitive advantage,\" said Mike Gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester Research. \"I don't see how OpenAI and Anthropic can overcome that.\"Additionally, Google has successfully incorporated its AI models into its enterprise products, driving sales for the company's cloud unit. In its third quarter earnings results last month, Google reached its first $100 billion quarter, boosted by its cloud growth. The company's cloud unit, which houses its AI services, showed solid growth and a $155 billion backlog from customers. And it's not just the AI models. Google is also garnering attention with its AI chips. Google says Ironwood is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first TPU from 2018. Google's ASIC chips are emerging as the company's secret weapon in the AI wars and have helped it notch recent deals worth billions with customers such as Anthropic. After a report said that Meta could strike a deal with Google to use its TPUs for the social media company's data centers, Nvidia saw its stock drop 3% on Tuesday, prompting the chipmaker to post a response on social media. With the rise of Google's TPUs, Nvidia may no longer have the AI chips market cornered.\"The advantage of having the whole stack is you can optimize your model to work specifically well on a TPU chip and you're building everything to a more optimally designed,\" said Luria.The company's ability to serve AI enterprise customers with its TPUs and Google Cloud offerings as well as its incorporation of Gemini 3 throughout its consumer products is driving Wall Street's enthusiasm.Experts who spoke with CNBC said the competitive landscape is broader than just one AI winner, but they added that it's become increasingly expensive for multiple companies to prove success.Tight competitionDespite these wins, Google is still in fierce competition with other AI companies, experts said.\"Having the state of the art model for a few days doesn't mean they've won to the extent that the stock market is implying,\" Luria said, pointing to Anthropic's new Opus 4.5 model launched Monday. Earlier this month, OpenAI also announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \"more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. \"The frontier models still seem to be neck and neck in some ways,\" Forrester Research's Gualtieri said.The competitive edge will likely go to the companies willing to spend more money given the expenses of the AI race, experts said. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures. They collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.\"These companies are spending a lot of money assuming there's gonna be a winner take all when in reality we may end up with frontier models being a commodity and several will be interchangeable,\" Luria said.For Google, maintaining a lead in AI won't be without challenges. Company executives told employees earlier this month that Google has to double its serving capacity every six month to meet demand for AI services and run its frontier models, CNBC reported last week. \"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Google Cloud Vice President Amin Vahdat told employees.Although Google's in-house TPUs have gotten increased attention as viable alternatives to Nvidia's Blackwell chips, Nvidia still holds more than 90% of the AI chip market. In its post on Tuesday, Nvidia pointed out that its chips are more flexible and powerful than ASIC chips, like Google's Ironwood, which are typically designed for a single company or function.And despite getting Salesforce's Benioff to switch to Gemini, Google also has a lot of catching up to do with its consumer chat product, experts said, citing hallucinations and lower user numbers than OpenAI's.The Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said last month. OpenAI, by comparison, said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million users per week.  \"Yes, Google has got its act together,\" Luria said. \"But that doesn't mean they've won.\"WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

    "body": "A general view of the Baidu logo is seen at the Shanghai New Expo Center during the World Artificial Intelligence Conference 2025 in Shanghai, China, on July 28, 2025.Ying Tang | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country. Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products. Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called \"full stack\" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.\"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud  computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.\"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers,\" JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. \"We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned.\"The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion. Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip. AI chip shortages hit ChinaBaidu's chip push comes as Chinese tech giants this month said they're seeing supply shortages.Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibab, said that \"the supply side is going to be a relatively large bottleneck\" over the next two-to-three years, referring to components and chips required to build data centers. Tencent said this month that its 2025 capital expenditure would be lower than initially anticipated. But Tencent President Martin Lau said this this was not because of a lack of demand, but more a shortage of available chips to spend the money on. \"It is not a reflection of our change in AI strategy ... It is indeed a change in terms of the AI chip availability,\" Lau said. watch nowPart of this shortage has been driven by global demand and resulting bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. But China's effective block of Nvidia chips has also reduced the supply.Chinese tech firms have tried to mitigate the shortage by using stockpiled chips, as well as trying to make their AI models more efficient to do more with the semiconductors they have.Meanwhile, China has its own challenges with manufacturing because its biggest chipmaker SMIC, is unable to compete on the scale and technology with leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That makes it hard for the China to manufacture enough domestic chips to fill the shortfall. Like their U.S. counterparts, Chinese tech companies have continually reported strong demand for AI. \"We see that customer demand for AI is and remains very strong. In fact, we are not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand … in terms of the pace at which we can deploy new servers,\" Alibaba's Wu said this week. That gives Baidu an opportunity in China.\"Baidu's chip push is both a necessity and an opportunity. It's a necessity, because Chinese platforms can no longer assume a steady diet of US GPUs; opportunity, because there's now a semi‑captive, multi‑billion‑dollar domestic market for AI hardware that is compliant with both US export rules and Beijing's self‑reliance agenda,\" Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"If Baidu can ship competitive Kunlun generations on time, it doesn't just solve its own supply problem — it becomes a strategic supplier to the rest of China's AI industry.\"",

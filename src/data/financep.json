    "body": "Andrew Paterson | Photographer's Choice RF | Getty ImagesCryptocurrency payments to suspected human trafficking syndicates surged 85% in 2025, with hundreds of millions of transactions traced on public blockchains, according to a new report by Chainalysis.The U.S.-based blockchain analytics firm said most of the activity was linked to an expanding criminal ecosystem in Southeast Asia, where scam compounds, illegal online gambling operations and Chinese-language money laundering networks operate in unison. Chainalysis said in its report that crypto activity by human traffickers largely fell into three categories: International escort and prostitution services; labor placement agents and scam compounds; and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) vendors. While data on the blockchain shows most services were concentrated in Southeast Asia, customers sent payments from across North and South America, Europe and Australia, highlighting the global reach of the operations.The report also found that cybercriminals are increasingly relying on messaging platforms such as Telegram to advertise their services, recruit victims, and coordinate payments. \"There's a broader migration from older darknet forums into messaging apps and semi‑open Telegram ecosystems, which, combined with crypto, let these networks scale faster, run 'customer services,' and move money globally with much less friction,\" Chainalysis intelligence analyst Tom McLouth told CNBC. However, Chainalysis adds that the transparency of public blockchains also provides \"unprecedented visibility\" into criminal financial flows, which watchdogs and authorities rely on to disrupt activities. \"The key takeaway is that the true financial scale is large, at least hundreds of millions of USD worth of crypto transactions, and the physical harm is orders of magnitude greater than any dollar figure,\" said McLouth. Escort and prostitution networks Blockchain activity suggests that highly organized networks were behind many transactions. While some escort services and sex work operate legally, the report said potential trafficking operations can be identified through distinct financial behaviors.In particular, suspected networks are increasingly relying on stablecoins and Chinese‑language money laundering groups to cash out quickly, McLouth said. These laundering networks operate primarily through Chinese-language Telegram channels, which can help cybercriminals \"clean\" illicit funds by moving them through cryptocurrency. Chainalysis estimates that those services funneled at least $16.1 billion in illicit funds in 2025. Data showed that crypto-linked international escort services also accounted for a significant share of higher-value transfers tracked by Chainalysis, with nearly half of transactions exceeding $10,000.Listings reviewed by researchers advertised cross-border travel packages, multi-day \"companionship\" services and tiered pricing structures, with VIP packages priced above $30,000. Chainalysis said the size and consistency of these transfers, along with repeated payment patterns between wallet clusters, suggest professionalized operations rather than isolated individuals.Crypto payments to suspected prostitution networks showed a distinct cluster of smaller transactions than those of escort services, mostly between $1,000 and $10,000. Still, Chainalysis said this data suggested operations consistent with agency-level activity.Labor recruiters and scam compoundsAnother major category involved so-called \"labor placement agents\" who recruit individuals into scam compounds, usually in Southeast Asia, known for carrying out crypto-based schemes. Recruitment fees typically range from $1,000 to $10,000 in cryptocurrency, matching the prices advertised on Telegram channels, the report said.Examples cited in the report include posts seeking \"customer service\" or \"data entry\" workers for jobs in Cambodia or Myanmar, promising high monthly salaries and covering travel costs. Once recruited, victims were allegedly forced to conduct romance scams, fake cryptocurrency investment schemes and other online frauds targeting victims abroad.In some Telegram conversations analyzed by Chainalysis, recruiters discussed transporting workers across borders, arranging forged documents and coordinating payments to intermediaries. The firm also identified links between recruitment channels and wallets previously associated with illegal gambling platforms and money laundering services, suggesting that the trafficking activity was linked to broader criminal enterprises.The scale of these compounds was highlighted last year when the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of bitcoin worth about $15 billion at the time from a massive Cambodian scam center that was running romance scams.\"Since late 2025 we've seen more enforcement around parts of this ecosystem, especially scam compounds, but the underlying sexual exploitation and trafficking networks can often keep operating via alternative infrastructure, both physical and digital,\" said McLouth.CSAM vendorsChainalysis also tracked networks involved in child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which operated under different crypto payment structures but also reflected growing levels of organization and \"sophisticated financial and distribution strategies.\"While about half of CSAM-related crypto transactions were below $100, that price point reflected individual payments within subscription-based models in private chat groups and encrypted file-sharing channels, the report said.The blockchain tracker also observed these funds moving from mainstream cryptocurrencies into privacy-focused assets such as Monero, as well as instant exchange services that require no identity verification.The report also documented overlaps between CSAM subscription services and \"sadistic online extremism\" communities.\"These [sadistic online extremism] groups specifically target and manipulate minors through sophisticated sextortion schemes, with the resulting content being monetized through cryptocurrency payments, perpetuating cycles of abuse,\" the report said.In July 2025, Chainalysis said it helped identify one of the largest CSAM websites operating on the dark web following a UK law enforcement lead. That single operation utilized over 5,800 cryptocurrency addresses and generated more than $530,000 in revenue since July 2022. \"In general, as crypto adoption grows, its use for both illicit and legitimate purposes will increase,\" said McLouth. \"In the near term, I don't expect crypto use in trafficking‑linked activity to go away, if anything, I expect it to keep growing even as enforcement gets better.\"",

Discovery's board is considering reopening sales talks with Paramount Skydance after recently receiving an amended offer with sweetened deal terms, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.Warner Bros. in December agreed to sell both its film studio and HBO Max streaming service to Netflix for $27.75 per share. Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV, in December launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros., promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Last week, Paramount upped the ante, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share to its offer for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal. The ticking fee would be approximately $650 million in cash value per quarter for every quarter the deal has not closed by Dec. 31, 2026, CNBC.com previously reported.Paramount also said it will cover a $2.8 billion termination fee paid to Netflix if the Warner Bros. deal is terminated. Paramount also said it will eliminate $1.5 billion in possible debt refinancing costs. Both Paramount and Netflix have said they would be willing to raise their bids to secure the Warner Bros. deal, Bloomberg reported. However, this is the first time Warner Bros. has considered whether Paramount's offer could either result in a better deal or prompt Netflix to offer better deal terms, according to the report.Read the complete Bloomberg report here.WATCH: Chadwick: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramountwatch now",

Among the key attendees are OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Anthropic boss Dario Amodei and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are also slated to be there. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who was earlier expected to attend, reportedly withdrew on Saturday due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will roll out of the red carpet which tech CEOs will happily walk down as the country presents a lucrative market of young, tech-forward consumers and a huge pool of talent which could be key to continued development of AI. \"The summit ... is a huge validation of the potential of the market. Everyone's coming in because they realize that this is the place to be in and India just cannot be ignored,\" Lalit Ahuja, CEO of ANSR, a company that helps businesses run offshore teams in India.The AI Impact Summit also comes amid a reset in relations between India and the U.S. as the two nations push toward a trade deal. India strives to be a major tech hubModi's government has made its intentions clear in the last few years — it wants India to be one of the world's tech superpowers. India has approved $18 billion worth of semiconductor projects as it looks to build a domestic supply chain. The government has pushed major companies, including Apple, to manufacture more of its goods in India.Venture capital investors are betting on India's startups while the country's stock exchanges are seeing a surge in initial public offerings. Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research said government support for tech \"is a red carpet for multinational companies to set up, expand and diversify their global operations.\"And with the door open, major firms are likely to announce big investments this week in India, while New Delhi will talk up the opportunities in the country. AI focusAI, unsurprisingly, is going to be a big focus from three angles: infrastructure, users and talent.There is likely to be big infrastructure investment deals announced around AI data centers as demand continues to rise and tech companies thirst for more computing power. In December, Amazon, Microsoft and Intel made commitments to building AI infrastructure and chips in India. India is one of OpenAI's top markets for ChatGPT and alongside rivals like Perplexity are offering their products for free in a race to gain users and potentially lucrative data for further training. There is no major domestic rival to these U.S. chatbots, providing a good opportunity to gain users with a tech-savvy user base. And access to talent is also attractive. India is an \"AI talent factory,\" Sham Arora, chief technology officer at Tech Mahindra, told CNBC's \"Inside India\" last week. watch nowThere is an increasing number of so-called Global Capability Centers (GCCs) that are being created in India. These are effectively offshore hubs which are set up on behalf of international companies. More than 60% of GCCs established in the last 2 years are focused on AI, data, digital engineering, or product development, according to ANSR, which helps companies set up GCCs. More than 80% of GCCs expected to be set up in the next six-to-eight months are projected to be AI-led, ANSR said.But not only are tech giants looking to India for engineering talent, an increasing number of firms are also banking on the country for senior leadership roles. ANSR's Ahuja said the role of \"chief AI officer\" is becoming more common.\"And the fact that there's talent available ... those positions are now being created in India,\" Ahuja said. ",

    "body": "The Good Brigade | GettyParents who took out student loans for their child's education could be excluded from affordable repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs in the coming months if they don't take certain steps soon, consumer advocates warn. \"I'm hearing a lot of anxiety from parents about losing access to income-driven repayment plans,\" said Kathleen Boyd, a certified financial planner and founder of Student Loan Savvy in San Diego. The Parent PLUS federal loan program allows parents to borrow on behalf of dependent undergraduate students. Due to the passage of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, Parent PLUS borrowers will no longer qualify for IDR plans starting in July. IDR plans cap eligible borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income and culminate in student loan forgiveness.\"Our concern is that thousands of Parent PLUS borrowers who would otherwise be eligible for IDR plans and forgiveness post-July 2026 will not take the required action and be stuck with paying loans back in a plan they cannot afford,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

The typical parent balance is around $32,000. Here's what parent borrowers need to know about preserving their relief options. How parent repayment options are changingStarting July 1, Parent PLUS borrowers will have only one option to repay their debt: the new Standard Repayment Plan. Under Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the Standard Plan will spread a borrower's debt into fixed payments over one of four time frames, depending on what they owe. In its current form, the plan comes with a 10-year term for all borrowers.Under the revised plan, only borrowers with balances up to $24,999 will retain a 10-year repayment term. Those who owe between $25,000 and $49,999 will repay over 15 years; balances ranging from $50,000 to $99,999 will be repaid over 20 years; and debts of $100,000 or more will have a 25-year repayment term. Due to longer repayment timelines, borrowers stand to pay significantly more in interest under the new program. Often, parents risk jeopardizing their own financial futures by borrowing for their children's education, Boyd said. Having only a single repayment option could worsen the problem. \"A Standard amortizing payment can be very hard to absorb, especially if they're nearing retirement,\" she said. Consolidate before April to ensure IDR accessMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesIf borrowers consolidate their Parent PLUS loans into a so-called Direct Consolidation Loan now, they can maintain access to IDR options, Nierman said.  The consolidation process, which involves packaging your federal loans into a new one, usually takes between four and six weeks, so Nierman recommends borrowers submit their request at Studentaid.gov no later than March 31. If you've already consolidated your Parent PLUS loans, you now have a Direct Consolidation Loan and therefore more repayment flexibility, \"so you are generally not in a group with any deadline pressure,\" Boyd said. During the consolidation application process, parents must select the Income-Contingent Repayment plan and make at least one payment under that program, she added. After that, you should be able to move into the Income-Based Repayment plan, which will likely result in the lowest monthly payment, Nierman said. This is the process the Department of Education requires from its interpretation of the new law.If you're in default on a Parent PLUS loan, requesting a consolidation should bring you back into a current status and preserve your IDR plan and loan forgiveness options, she said. Current parent borrowers should plan ahead Parent borrowers with a student currently in college will need to think ahead. If you take out any new Parent PLUS loans on or after July 1, 2026, you forfeit IDR access and must repay your student debt in the new Standard program. Consolidating will not help you after that date. Parent PLUS borrowers will also face a new annual loan limit of $20,000 starting in July, with a $65,000 lifetime cap. Currently, parents can borrow up to the cost of attendance for their children, minus any other aid, and there is no aggregate limit.",

    "body": "It's a sunny, 70-degree February afternoon in Los Angeles, and crowds have been pouring into Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters' home nonstop.A stereo system filters music into their kitchen, dining area and through the open doors to their backyard, where dozens of people sip coffees, chat in groups or type away on their laptops.The couple isn't just entertaining friends and family. Wayser, 39, and Watters, 42, are the creators behind LA's hottest new coffee shop, Granada, which the married couple runs out of their own home in Echo Park's Angelino Heights.Just over a month into their venture, they say they're having their busiest day yet.Like usual, they opened their doors at 9 a.m. Within hours they sold out of their pastry selection, had to DoorDash additional milk and called on a neighbor to go for an ice run. It's 2:30 p.m. by the time I arrive, 30 minutes to close, and there's still a line to order.The fact that the home-based cafe has been such a hit in a town with \"so many phenomenal coffee shops\" is still a shock to Wayser, who says they \"didn't expect this at all.\"\"I think that people really want community,\" she says. \"My guess is the part that feels so special is just the private intimacy of being in a house.\"Granada is one of the latest small businesses to open through California's Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation, or MEHKO, program, which allows residents to make and sell food from their home. Given the cafe's instant success, more Angelenos could be opening their own micro-restaurants soon, meaning the new hottest place to hang out could literally be in your own backyard.A home-based coffee shop takes shapeWayser and Watters first heard about the MEHKO program last summer thanks to reporting from KCRW and The New York Times. The program was introduced in California in 2019 and authorized in LA County in 2024.Wayser says she didn't think much of it at first. Then, she became fixated.The couple had regularly attended a neighbor's family-style dinner hosted from their garage during the pandemic, which Wayser says felt like a home-based pop-up restaurant. They'd also specifically designed their own home, which they bought in 2019, for entertaining.Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters opened Granada, a coffee shop they run from their home, in January.Talitha BullockAs a new mom, Wayser says she was figuring out how to spend her days with her 3-year-old daughter heading to preschool. As a musician, artist and designer, she was eager to find a new way to put her skills to use, especially with her work in film and TV up in the air as the industry struggles.Wayser says she's spent her career producing shows, planning events, managing business finances and running an LLC for her creative work. When she thinks about it, \"I have been an entrepreneur my whole life,\" she says. \"I just didn't really put it together, because it's always been my art.\"She and her husband, a fellow musician and visual artist, have collaborated on design projects throughout their relationship, including their home. Running a coffee shop together sounded like a fun new experiment.The couple spent months going through the process of getting a MEHKO permit, which includes food safety certification, business licensing and inspection from LA County's Department of Public Health. They say the $597 application review fee was waived because they were among the first 1,000 businesses in the program. The annual health permit for MEHKO businesses, which covers annual inspections and enforcement, costs $347.The MEHKO program sets a cap on gross annual sales of $100,000; businesses are limited to 30 meals per day or 90 per week. MEHKO operators can also be approved to serve as a commissary for up to two food carts, which would expand the amount of meals they can serve per week and also bump their gross annual sales max to $150,000 per year.I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works.Sydney Wayserco-founder of GranadaThroughout the fall, Wayser and Watters got to work outfitting their home kitchen with espresso machines, additional dining and seating areas, custom ceramics from local artist Amy Louise Johnson and new artwork fit for a modern cafe. They asked a friend to refer them to a \"coffee wizard\" and teamed up Chad Aaron to create their coffee menu; they also tapped local baker Sasha Piligian for their pastry selection.Granada officially opened its doors in January 2026.An emerging neighborhood hot spotBecause of the limitations around MEHKO, skyrocketing sales isn't the goal for Granada. Wayser says they'll consider shortening their hours or limiting days of service in order to stay in operation for a longer stretch throughout the year.Other than potentially launching a coffee cart or two to raise their MEHKO sales cap, Wayser says they don't expect to open a commercial coffee shop. \"As soon as you're in a commercial space and your rent is so high, it's not about community anymore,\" she says. \"The reason this works is that you can buy something or not. You can hang out in the yard as long as you want. We will be paying our mortgage no matter what.\"Granada offers a menu of classic espresso drinks, teas, and pastries sourced from local baker Sasha Piligian.Oscar Mendoza, Talitha Bullock, Amber CanterburyWayser says Granada's visibility could bring new business opportunities, like courting clients to host private events, concerts and art shows from their home.She also hopes the coffee shop's success inspires other people to strike out on their own. There are currently about 265 MEHKO-permitted operations throughout LA County.Wayser says that while the program wasn't necessarily designed to encourage new parents, specifically new moms, to start a business, it's had that effect on her. \"There aren't very many things where you're able to start a new business in such short time period\" or around a condensed schedule, like the typical school day, she says.\"I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works,\" she says, adding that the stakes are lower without having to rent out commercial space.She's already heard from one inspired friend.\"Our neighbor just today said that maybe he'll apply for MEHKO and start making sandwiches and serve [them] out his window, which would be really fun,\" Wayser says. \"This would become MEHKO Alley.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "D-keine | E+ | Getty ImagesThe average tax refund is 10.9% higher so far this season, compared to about the same point in 2025, according to early filing data from the IRS. The 2026 tax season opened Jan. 26, and the average refund amount was $2,290 as of Feb. 6, up from $2,065 about one year prior, the IRS reported Friday night. As of Feb. 6, the total amount refunded was more than $16.9 billion, up 1.9% compared to last year, according to the IRS release. That figure reflects current-year returns only. Earlier on Friday, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that refunds were up 22%. But it was unclear how many days of returns Bessent's figure reflected or what comparison period he used.The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe IRS release said \"average refund amounts are strong,\" and the figure will increase in the Feb. 27 release once the agency starts issuing refunds that include earned income tax credit or additional child tax credit.  \"Early data [for refunds] can be deceiving,\" Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank, wrote in a tax season guide on Jan. 22. Typically, filers receive a refund when they overpay taxes throughout the year via paycheck withholdings or estimated payments. Alternatively, filers owe a balance when they don't pay enough. In recent years, IRS data has reflected a smaller refund during the beginning of the tax season, but those payments have \"risen sharply\" in mid-February, Lautz wrote. After the February peak, the average refund has \"declined slightly\" through the April 15 deadline, he wrote. In 2025, the average refund for individual filers was $3,052 through Oct. 17, according to the IRS.Filers could see bigger tax refundsFor the 2026 filing season, the size of tax refunds has been a key political topic with the midterm elections approaching. President Donald Trump has promised that 2026 will be the \"largest tax refund season of all time\" based on changes enacted via his \"big beautiful bill.\" The legislation added new tax breaks for 2025, and the IRS did not adjust paycheck withholdings, which could result in refunds for many workers. However, there could be \"a lot of variation between taxpayers,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, previously told CNBC. Ultimately, the size of your refund, or balance due, depends on which new tax breaks apply to your situation and how much you paid throughout the year, experts say. watch now",

    "body": "ByteDance's new AI video model Seedance 2.0 is displayed on a smartphone screen. Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant ByteDance has said it will strengthen safeguards on a new artificial intelligence video-making tool, following complaints of copyright theft from entertainment giants. The tool, Seedance 2.0, enables users to create realistic videos based on text prompts. However, viral videos shared online appear to show copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, raising intellectual property concerns in the U.S. \"ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the spokesperson added. ByteDance's response comes after receiving backlash and stern warnings from Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing major Hollywood studios including Netflix, Paramount Skydance, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney. The group issued a forceful public statement at the end of last week demanding that ByteDance immediately cease what it called \"infringing activity.\" \"In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,\" said MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin in the statement. \"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.\"According to a report from Axios, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to ByteDance, accusing the company of distributing and reproducing its intellectual property through the new AI tool without permission. The legal notice alleged that ByteDance had effectively pre-packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art,\" the report added. Disney has also sent cease-and-desist letters to AI companies in the past. In September, the company warned the AI startup Character.AI to stop the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters.While trying to protect its intellectual property, Disney has signed a licensing deal with and invested in OpenAI. The agreement allows the AI company to use Disney characters from the Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator.Paramount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, making similar accusations, Variety reported over the weekend.",

    "body": "The TikTok Inc. sign in front of the building on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026 in Culver City, CA.Kayla Bartkowski | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesTikTok's U.S. joint venture seems to have survived a turbulent rollout with minimal change in usership, as early narratives of a mass user exodus prompted by service outages and censorship concerns now appear overstated, according to new figures.Survey data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show that, despite a surge in deletions following the announcement of TikTok's U.S. joint venture on Jan. 23, the average number of TikTok's daily active users in the U.S. remains around 95% of its usership compared to the week of Jan. 19-25.The joint venture — officially the TikTok USDS Joint Venture  — was established in compliance with U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order mandating the divestiture of TikTok in the U.S. from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.While ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations after the agreement, Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX each own a 15% share, with the remaining shares divvied among several other firms.Following the announcement, users were quick to express discontent over TikTok's new ownership.The deal drew scrutiny, with prominent figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raising concerns about cronyism over Oracle co-founder and Chief Technical Officer Larry Ellison's involvement.Following the joint venture's announcement that Ellison's Oracle would \"retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data\", online speculation mounted that TikTok would begin mining user data or promoting content supportive of Trump's policy positions.Such concerns spiked on Jan. 25, with users claiming that TikTok was suppressing content critical of controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, and censoring buzzwords like 'Epstein' on the platform.Last month, CNBC confirmed that messages containing the word \"Epstein\" triggered an error message, but was unable to independently verify broader claims of political censorship.Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for the TikTok joint venture told CNBC in January that the platform does not prohibit sharing the name 'Epstein' in messages and that it was investigating why some users are experiencing the problem, among others.CNBC reached out to the White House and TikTok for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Engagement metrics unchangedAlthough TikTok attributed last month's disruptions to power outages, the glitches \"no doubt impact[ed] how and what content was being served, even without any intent or motive,\" according to Jim Johnston, partner at law firm Davis+Gilbert LLP.Yet despite various user pledges to boycott the platform over apparent political suppression, engagement metrics among U.S. users suggest there has been little sign of a mass exodus.The average daily time spent by American users on the platform has since returned to around 80 minutes, after dipping to an average of 77 minutes during the week of the reported disruptions, according to Sensor Tower data.Additionally, while deletions spiked after the reported disruptions, they tapered off the following week, suggesting a temporary surge rather than a sustained boycott of the app.\"It is plausible that the short-lived rise in observed uninstalls was due to an attempt to troubleshoot the app,\" Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, told CNBC, as the number of uninstalls followed by re-installations on the same day surged more than 70% on Jan. 25 from the day before.While Yousef grants that the data suggests a \"slight impact to overall usage\" in the weeks after the Joint Venture was announced, there is no clear indication of a structural shift in user trends, as many sites touted as alternatives to TikTok have also struggled to sustain interest.According to Sensor Tower, the number of new installs for UpScrolled - a social media platform that offers an algorithm free of automated systems that filter out content from some users known as shadow banning - surged by about 770% from the previous week, with more than 955,000 new U.S. downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1.New UpScrolled downloads, however, fell sharply by about 80% the following week, bringing in only around 191,000 new users. In comparison, TikTok registered 870,000 downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, and around 800,000 the following week.Similarly, new downloads of other alternative platforms such as Skylight Social and Red Note respectively declined by 96% and 33% week-on-week from the week of Jan. 26.Tenuous evidence of mass exodusSensor Tower's user data more fundamentally seems to suggest that beyond anecdotal claims, users have largely been unable to identify tangible changes in TikTok's American operations, or at least, not enough to meaningfully shift user sentiment.\"The idea of a mass exodus from TikTok now looks overblown,\" Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst from Forrester, told CNBC. \"Anecdotally, most users say the app feels largely the same - the algorithm hasn't meaningfully changed, and the experience is still strong,\" While some American users may have perceived changes in the operation of their TikTok algorithms, \"some changes to content suggestions are bound to occur simply due to the changed data set,\" according to Johnston, referring to the Joint Venture's announcement to retrain the algorithm on U.S. data.But while analysts have been unable to find evidence that TikTok's new American owners have engineered the platform in their favor, this is not a foregone conclusion.According to Johnston, there are at least three notable changes to TikTok's new terms of use, including the platform's ability to collect precise location data from enabled devices, its collection of data on interactions with artificial intelligence tools on the app and its explicit integration with ad networks.Although there has been no hard evidence of its occurrence, it remains technically possible to adjust TikTok's algorithm to enhance or diminish the impact of certain types of content on recommendations, Johnston said.Chickering adds that under its new owners, TikTok has more control over what shows up on American feeds, but this control, according to Chickering, is where TikTok's opportunity - and risk - lies. \"If moderation starts to feel politically slanted or misinformation isn't adequately addressed, the platform could face backlash from users and advertisers alike,\" Chickering said, \"We've seen this play out before: Twitter's shift to X is a recent reminder of how quickly trust can erode.\"For now, however, the discontent from TikTok's American users that marred its first few weeks under new ownership seems to have largely subsided.As Chickering notes, \"we've seen time and time again, if the product works, users tend to stick around regardless of who owns it.\"— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Tequila Turner collected her last regular paycheck in October 2024. Since then she's traded her steady career in corporate IT for freelance projects and gig work, like delivering for DoorDash. Her income plummeted from six figures to a fraction of that last year, she tells me over the phone between making deliveries. She moved in with friends to save money. And she's been hard at work looking for a new job — but so far, no real luck. Turner, 47, says she lost her job over a year ago when her contract role with a bank ended. The Kansas City, Missouri, resident is part of the growing share of Americans who are not only unemployed but have been looking for work for six months or more, making them what the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as \"long-term unemployed.\" Official numbers about the job market show a relatively stable labor economy with stronger than expected job growth in January — more than half of jobs added were in health care — and a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, or 7.4 million people.But the share of people who've been out of work for six-plus months has been rising for the last three years. Typically, long-term unemployment has gone down after the job market recovers following recessionary shocks like the pandemic or Great Recession.Today, 1 in 4 unemployed people, or 1.8 million Americans, have been job searching for over half a year, which in most cases means they've also exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits. Benefits vary by state but on average replace less than 40% of a person's previous income.In today's challenging hiring environment, stories like Turner's are becoming more common.Why long-term unemployment is on the riseThe pool of job opportunities has been shrinking for a while: Job openings, hiring and voluntary quits (which signal workers' confidence in being able to get a new job) have been sliding since the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2022. Meanwhile, U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs in all of 2025 (compared to 1.46 million in 2024), and businesses announced 108,435 layoffs in January.These compounding factors mean those looking for a job are having a harder time landing one.Businesses are no longer adding jobs and are slowly trimming their workforce to correct for over-hiring directly after the pandemic recession, says Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist at career site ZipRecruiter.\"The moment we're in right now in labor is stagnation across the board for workers and for employers,\" she says. While workers moved jobs (and even quit on their own) after other recessions like the 2008 financial crisis or Covid-19 pandemic, today they're staying put.\"Unemployment is becoming more of a status quo versus a temporary position for workers who find themselves out of their job,\" Bachaud says.People who've been out of work long-term tell CNBC Make It the experience has chipped away at their confidence and made them question their career decisions. Some have taken on part-time work to pay for bills, while others have moved in with family. They say they're doing everything by the job-searching playbook, and even trying new methods, but still nothing seems to be working.Big challenges for young workersThe tough hiring market is hitting certain demographics hard, including young professionals.Chris Fong, 25, says he thought it wouldn't be too hard to find a job when he was laid off from a startup in March 2025. He went to a top-tier university, did well at his previous jobs and lives in the Bay Area, a major job market.But in the months since, Fong says he's noticed a drop in entry-level jobs, and he's often competing with candidates with more years of experience or higher graduate degrees than him.Fong's observations reflect a larger trend: Entry-level job postings were down by about 35% in mid-2025 compared to January 2023, according to research from Revelio Labs.Chris Fong is an early-career job seeker in the San Francisco Bay Area.Courtesy of subjectHe's also noticed the interview process getting longer as companies get \"more picky,\" he says. One recent company required eight rounds, and he still didn't get the role.Fong says he's been living on savings and recently took up a part-time job working at a friend's film rental gear company. It's minimum wage but helps pay the bills. In January, he started documenting his unemployment journey on Instagram as a creative outlet and to regain control of his life and career story. \"I was tired of letting these recruiters and companies judge me based off my previous experience\" on a resume, he says. \"I was like, 'I'm going to start something myself.'\"Long-term unemployment is still talked about a personal shortcoming when in reality it's increasingly a structural issue.Sakshi PatelJob seeker in BostonSome recent grads say changing immigration policies add stress to their search.Sakshi Patel, 22, earned her master's degree in financial management in May 2025. She's currently volunteering at a nonprofit as a business analyst, but as an international student from India needs to find employment by the spring in order to stay in the U.S. Now, she's worried new policies, like the Trump administration's revamping the H1-B visa program and adding a $100,000 application fee, will mean companies won't be looking to hire international students who need visa sponsorship like her.Sakshi Patel graduated with her master's degree in May 2025 and hopes to secure a full-time job in finance.Courtesy of subjectPatel says she's trying everything to get hired: She lives in Boston but will relocate anywhere and is open to jobs not related to her major. She estimates she sends 30 to 40 tailored applications per week but rarely hears back.\"Long-term unemployment is still talked about a personal shortcoming when in reality it's increasingly a structural issue,\" she adds. \"A lot of people are doing everything they're supposed to be doing and still not getting work.\"From feeling in-demand to 'completely ignored'Myriam Samake laments the lack of transparency in hiring today. When she landed her job as a multimedia news journalist in 2023, she'd contacted the news director on LinkedIn, set up two phone interviews, and had a gig lined up after grad school. The contract role ended in June 2025.The 27-year-old in Sterling, Virginia, keeps an Excel spreadsheet with all of her applications in the last seven months, which is 150 roles and counting, including getting to final interviews for two roles but no offers. One company completely ghosted her, she says.Do I have to knock off $5,000, $10,000 and accept a lower salary just to get my foot in the door?Myriam SamakeJob seeker in Sterling, Virginia\"It's at that point where if I did get an offer, I would take it 100%,\" she says. \"It's sad in a way, where I don't know if we can be as picky anymore.\"In another sign of the challenging job-seeker market, more workers are making a lateral move or taking a pay cut for a new job, and the share of new hires who say they landed their \"dream job\" is down, according to ZipRecruiter data from the final months of 2025.Samake says she doesn't have high hopes to land hers. \"I'm trying to look for places that have diversity. I am a Black woman, and that's important to me,\" she says. \"Do I have to lower my expectations on that or the salary I want? Do I have to knock off $5,000, $10,000 and accept a lower salary just to get my foot in the door?\"Like many job seekers, Samake is frustrated with the state of applying to jobs online and never really knowing if the materials she pours over make it to a human reviewer. In mid-2025, the average job opening received 242 applications, or three times the average in 2017, according to Greenhouse data reported by Business Insider.\"It's such a mental war,\" Samake says.Even experienced workers are having a hard time. Greg Roth, 52, remembers back in 2022 getting to final interviews with four companies and securing two competing offers. The D.C.-based executive communications professional joined Thumbtack, the home repair marketplace, in June 2022, but by December was laid off along with 14% of the company. Greg Roth is an executive communications professional in the Washington, D.C. area.Courtesy of subjectHe resumed looking for a full-time job in 2024 but says interviews are hard to come by. \"In a short amount of time I've gone from feeling very in-demand to feeling completely ignored,\" Roth says. \"My skills haven't changed, so either the market has changed, or there's just less hiring.\"Both are likely, says Bachaud, the ZipRecruiter economist. Businesses have been scaling back on hiring due to a number of economic factors (like high interest rates and stubborn inflation), political challenges (like new tariff policies) and shifting business objectives (like investments in AI), Bachaud says.And now, the supply of job seekers it outpacing demand in hiring: As of December, there were roughly 1 million more people looking for work than there were available jobs, according to BLS data analyzed by Indeed.What job seekers wish others knew about long-term unemploymentAndrew Bohan says one of the hardest parts of dealing with long-term unemployment isn't just the constant rejection, but also not have a satisfying answer when people ask how the search is going.Bohan lost his paralegal job in August 2024, exhausted his unemployment insurance benefits in March 2025, and in January 2026 moved from Chicago to Baltimore to live with family and keep bills low.\"I like to tell people being unemployed isn't the problem; it's keeping your head screwed on that's the real problem,\" he says. He says he can feel pressure to \"prove\" he's being proactive about his circumstances among friends and family, though that's hard to show without the results of interviews or offers.Losing a job can have long-term impacts: Research has shown that losing a job is associated with declines in psychological and physical wellbeing, social withdrawal and long-term earning losses. Other studies have shown people who experience unemployment tend to get new jobs earning about 5% to 15% less than similar workers who did not lose their jobs.Bohan, who's recently applied to hourly service jobs to no avail, tries not to be too pessimistic about his situation. Otherwise it shows up in his interactions, from recruiters to friends and family. \"You just have to focus on what's in front of you and what you can do about it,\" he says.That can be as simple as getting a good night's rest in order to be ready to apply to new jobs the next day, Bohan says: \"I don't like being idle. I want to get back into the game.\"These are people who've provided for their families and themselves for their entire lives. We want to do the work.Tequila TurnerJob seeker in Kansas City, MissouriTurner, the risk management worker in Kansas City, hopes long-term job seekers recognize that it takes a lot of self care and encouragement to not internalize the challenges of unemployment. To those who do have jobs or know others struggling with the search, \"I wish people knew this is not a choice,\" Turner says. \"It's new to us. These are people who've provided for their families and themselves for their entire lives.\"Many job seekers, like Turner, have years of work experience and valuable skills they've earned over their careers, she says. Now they just need the opportunity to showcase that to an employer, she says: \"We want to do the work.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "China is focusing on large language models in the artificial intelligence space.Blackdovfx | Istock | Getty ImagesChina's rapid advancement in AI is threatening to shake up U.S. dominance in the market, with one analyst warning of a tech shock that is just getting started. Rory Green, TS Lombard's chief China economist and head of Asia research, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday that America's \"perceived monopoly\" on tech and AI has been broken by China. \"I think the China tech shock is just getting started. It's not just AI, DeepSeek, and electric vehicles. China is moving up the value chain very rapidly... It's the first time in history that an emerging market economy is at the forefront of science and technology,\" Green said in a conversation with CNBC's Steve Sedgewick and Ben Boulos. China is pairing dominant-market level tech with emerging-market production costs, backed by its massive supply chain, Green said. He added that with Xi Jinping being like a \"tech bro\" that is chucking money into these sectors, it makes for a powerful mix that  is really rapidly accelerating the China tech story.Indeed, Beijing quietly launched a 60.06 billion yuan ($8.69 billion) national AI fund last year, and has an initiative called \"AI+\" which will see the tech integrated across its economy, industries, and society.watch nowChina is quickly catching up to the U.S. in the AI arms race, developing highly advanced models powered by homegrown chips, particularly through massive Huawei chip clusters and abundant low-cost energy. While U.S. chip giant Nvidia is viewed as the gold standard for semiconductors used to train AI models, Huawei is narrowing the gap by deploying larger volumes of chips and leveraging cheaper power to scale compute.TS Lombard's Green explained that a \"China tech sphere\" could easily form, as the world's second-largest economy's low-cost tech offerings may be more attractive to developing economies. \"China is a top trade partner for most of the world, particularly in emerging and frontier economies. What happens if that repeats on tech?\" Green said.  Developing economies that don't have a national security issue with China have a choice between \"low-cost China tech, Huawei, 5G batteries, solar panels, AI, probably some cheap RMB financing,\" or \"high-cost American and European alternative,\" he said. \"For these economies, I think the choice is fairly simple, and you could see easily a world where maybe most of the world's population is running on a Chinese tech stack in five to 10 years time,\" he added. Additionally, Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind, one of the world's leading AI labs, told CNBC in January that China's AI models might be just \"a matter of months\" behind U.S. and Western rivals and are closer to those capabilities than \"maybe we thought one or two years ago.\"U.S. hyperscaler spending U.S. hyperscalers Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet recently announced capital expenditure of up to $700 billion on AI this year, which raised alarms about returns and caused $1 trillion to be wiped from the market caps of tech giants. Some stocks have since pared their losses.Karim Moussalem, Selwood Asset Management's chief investment officer, told \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday that there's a lot of \"nervousness around U.S. exceptionalism,\" especially after the sell-off in the U.S. software sector earlier this month. \"When I think of the hyperscalers' capex, we're seeing a race that's on and a lot of money being spent, and more and more question marks around whether you know all that investment, all that capex, is going to result in meaningful return on investments,\" Moussalem said. \"I think that's really what's driving this big question mark about the U.S. versus China, and whether the U.S. will be the winner in that race. But for the time being, there's a lot of capital being spent, actually a lot more than even what was expected a few months ago, with more and more question marks about the ROI,\" he added. — CNBC's Steve Sedgwick and Ben Boulos contributed to this report ",

    "body": "Skynesher | E+ | Getty ImagesNew laws enacted in 2025 may have a big impact on how much Social Security beneficiaries pay in taxes this season.On Jan. 5, 2025, President Joe Biden signed the Social Security Fairness Act, a law that ended provisions that reduced or eliminated Social Security benefits for more than 2.8 million individuals who have pension income from work that did not require payment of Social Security payroll taxes. Later that year, on July 4, President Donald Trump signed the \"big beautiful\" tax package, which includes a new tax deduction of up to $6,000 per eligible senior to help offset taxes on Social Security benefits. Up to 85% of Social Security benefits may still be subject to federal tax, depending on the beneficiary's income.Together, those changes will influence the tax liabilities that Fairness Act beneficiaries face this tax season. \"If you're getting higher benefits because of the Social Security Fairness Act, some percentage of those are going to be taxable,\" said Alex Durante, senior economist at the Tax Foundation.watch nowThe monthly benefit increases for affected beneficiaries range from \"very little\" to more than $1,000, according to the Social Security Administration. In addition, affected individuals received retroactive lump-sum payments representing benefit increases to monthly checks from January 2024 onward.The tax liabilities associated with that extra benefit income may be reduced with the new senior \"bonus\" deduction, if the recipient qualifies, Durante said.To qualify for the full $6,000 deduction — or $12,000 if married filing jointly — individuals need to have a modified adjusted gross income of less than $75,000, while couples may have up to $150,000. \"They're better off because their Social Security benefit went up, and they're better off because they're basically getting a bigger deduction,\" said Karen E. Smith, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.How the Social Security Fairness Act worksPresident Joe Biden after he signed the Social Security Fairness Act at the White House on Jan. 5 in Washington, D.C. Kent Nishimura | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Social Security Fairness Act eliminated two provisions: the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, that reduced Social Security benefits for people with pensions from jobs not covered by Social Security, and the Government Pension Offset, or GPO, that adjusted Social Security spousal or widower benefits for individuals who also receive pension income from jobs where Social Security taxes were not withheld.Among the more than 2.8 million people affected by those provisions are some state teachers, firefighters and police officers; federal employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System; and workers covered by a foreign social security system, according to the Social Security Administration.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThis change applies only to people who receive pension income based on work that did not include the payment of Social Security payroll taxes, according to the agency. Those individuals also qualify for Social Security benefits based on payroll taxes paid into the program through other work.Around 72% of state and local public employees were not affected by the law, as they pay Social Security taxes — and therefore will not see a benefit increase, according to SSA. What beneficiaries should know this tax seasonThis is the first tax-filing season that Social Security Fairness Act beneficiaries will see those payments in their SSA-1099s, a Social Security Administration spokesperson told CNBC via email. Those tax forms show their Social Security benefit income.The Social Security Administration has said that as of July, it completed more than 3.1 million payments totaling $17 billion to eligible Fairness Act beneficiaries. The adjustments included higher monthly benefit payments and one-time lump-sum payments.The lump-sum payments sent under the Social Security Fairness Act are generally taxed as Social Security benefits received during the tax year, and are included in the SSA-1099 statement, the SSA spokesperson said. The SSA-1099 is also sent to the IRS. Recipients of those retroactive payments may want to consider selecting a box for a \"lump-sum election\" on this year's Form 1040 or 1040-SR for seniors, according to Lawrence Pon, a certified financial planner and certified public accountant at Pon & Associates in Redwood City, Calif. Pon is also an enrolled agent, which is a tax license to practice before the IRS.watch nowBeneficiaries who received benefits that were taxable in 2025, including a lump-sum benefit payment for an earlier year, can \"reduce the taxable amount\" with the lump-sum election, according to the IRS.The lump-sum election allows beneficiaries to recalculate their taxable benefits for a prior year by subtracting the taxable benefits they previously reported, according to the IRS. The remaining amount is the taxable part of the lump-sum payment to report for 2025.Using the lump-sum election does not require a taxpayer to adjust an earlier return, nor does it require filing an amended return, according to the IRS.\"If it results in a lower tax, take advantage of it,\" Pon said. \"If it doesn't, ignore it. Don't waste your time.\"Pon's said his father, who receives a state pension from California, now receives Social Security survivor benefits because the GPO was eliminated. However, the benefit change was not automatically processed. To access the benefits, Pon's father visited a Social Security office with proof of his marriage, including past joint tax returns and their wedding album.If you think you may be eligible for higher benefits under the new law, it's worthwhile to check, he said.\"There's probably people who qualify for it and don't know about it,\" Pon said.",

In some countries, it also comes with watches and six-figure payouts.Nearly 2,900 athletes from more than 90 national Olympic committees are competing at the Winter Games across 116 medal events across eight sports.While the International Olympic Committee does not award prize money, many governments and national Olympic bodies offer cash bonuses.Here is how some countries stack up, based on information compiled by CNBC from national Olympic committees, sports associations and local reports.Singapore tops the payout rankings for the 2026 Winter Games.The Southeast Asian nation offers about $792,000 for an individual gold medal, $395,000 for silver and $197,000 for bronze, making it the most generous gold-medal payout among the countries reviewed.Singapore has only competed in one previous Winter Games, the 2018 edition, where short-track speedskater Cheyenne Goh finished 28th in the women's 1,500 meters. The country is again represented by a single athlete in Italy: alpine skier Faiz Basha, who failed to finish the first run of the giant slalom at the Stelvio Ski Centre in Bormio, ending his campaign in a field of 81 athletes.Hong Kong, which has sent alpine skiers and short-track speedskaters to compete in Italy, offers roughly $768,000 for gold, $384,000 for silver and $192,000 for bronze. The city has yet to win a medal at the Winter Olympics.In Europe, Poland stands out not only for the scale but also for the variety of its rewards. Individual gold medalists can receive about $211,000. The package also includes a Toyota Corolla passenger car, a fully finished two-room apartment, a painting, a holiday voucher and jewelry.Paintings and jewelry are also part of the entitlements offered to silver and bronze medalists, along with monetary rewards of about $169,000 and $124,000, respectively.Italy, the host nation, offers about $214,000 for gold, $107,000 for silver and $71,000 for bronze.South Korea awards about $208,000 for gold, roughly $139,000 for silver and $70,000 for bronze.In some cases, rewards extend beyond standard medal bonuses. South Korean state media reported that snowboarder Choi Ga-on received 300 million won from her sports association after winning gold, while private companies also presented additional gifts, including a luxury watch from Swiss brand Omega.The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee awards $37,500 for gold, $22,500 for silver and $15,000 for bronze.watch nowGlory only, for someThat said, not every winter sports powerhouse pays direct prize money. Norway, which boasts the most medals in Winter Games history, does not award cash bonuses for podium finishes. Instead, athletes who continue competing may qualify for financial support from the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee. The stipend is worth roughly 160,000 Norwegian kroner per year ($16,831) and includes access to professional training and medical services.In some countries, there is no publicly disclosed medal bonus scheme. The United Kingdom does not award cash bonuses for Olympic medals, meaning Team Great Britain athletes will not receive additional payments for podium finishes in 2026. Instead, financial support is provided through UK Sport, which uses National Lottery funding to back training, coaching and athlete development.China also does not publish a standardized national payout structure for Winter Games medals, with rewards often determined at the provincial or sponsor level.An Olympic medal represents years of sacrifice and training. In a high-stakes competition decided in seconds, a podium finish can also bring a life-changing payout.watch now",

    "body": "Artistgndphotography | E+ | Getty ImagesWith many expecting a bigger tax refund this season, there may be an incentive to file returns sooner. But that doesn't mean you should rush to send yours.  First, you'll need all the necessary tax forms, or you could risk processing delays — or worse, experts say.  Every year, employers and financial institutions report your income and other transactions via so-called information returns, such as W-2s and 1099s. A copy goes to you and to the IRS, which makes it easy for the agency's systems to automatically flag missing or incorrect details, experts say.       \"We don't know all the things that make an IRS audit happen,\" said April Walker, senior manager for tax practice and ethics with the American Institute of CPAs. \"But one of the best ways to avoid that is to make sure that you are fully and completely reporting everything.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageParents with student debt face deadline to secure affordable repayment, forgivenessSecure 2.0 let employers pair emergency savings and 401(k)s, but few have done soHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedIf you have an error or leave details off your return, you could see an automated CP 2000 notice from the IRS, which details what is missing, based on information returns the agency received. The notice also includes the IRS' proposed adjustments, with an opportunity to agree or disagree with the changes.     Some filers could see an \"accuracy-related penalty\" for missing income, but mistakes won't necessarily trigger an audit, according to Josh Youngblood, owner of The Youngblood Group, a Dallas-based tax firm. He is also an enrolled agent, which is a tax license to practice before the IRS.The 2026 filing season could present \"greater challenges\" for certain taxpayers amid the IRS' 27% workforce reduction, leadership turnover and implementation of tax changes enacted by President Donald Trump, the National Taxpayer Advocate said in a late January report to Congress. With possible taxpayer service delays this season, it's important to file your returns accurately the first time, experts say.When to expect tax forms While many tax forms come in late January, others could take until mid-February, March or even later, according to the AICPA. For example, 1099s for your investments are typically among the last to arrive, especially for more complicated assets, Walker said. In some cases, the first form you receive from financial institutions states that a corrected version will come later.  For earnings, you can expect Forms W-2 for wages, 1099-NEC for contract work, 1099-G for unemployment income, 1099-R for retirement plan distributions and others.If you're claiming new deductions for tip or overtime income for 2025, your employer may or may not report those figures on your W-2 or 1099 this season. That means you'll need to calculate qualified income for these tax breaks on your own. Also, some filers will see Form 1099-DA for the first time in 2026. It covers last year's digital asset transactions.Other forms can help filers claim tax credits and deductions.Certain \"above-the-line\" deductions allow tax breaks even when using the standard deduction. The forms for these may include a 1098-E for student loan interest, 5498 for individual retirement account contributions or 5498-SA for health savings account deposits. watch now",

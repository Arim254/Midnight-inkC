    "body": "Ryanjlane | E+ | Getty ImagesYour paycheck could be a little bigger in 2026 based on the latest IRS tax bracket changes and updates enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"    The IRS in October released new federal income tax brackets for 2026. The inflation-based change increased the income ranges for the two lowest tax brackets by about 4%, and the higher ones by roughly 2.3% compared to 2025. The agency also unveiled inflation adjustments for the standard deductions, capital gains brackets and other provisions.Plus, workers will see 2026 paycheck withholding changes \"layered on top of that,\" based on Trump's new law, according to Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation. Withholdings dictate how much employers retain for income and payroll taxes. Read more CNBC personal finance coverage2026 tax brackets could mean a slightly bigger paycheck — what to expectWhy estate planning helps 'forestall bad outcomes': 'My Mother's Money' authorSome ETFs compete on price, but fees shouldn't always be biggest concern: analystStudent loan forgiveness is taxable again: Plan for the 'tax bomb,' CFP saysUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

Why that mattersAffordability is a buzzword right now — these charts show whyTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers. Here's whyCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedEnacted in July, Trump's legislation permanently extended his 2017 tax cuts, boosted the standard deduction, increased the child tax credit and added several temporary tax breaks. Those cuts include a bonus deduction for seniors, a bigger state and local tax deduction, tax breaks on tips and overtime income, among other provisions.     Many of these changes applied to 2025, but the IRS did not adjust withholding tables, and workers' paychecks generally stayed the same through year-end. As a result, many  could see a bigger tax refund when filing 2025 returns in 2026, experts say.    Once 2026 withholdings go into effect, \"folks will see slightly larger paychecks,\" assuming their income stays the same as 2025, said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center.\"For most workers, we're talking about a couple of dollars a paycheck, unless you're claiming the tips and overtime deductions,\" depending on withholdings, he said.  How higher tax brackets impact your financesWhen tax brackets increase, you can earn more before reaching the next income tax rate. If earnings stay the same from 2025 to 2026, wider brackets could mean a bit higher take-home pay. But some workers won't feel the difference, experts say.   The federal income tax brackets reflect each portion of your taxable income, depending on your filing status. You calculate taxable income by subtracting the greater of the standard or itemized deductions from your adjusted gross income.However, tax bracket adjustments are \"a lagging measure of inflation over the prior year,\" and the current figures can be higher, said Watson with the Tax Foundation. The consumer price index, a key inflation measure, rose 2.7% in November 2025 compared with the previous year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in December. That is more than most of the 2026 tax bracket adjustments.  Of course, your personal inflation rate could be different, depending on the goods and services your household consumes.   watch now",

    "body": "Limited-time retro packaging will highlight Chick-fil-A's heritage, the company said.Source: Chick-fil-AFor Chick-fil-A's 80th anniversary, the chicken chain is going all out: retro packaging, collectible cups, themed merch and even the chance to win free food for a year.The chain's anniversary comes as the restaurant industry struggles with declining traffic. To win back diners, many restaurants have leaned into deals, buzzy promotions and larger marketing budgets. As a privately held company, Chick-fil-A does not disclose quarterly financial results, but franchise disclosure documents show that the company's system sales growth slowed to 5.4% in 2024, making it the first year in more than a decade with less than double-digit sales growth.Chick-fil-A has stayed out of the so-called value wars other restaurants have leaned into to compete, but the anniversary gives the chain the opportunity to attract more customers to its restaurants. The yearlong marketing campaign kicks off on Monday and represents the biggest promotional push ever for Chick-fil-A. Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A's vice president of brand strategy, advertising and media, told CNBC that new advertising will spotlight the anniversary in both national TV spots and on social media.At the center of the campaign is what the company is calling \"newstalgia,\" a portmanteau of \"new\" and \"nostalgia.\"\"We've thought about this as a way to celebrate our heritage with customers who've been with us, potentially for decades, for all 80 years, or whether they've been with us for eight days or have never tried Chick-fil-A before,\" Cooper said.While Chick-fil-A's growth is slowing, its sales are still rising even as the broader restaurant industry struggles with more budget-conscious consumers who are eating out less often and spending less, leading to shrinking traffic to eateries. In 2025, July was the only month with increasing restaurant visits compared with the year-ago period, according to Black Box Intelligence. Monthly traffic hit a low point in February, with the firm reporting a 5.7% fall from a year earlier.Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Papa John's and Wendy's have reported declining traffic and falling same-store sales. Hundreds of restaurant locations, from the likes of Starbucks and Jack in the Box, permanently closed in 2025 due to weak traffic.Chick-fil-A's marketing pushTo start, Chick-fil-A is also rolling out four retro collectible cup designs every few weeks, inspired by the company's archives and the shape of its 32-ounce cup. The chain is selling the cups for $3.99 at restaurants nationwide. Plus, Chick-fil-A has come up with its own riff on Willy Wonka's famous golden ticket: the Golden Fan Cup. The 3,000 customers who buy a collectible cup and receive the Golden Fan Cup will receive free Chick-fil-A for a year.The chain will also give its iconic chicken sandwich limited-time, vintage-inspired packaging.Chick-fil-A plans to sell themed merch through its website over the course of the year. Customers who visit its restaurants will also be able to purchase limited-edition designs of its stuffed cows. Also as part of the campaign, Chick-fil-A is adding its frosted sodas and floats to its menu permanently, starting Monday. Customers can also expect to see more limited-time menu items throughout the year than Chick-fil-A typically offers, according to Cooper.The focus on \"newstalgia\" will also be front and center at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Friday, when the Oregon Ducks face off against the Indiana Hoosiers in the College Football Playoff semifinal.Chick-fil-A traces its roots to 1946, when S. Truett Cathy and his brother opened a restaurant called The Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. More than two decades later, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A location, with its trademark chicken sandwich. The business is still family owned, and Cathy's grandson Andrew serves as its CEO.The privately held chain's system sales reached $22.74 billion in 2024, making it the third-largest restaurant chain in the U.S., trailing only McDonald's and Starbucks. Over the past decade, Chick-fil-A has expanded far beyond its Southeastern stronghold, opening locations all across the U.S. and planning to expand its international business into the United Kingdom and Singapore.",

    "body": "Home prices are expected to rise by about 2.2% nationally in 2026, but some large U.S. cities — mostly in the Midwest and Northeast — could see prices climb much faster.That's according to a recent Realtor.com forecast, which projects \"a more balanced\" housing market as higher inventory slows overall price growth. Even so, the moderation isn't expected to be evenly felt.\"The Midwest and Northeast have maintained strong demand despite the broader slowdown, largely due to persistent inventory scarcity,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It.While many markets in the South and West are seeing price growth flatten or turn negative as new construction adds supply, cities in the Midwest and Northeast have added fewer homes in recent years, which has helped kept prices moving higher, according to Realtor.com.Here are the 11 large U.S. cities expected to see the biggest home-price increases in 2026:1. Toledo, OhioExpected 2026 price growth: 13.1%Median home price: $199,9002. Syracuse, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 12.4%Median home price: $298,9503. Scranton–Wilkes-Barre–Hazleton, PennsylvaniaExpected 2026 price growth: 10.9%Median home price: $260,0004. Rochester, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 10.3%Median home price: $256,9005. Hartford–West Hartford–East Hartford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 9.5%Median home price: $429,0006. Baltimore–Columbia–Towson, MarylandExpected 2026 price growth: 8.3%Median home price: $375,0007. New Haven–Milford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $439,0008. Winston-Salem, North CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $342,8999. Albany–Schenectady–Troy, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 7.5%Median home price: $419,90010. Columbia, South CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.2%Median home price: $303,30011. Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis, WisconsinExpected 2026 price growth: 7%Median home price: $379,000Realtor.com's metro-level forecasts are based on its own listings data, along with local inventory levels, new construction activity, employment and income trends, and mortgage rate expectations.What those projections show is that in markets where very little housing has been added, even modest demand is enough to keep prices rising — especially in smaller Midwest and Northeast cities. By contrast, in markets where construction has been heavier, home prices in some areas are expected to fall by as much as 10% in 2026.The metros with the highest expected gains \"have seen very limited new housing development, keeping supply tight,\" says Jones. At the same time, most of these cities have home prices \"well below national averages,\" she says.Overall, only three of the 11 cities on the list have median listing prices above the U.S. median of about $415,000 as of late 2025.Toledo stands out in particular for its relative affordability. The city's median home price of about $199,900 is well below Ohio's statewide median of roughly $275,000, per Realtor's data.Another factor is proximity to larger urban hubs. \"In the Northeast, demand has remained elevated as buyers seek more affordable, commutable alternatives to large, high-cost metros, such as New York and Boston,\" says Jones. \"Because new construction has lagged in many of these older, built-out Northeastern markets, supply constraints remain acute, amplifying the price impact of even modest demand growth.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that US forces had captured Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro after bombing the capital Caracas and other cities in a dramatic climax to a months-long standoff between Trump and his Venezuelan arch-foe. (Photo by ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP via Getty Images)Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba announced on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed in combat during the U.S. raid on Venezuela.The raid on Saturday, which saw U.S. forces arrest and extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to New York, reportedly saw a large part of his security team killed. The Cubans were performing missions on behalf of the Cuban Armed Forces and interior ministry, the country's presidential office said on Facebook.\"Faithful to their responsibilities with security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroically and fell, after ferocious resistance, into direct combat against the attackers or as a result of the bombings of the facilities,\" the statement said, according to a translation by Facebook. Cuba also called the U.S. strikes a \"criminal act of aggression and state terrorism,\" and said the Cuban government will pay tribute to the dead.The U.S. strikes came after weeks of military buildup in the region and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump against Maduro. After the raid, Trump said that the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela, \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. will use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims.\"We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction,\" Rubio told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker.Seperately, Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" that as the U.S. has a \"quaratine\" on Venezuelan oil. \"That means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" he added.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean.— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the premiere of \"The Big Short\" at Ziegfeld Theatre on Nov. 23, 2015 in New York.Dimitrios Kambouris | Getty ImagesMichael Burry's quiet bet on Venezuelan oil is coming back into focus.The investor best known for \"The Big Short\" said he has owned Valero Energy since 2020, a position he views as increasingly attractive as the U.S. moves toward a deeper role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry.\"Realize that many Gulf Coast refineries were purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude,\" Burry wrote in a Monday blog post on Substack. \"So they have been running with suboptimal feedstock for years. This will, in time, produce better margins across jet fuel, asphalt, and diesel ... I have owned Valero since 2020, and I am more resolved to holding it even longer after this weekend.\"His comments came after President Donald Trump called on U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The country's oil is among the heaviest and most sulfur-laden in the world, and only a limited number of refineries are equipped to process it efficiently.Valero stands out because of its ability to process heavy crude, but Burry said smaller refiners such as PBF Energy and HF Sinclair could also benefit, even if Venezuelan oil arrives only gradually. Any meaningful recovery in exports is likely to take years.Multiple analysts on Wall Street are also highlighting Valero as the biggest beneficiary, should Venezuelan supply increase. Shares of the refiner jumped about 10% Monday. The opportunity may extend beyond refining. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has deteriorated after decades of underinvestment, creating potential demand for U.S. oilfield services companies if large-scale rehabilitation begins, Burry said.Burry said he owns Halliburton, and sees possible upside as well for Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which could be tapped to help rebuild pipelines and refineries.\"Venezuelan pipelines and refineries are old and in disrepair. This work will go to U.S. contractors,\" he said. \"Chevron is already there. Exxon and others have been litigating claims for decades and may see some justice relatively soon, if the US literally begins to run Venezuela as some have suggested. I own Halliburton, and may buy more shares or LEAPs.\"LEAPs, or long-term equity anticipation securities, are options with lengthy expiration dates that could go beyond one year.",

And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, \"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action \"with everything I've got,\" and called Hegseth \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.\"\"Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,\" Kelly wrote. \"I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.\"\"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly wrote. \"Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.\"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,\" the senator said. \"It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.\"The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealedThe legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned.In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: \"These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.\"\"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,\" Hegseth said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"",

Hyunjoo Jin | ReutersLucid Group significantly increased its production and sales last year as it continues to ramp up production of its new Gravity SUV.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer on Monday said its deliveries last year increased to 15,841 units, up 55% compared with 2024, including a more than 70% year-over-year increase during the fourth quarter.The automaker also achieved a previously lowered production target of roughly 18,000 vehicles in 2025, down from an initial expectation of as much as 20,000 vehicles. It produced 18,378 units last year, including 8,412 EVs during the fourth quarter.Much of that increase is likely due to a prolonged ramp-up of its Gravity SUV, which has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages, the company has said. In addition to Lucid's own challenges, EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs because of tariffs and slower forecast sales of EVs, as well as regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.watch now",

He took no questions.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is weighing a Minnesota gubernatorial bid in light of Walz bowing out, The New York Times reported Monday. Walz and Klobuchar spoke over the weekend, multiple outlets reported.Walz had announced in September that he would seek a third term in office. But his plans were soon upended by damning reports on the social services fraud scams that have blossomed in Minnesota in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, while Walz led the state.A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month estimated that the fraud schemes may have totaled more than $9 billion, though Walz has called that number \"sensationalized.\"The scandal has put focus on the state's Somali community, where the majority of people so far charged by the Department of Justice in connection with the fraud have come from.President Donald Trump has responded to the fraud reports with vehemently anti-Somali rhetoric and renewed attacks against Democratic Rep.

The Detroit automaker's results were driven last year by incremental sales of EVs as well as gains in large SUVs and entry-level vehicles such as the Buick Envista. GM's 2025 sales are expected to be among the standouts for the U.S. automotive industry, which Cox Automotive expects to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units compared with 2024.GM is among a handful of automakers to report U.S. sales gains for 2025. Others include Toyota Motor's sales being up 8%; Hyundai and Kia each achieving third consecutive years of record sales with 8.4% and 7% increases, respectively; and Honda Motor up 0.5%. Chrysler parent Stellantis was down 3.3% as it executes a U.S. turnaround plan.

That compares to Toyota at 2.52 million U.S. sales in 2025.\"Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,\" GM President of North America Duncan Aldred said in a statement.

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Nov. 24, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk will start rolling out the first-ever GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S. on Monday, the company announced, marking a new chapter of obesity treatment in the U.S. The drug's cash prices are among the lowest on the market, ranging from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose. That fuels hopes that pills could help address the long-standing affordability hurdles tied to the weekly injections dominating the weight loss drug market. The official launch of the oral drug, called the Wegovy pill, comes just two weeks after U.S. regulators cleared the treatment. The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. The higher, remaining doses of the pill will be available to patients by the end of the week, Novo Nordisk said. Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability \"opens new possibilities\" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. Pills are the next battleground for the two companies, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite.\"This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care,\" said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions. ",

We already have a defense agreement between the Kingdom and the United States today, which gives the United States wide access to Greenland,\" Frederiksen said. \"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" she added. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said on social media that Trump's remarks were \"very rude and disrespectful.\"'The Greenland risk is underpriced'Trump has long advocated for control over Greenland, a vast and sparsely populated territory rich in minerals that is strategically situated between Europe and North America. Opinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. Copenhagen has sought to improve ties with Greenland in recent months, pledging to boost spending for health care and infrastructure investments, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen attends a press conference at the Chancellery in Berlin, Germany, Jan. 28, 2025. Nadja Wohlleben | ReutersMujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said the Danish government is in \"full crisis mode\" over Trump's latest comments, citing Frederiksen's statement over the weekend. \"As I've long argued, the Greenland risk is underpriced,\" Rahman said Sunday in a LinkedIn post. \"A possible US intervention in Greenland is now the biggest source of risk to the transatlantic alliance and intra-NATO and intra-EU cohesion, arguably far greater than those presented by Russia's invasion of Ukraine,\" Rahman said.U.S. President Donald Trump, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (L) and U.S. Sen.

    "body": "Yuichiro Chino | Moment | Getty ImagesE-commerce logistics startup Stord has bought CEVA Logistics subsidiary Shipwire, the company said Monday. The deal, which closed Jan. 1 for a undisclosed amount, adds 12 new locations to Stord's growing logistics network and about 60 new employees. Shipwire is an AI fulfillment platform used by e-commerce firms. \"This is a great network, great customers, great team to pull onto our technology and our combined scale,\" CEO Sean Henry told CNBC. \"And with that scale, it spins our flywheel up.\"The deal also brings dozens of new large and mid-market customers and a host of AI-powered internal execution, planning and routing tools to Stord's network, he added. Stord will look to partner with CEVA's 120 million square foot network across 170 countries.This is the seventh acquisition from the Atlanta-based startup that's challenging e-commerce giants such as Amazon by building out a network of infrastructure to help lower shipping costs and speed up deliveries for smaller merchants. Stord is part of a crowded market of startups that provide logistics and fulfillment services to online businesses, including ShipBob, Flexport's Deliverr, Cart.com and Shipmonk. Demand for these services has only continued to grow as more consumers shop online, and as merchants increasingly operate storefronts on multiple platforms. Amazon has sought to capitalize on the trend by offering a competing service that lets businesses tap into its network to ship orders placed on other sites, called multi-channel fulfillment.Read more CNBC tech newsChina's BYD overtakes Tesla as world's top EV seller for the first timeChips, robots and fortune telling collide in China's 'Silicon Valley' AI boomDust to data centers: The year AI tech giants, and billions in debt, began remaking the American landscapeGoogle wraps up best year on Wall Street since 2009, beating megacap peers as AI story strengthensStord has been on an expansion spree.In May, Stord bought third-party delivery company and UPS subsidiary Ware2Go for an undisclosed amount earlier this year. The company previously acquired Pitney Bowes' e-commerce fulfillment business and freight and logistics platform ProPack in 2024. Stord recently announced a major investment plan in Kentucky and tech platform Penny Black. Henry told CNBC that the company is looking to make more acquisitions like Shipwire over the coming months and is eyeing expansions into Australia and Asia. Stord's current network includes facilities in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and the Netherlands. Last year, Stord raised $200 million at $1.5 billion valuation. Major investors include Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Salesforce Ventures and Strike Capital.Stord was founded in 2015 by 18-year-old Henry, who dropped out of the Georgia Institute of Technology to pursue the prestigious Thiel Fellowship, which was founded by Peter Thiel. The two-year program currently pays aspiring entrepreneurs $200,000 to quit college to build their startups, according to its website. Famous fellows have included design software firm Figma's Dylan Field, Anthropic's Chris Olah and ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin.watch nowCNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this article.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe traditional role of an investment banker is to provide advice on deals and financings. But JPMorgan's bankers recently began noticing that clients were asking for more from the firm – like how the nation's largest bank was navigating artificial intelligence or what cybersecurity practices it used. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had an idea: formalize a group that can give certain clients access to much of JPMorgan's \"secret sauce.\" They're calling the initiative the \"Special Advisory Services,\" which launches Monday, with Liz Myers, who also serves as the global chair of investment banking, at the helm. \"These capabilities are on par or better with some of the specialized consulting firms out there,\" said Myers in an interview with CNBC. \"We think it could help C-suite executives be more effective in their roles and learn from our best practices.\" JPMorgan identified several dozen adjacent capabilities to offer clients, ranging from investor relations to real estate selection to health-care benefits to technology procurement. At the outset, the firm does not plan to charge for these services. However, if a client seeks a more time-consuming project or a service that exists on an ongoing basis, they may negotiate some sort of fee structure. The services are intended for clients that \"have, or seek to have, deep and long-term relationships with the firm,\" the company said in a press release. That cohort may include, \"companies considering JPMorgan as their lead IPO adviser, long-tenured clients preparing for transformational deals, or growing mid-sized clients looking to use JPMorgan as their primary operating bank,\" according to the release. \"More than two-thirds of our experts are internally facing people – their No. 1 job is to make sure they're delivering for our firm,\" Myers said. \"They're a precious resource, to some extent, so we have to be thoughtful about who gets it.\" Myers, a 30-year veteran of the firm, had previously served as global head of equity capital markets, and in her expanded role, she'll work with advisory teams and experts across JPMorgan. She said that in the beginning, the Special Advisory Services group will have a \"handful\" of people. And then over time, the firm may scale it if there's a sizable uptake in client demand. JPMorgan is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week. LSEG estimates that for the year through Dec. 11, JPMorgan raked in $9.44 billion in investment banking fees, making the firm No. 1 worldwide, with 7.4% of wallet share. ",

    "body": "Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim during the Premier League match at Elland Road, Leeds. Picture date: Sunday January 4, 2026.Danny Lawson - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty ImagesEnglish soccer giant Manchester United has parted ways with head coach Ruben Amorim, just after he raised questions over his role at the club amid rumors of tensions with the club hierarchy. Appointed in November 2024, the 40-year-old had overseen one of the club's worst finishes in recent history last season, 15th out of 20 in the Premier League, the top division of English soccer.A statement from the club, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, said the move would \"give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"The stock was steady in premarket trading as of 7 a.m. ET, up around 0.1%.Amorim was Manchester United's first managerial appointment following billionaire Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of a minority stake in the club in February 2024 from the Glazer family. Ratcliffe took an initial 27.7% stake, before ramping that up to 28.94% in December 2024, and has since assumed control of all football operations.Since the initial deal, worth $1.6 billion, Ratcliffe has also made a series of changes to the club's structure, hiring a new CEO and Director of Football.Speaking before his departure, Amorim hinted at frustrations over his role at the club following a draw with Leeds United on Sunday.\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months (when his contract expires) and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.\"The club is currently 6th in the Premier League.Manchester United said former player Darren Fletcher will lead the club in its next game against Burnley on Wednesday.",

    "body": "watch nowVersant Media Group, the portfolio of cable TV networks and digital assets spun off by Comcast, joined the small cohort of public media companies Monday as the industry reckons with ongoing disruption. Versant began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \"VSNT,\" opening at $45.17 per share. The company's so-called when-issued stock — a security that is expected to be issued and has been authorized to trade on a conditional basis to give investors an early chance to buy shares — initially began trading on Dec. 15 at $55 per share and ended trading Friday at $46.65 per share. As of mid-morning Monday, Versant shares had fallen to roughly $40 per share, down 14% on the day. The company's market capitalization stands at roughly $6.5 billion with shares outstanding of 145.76 million based on the spinoff ratio. As part of the spinoff, Comcast shareholders received one share of Versant stock for every 25 shares of Comcast stock they owned. \"It's been a year in the making,\" said Mark Lazarus, Versant CEO, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. In November 2024, Comcast announced its intention to separate out the bulk of NBCUniversal's cable TV networks, including MS Now (formerly MSNBC), CNBC, Golf Channel, USA, E!, Syfy and Oxygen, as well as digital properties Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and Sports Engine. \"As part of Comcast and NBCU we had other priorities as a company,\" Lazarus said. \"We made different decisions, because we had a different company and a different strategy. Now we're bringing these [assets] into their own company, we're going to be able to invest into them. We'll invest organically ... and hopefully the market is listening to what we're saying.\" Lazarus said \"vertical scale\" is necessary to diversify the business away from a dependence on pay TV. \"While that's still a big, profitable part for us, it's not going to be the end game,\" he said.There are few traditional media companies that have gone public in recent years — namely because of the significant challenges the industry has been facing due to the shift away from the TV bundle and toward streaming.  In 2025, Newsmax, the conservative cable news network, went public on the New York Stock Exchange and quickly saw its shares soar from its $14 per share opening price. It has fallen precipitously since its debut. Instead, the media sector has been marked by a rush for consolidation and fresh M&A deals. Paramount Skydance completed its merger last year, and since then CEO David Ellison has been acquisitive. Warner Bros. Discovery, itself formed following a merger in 2022, last year kicked off a sale process that resulted in a proposed deal with Netflix. Paramount has since made a hostile offer to WBD shareholders to upend the proposed transaction with Netflix. Mark Lazarus, CEO of Versant, visits the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., July 21, 2025.  Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThe Versant spinoff was likewise a result of the disruptive media landscape. Its executives, led by CEO Lazarus, former chairman of NBCUniversal's media group, spent the final months of 2025 convincing Wall Street investors that the future of the business would be focused on growing the digital presence of its portfolio. The company has also highlighted its strength in news and sports, the two categories of programming that still receive the bulk of TV viewers. Although networks like those in Versant's portfolio are seeing declines in financials, they are still profitable and beckon ad dollars. On Monday, Lazarus once again pointed to Versant's weight in sports and news, saying 62% of the portfolio is in those two content areas. \"We have a really strong position,\" Lazarus said. In September Versant reported declining revenue in recent years as consumers exit the cable TV bundle. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of going public, Versant's assets generated $7.1 billion in revenue in 2024 , down from $7.4 billion in 2023 and $7.8 billion in 2022. The company said its net income attributable to Versant was $1.4 billion in 2024, down from $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022. Shortly after, ratings agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings each issued BB credit ratings on the company's debt noting stable outlooks, placing the company's rating in junk territory. This was based on Versant's plans to issue $2.75 billion of new senior secured debt to fund a one-time $2.25 billion cash distribution to Comcast and add $500 million to its balance sheet, according to S&P. Versant's low debt levels have boded well for the company with both ratings agencies and have been a highlight in its pitch to Wall Street investors. Media peers like Warner Bros. Discovery have grappled with heavy debt loads while also contending with the decline of cable TV subscribers and lower ad revenue. Both ratings agencies noted the headwinds facing the traditional TV landscape, which S&P said \"offset the strength of [Versant's] portfolio,\" noting that revenue from linear distribution and advertising from its networks accounted for more than 80% of total revenue. Fitch said \"the strong viewer loyalty and engagement\" with Versant's TV networks, as well as its conservative debt structure, bodes as a positive for the company. Versant executives said at a recent investor day presentation that the company intends to grow its digital business through acquisitions and investments.— CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this article.

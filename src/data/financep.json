The minerals are essential for high-tech industries, including automobiles, defense and semiconductors.Trump suggested earlier Friday that he would cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea because of China's new controls.Nearly every product imported into the U.S. from China already faces steep tariffs. While there are different levels of specific duties on imports, ranging from 50% on steel and aluminum, to 7.5% on consumer goods, the so-called effective tariff rate on Chinese imports currently is 40%, according to Wells Fargo Economics and analysts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\"It has just been learned that China has taken an extraordinarily aggressive position on Trade in sending an extremely hostile letter to the World, stating that they were going to, effective November 1st, 2025, impose large scale Export Controls on virtually every product they make, and some not even made by them,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continues\"This affects ALL Countries, without exception, and was obviously a plan devised by them years ago. It is absolutely unheard of in International Trade, and a moral disgrace in dealing with other Nations,\" Trump wrote.\"Based on the fact that China has taken this unprecedented position, and speaking only for the U.S.A., and not other Nations who were similarly threatened, starting November 1st, 2025 (or sooner, depending on any further actions or changes taken by China), the United States of America will impose a Tariff of 100% on China, over and above any Tariff that they are currently paying,\" he wrote.\"Also on November 1st, we will impose Export Controls on any and all critical software.\"China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that starting Dec. 1 foreign entities must have a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of rare earths sourced from that country, or that are manufactured using Chinese extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology."

Ken Cedeno | ReutersDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday announced an agreement to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at a U.S. Air Force Base in Idaho.Hegeth said the facility at the Mountain Home Air Force Base will allow pilots from Qatar's air force to train with American military personnel.The Defense secretary made the announcement at a Pentagon press conference with Qatari Defense Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al Thani.Hegseth said the facility will \"host a contingent a Qatari F-15's and pilots to enhance our combined training, increase lethality, interoperability, it's just another example of our partnership.\"Qatar is a key U.S. ally in the Middle East. The Al-Udeid Air Base, whose 10,000 or so service members make it the largest American military installation in the Middle East, is located in Qatar, near the capital of Doha.Laura Loomer, a right-wing activist who has influence with President Donald Trump, blasted the announcement.\"Never thought I'd see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,\" Loomer wrote on X.\"I don't think I'll be voting in 2026. I cannot in good conscience make any excuses for the harboring of jihadis. This is where I draw the line,\" Loomer wrote.Trump himself in 2017 said, \"The nation of Qatar, unfortunately, has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level.\" That comment came during a dispute between Qatar and other Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain, who had blockaded Qatar over claims that it had backed extremist Muslim groups.Qatar has denied financing terrorists.After a backlash among some Trump supporters, such as Loomer, to Friday's announcement, Hegseth posted what he called an \"important clarification\" on X, saying, \"The U.S. military has a long-standing partnership w/ Qatar, including today's announced cooperation w/ F-15QA aircraft.\"\"However, to be clear, Qatar will not have their own base in the United States â€” nor anything like a base,\" Hegseth wrote. \"We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.\"The Mountain Home Air Force Base currently has a contingent of F-15 fighter jets from Singapore's air force stationed there as part of a training program for that nation's pilots.The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Hegseth's announcement.The announcement is another sign of the deepening of the relationship between the Trump administration and Qatar.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump puts extra 100% tariff on China imports, adds export controls on 'critical software'Qatar Air Force facility to be built at USAF base in Idaho, Defense Secretary Hegseth saysTrump nominee Paul Ingrassia reportedly accused of sexual harassmentTrump administration begins layoffs of federal workers amid government shutdownNew York AG James indicted by grand jury after Trump called for chargesTrump threatens 'massive' tariff hike on China over rare earths disputeNobel Peace Prize winner Machado praises Trump after White House criticizes snub'There will start to be layoffs' if Trump decides shutdown talks have stalled, Hassett saysEpstein bank records sought by top House Democrat from Jamie Dimon, other CEOsTreasury weighs minting $1 coin with Trump's face for U.S. 250th anniversaryGovernment shutdown: Senate funding measures fail again as deadlock continuesIn September, after Israel executed an airstrike on senior leaders of the Hamas terror group in Doha, Trump signed an executive order \"assuring the security of the state of Qatar.\"Earlier this year, the U.S accepted a Boeing 747 jet as a gift from the Qatari royal family. Trump has said he wants that jet, valued at $400 million, converted for use as Air Force One, the presidential aircraft.NBC News has reported that the jet is expected to be handed over to Trump's future presidential library after he leaves the White House in January 2029.A Pentagon spokesperson told CNBC that Hegseth accepted the luxury plane \"in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.\"The gift drew criticism from Democrats and others who said the jet looked like a bribe to Trump.Trump's family business has also been expanding its footprint in the Middle East -- including a golf resort in Doha with Qatar's sovereign wealth fund's real estate arm, as well as a Trump International Hotel & Tower in Dubai, a Trump Tower located in Jeddah, and a hotel that is under construction in Muscat."

Ingrassia, nominee to lead the Office of Special Counsel.Source: DHSPresident Donald Trump's nominee to head the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Paul Ingrassia, was accused of sexual harassment, Politico reported.Ingrassia, who is currently the White House liaison for the Department of Homeland Security, was investigated in connection with an incident in late July in which he told a lower-ranking female colleague on a business trip that she would be sharing a hotel room with him, Politico reported Thursday. The outlet cited five unnamed administration officials.The woman later \"discovered that Ingrassia had arranged ahead of time to have her hotel room canceled so she would have to stay with him,\" three officials said, according to Politico.She \"initially protested\" the arrangement, but relented in order to avoid causing a scene around other colleagues, Politico reported officials saying. The two slept in separate beds in the room, according to Politico.In a letter to Politico, a lawyer for the 30-year-old Ingrassia denied the harassment allegations.The news outlet did not name the woman, but said that she was a Trump appointee, \"Mr. Ingrassia has never harassed any coworkers â€” female or otherwise, sexually or otherwise â€” in connection with any employment,\" the attorney, Edward Paltzik, wrote.Paltzik said that while the two did share a hotel room on the trip, Ingrassia did not cancel the woman's reservation and \"no party engaged in inappropriate behavior.\"In a separate letter to CNBC, Paltzik said Ingrassia \"did not engage in any wrongdoing in connection with the matters reported.\"The woman filed a human resources complaint against him but retracted it days later out of fear of retaliation, three officials told Politico.Â An HR investigation into Ingrassia cleared him, Paltzik and a DHS spokesperson told Politico.The woman told Politico in a statement that she \"never felt uncomfortable\" about Ingrassia's behavior and that she never made a complaint.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Politico's report.Trump nominated Ingrassia to lead the Office of Special Counsel, an independent agency that oversees whistleblower complaints and investigates federal employees.The nomination came after Trump fired Hampton Dellinger, an appointee of President Joe Biden. Dellinger had reportedly opposed the layoffs of federal employees ordered by Trump's so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Dellinger challenged his dismissal in a lawsuit but later dropped the suit.In his role as White House liaison, Ingrassia has pushed for the hiring of candidates at the Department of Justice who show \"exceptional loyalty\" to Trump, ABC News earlier reported.Ingrassia's chances of being confirmed to lead OSC appeared to falter in July, when Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he would not back Trump's pick.Read Politico's full report here."

In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" said Airlines for America, whose members include Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, American Airlines and others.Bad weather could also snarl travel over the long weekend. The National Weather Service on Friday issued a flood watch for New York, Long Island, and parts of Connecticut and New Jersey from an expected storm.During a federal governmentÂ shutdown, \"essential\" workers such as air traffic controllers and TSA agents worth without pay, while many other employees are placed onÂ furlough.A more than monthlong shutdown starting in late 2018 ended hours after a shortage of air traffic controllers snarled air travel in the New York area.Absences of air traffic controllers rose this week as the current shutdown stretched into its second week, Bryan Bedford, head of the Federal Aviation Administration, reiterated to staff on Friday.\"Air traffic controllers are still required to report to work and carry out their critical duties. The safety and efficiency of our airspace depend on them,\" he said in a note to employees, which was seen by CNBC.Tuesday will mark the first partial paycheck for air traffic controllers, and Oct. 28 would be the first suspended payday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, the controllers' union, said on Friday.The union said it plans to start informational leafleting on Tuesday at New York's LaGuardia Airport about the effects of the shutdown on controllers. Similar events areÂ scheduled at other airports in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Philadelphia. \"Participating air traffic controllers and other aviation safety professionals plan to engage with travelers to explain how the government shutdown introduces unnecessary risk to the National Airspace System (NAS) and is detrimental to efficiency,\" the union said.Delta CEO Ed Bastian earlier this week told CNBC that the carrier has so far not seen \"any impacts at all\" to its operation because of the shutdown. However, he said that could change if it continued for another roughly 10 days.On Friday, close to 3,700 U.S. flights were delayed, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware, below the average daily rate of about 4,100 for U.S. airlines so far this year.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flights"

He also said he expects some clarity on President Donald Trump's plans to issue new tariffs on China. The market soured on Friday after Trump threated a \"massive increase ofÂ Tariffs\" on Chinese products entering to U.S. to counter the country's expansion of rare earth mineral export restrictions. Friday evening, TrumpÂ announcedÂ on social media that he would put an extra 100% tariff on imports.Earnings season kicks off on Tuesday, starting with quarterly results from Blackrock, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Cramer said all three have had solid runs this year, and they \"aren't exactly in the crosshairs of the trade war.\" He suggested Goldman Sachs might have \"the biggest upside surprise.\" JPMorgan and Citigroup will report that day, and Cramer said he's optimistic about the results from both banks.Tuesday also brings earnings from Johnson & Johnson and Domino's Pizza. Cramer said he expects the pharmaceutical giant to report the best quarter of the sector, but indicated the pizza maker could miss the estimates.Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Abbott Laboratories are set to report on Wednesday, and Cramer noted that Morgan Stanley has been surprisingly positive for the last several quarters. He also said Abbott Laboratories is usually reliable.Wednesday also brings analyst meetings from Salesforce and Dollar Tree. Cramer noted that both companies' stocks have been under pressure as of late â€” with Salesforce weighed down by worries about its artificial intelligence offerings and Dollar Tree burdened by new tariffs.Trucking giant J.B. Hunt and United Airlines are set to report Wednesday, and Cramer said these two could provide a solid read on the economy as investors largely lack economic data due to the government shutdown.On Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor, CSX and Charles Schwab will report earnings. Cramer said he expects largely positive figures from Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures chips for industry leaders Nvidia and AMD. Cramer said CSX will likely explain its recent leadership shakeup, while Schwab can give insight to retail participation in the market.Friday brings quarterly reports from American Express and oil giant SLB.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"China's Ministry of Commerce on Thursday said that foreign entities must now obtain a license to export products that contain more than 0.1% of rare earths sourced from that country, or that are manufactured using Chinese extraction, refining, magnet-making or recycling technology.The new rules for rare earths exports are set to take effect Dec. 1.U.S. and Chinese officials have been working to arrange a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming months, which will likely take place in Beijing, experts said.Dilara Irem Sancar | Anadolu | Getty Images\"Some very strange things are happening in China!\" Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\"They are becoming very hostile, and sending letters to Countries throughout the World, that they want to impose Export Controls on each and every element of production having to do with Rare Earths, and virtually anything else they can think of, even if it's not manufactured in China,\" Trump wrote.The president said he had not spoken to Xi about the issue \"because there was no reason to do so.\"\"This was a real surprise, not only to me, but to all the Leaders of the Free World. I was to meet President Xi in two weeks, at APEC, in South Korea, but now there seems to be no reason to do so,\" Trump wrote, referring to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.Trump claimed that the United States has been contacted by other countries that are \"extremely angry at this great Trade hostility, which came out of nowhere.\"\"Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,\" he wrote.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not immediately respond to a request for comment.â€” CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this story."

The app is only available on iOS devices and is limited to invitees, meaning people need a code to access it. Still, Sora has climbed to theÂ No. 1 spotÂ in Apple's App Store, and OpenAI said this week it hit 1 million downloads in less than five days after launch.Major Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association have objected to OpenAI's copyright policies, and top Hollywood agencies are calling it \"exploitation.\" That's led to changes in how the model handles prompts for certain sensitive categories of generated content. CNBC's Julia Boorstin got access to Sora 2 and tried prompts like \"show me a video of a fat orange cartoon cat eating lasagna\" and \"create a superhero that wears a black cape and is saving a woman from a burning building.\" Some of the prompts failed due to copyright infringement, while others worked.

    "body": "Russell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), speaks to members of the media outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, July 24, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal workers across a range of agencies on Friday, the 10th day of the U.S. government shutdown.President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon told reporters in the Oval Office that the number of federal workers who will be laid off will \"be a lot.\"\"It'll be Democrat-oriented,\" Trump said, reiterating his promise to target programs he believes are favored by Democratic officials.The permanent job cuts, formally known as \"Reductions in Force,\" are different from the furloughing of government workers. Furloughed employees return to their jobs after a government shutdown ends.The layoffs were first announced by Russell Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.\"The RIFs have begun,\" Vought wrote on X.OMB soon after confirmed his tweet, and said the cuts \"are substantial.\"RIF notices went to workers at the departments of Treasury, Health and Human Services, Commerce, Education, Energy, EPA, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, and Interior.Â A filing by the Justice Department in U.S. District Court in San Francisco late Friday showed at least 4,000 federal workers received layoff notices, with Treasury and HHS seeing the largest cuts, of more than 1,100 employees apiece.The filing came in response to a lawsuit filed on Sept. 30 by two unions that represent many federal workers, the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of County, State & Municipal Employees.The lawsuit challenges the legality of the RIFs, which at the time the suit was filed were threatened by the Trump administration. A hearing on the unions' request for a temporary restraining order to block the layoffs is scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco.\"These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day,\" AFSCME President Lee Saunders said in a statement.\"Whether it's food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration's political games,\" Saunders said.The layoffs started four days after National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett warned in a CNBC interview that could \"start taking sharp measures\" if the shutdown continued due to the lack of a stopgap funding deal approved by Congress.Hassett said that \"any government worker who loses their job\" will have Democrats to blame for their layoff.watch nowWhile many federal workers have been furloughed because of the shutdown, it is not the normal practice in shutdowns to permanently lay off government employees.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said, \"Russell Vought just fired thousands of Americans with a tweet.Â \"Let's be blunt: nobody's forcing Trump and Vought to do this,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"They don't have to do it; they want to. They're callously choosing to hurt people â€” the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.\"Â \"Here's what's worse: Republicans would rather see thousands of Americans lose their jobs than sit down and negotiateÂ with DemocratsÂ to reopen the government,\" Schumer said.Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, in a statement said, \"I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.\"\"Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,\" Collins said. \"Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.\"Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials.The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it.Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces.Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday.The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.Although Republicans hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they need the votes of at least some Democratic senators to pass a funding bill because of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate required to avoid filibusters blocking legislation."

Prior to that legislation, the maximum child tax credit was $2,000 per child.The maximum $2,200 child tax credit will be in effect for tax years 2025 and 2026, according to an IRS spokesperson. That threshold will be adjusted for inflation for tax year 2027, the spokesperson said.The refundable portion of the child tax credit is $1,700 for 2026, according to the IRS, which is unchanged from 2025. That represents the amount families may potentially receive back as a tax refund if their tax liability is less than their child tax credit amount.Earned income tax credit for 2026The earned income tax credit â€” a tax break for low- to middle-income individuals and families â€” will be adjusted for 2026 based on the taxpayer's number of children and income.The maximum earned income tax credit, or EITC, will increase to $8,231 in 2026 for qualifying taxpayers with three or more eligible children â€” up from $8,046 for tax year 2025.For qualifying taxpayers with two children, the maximum EITC will increase to $7,316 in 2026, up from $7,152 in 2025.For taxpayers with one child, the maximum will be $4,427, up from $4,328 in 2025.For qualifying filers with no children, the maximum amount will be $664 in 2026, up from $649 in 2025.watch nowTo qualify for the tax credit, individuals and families must be under certain thresholds for adjusted gross income.Married couples who file jointly will completely phase out at $70,224 in adjusted gross income if they have three or more children, $65,899 in AGI with two children, $58,863 with one child and $26,820 with no children.For other tax filing statuses â€” single, head of household or widowed â€” the EITC will completely phase out at $62,974 for those with three or more children, $58,629 for two children, $51,593 for one child and $19,540 for no children.To qualify for the EITC, taxpayers cannot have more than $12,200 in certain investment income in 2026.Adoption credit for 2026The maximum credit for qualified adoption expenses rises to $17,670 in 2026, up from $17,280 in 2025. The amount of the credit that may be refundable will be $5,120 in 2026.Gift tax exclusion changesThe annual exclusion for gifts will be $19,000 in 2026 â€” which is unchanged from 2025.The annual exclusion for gifts to a spouse who is not a U.S. citizen will go up to $194,000 for 2026 â€” a $4,000 increase from 2025."

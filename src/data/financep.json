    "body": "watch nowBridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio on Tuesday warned that a bubble could be forming around megacap technology in the U.S. amid the artificial intelligence boom, but said that it may not end until the Federal Reserve reverses its current easy policies.\"There's a lot of bubble stuff going on,\" Dalio told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from the Future Investment Institute in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \"But bubbles don't pop, really, until they are popped by tightness of monetary policy and so on.\"Added Dalio, \"We're going to be more likely to ease rates than to tighten rates.\"The hedge fund titan said he uses a personal \"bubble indicator\" that's relatively high right now. Dalio joins a growing chorus of well-known market participants that have cautioned about the potential for a bubble tied to AI spending in recent months.The Fed is set to cut rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and many investors expect the central bank it will do so again at its final meeting of the year in December.The billionaire investor also pointed out that outside of AI-linked names, the market as a whole has done \"relatively poorly\" and there's a \"concentrated environment.\" He noted that 80% of gains are concentrated within Big Tech. The three major indexes on Monday rallied to all-time closing highs, led higher by technology stocks with more good AI news expected from a series of Big Tech earnings this week.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, all-time chartDalio said there's a \"two-part economy,\" with the easing of interest rates because of weakening in some places while a bubble develops elsewhere.He said monetary policy cannot aid both ends of this spectrum given the divergence, making it more likely that the bubble will continue. Dalio said the outcome could be similar to what was seen in 1998 to 1999 or in 1927 and 1928.\"Whether or not it's a bubble and when that bubble is going to burst, maybe we don't know exactly,\" Dalio said. \"But what we can say is there's a lot of risk.\"",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon said Tuesday that it will lay off about 14,000 corporate employees, marking the latest cuts in the company's multiyear effort to rein in costs.In a blog post, the company wrote that the layoffs are being carried out to help make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, while it looks to invest in \"our biggest bets\" including generative artificial intelligence.\"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones),\" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote. \"We're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and businesses.\"The layoffs are expected to ultimately be the largest corporate job cuts in Amazon's history, CNBC previously reported. The cuts could affect as many as 30,000 employees, according to Reuters, which cited sources familiar with the matter.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawEmployees in Amazon's video games, grocery, human resources, sustainability and communications, ads and devices units were informed of cuts early Tuesday morning, although the layoffs are expected to touch nearly every area of the company.Amazon is the nation's second-largest private employer, with more than 1.54 million staffers globally as of the end of the second quarter. That figure is primarily made up of its warehouse workforce.It has roughly 350,000 corporate and tech employees, meaning the 14,000 job cuts represent about 4% of that segment of its workforce.The company indicated that it will continue to lay off employees in the coming year, even as it plans to keep hiring in \"key strategic areas.\"Amazon's job cuts come as companies across industries including tech, banking, auto and retail have pointed to the rise of generative AI as a force that's likely to or already changing the size of their workforces.Several companies have indicated they can hire fewer employees and still grow their revenues, partly as a result of relying more on AI, which they believe will translate to greater efficiencies and productivity.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in June that the company's workforce would shrink further as a result of it embracing generative AI, telling staffers that it \"will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"Meta last week laid off about 600 staffers in its AI unit in an effort to reduce layers and operate more nimbly. Microsoft has cut more than 15,000 staffers this year as CEO Satya Nadella told staffers they must \"reimagine our mission for a new era\" of AI. Google made cuts to a number of units earlier this year and taken steps to reduce bureaucracy by eliminating 35% of managers overseeing small teams.Jassy, who took the helm at Amazon from Jeff Bezos in 2021, has been on a campaign to slash costs across the company over the past few years. Amazon laid off 27,000 employees between 2022 and 2023, and job reductions have continued since then, though at a smaller scale.Amazon is slimming down its workforce after it went on a hiring spree during the Covid-19 pandemic, partly to meet a surge in demand for e-commerce and cloud computing services.The company has since moved to shutter some of its unprofitable initiatives, while committing to invest about $118 billion this year in AI development and cloud infrastructure. Amazon faces growing pressure to show its cloud and AI businesses aren't lagging behind rivals.At the same time, Jassy been trying to overhaul Amazon's corporate culture and operate like the \"world's largest startup\" as it looks to stay competitive. Last September, as part of a mandate requiring corporate employees to work in the office five days a week, he set a goal to flatten organizations across Amazon by the first quarter of this year.Earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to hire 250,000 workers for full-time, part-time and temporary roles in its fulfillment and transportation units to meet demand for the holiday shopping season.Amazon is slated to report its third-quarter results on Thursday after the market closes.",

    "body": "watch nowMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, who wrote a book in 2021 titled, \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" now says leaders need to shift their approach to climate change.In a letter published Tuesday ahead of next week's COP30 U.N. climate summit, Gates argued that too many resources are focused on emissions and the environment, and that more money should go toward \"improving lives\" and curbing disease and poverty.\"Climate is super important but has to be considered in terms of overall human welfare,\" Gates told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive interview. \"I didn't pick that position because everybody agrees with it – it's I think intellectually the right answer.\"In the letter, Gates called out the \"doomsday view\" of climate change and said leaders need to make a \"strategic pivot\" to focus on issues that have the \"greatest impact on human welfare.\"\"It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into,\" he wrote.Breakthrough Energy, Gates' climate-focused investment fund, reportedly cut dozens of staffers earlier this year. The New York Times reported in March that the \"change shows how Mr. Gates is retooling his empire for the Trump era.\"This year's climate summit in Brazil comes nearly a decade after world leaders adopted the Paris climate agreement aimed at limiting temperature warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.Gates called that original goal unrealistic.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOver the last decade, the U.S. government has stepped in and out of the commitment depending on who's in the White House.The U.S. initially entered the agreement under President Barack Obama, before President Donald Trump pulled out of the pact when he took office for the first time in 2017. After President Joe Biden rejoined, Trump issued an executive order to again withdraw during his second term.Gates said in 2017 that he was \"deeply concerned\" but \"hopeful\" that the U.S. would continue supporting innovation after Trump left the agreement.Gates told Sorkin that pulling back on climate initiatives is a \"huge disappointment,\" but credited companies like Microsoft for investing in alternative energy technologies. Continued support of these innovations will bring down costs, he said.Over the last decade, several major technology companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have set 2030 targets to reach net-zero emissions or go carbon negative.In February, Microsoft sustainability chief Melanie Nakagawa admitted that the \"moon has gotten further away\" from previous goals as the company doubles down on artificial intelligence.\"However, the force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster, and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence (AI),\" she wrote.The massive energy demand needed to meet growing data center power requirements has sparked concerns among many climate activists.In terms of AI and concerns that a bubble has formed, Gates said many investments will be \"dead ends.\"Still, he added, \"If you want to be a tech company you don't get to say no let's check out of this race.\"",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesPayPal has signed a deal with OpenAI to have its digital wallet embedded into ChatGPT so users can pay for items found through the leading consumer AI tool, the company told CNBC exclusively.Shares of the company jumped as much as 13% on the news.The agreement, sealed over the weekend, means that starting next year, both sides of PayPal's ecosystem can plug into ChatGPT: PayPal users can purchase items through the AI platform, and its merchants can sell on it, with their inventory listed there, according to PayPal CEO Alex Chriss.\"We've got hundreds of millions of loyal PayPal wallet holders who now will be able to click the 'Buy with PayPal button' on ChatGPT and have a safe and secure checkout experience,\" Chriss said in an interview.The move makes PayPal an early part of OpenAI's efforts to broaden ChatGPT's use for e-commerce. The thinking is that its 700 million-plus weekly users can lean on artificial intelligence to help them find items, similar to a human personal shopper. Last month, OpenAI said its users could buy from Shopify and Etsy merchants, and two weeks ago it announced an e-commerce deal with Walmart.\"It's a whole new paradigm for shopping,\" Chriss said. \"It's hard to imagine that agentic commerce isn't going to be a big part of the future.\"PayPal is attempting to position itself as a payments backbone for the coming era of agentic AI shopping, announcing recent deals with Google and artificial intelligence firm Perplexity. The fintech firm, which also released third-quarter results Tuesday, issued a release on its OpenAI deal after CNBC's report.The company will also manage merchant routing, payment validation and other behind-the-scenes aspects of payment processing for PayPal sellers on ChatGPT, so individual merchants don't have to sign up with OpenAI, the firm said.Chriss touted the fact that both consumers and merchants have been verified by the fintech firm, reducing the risk of fraud for either group. Users can pull funds from linked bank accounts or credit cards, or stored balances, to pay for purchases, and they'll get protections, package tracking and dispute resolution.\"It's not just that a transaction can happen,\" Chriss said. \"It's that this is a trusted set of merchants, the largest merchant network in the world from PayPal, that are verified, with the largest set of verified consumers in a consumer wallet.\"PayPal also said it is expanding the use of OpenAI's enterprise AI products for its employees to speed up product cycles.At the launch last month of its Instant Checkout feature, OpenAI announced it was partnering with Stripe, which is giving users the ability to tap stored card and bank accounts to pay Etsy merchants.Stripe calls its product, Link, a wallet and says it has 200 million users, but the service cannot yet store funds and has no consumer mobile app, so many fintech experts don't yet consider it a full wallet.",

    "body": "The Grok AI logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with the Wikipedia logo in the background. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesElon Musk launched an early version of an AI-powered encyclopedia called 'Grokipedia' on Monday, with its website temporarily crashing before coming back online hours later. The new AI service, named after xAI's large language model Grok, has been promoted by Musk as an improved and less biased version of the popular free and web-based Wikipedia. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO announced last month that he was working on a Wikipedia rival after a suggestion from David Sacks, a fellow tech mogul who is serving as US President Donald Trump's administration's AI and crypto czar.Musk, who has endorsed Germany's far-right extremist party AfD, has previously lambasted Wikipedia as \"woke\" and criticized it for citing news outlets such as The New York Times and NPR as sources in many of its articles.In a post on X , Musk said that the launch was only \"Grokipedia version 0.1,\" but that a later \"version 1.0 will be 10X better.\" However, he argued that the current version was better than Wikipedia. Reports and copies of the site on the web archive, The Way Back Machine, indicate the site was down for a few hours. The Grokipedia.com page features a search bar on a dark background and says it has logged 885,279 articles, which appear to be in a style reminiscent of Wikipedia.For comparison, the Wikipedia website said it had over 7 million articles on its English Wikipedia as of Tuesday. Wikipedia's articles are also written and edited by a community of volunteer writers and editors, while Grokipedia appears to be solely generated by AI. Musk's 'anti-woke' AI crusade continues Grokipedia represents the latest application of xAI's chatbots into Musk's projects after Grok was integrated into the X social media platform. Musk has also advertised Grok as an \"anti-woke\" and unbiased alternative to competitors like OpenAI's ChatGPT. However, as noted by many media outlets and X users, both the Grok chatbot and Grokipedia itself commonly cite Wikipedia as a source when queried by users. In a statement shared with CNBC, a Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson said the company was \"still in the process of understanding how Grokipedia works,\" but added that alternative versions of Wikipedia have appeared before and haven't interfered with its work or mission.When asked about accusations of bias, the spokesperson said that Wikipedia is written to inform billions of readers without promoting a particular point of view, adding that \"unlike newer projects, Wikipedia's strengths are clear: it has transparent policies, rigorous volunteer oversight, and a strong culture of continuous improvement.\"\"Wikipedia's knowledge is — and always will be — human. Through open collaboration and consensus, people from all backgrounds build a neutral, living record of human understanding — one that reflects our diversity and collective curiosity. This human-created knowledge is what AI companies rely on to generate content; even Grokipedia needs Wikipedia to exist,\" it added.Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales reportedly told the Washington Post last week that he didn't have high expectations for Grokipedia as AI language models weren't sophisticated enough and \"there will be a lot of errors.\"On the other hand, Larry Sanger — a Wikipedia co-founder who resigned as editor and chief in 2002 and has long criticized its current editorial leadership — has previously shown enthusiasm about a new to Wikipedia. However, following the launch of Grokipedia - Sanger posted a long thread pointing out what he called inaccuracies on the AI ​​encyclopedia for himself.",

    "body": "Stock photo of a nuclear power plant.Larry Lee Photography | Corbis | Getty ImagesGoogle and American electrical utility giant NextEra Energy announced a partnership Monday to revive Iowa's only nuclear power plant to meet growing low-carbon energy demand from artificial intelligenceThe Duane Arnold Energy Center, which closed in 2020, could begin operating in early 2029, pending regulatory approval.\"Once operational, Google will purchase power from the 615-MW plant as a 24/7 carbon-free energy source to help power Google's growing cloud and AI infrastructure in Iowa, while also strengthening local grid reliability,\" the companies said in a press release.  The Central Iowa Power Cooperative, the state's largest energy provider, has agreed to buy surplus electricity leftover by Google.The Duane Arnold Energy Center's prior shutdown had come at a time when the nuclear sector was struggling to compete with natural gas and other renewable energy sources due to high operating costs and public perception challenges around safety.However, the nuclear site's revival marks a trend, as energy demand in the U.S. has been surging, with tech companies like Google investing billions in developing power-hungry AI data centers. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, total annual electricity consumption stateside hit a record high in 2024 — a ceiling that could continue to rise if data centers continue to expand at their current pace.watch nowIn the face of rising energy demands, Washington and the tech industry have been pushing nuclear energy as a potential way to address growing concerns about AI computing's impacts on local energy grids.  The Iowa project follows similar nuclear partnerships, including one between Constellation Energy and Microsoft. Meanwhile, computer giant Oracle recently said it is designing a data center powered by three small nuclear reactors.In addition to bringing more energy online, nuclear energy provides a potential pathway for Big Tech to continue their data center rollout while also curbing carbon emissions. \"[The Google-NextEra partnership] serves as a model for the investments needed across the country to build energy capacity and deliver reliable, clean power, while protecting affordability and creating jobs that will drive the AI-driven economy,\" Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, said.Media outlets had taken note when Google, in June, had quietly removed its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 from the main page of its corporate sustainability website amid expansion of its AI plans. Data center projects across the U.S. have also faced growing public pushback. In September, Google withdrew plans for a new data center in Indiana after community groups raised concerns about resource use and environmental impacts, local media reported. On the other hand, Iowa has so far proved receptive to such projects, with Google having invested more than $6.8 billion into data centers in the state. Iowa lawmakers have praised the latest project in the joint release, saying it will support local jobs and energy grids.\"Bringing Duane Arnold back online is a big win for Linn County and the entire state of Iowa,\" State Senator Charlie McClintock said, adding that the announcement shows Iowa can \"keep the lights\" on for residents and businesses.",

Today's number is the four-week average ended Oct. 11.\"ADP's near real-time employment data, released weekly, will now provide an even clearer picture of the labor market at this critical time for the economy ... providing a dynamic view of job creation and loss at an unprecedented level of weekly detail,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.This preliminary data will be different from the better-known and closely followed National Employment Report, generally released on the Wednesday before the government's payroll number. The NER measures the monthly change in job growth during the week that contains the 12th of the month and provides detail of job growth by sector.The preliminary data, which can serve as a guide to the monthly data, offers a four-week moving average of weekly job growth. It will be revised monthly with the release of the NER.The 14,250 increase suggests monthly job growth totaled around 55,000 for the four-week period, compared with a loss of -32,000 reported for September in the NER. However, the total is subject to revision with the release of the NER.",

And I think that is going to be the biggest of all the embodied AI opportunities.\"AI-powered humanoid robots have long captured the public's imagination and companies have been scrambling to produce machines that can revolutionize sectors from healthcare and personal assistance to retail.watch nowInvestors, however, have traditionally been skeptical about the emerging technology, particulalry when it comes to delivering economically justifiable performance in real-world settings.Tesla CEO Elon Musk is a big fan of the concept. Indeed, the tech billionaire said last month that Tesla's Optimus robots would eventually make up around 80% of the electric vehicle maker's value.Wood's ARK Artificial Intelligence & Robotics UCITS ETF's top holdings are Tesla (9.16%), Palantir (7.02%) and AMD (6.14%).Productivity gains\"What I do think is, on the enterprise side, it is going to take a while for large corporations to prepare themselves to transform it's going to take a company like Palantir going into the largest enterprises and really restructuring them in order to really capitalize on the productivity gains that we think are going to be unleashed by AI,\" Wood said.\"In the consumer space, the consumer loves all of this, you know, and I think we're all looking forward to our personal assistants doing our shopping for us,\" she continued. \"I am really excited about not just shopping, but how much my productivity as an individual is going to increase with AI. It already has in terms of research.\"Wood, who also warned about the short-term potential for an AI-related \"reality check,\" said elevated Big Tech valuations will make sense over a five-year time horizon.",

    "body": "watch nowOnline home goods company Wayfair reported a jump in third-quarter revenue on Tuesday, as it beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines.The company said total net revenue increased 8.1% year-over-year.Here's how the company performed in its third quarter, compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 70 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expectedRevenue: $3.12 billion vs. $3.02 billion expectedWayfair shares climbed more than 20% in early trading.For the period ended Sept. 30, Wayfair reported a net loss of $99 million, or 76 cents per share, compared to a loss of $74 million, or 60 cents per share, the year prior.The company's U.S. revenue rose 8.6% year over year to $2.7 billion, while international revenue climbed 4.6% year over year to $389 million. Wayfair said its total net revenue excluding its Germany exit jumped 9% year over year.The revenue increase comes as the overall home goods sector has seen recent struggles, partly due to rising inflation and lower home turnover during a stretch of high interest rates. The sector has also faced challenges in President Donald Trump's furniture tariffs, in addition to other duties — though rates on imported goods from many countries are now lower than Trump proposed earlier this year.CFO Kate Gulliver told CNBC that the company doesn't credit the growth to any macro-related factors like tariffs or interest rates.\"We think it's really being driven by our share gain, and that, we believe is really coming from a confluence of factors and initiatives that we started over a year ago that are now starting to bear fruit,\" Gulliver said.Those initiatives include what Gulliver calls the company's \"core recipe\" – price, product availability and speed – in addition to growth from its loyalty program, site improvement and physical retail. The retailer opened its first large store in Illinois last year to ride the wave of physical stores' comeback. Based on that success, it plans to open another location in Yonkers, New York, in early 2027.Though tariff policy has created uncertainty for the company, she said it has been able to lean on the strength of its model: operating as a marketplace on the back end and as a retailer on the front end.Wayfair saw a post-pandemic slump in sales in what was a \"somewhat challenged\" time for the home goods category, Gulliver said, but the past year has brought increased momentum. Despite tariff volatility, Wayfair's stock had gained roughly 95% this year as of Monday's close.CEO Niraj Shah added in the earnings release that the company's delivered orders for the quarter grew 5% year-over-year.\"Our 6.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin marks the highest level achieved in Wayfair's history outside of the pandemic period,\" Shah said on a call with analysts. \"As we've promised, substantial profitability flow through is powered by a strong contribution margin and fixed cost discipline as our business has returned to growth.\"Wayfair said its active customers totaled 21.2 million at the end of the quarter, a 2.3% decrease year over year.Shah added on the Tuesday call that Wayfair's growth plan is driven by \"Wayfair-specific factors\" and is \"not reliant upon a recovery in the housing market.\" He said the company saw few isolated examples of early purchases to avoid tariffs like a \"short-lived\" increase in large appliance sales in the early spring.\"We see our outperformance as structural share capture driven by our strong day-to-day execution against the core recipe, the early success of the new programs we've been able to launch and from the broad gains we have brought to bear from our technology team,\" Shah said.",

The company has also used the tech during New Year's Eve and summer holidays like Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.Airbnb said the rate of parties reported worldwide has dropped by 50% since it implemented a ban on parties and events in 2020 to curb the spread of Covid. The party ban became official in 2022.The company cracked down on parties and implemented a number of new safety measures in 2019 in response to a deadly shooting at an Airbnb booking that left five dead.Following the shooting, CEO Brian Chesky announced a ban on \"party houses\" in a post to the social media platform now known as X. At the time, Chesky said that the company was also cracking down on \"abusive host and guest conduct.\"Airbnb said accounts that break the no party policy will be suspended or banned from the platform. The company also said its offers features like a 24-hour safety line and noise sensor for hosts.WATCH: Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky on new product updates, integrating AI and state of AI tech racewatch now",

Yes [they've] been a great disruption — the greatest disruption of global trade in 80 years — but we are pleased to see the resilience of the system,\" WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.\"The system is battered, it's bruised, but it's still standing,\" she told CNBC's Dan Murphy on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative in Saudi Arabia.Okonjo-Iweala's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump, the architect of multiple U.S. tariffs on foreign imports to the States, continues a tour of Asia in which he has signed trade deals and truces, so far.But the big prize for Trump will be whether he and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are due to meet Thursday, can come to a deal to reduce duties and counter-tariffs on a range of each other's goods. Trump said Monday that Washington and Beijing were poised to \"come away with\" a trade deal, raising market hopes.watch now\"We do wish that the meeting goes very well,\" Okonjo-Iweala said, noting that any de-escalation in trade tensions would be welcome.\"Any threat of disconnect and conflict between China and the U.S. in trade is not good for either country or for the world. Any threat of fragmentation or division between the two, into two global trading camps, will lead to losses in global welfare, and the poorer countries will be harder hit,\" she said.WTO forecast Earlier in October, the WTO hiked its forecast for global trade growth in 2025, but warned the outlook for 2026 had deteriorated.Despite predicting that trade volume growth would stand at 2.4% this year, up sharply from a previous estimate of 0.9% in the trade body's August report, the WTO slashed its previous expectation of 1.8% trade volume growth next year to a lackluster 0.5%.It cited a cooling global economy and the impact of higher tariffs as a reason for the revision.Trade tariffs have become a dominant feature, and headwind, for global commerce since U.S. President Donald Trump shocked friends and foes alike with his widescale tariffs regime in April.Countries scrambled to reach trade deals with the White House but even allies, such as the U.K., have seen a baseline 10% tariff remain on goods exported to the U.S.Global trade volumes rose sharply in the first half of 2025 — up 4.9% year on year — with several factors contributing to the robust expansion.These included the front-loading of imports into the U.S. in anticipation of higher trade tariffs, and favorable macroeconomic conditions with disinflation, supportive fiscal policies and tight labor markets boosting real incomes and spending in major economies, the WTO said.Strong growth in emerging markets and increased demand for artificial intelligence-related goods — including semiconductors, servers and telecommunications equipment — also fueled global trade growth, it added, with AI-related spending driving nearly half of the overall trade expansion in the first half of the year, rising 20% year on year in value terms.Global competition when it comes to developing AI-related products has heated up.The WTO noted that the U.S. accounted for roughly one-fifth of global AI-related trade growth in the first half of 2025. The bulk of the expansion came from Asia, however, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of global AI-related trade growth in the same time period.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks during the Snowflake Summit in San Francisco on June 2, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Tuesday announced it has completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business.The artificial intelligence startup said its nonprofit is now called the OpenAI Foundation, and it holds an equity stake worth about $130 billion in its for-profit arm. OpenAI said its for-profit arm is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.Under the new structure, the OpenAI Foundation will hold a 26% stake in the for-profit, with 47% held by current and former employees and investors.Microsoft, which has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI and backed the company as early as 2019, said it supports OpenAI's recapitalization and now holds an investment in the PBC that is valued at $135 billion, or roughly 27% of the company on an as-converted diluted basis.The company said it held a 32.5% stake in the for-profit on an as-converted basis, excluding OpenAI's recent funding rounds.Microsoft shares are up 3% Tuesday.\"The more OpenAI succeeds as a company, the more the non-profit's equity stake will be worth, which the non-profit will use to fund its philanthropic work,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet in recent years. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion.In 2024, the company announced plans to convert into a for-profit company, which would have wrested control from the nonprofit and kept it as a separate arm. But after facing pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees, OpenAI said in May that its nonprofit would retain control.OpenAI Foundation will make an initial $25 billion commitment to work to accelerate health breakthroughs and technical solutions to AI resilience, OpenAI said Tuesday.As part of the announcement, Microsoft said OpenAI has agreed to purchase an incremental $250 billion of Azure services, though Microsoft will no longer have a first right of refusal to be OpenAI's compute provider.The companies also outlined several additional changes to their partnership.When OpenAI says it has reached Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which is a term for an AI system that rivals or exceeds human intelligence, that claim will have to be verified by an independent expert panel, Microsoft said. The revenue share agreement between the two companies will remain until that panel verifies AGI.Microsoft can now pursue AGI independently or in collaboration with third parties, and OpenAI can now jointly develop some products with third parties.OpenAI remains Microsoft's frontier model partner. Microsoft said its IP rights for both models and products are extended through 2032, and include models post-AGI. OpenAI's consumer hardware is excluded from Microsoft's IP rights.\"As we step into this next chapter of our partnership, both companies are better positioned than ever to continue building great products that meet real-world needs, and create new opportunity for everyone and every business,\" Microsoft said in a statement.Microsoft is slated to report fiscal first-quarter 2026 results after market close on Wednesday.WATCH: OpenAI begins to threaten software stockswatch now",

    "body": "Members of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) union protest against firings during a rally to defend federal workers in Washington, DC on Feb. 11, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe largest union representing federal workers on Monday called for Democrats in Congress to end the ongoing government shutdown by voting for the stopgap funding measure that Republicans have proposed.\"It's time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,\" Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, wrote.\"No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today,\" said Kelley, whose union represents more than 800,000 federal and District of Columbia government workers.\"Because when the folks who serve this country are standing in line for food banks after missing a second paycheck because of this shutdown, they aren't looking for partisan spin,\" Kelley said. \"They're looking for the wages they earned. The fact that they're being cheated out of it is a national disgrace.\"The shutdown began on Oct. 1, and has led to about 900,000 federal workers being furloughed.Senate Democrats have largely resisted voting for the clean resolution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, saying they want any funding measure to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of 2025, lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Republicans, in turn, say the fate of ACA tax credits should be addressed only after a funding resolution is passed.At least 60 senators need to vote for such a measure because of the Senate's filibuster rules. Republicans only hold 53 seats in that chamber.In his statement, Kelley did not explicitly address the question of the ACA subsidies, but he seemed to refer to it, writing, \"Reopen the government immediately under a clean continuing resolution that allows continued debate on larger issues.\"\"Both political parties have made their point, and still there is no clear end in sight,\" Kelley wrote. \"Unfortunately, shutdowns have become a recurring tactic in Washington.\"\"But there is no 'winning' a government shutdown. They cost taxpayers billions, hurt small businesses, and erode confidence in government itself,\" he said.",

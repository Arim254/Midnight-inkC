    "body": "The holiday season brings out a mix of emotions for many of us: joy, pressure, love, expectations, excitement, and sometimes financial anxiety. Between gift exchanges, gatherings, the perfect decor, and travel, the pressure to show up big can feel heavier than the holiday ham. As a financial therapist, I am here to tell you that this holiday and every holiday going forward: You're allowed to set limits and protect your financial well-being without giving a long explanation.To be more intentional with your money this holiday season, use these six phrases to speak up with confidence.1. 'I have a few pressing financial priorities, so I have to scale back this year.'This is a calm and clear way to let people know your focus has shifted. It reminds them that you have responsibilities outside of the holiday season and that you're choosing to honor them. It also opens the door for understanding without inviting questions or explanations you don't want to give.2. 'Let's do a gift exchange instead of buying gifts for everyone. My wallet needs a breather.'Many people feel the same holiday pressure but are afraid to say it first. When you bring this up, you create space for an honest conversation about what feels manageable. This approach helps everyone simplify while also honoring your financial limits.3. 'I can contribute time, but not money. Put me on setup or cleanup duty!'Acts of service are still acts of love. You're showing up in a way that doesn't drain your bank account but shows you care. Most people will appreciate the offer and gladly accept.4. 'Can we play board games and chill this holiday season? My money is looking a little funny.'A little humor softens the message and makes the moment relatable. This is honest and keeps the conversation light. It could be a board game, a craft, or something your family enjoyed before holiday spending became a competition. This could even become a new tradition that honors connection instead of cost.5. 'I love y'all, but I can't host this year. My capacity just isn't there. How can we switch it up this year?'Some families have rituals where everyone naturally gathers at one person's home every year. But circumstances change, and you're allowed to change with them. Speaking up early helps others adjust their expectations and make new plans without stress or confusion.6. 'I'm trying to avoid overspending, so I've signed out of Amazon and anything else that might tempt me outside of my budget.'This one is straightforward and easy for others to understand. It names a financial habit that most people can relate to, and the humor softens the reality. It keeps things honest without making the moment awkward.Your finances may change, but your love for your family does not.It's one thing to be honest about your situation, but in these moments, guilt can creep in. This can make you feel like you're letting people down, especially in a season that celebrates generosity and togetherness — but guilt often has little to do with the money itself. It usually comes from the fear that changing what we can give means changing who we are to the people we love, which is not true at all. So a few things to keep in mind to help combat any guilt as you navigate this time of year.Remember your \"why.\" Protecting your peace, honoring your budget, focusing on your mental health and preventing debt are valid reasons to make different choices. Lead with clarity. When you communicate early and honestly, you stop imagining people's reactions and start building understanding. Most of the time, others are relieved you spoke up because they were feeling the same way.It's okay to evolve. You do not have to keep up traditions that no longer fit your financial reality. It's okay to shift, simplify, and create new traditions that feel emotionally and financially safe. Use language that sounds like you. If you're direct, choose something straightforward. If you're shy, choose something soft. If you use humor to ease tension, lean into that. With these phrases, when your words feel more like you, the guilt loses its power.Love is not measured by how much you spend. Changing your capacity is not the same as changing your love. Your financial situation may shift, but your love and care for your family does not. Jasmine Johnson is a certified financial therapist and financial counselor.

    "body": "Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAnthropic, the AI startup behind the popular Claude chatbot, is in early talks to launch one of the largest initial public offerings as early as next year, the Financial Times reported Wednesday. For the potential IPO, Anthropic has engaged law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, which has previously worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft, the FT said, citing two sources familiar with the matter.The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, was also pursuing a private funding round that could value it above $300 billion, including a $15 billion combined commitment from Microsoft and Nvidia, per the report. It added that Anthropic has also discussed a potential IPO with major investment banks, but that sources characterized the discussions as preliminary and informal. If true, the news could position Anthropic in a race to market with rival ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which is also reportedly laying the groundwork for a public offering. The potential listings would also test investors' appetite for loss-making AI startups amid growing fears of a so-called AI bubble. However, an Anthropic spokesperson told the FT: \"It's fairly standard practice for companies operating at our scale and revenue level to effectively operate as if they are publicly traded companies,\" adding that no decisions have been made on timing or whether to go public.CNBC was unable to reach Anthropic and Wilson Sonsini, which has advised Anthropic for a few years, for comment. According to one of the FT's sources, Anthropic has been working through internal preparations for a potential listing, though details were not provided. The FT report follows several notable changes at the company of late, including the hiring of former Airbnb executive Krishna Rao, who played a key role in the firm's 2020 IPO.CNBC also reported last month that Anthropic was recently valued to the range of $350 billion after receiving investments of up to $5 billion from Microsoft and $10 billion from Nvidia. In its race to overtake OpenAI in the AI space, the startup has also been expanding aggressively, recently announcing a $50 billion AI infrastructure build-out with data centers in Texas and New York, and tripling its international workforce.According to the FT report, investors in the company are enthusiastic about Anthropic's potential IPO, which could see it \"seize the initiative\" from OpenAI.While OpenAI has been rumoured to be considering an IPO, its chief financial officer recently said the company is not pursuing a near-term listing, even as it closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October.",

    "body": "Homes in Hercules, California, US, on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAfter rising for several weeks, mortgage rates moved decidedly lower last week, but not enough to make much of a difference in demand from current borrowers or potential homebuyers. Total mortgage application volume fell 1.4% for the week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. An additional adjustment was made for the Thanksgiving holiday. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.32% from 6.40%, with points falling to 0.58 from 0.60, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. \"Mortgage rates moved lower in line with Treasury yields, which declined on data showing a weaker labor market and declining consumer confidence,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. Even with that drop, applications to refinance a home loan fell 4% for the week but were 109% higher than the same week one year ago, when interest rates were much higher.  Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 3% for the week and were 17% higher than the same week one year ago. Buyer demand has been pretty weak this fall, as still-elevated home prices, relatively high mortgage rates and uncertainty over the state of the economy all weigh on consumers.\"We continue to see mixed results each week as the broader economic outlook remains cloudy, even as cooling home-price growth and increasing for-sale inventory bring some buyers back into the market,\" Kan added. The adjustable-rate mortgage share of activity increased to 8% of total applications, as consumers continue to look for more savings. ARMs offer lower rates and can be fixed for up to 10 years. They tend to be more popular in higher rate environments.Interest rates were mixed to start this week. They rose sharply on Monday but then pulled back a little bit Tuesday, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. There wasn't much economic data to impact rates.\"That could change on Wednesday with the confluence of ADP and ISM Services--both capable of influencing the bond market, even before the shutdown data dynamics temporarily magnified private data's importance,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily.",

    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market slowdown intensified in November as private companies cut 32,000 workers, with small businesses hit the hardest, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.With worries intensifying over the domestic jobs picture, ADP indicated the issues were worse than anticipated. The payrolls decline marked a sharp step down from October, which saw an upwardly revised gain of 47,000 positions, and was well below the Dow Jones consensus estimate from economists for an increase of 40,000.Larger businesses, entailing companies with 50 or more employees, actually reported a net gain of 90,000 workers.However, establishments with fewer than 50 workers saw a decline of 120,000, including a drop of 74,000 among firms with 20 to 49 employees. The total loss was the biggest drop since March 2023.Education and health services led gainers with 33,000 hires, while leisure and hospitality added 13,000. But a broad-based decline across industries drove the total lower.The biggest loss came in professional and business services, which saw a decline of 26,000. Others shedding jobs included information services (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial activities and construction, both of which saw losses of 9,000.The rate of pay also slowed, with workers staying in their jobs seeing a 4.4% year-over-year increase, down 0.1 percentage point from October.\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"And while November's  slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses.\"The ADP report is the last jobs picture the Federal Reserve gets before it meets Dec. 9-10. Futures traders are assigning a nearly 90% probability that the central bank will approve another quarter percentage point cut in its key interest rate, despite misgivings from some officials over whether further easing is needed.In recent weeks, Fed policymakers have expressed a divergence of opinions. One side sees cuts as necessary to head off further labor market troubles, while the other worries that additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which has held considerably above the Fed's 2% target.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its take on the nonfarm payrolls picture on Dec. 16, a date delayed because of the government shutdown.",

    "body": "watch nowNEW YORK — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court.Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties.\"We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122,\" he said during an onstage interview at the New York Times DealBook Summit.Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin — the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" — whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, \"permanently.\"Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court.President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U.S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures.Bessent cited some of the successes the administration has enjoyed thus far, naming China specifically despite ongoing tensions between the two nations.\"Because of the fentanyl tariffs, the Chinese are making the first the step forward that they've made\" on trade, he said. Bessent added that China has made \"a robust effort\" at halting the drug's import into the U.S.He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case.On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the frontrunner.\"The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks,\" he said. \"The chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion, but at the end of the day ... he or she is one vote.\"Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year.",

    "body": "Waymo partners with Uber to bring robotaxi service to Atlanta and Austin.Uber Technologies Inc.Waymo on Wednesday said humans will begin test driving the Alphabet-owned company's robotaxi vehicles in Baltimore, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. The three cities represent the latest additions to Waymo's quickly growing list of cities where the Google sister company is either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles. That list now stands at 26 markets. Waymo will begin manual drives in the trio of new cities this week with hopes to eventually begin serving fully-autonomous rides there, spokesperson Ethan Teicher told CNBC. Over the past month, Waymo has been aggressively making announcements for new markets and developments at the Google sister company. This comes as tech rivals Amazon and Tesla made advancements in the robotaxi market in 2025. Amazon's Zoox began offering free rides in Las Vegas and San Francisco, and Tesla this year launched ride-hailing service with human supervisors in the Austin and San Francisco markets.In November, Waymo announced that it will soon begin manually driving in Minneapolis, Tampa and New Orleans. The company also added Houston, San Antonio and Orlando to its list of cities where it'll launch service in 2026. Waymo also began offering rides on freeways in the San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix markets, and it named a new finance chief. With more than 250,000 weekly paid trips, Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. The company in May said it had provided more than 10 million paid rides since launching in 2020.The new cities further signal that Waymo is increasingly confident its service can work well in locations with colder weather conditions.WATCH: Waymo launches paid robotaxi rides on freewayswatch now",

    "body": "Russia's President Vladimir Putin awards India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-Called at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia July 9, 2024. Evgenia Novozhenina | ReutersAs India reels under punitive U.S. tariffs over its purchases of Russian oil, New Delhi is all set to host President Vladmir Putin for a two-day visit, signaling its determination to deepen ties with Moscow.The visit indicates that India wants to \"maintain its relations with Russia, especially at a time when it sees the United States as unreliable and China as hostile,\" said Ian Bremmer, president and founder of political risk consultancy firm Eurasia Group.Putin will be in India on Dec 4-5 for the 23rd India-Russia annual summit, with experts saying the two countries will extend their strategic and trade ties.While this visit was planned before U.S.-India ties soured, it signifies that \"New Delhi is not beholden to the whims of the Trump administration and that it maintains an independent foreign policy,\" said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia in the Asia-Pacific Programme at Chatham House.Kremlin said last week that Putin's visit was of \"great importance\" with the Russian president and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to discuss the \"scope of Russia-India special and privileged strategic partnership in politics, trade and economy,\" among other issues.The two leaders are expected to issue a joint statement and may also sign a \"wide range of bilateral interdepartmental and business agreements\" it added.Expanding trade will be the major focus of the summit, which could help India achieve a more balanced bilateral trade with Russia, said Aleksei Zakharov, visiting fellow at Indian think tank Observer Research Foundation.Trade disparityIn fiscal year ended March 2025, trade between India and Russia stood at $68.72 billion, heavily skewed in favor of Russia, according to data government-backed India Brand Equity Foundation. Indian exports to Russia were just $4.88 billion while imports stood at $63.84 billion, it said. The countries aim to expand bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.India could ramp up its shipments of machinery, chemicals, food and pharmaceutical products to Russia, while Moscow is pitching its technological solutions for civilian nuclear energy, including building small modular reactors in India, said Zakharov. \"New Delhi and Moscow are seeking to compensate for India's reduced purchases of Russian oil by diversifying their trade relationship to other areas, including defense and civil nuclear cooperation,\" said Bajpaee of Chatham House.The two leaders are likely to discuss India's purchase of Russia's next-generation Su-57 fighter jets and its advanced S-500 missile defense shield, according to a report by Bloomberg.Some experts, however, have raised doubts over Russia's ability to honor a defense deal.\"India and Russia will talk about weapons, but Russia can barely deliver on the S-400 already on order because of chip shortages,\" said Bremmer of Eurasia Group, adding that \"India is not interested in the su-57 fighter.\" Between 2020 and 2024, Russia was the largest supplier of arms to India with 36% share, followed by France at 33% and Israel at 13%, according to data from Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. But Russia's share has been declining from 55% in 2015–19 and 72% in 2010–14. India is shifting sourcing of arms toward suppliers such as France, Israel and the U.S., SIPRI noted in its report in March this year.Balancing actIndia has been under pressure from the U.S. to cut back on its imports of Russian oil as Washington claims this enables Moscow to withstanding pressure of economic sanctions by the West and continue its war against Ukraine. New Delhi incurs an additional 25% levy, on top of 25% tariffs on its exports to the U.S. as a \"penalty\" for its purchases of Russian energy. The 50% U.S. tariffs on Indian goods, amongst the highest on any country, came into effect on Aug. 27.The U.S. has accused India of importing Russian oil and reselling it in the open market for a \"significant profit,\" enabling Moscow to fund its aggression.  New Delhi has said that its oil imports are based on the \"objective of ensuring energy security of 1.4 billion people of India.\"In its bid to mend ties with the U.S., New Delhi has ramped up energy purchases from Washington with Indian state-owned oil companies signing a 1-year deal to import around 2.2 million tonnes per annum of liquefied petroleum gas from the U.S.The country has also been cutting back on its Russian oil purchases after the U.S. sanctioned Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil.  watch nowHowever, Sumit Ritolia, lead research analyst at energy intelligence firm Kpler told CNBC that Russian oil exports to India will drop in the short term but will pick up through new intermediatory companies that can circumvent the sanctions.A lack of U.S.-India trade deal could mean revenue loss of $20 billion in trade surplus for India while the cost advantage with Russian discounted oil was about $8 billion, said Arpit Chaturvedi, advisor with Teneo's geopolitical risk advisory team.  \"Weighed only in monetary terms, the trade with U.S. is much more important for India,\" he added.Putin's visit to India comes at a time when the U.S. has been striving to broker a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia. On Tuesday, Putin, U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner met in Moscow for five hours to discuss the end of war between Russia and Ukraine. Kremlin reportedly said the meeting was constructive but there was no breakthrough. India will be hoping for an eventual peace deal as that will help reduce scrutiny of the India-Russia relationship, said Bajpaee.",

    "body": "Filip Kaliszan, CEO of Verkada.Courtesy: VerkadaSecurity technology startup Verkada has reached a $5.8 billion valuation after a new funding round led by CapitalG, Alphabet's venture capital arm, announced Wednesday.\"I think Google saw the opportunity with us in the application of AI and everything we're driving to apply AI to the physical security industry,\" CEO Filip Kaliszan told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa.The company said in a release that the investment will be used to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities and provide liquidity.The financing totaled $100 million, a person familiar with the terms of the round told CNBC, raising the company's valuation by $1.3 billion from its Series E funding in February. The person asked not to be named in order to discuss details of the funding.CapitalG also recently contributed to a $435 million fundraise for cybersecurity startup Armis in November.The new funding comes as Verkada surpasses $1 billion in annualized bookings across 30,000 customers globally.The company develops physical security products, including cameras, alarms and sensors, that are connected under a single cloud-based software platform. Kaliszan said his company serves a broad span of businesses, such as retailers, government properties, schools, and transportation.For example, TeraWatt Infrastructure, which supplies charging sites to electric vehicles like Google's Waymo, uses Verkada technology to protect EV facilities.In September, the company rolled out over 60 new AI features and platform updates, including tools like \"AI-Powered Unified Timeline.\" Read more CNBC tech newsFormer cyber spy raises $60 million to fight AI threatsYouTube's new AI deepfake tracking tool is alarming experts and creatorsApple names former Microsoft, Google exec to succeed retiring AI chiefInstagram orders employees back to the office 5 days a weekThe tool can automatically synthesize videos and images from several cameras into a single visual timeline, rather than requiring security teams to dig through multiple videos during an investigation.\"The genius of Filip and the team of Verkada is that they're leveraging AI as a Rosetta Stone to really help unlock insights from cameras to help companies become safer and more efficient,\" CapitalG general partner Derek Zanutto told Bosa.By capturing over 20 million images per hour, Verkada can provide notable data like foot traffic, occupancy rates, security violations and other trends, Zanutto said.He added that the physical security is a sleeping $60 billion market that is led by legacy hardware like \"cameras that just record, not cameras that think\" — a gap that Verkada is hoping to fill. However, AI-powered technology will not necessarily replace human security guards any time soon.\"I think humans will be providing security to other humans for as long as I can think,\" Kaliszan said. \"But AI can empower these first responders to be more aware, to have situational knowledge, to know what to do, and in some cases, actually prevent the problems from happening.\"He pointed to the Louvre heist in October, where multiple crown jewels were robbed from the museum, as an opportunity where AI-assisted devices that could actively monitor, then immediately alert security forces, would be more effective than only physical personnel.\"If you could intervene right then, if you could know in real time that that's happening, the potential for savings and preventing damage is tremendous,\" he said.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowMacy's on Wednesday beat Wall Street's sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company's turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum.The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion.Macy's said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares with its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy's includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace.It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy's raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and \"some moderation\" in discretionary spending. Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy's said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. And Macy's said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter.The company's shares dropped nearly 5% in premarket trading Wednesday.In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a \"prudent view\" of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it's not sure how \"aspirational customers,\" those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season.\"We're pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,\" he said. Spring said Macy's department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury.Here's how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expectedMacy's is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy's department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer's business, but their performance has lagged behind the company's higher-end department store, Bloomingdale's, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy's stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the \"First 50,\" and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy's locations. That's more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy's plans to keep open.Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy's locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. The company hasn't yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy's net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents.Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter.In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won't be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%.Bloomingdale's posted the strongest performance of the company's brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury's comparable sales increased 1.1%.Spring attributed the company's better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy's has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs.He said he visited Macy's stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. \"I like the way we're showing up,\" Spring said. \"We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.\"The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures dropped in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy's stores and website, along with those of its competitors.Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy's has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came in lower than the company expected, he said. Still, Spring said Macy's has made \"selective\" price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs.As of Tuesday's close, Macy's shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500's 16% gains during the same period. Macy's stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company's market cap to about $6.10 billion.",

    "body": "Marvell Technology Group Ltd. headquarters in Santa Clara, California, on Sept. 6, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor company Marvell on Tuesday announced that it will acquire Celestial AI for at least $3.25 billion in cash and stock.The purchase price could increase to $5.5 billion if Celestial hits revenue milestones, Marvell said. Marvell shares rose 13% in extended trading Tuesday as the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat expectations and said on the earnings call that it expected data center revenue to rise 25% next year. The deal is an aggressive move for Marvell to acquire complimentary technology to its semiconductor networking business. The addition of Celestial could enable Marvell to sell more chips and parts to companies that are currently committing to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure for AI.  Marvell stock is down 18% so far in 2025 even as semiconductor rivals like Broadcom have seen big valuation increases driven by excitement around artificial intelligence.Celestial is a startup focused on developing optical interconnect hardware, which it calls a \"photonic fabric,\" to connect high-performance computers. Celestial was reportedly valued at $2.5 billion in March in a funding round, and Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan joined the startup's board in January. Optical connections are becoming increasingly important because the most advanced AI systems need those parts tie together dozens or hundreds of chips so they can work as one to train and run the biggest large-language models.Currently, many AI chip connections are done using copper wires, but newer systems are increasingly using optical connections because they can transfer more data faster and enable physically longer cables. Optical connections also cost more. \"This builds on our technology leadership, broadens our addressable market in scale-up connectivity, and accelerates our roadmap to deliver the industry's most complete connectivity platform for AI and cloud customers,\" Marvell CEO Matt Murphy said in a statement. Marvell said that the first application of Celestial technology would be to connect a system based on \"large XPUs,\" which are custom AI chips usually made by the companies investing billions in AI infrastructure. On Tuesday, the company said that it could even integrate Celestial's optical technology into custom chips, and based on customer traction, the startup's technology would soon be integrated into custom AI chips and related parts called switches.Amazon Web Services Vice President Dave Brown said in a statement that Marvell's acquisition of Celestial will \"help further accelerate optical scale-up innovation for next-generation AI deployments.\"The maximum payout for the deal will be triggered if Celestial can record $2 billion in cumulative revenue by the end of fiscal 2029. The deal is expected to close early next year. In its third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, Marvell earnings of 76 cents per share on $2.08 billion in sales, versus LSEG expectations of 73 cents on $2.07 billion in sales. Marvell said that it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be $2.2 billion, slightly higher than LSEG's forecast of $2.18 billion.

    "body": "watch nowLevi Strauss CEO Michelle Gass was out for a run in San Francisco last March when she first heard the song \"Levii's Jeans\" from Beyonce's latest album, \"Cowboy Carter.\" \"Literally, I got chills,\" Gass recounted to CNBC, adding the name-check represented a \"once in a lifetime\" marketing opportunity she couldn't afford to squander. \"She is one of the most celebrated and influential artists of our time. ... We asked the question, 'Could there be something more?'\" Six months later, Levi announced Beyonce would star in a new global marketing campaign. Then, a pattern that's repeated itself since Levi invented blue jeans more than 150 years ago happened again: competitors raced to catch up.Gap and American Eagle launched their own star-studded campaigns the following summer in a bid to sell more jeans. Gap partnered with girl group Katseye in its viral made-for-TikTok \"Milkshake\" ad, while American Eagle chose actress Sydney Sweeney for its controversial \"good jeans\" campaign. Just before Thanksgiving, American Eagle launched another celebrity campaign with a different type of star: Martha Stewart. Some smaller brands that can't pay for a name like Beyonce have gotten free marketing just from celebrities wearing their denim. In late August, Kylie Jenner posted a picture of herself in True Religion jeans, leading to a spike in sales, CEO Michael Buckley told CNBC. He called it the \"ultimate compliment.\" Industrywide, brands aired nearly 70% more denim TV spots this year compared with last, as the global jeans market swelled to $101 billion, up 28% since 2020, according to data from TV outcomes company EDO and market research company Euromonitor International. Behind the big campaigns were hints about each retailer's strategies and challenges. American Eagle is trying to win over more men. Levi's wants to court more women. Gap is working to find relevance among a new generation of shoppers. But taken together, the marketing shows the lengths companies are going to dominate a growing denim category that is still up for grabs — even if Levi may have created it. In an economy where many shoppers are thinking twice before shelling out for a new pair of jeans, retailers are scrapping harder than ever to win every dollar they can. \"There definitely is a denim war. There's a war for people's attention. There's a war for people's spend,\" said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and GlobalData managing director. \"Who has the most comfortable denim? Who has the softest feel? Who has the best cuts? What fits me well? There's much more consideration in the customer buying process than for some other products, so it does make it much more of a battle between the retailers.\" Why retailers are betting on denim nowLike all things in fashion, denim goes through cycles. It's a stalwart garment in any closet, but sometimes it's in fashion, and sometimes it's not. The last time denim was this big was during the 2000s when brands like True Religion and Joe's Jeans were a favorite among A-listers before athleisure became more popular and transformed casual dressing. \"When we came out of Covid, I think to me this is really when it started, when we started to see consumers basically say, 'Look, I want to feel like I am not sitting in my house anymore, I want to feel like I am getting dressed up to go out,'\" said Janine Stichter, a retail analyst and managing director at financial services firm BTIG. \"That kind of started to bring about the denim cycle that we're in right now.\" In past denim booms, certain cuts dominated, like skinny jeans in the 2000s and bell bottoms and flares in the 1970s. This time around, any cut goes, and consumers are moving beyond jeans to a wider variety of denim garments, creating a bigger market opportunity. \"Now we're seeing everything from wide leg to barrel leg to bootcut. It all kind of has a place,\" said Stichter. \"That's a reason why companies might want to invest behind it, because there's just so many styles that consumers are accepting right now.\" Denim has been a bright spot for retailers in a sluggish apparel market, but they've had to fight harder for consumer attention as more rivals invest in the space. Younger shoppers are prioritizing value over brand loyalty, cash-strapped consumers are pulling back on new clothes and the category has grown increasingly competitive, analysts said. A woman walks next to a poster of Beyonce's Levi Jeans campaign on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024 in Los Angeles, CA.Michael Blackshire | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesMajor apparel players like Levi, Gap and American Eagle aren't just competing with one another. They're also vying against emerging brands, fast-fashion retailers and thrift stores, where many Gen Z consumers might opt for a vintage pair of jeans instead of buying new. To cut through all of the noise, companies needed to go big with their marketing campaigns, said Saunders. \"The whole world and his wife are on denim at the moment. Everyone's pushing and talking about it, so they just needed to do something that was a little bit more edgy,\" Saunders said. \"They didn't want to play it safe, because that's not really going to make noise in the market.\"For Gap and American Eagle, both legacy mall players with fading relevance, the denim play goes deeper than just driving revenue. In a way, they're reintroducing themselves to a new generation of customers as they work to reclaim their standing in fashion and culture. \"Leaning into denim and having these big campaigns around denim is part of a wider push to reinvigorate the brands, and I think that's why they've gone all out on it, because they see denim almost as a halo that can shine light on the rest of the brand and the things that they're doing,\" said Saunders. \"It's the relevance play because … American Eagle had become a little bit stale and was struggling with the results, Gap is in the midst of a reinvention to really try to make the brand much more relevant, especially to younger consumers.\" In an interview with CNBC, Gap CEO Richard Dickson said the Katseye campaign allowed the company to reach a wide set of consumers in a strategic way. \"It has absolutely resonated with Gen Z, who is still in the discovery phase of the Gap brand,\" he said. \"But what it also did is, it reinforced loyalty with our core consumer. So again, we're bridging the generation gap by appealing to multiple audiences.\"Gap Inc. KatseyeSource: Gap Inc.While the market has been flooded with denim advertisements, the content of the ads is having a big impact on engagement, EDO said. The effectiveness of jeans ads, measured by consumer engagement like searches and site visits, improved 9% year over year from January through August, suggesting the creative messaging behind the spots matters more than frequency, EDO said. Levi's denim ads were 304% more effective than the average clothing ad, even after it cut back on airings by nearly a third, said EDO. How did big denim ads perform? Retailers don't disclose how much they spend on individual advertising campaigns, but those investments are part of a company's selling, general and administrative costs, which they disclose in filings. In Levi's fiscal year ended Dec. 1, 2024, which covers the debut of its Beyonce campaign, the company's SG&A expenses were nearly $200 million higher than the previous year, more than half of which was spent in the quarter the campaign debuted. The company previously acknowledged the Beyonce ads contributed to the higher costs, and Gass told CNBC it was a bet worth taking.\"The Beyonce campaign had a great return for us,\" said Gass. \"When we look at our business results, our sales are growing, but our profits are growing as well overall, so we feel good about the investment.\"Since Gass took over, winning over more female shoppers has been at the core of her strategy, and the company's Beyonce campaign is helping it achieve that goal. Last October, days after the campaign launched, Levi said its women's business represented about 35% of overall revenue. A year later, it's about 38%. \"It's driving a lot of our growth. That should be half of our business,\" said Gass. \"Based on the momentum we're seeing, there's no reason why we can't achieve that.\" True Religion, which is privately held and doesn't disclose its financials, told CNBC denim sales rose 38% between Aug. 20 and Aug. 22, the time period in which social media influencer Alix Earle and Jenner made organic posts about the company's jeans. \"When Kylie posted, not only did she put us in a story, but she put us in a carousel as a hard post on her wall. She probably charges 500,000 to a million dollars for that,\" said Kristen D'Arcy, True Religions' chief marketing officer and head of digital growth. \"The results of those posts, especially on women's denim sales, was pretty incredible.\"Since American Eagle and Gap's campaigns are newer, it's too early to say how they have affected long-term sales. But they've already made their mark in culture and on Wall Street. An American Eagle advertisement featuring actress Sydney Sweeney on a billboard in Times Square in New York, US, on Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen American Eagle announced its campaign with Sweeney, the company became a meme stock sensation, only to see those gains erased after it faced criticism over the ad's tone and messaging. Later, President Donald Trump weighed in and called it the \"hottest ad out there,\" leading the stock to soar once again. \"It was billions of impressions. I mean, it was amazing what happened. It struck a new conversation,\" Jennifer Foyle, president and executive creative director for AE & Aerie, told CNBC in an interview. \"When we launched that campaign, we knew it was going to be exciting but it really took off.\" Some news reports suggested foot traffic at the company's stores fell in the aftermath of the ad. However, the company later said traffic across channels had been \"consistently positive throughout August,\" the month after the campaign launched. Following the Sweeney ad and another campaign with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, the company said in early September it had seen \"meaningful improvement in the business,\" with growth in comparable sales and the acquisition of 700,000 new customers. \"It definitely helped our traffic. We definitely gained new customers,\" said Foyle. \"Keep in mind, those new customers don't always come right back and shop, right? So, definitely there'll be a halo effect for sure as we head into Q4 and future seasons.\" Following the controversy over the campaign, American Eagle apparently removed one of the ads from most of its social pages – the one where Sweeney discusses genes being passed down from parent to offspring that incited the most blowback and comparisons to eugenics. The spot is now only visible on American Eagle's Facebook page. A company spokesperson denied the retailer took the ad down, saying \"once content is released, it's out for the world to see.\" American Eagle declined further comment on the Sweeney controversy. About a week after the ads came out, it posted a statement on its Instagram page saying the campaign \"is and always was about the jeans.\"When American Eagle issued fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday, it was the first time investors got to see a full quarter of impact from the Sweeney and Kelce campaigns. While the company said that the campaigns are \"attracting more customers\" and creating more attention around the brand, the results showed they're not yet a major revenue driver.At American Eagle's namesake banner, where the campaigns were focused, comparable sales grew just 1% in the three months ended Nov. 1, worse than the 2.1% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Meanwhile, SG&A expenses were up by about $35 million year over year, due in large part to its campaigns with Sweeney and Kelce. The increase in costs didn't have a major impact on American Eagle's operating margin, which came in higher than expected.Last month, Gap said comparable sales at its namesake banner surged 7% in the quarter after the Katseye ad came out -- more than double what analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. \"The brand saw growth in [average unit retail], consideration, organic impressions, new customers, so generating significant traffic,\" Dickson told CNBC. \"Double digit growth in denim, 8 billion impressions, so we're very pleased and excited about the long term proposition and the continued progress the brand is making.\"Meanwhile, the campaign has been a viral sensation, racking up 50 million views on YouTube alone in the last three months. That's five times the 10 million views American Eagle's Sweeney ad saw on the platform in four months. Still, both of the ads combined don't come close to the engagement Levi's Beyonce campaign has seen on YouTube. The four \"chapters\" of the campaign, which were released between last September and August, have garnered a staggering 85 million views combined. \"Levi's is definitely winning the war overall. I mean, this is Levi's home turf, you're playing in the home stadium, so they have an inbuilt advantage,\" said Saunders. \"They have been very savvy about creating the culture around denim. They've got arguably the biggest celebrity on their team, and they've widened the lifestyle aesthetic, so they've really led this.\" ",

    "body": "French satellite group Eutelsat, often seen as Europe's answer to Elon Musk's Starlink, saw its share price plummet Wednesday following a report that Japanese investor SoftBank had sold subscription rights in the company.Shares in Eutelsat were last trading 7.3% lower as of 10:22 a.m. ET.The moves come following a Reuters report that SoftBank has sold 36 million rights, which would correspond to around 26 million shares and around half its stake in the satellite operator.Eutelsat is the owner of the satellite internet provider OneWeb, which it merged with in 2023 in a bid to challenge Starlink's dominance in the market.But the French group has struggled to tap into the U.S. company's market share. Eutelsat currently has more than 600 satellites in orbit compared to Starlink's over 6,750, according to the companies' websites.After soaring more than 600% in early March this year, as Europe scrambled to bolster its tech sovereignty in the wake of the U.S. cutting military support to Ukraine, Eutelsat shares have since dropped more than 70%.The company is seen as crucial to Europe's tech sovereignty ambitions. In June, the French state led a 1.35 billion euro ($1.57 billion) investment in Eutelsat, becoming its biggest shareholder with a roughly 30% stake.Tech sovereigntyIn November, SoftBank said it had sold its entire stake in U.S. chipmaker Nvidia as it looked to free up funds for its investment in OpenAI and other projects.SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, founder Masayoshi Son said on Monday at an event.watch nowThe Japanese giant's Eutelsat move mirrors its \"aggressive monetisation\" across its portfolio, Luke Kehoe, analyst at Ookla, told CNBC.\"With governments and strategic European investors, not SoftBank, now funding the recapitalisation, Eutelsat is becoming less a growth story and more a pillar of Europe's digital sovereignty infrastructure.\"While Starlink is holding on to its scale advantage and is dominant in retail broadband, Eutelsat is carving out a niche in government, aviation, backhaul and emergency connectivity, said Kehoe.\"The open question is whether that higher-value, B2B-centric positioning can deliver attractive returns once the current wave of capex and recapitalisations is behind it, and whether Europe is willing to keep writing cheques at the scale required to narrow the gap with Starlink.\"Eutelsat has yet to respond to a request for comment. SoftBank declined to comment.Correction: This article and its headline have been updated to clarify that Softbank reportedly sold subscription rights in Eutelsat.",

    "body": "watch nowIf OpenAI's internal drama were a Netflix series, CNBC's Jim Cramer says, it would be a binge-worthy mix of tension, comedy and cliffhangers — and Wall Street would be glued to every episode.On Tuesday, Cramer seized on reporting that CEO Sam Altman recently declared a \"code red\" inside the company that suggests OpenAI fears Google's Gemini 3 may be catching up fast in user traction. Cramer said the comparison isn't about which model answers questions better, as both can be wrong, but about distribution and habit.\"Gemini 3 is easy to find and easy to trust,\" Cramer saidWhat rattles investors, he said, is the sense this market could become winner take all, loser take none if November usage data shows Gemini overtaking ChatGPT.But the competitive threat is only part of the story. OpenAI has reportedly slowed development on other projects including advertising products, consumer AI agents and a personal assistant called Pulse, a pause Cramer says creates immediate openings for rivals. Meta could see less pressure on its ad business. Amazon might buy more time to reposition Alexa. Even Salesforce could find room to tout its own AI tools.Cramer argued the bigger risk is financial. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft can borrow tens of billions cheaply. OpenAI, already heavily indebted, cannot. The quickest fix Cramer said would be to settle its lawsuit with The New York Times and reduce legal costs or persuade Microsoft to take an even larger stake and shore up the balance sheet.The real code red, Cramer said, is a capital war. \"All of OpenAI's competitors have better access to credit,\" Cramer said. watch now",

    "body": "Reaching out to strangers is a daunting prospect for many, but Carly Valancy has a \"really special love\" for networking, she says.Valancy, 30, has had a wide-ranging career so far: she's worked in tech, theater and marketing, before becoming the co-founder of Momentum Growth, a growth consultancy for female founders.Through each professional pivot, networking has been key to her success, she says.When she faced a career crossroads in her early 20s, Valancy challenged herself to contact one new person every day for 100 days, an idea inspired by Molly Beck's networking strategy book \"Reach Out.\"The experience \"totally changed my life,\" she says.\"Not only did it give me so many incredible opportunities, jobs and mentors, but it really gave me such a belief in myself — that I could ask for what I want, and I could reach out to a stranger and actually make a genuine connection.\"Five years later, Valancy is trying the 100 days of networking challenge again. She began in October, and the challenge — which, she clarifies, only takes place on weekdays — will conclude in March on her 31st birthday.This time around, she already has a strong network by her side, so her main goal is to \"plant seeds for my future self,\" she says.Her strategy for the challengeThe first time Valancy tried sending 100 messages in 100 days, she felt \"chaotic and desperate to make a change.\" By the end of it, she was feeling burnt out, she says.\"A lot of people turn to networking when they're in those desperate situations, which makes sense,\" she says. \"Maybe you were laid off from a job, or maybe you've moved to a new city and all of a sudden you're like, 'Oh my gosh, I need to be networking.'\"This time, she's being more intentional.Having a concrete list of goals is crucial, Valancy says. Hers are to find \"dream clients\" for her consulting firm, make her personal brand \"more visible\" and to create \"amazing experiences\" for her family.So far, Valancy has scheduled introductory meetings with potential clients, pitched herself to speak at a university, and secured sponsorship from her favorite baby brands for her son's Formula 1-themed birthday party.Valancy doesn't plan who she reaches out to ahead of time, she says: \"I don't want it to feel like a to do list.\"Every day, she chooses a person to contact via LinkedIn, social media or email based on \"just my curiosity of like, oh, this person seems really cool, or they're doing work that I want to be doing in 5 years, or, they've written something that I really love.\"Valancy learned from her last attempt at the 100 days challenge that \"the coolest opportunities came from the most random places and the most random people,\" she says.She logs every outreach message and response on Tether, an online platform she created to keep track of her networking efforts. Last time Valancy tried the challenge, she had a 70% response rate.\"It can be so easy to let these connections or attempts for connection just totally slip through our fingers,\" she says, but Tether helps her stay organized.How she overcomes networking nervesMany people resist reaching out to others because they're afraid \"of being rejected or being judged,\" Valancy says.Even after sending hundreds of networking messages over the course of her career, Valancy still gets nervous: \"The fear around putting yourself out there is so real, and to pretend it isn't is such a lie,\" she says.Instead of letting that hold her back, Valancy chooses to be open about her feelings instead.\"It's really disarming to just tell the truth, and to just say how you feel about attempting to connect with someone,\" she says.Valancy has found that people are more likely to respond positively when she openly acknowledges how stressful and awkward networking can be.\"I can't tell you the amount of times I will reach out to someone and just be like, 'You are way out of my league, and I feel so nervous to be reaching out to you right now,'\" she says.\"The second that we can kind of like let our guard down, be honest, and share that with the person that we're trying to connect with — first of all, the better it feels, the more genuine and truthful it feels, but also the better it is received,\" Valancy continues.Networking can feel \"really icky\" when people approach it from a transactional perspective, she says, but it doesn't have to be that way.She describes her networking ethos as \"the anti-sales bro approach\": \"I just want to like feel like myself when I talk to other people,\" Valancy says.The connections you make today can \"have incredible effects on our life many years from now,\" according to Valancy.\"Life really, really is about who you know,\" she says. \"The professional things, the personal things — all of the best things in our life are made possible by the people around us, and by the company we keep.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Tomorrow's leaders might be today's artificial intelligence-obsessed kids, according to billionaire serial entrepreneur Mark Cuban.\"Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that's needed in the future workplace,\" Cuban tells CNBC Make It, adding: \"Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.\"The students who will use AI to find the most success, now and in the future, are those who use the technology to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them, Cuban said.\"Students using AI effectively know how to ask the right questions,\" because they have been given the opportunities to spend time getting comfortable using the technology, according to the billionaire. \"They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results. AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn't make decisions,\" he said.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterEighty-eight percent of U.S. teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for their students' future success, according to Samsung's new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, which surveyed 620 public middle and high school teachers across the country. However, 81% are concerned that an over-reliance on AI technology will erode students' critical-thinking skills, according to the same study, which is set to fully publish on Monday.\"Access is the biggest barrier\" to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school, added Cuban. Along with fellow entrepreneur Emma Grede, Cuban is partnering with Samsung's STEM resources initiative, Solve for Tomorrow, which plans to distribute $2 million worth of technology and AI training resources to 500 U.S. schools in 2026, Samsung announced on Monday.Educators typically express concern that students will use AI tools to cheat, or that the information they get from AI chatbots and other models will include errors that spread misinformation. Those concerns are valid, research shows: AI assistants can make widespread mistakes, and the technology enables relatively low-effort creation and dissemination of fake images, audio and video.Yet some other experts agree with Cuban's assertion that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively to set themselves up for future success in the workplace. \"AI isn't always a crutch, it can also be a coach,\" psychologist and author Angela Duckworth said in a May 2025 commencement speech at the University of Pennsylvania's Graduate School of Education. \"In my view, [ChatGPT] has a hidden pedagogical superpower. It can teach by example.\"Cuban often likens the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet, which helped spawn Cuban's own early entrepreneurial success. His frequent advice to students today: Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills.\"Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that's what people don't understand,\" Cuban said on an episode of the \"TBPN\" podcast that aired on Aug. 20, adding: \"That is going to be jobs left and right.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "People walk past a Burger King restaurant with Chinese national flags displayed on a street during the National Day Golden Week holiday on October 5, 2024, in Chongqing, China. Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesRestaurant Brands International on Monday announced that it will form a joint venture with CPE, a Chinese alternative asset manager, to run Burger King's restaurants in China.Earlier this year, a subsidiary of Restaurant Brands acquired its equity interests from its previous Burger King China partners, Turkish-based operator TFI and U.S.-based private equity firm Cartesian Capital, for roughly $158 million in cash. At the time, the company said it planned to find a local operator as a partner.Under the terms of the deal, CPE will own roughly 83% of Burger King China. Restaurant Brands will hold a minority stake of about 17%, along with a seat on the board of directors.When the deal closes, CPE plans to invest $350 million into the joint venture. That investment will go toward a number of areas, from marketing to menu innovation, as well as restaurant expansion. Over the next decade, the joint venture aims to more than double the burger chain's footprint in the market, from about 1,250 locations today to more than 4,000 by 2035.\"CPE is a well-capitalized, proven operator with exceptional leadership and extensive consumer and restaurant experience, making them an ideal partner to fuel the next chapter of Burger King China's growth,\" Restaurant Brands CEO Josh Kobza said in a statement.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.For decades, China's massive population and fast-growing economy have made it an attractive market for U.S. companies, including restaurant chains. But in recent years, an economic slowdown have made some companies rethink their strategies. A week ago, Starbucks announced plans to form its own joint venture for its China business with Boyu Capital, a local alternative asset management firm.",

    "body": "Stephen Miran, governor of the US Federal Reserve, at the Nomura Research Forum during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Fall meetings in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday advocated for further interest rate cuts as a way stave off a potential economic softening ahead.In a CNBC interview, the central bank official held to his belief that the Fed should be moving at an even more rapid pace than its traditional quarter percentage point reductions.He advocated, as he has at the previous two Federal Open Market Committee meetings, for a 50 basis point, or half percentage point, reduction, though he said there at least should be a quarter-point easing.\"Nothing is certain. We could get data that would make me change my mind between now and then,\" Miran said. \"But failing new information that's made me update my forecasts, looking out in time, yeah, I would think that 50 is appropriate, as I have in the past, but at a minimum 25.\"Despite Miran's urging for bigger moves, the FOMC in both September and October opted for quarter-point cuts. Miran voted against both those moves but was not joined by any of his colleagues. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" in October, but only because he wanted to no cuts.Though there were only two votes against the October cut, public statements from multiple officials have indicated a wide dispersion of opinion among officials.Fed Chair Jerome Powell alluded to the disagreements at his most recent news conference, in which he indicated that another cut in December is not a foregone conclusion. Some policymakers have expressed hesitancy to but based on data showing inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, while others in favor of lowering rates fear further labor market deterioration.Miran said not continuing to ease would be short-sighted.\"If you're making data for what, if you're making policy for what the data are now, you are backward looking, because it will take 12 to 18 months for that to hit the economy. So you need to make policy now based on where you think the economy is going to be a year to a year and a half from now.\"Policymakers have been handcuffed by a lack of official economic data during the government lockdown. Miran said the data that is available has showed softening in both inflation and the labor market, which itself should make the Fed at least incrementally more dovish than its collective forecast in September indicating a total three cuts this year.Markets are pricing in about a 63% chance of a third reduction in December, though that has been falling gradually since the October Fed meeting, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.",

David Ake | Getty ImagesThe Federal Aviation Administration on Monday will \"effectively prohibit business aviation\" at a dozen major U.S. airports, adding to flight restrictions for commercial airlines as air traffic controller shortages snarl travel in the government shutdown, a trade group said.Last week, the Trump administration ordered U.S. commercial airlines to cut their schedules to ease strains on air traffic controllers who are working without their regular paychecks in the shutdown. Government officials at first didn't curb private flights the same way they did for commercial aviation, though the air traffic controller staffing shortages have slowed travel broadly.The first commercial airline flight cuts of 4% went into affect on Friday and are set to rise to 10% of flights by this coming Friday.More than 4,500 commercial flights were canceled over the weekend and over 17,000 were delayed as staffing shortages worsened around the country, according to FlightAware. Aviation industry members applauded the Senate's progress toward ending the shutdown late Sunday, though a solution for the longest-ever such impasse hasn't been finalized.\"Safety is the cornerstone of business aviation, and NBAA is fully committed to ensuring the safety of the NAS,\" said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen in a statement late Sunday. \"Among the ways we will do that is to ensure business aviation operators have an understanding of these restrictions and their implications.\"Most business jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the NBAA. The FAA didn't immediately comment.Here are the airports included in the new restrictions, according to the NBAA:Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)Denver International Airport (DEN)General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS)George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)John F.

    "body": "Warren Buffett laid out a plan to \"step up\" the pace of giving away his $149 billion estate to his children's foundations, while still allowing for a short period that lets Berkshire Hathaway shareholders gain confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel.Buffett, in a Thanksgiving letter that will become an annual tradition, said he needs to accelerate the disbursement of his Berkshire stock to his three children's foundations because of their own advanced ages and that by doing so it will \"improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.\"Abel, 63, is set to take over for Buffett, 95, as Berkshire CEO at the start of the new year with the \"Oracle of Omaha\" remaining chairman.\"I would like to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed,\" wrote Buffett, referring to longtime Berkshire vice chairman and his cherished business partner, Charlie Munger, who died two years ago.  \"That level of confidence shouldn't take long. My children are already 100% behind Greg as are the Berkshire directors,\" said Buffett.Buffett owns about $149 billion worth of Berkshire based on shares held at the end of the second quarter, making him far and away the largest shareholder. Most of his wealth is in the original A shares which trade for around $751,480 a share.He said 1,800 of those Berkshire A shares were converted into 2.7 million B shares and given Monday to four family foundations: The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. This donation is worth more than $1.3 billion.\"The acceleration of my lifetime gifts to my children's foundations in no way reflects any change in my views about Berkshire's prospects,\" added Buffett.The note marks Buffett's first major communication since announcing plans to step down as CEO, signaling the close of a six-decade run that made him a household name and one of the most successful investors in history.\"As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet.'... sort of,\" Buffett wrote in the letter.'I Generally Feel Good'Abel, currently vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will take over writing Berkshire's annual shareholder letters — a tradition that Buffett began in 1965 and that has become essential reading across Wall Street — while Buffett said he will continue this Thanksgiving message.In one of the most personal passages of the letter, Buffett gave a rare update on his health.\"To my surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people,\" he wrote. \"I was late in becoming old ... but once it appears, it is not to be denied.\"The Berkshire FortressSince taking control of Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has transformed a struggling textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate spanning insurance, railroads, utilities and consumer brands.He devoted part of his letter to reaffirming Berkshire's durability, saying it is designed to withstand nearly any economic environment.\"Berkshire has less chance of a devastating disaster than any business I know,\" he said.Berkshire held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring its unmatched balance sheet and cautious investing approach. It has also been selling equities for 12 straight quarters, reflecting Buffett's caution in a richly valued market.The company's underlying businesses remain strong with operating profit jumping 34% in the third quarter. Still, Buffett acknowledged that Berkshire's sheer scale has become both its strength and its limitation.\"In aggregate, Berkshire's businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll,\" he wrote.Berkshire's stock has risen roughly 10% in 2025, outpacing many defensive names but lagging the S&P 500 amid a tech-driven rally.\"Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management,\" Buffett said. \"Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.\"— With reporting by Becky Quick.",

    "body": "A FlexJet Gulfstream G450 airplane approaches San Diego International Airport for a landing on May 9, 2025 in San Diego, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesDemand for flights on private jets has been on the rise during the U.S. government shutdown as commercial air travel headaches have worsened, the CEO of private jet charter and fractional ownership company Flexjet told CNBC.More than 17,000 U.S. commercial flights were delayed over the weekend, partly due to major staffing shortages at air traffic control facilities coast to coast, according to FlightAware. That was on top of several hundred preplanned cancellations after the Trump administration last week ordered U.S. commercial airlines to cut their schedules in 40 major U.S. airports by an initial 4%, with the potential to increase to as much as 10% by the end of the week, blaming strains on air traffic controllers.The Senate made progress toward a potential deal to end the shutdown over the weekend and into Monday, but an agreement would still need approval by Congress.Air traffic controllers are required to work during a shutdown, but like other essential employees have been working without their regular paychecks since it began on Oct. 1.The disruptions sent travelers around the country scrambling for alternatives. Car rental company Hertz reported an increase in one-way rentals late last week.Private-jet demand was already up over last year, but bookings have spiked in recent weeks, according to Flexjet.In the first seven days of November, Flexjet's fractional ownership and jet-leasing business posted a 42% increase in revenue hours over the same period last year, compared with an increase of about 20% so far this year, the company said.\"That means that our aircraft owners and lease holders are using their aircraft more. It spiked in October, and it's continued to spike,\" Flexjet global CEO Andrew Collins said in an interview Saturday. Flight hours last month were up 23% over last year, the company said.Other major private jet providers didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.Flexjet's charter business, FXAIR, saw a 56% jump in revenue hours last month compared with October 2024, while year-to-date they're up 17% from last year.Flexjet's Sentient Jet unit, which sells cards starting at $174,375 for 25 hours on light business jets, has 24% more revenue hours booked for the rest of November compared with the same point last year.Collins cautioned that it's too early to draw a conclusion on the spike from the shutdown, but said he's seen the company's fractional aircraft leaseholders booking more last-minute, within 10-hour windows.The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday plans to curb private-jet traffic at 12 major U.S. airports, the National Business Aviation Association said late Sunday.The FAA's original order last week didn't require the private aviation sector to specifically cut flights the way commercial airlines were ordered to.The NBAA has noted that business jets often use airports other than the country's busiest.\"As business aviation routing is not fixed, it makes it possible to make use of reliever airports to not burden the major commercial hubs and get people where they desire to go from points still within proximity to their points of origin and destination,\" Flexjet said in a statement.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom.

    "body": "US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a news conference on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol on November 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday called for House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., so that they can vote as soon as possible on a Senate deal that would end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.Johnson, R-La., spoke to reporters a day after the Senate narrowly approved the first stage of the deal to reopen the government, which shut down on Oct. 1.To end the shutdown, the House needs to pass any deal that survives Senate votes. President Donald Trump would then have to sign it into law.Johnson indicated to reporters that he expected votes in the House to occur this week, but he did not state a specific day. He later told the Republican House conference during a call that he would like the vote to occur on Wednesday, although that is contingent on the Senate voting for it completely by then, according to a person familiar with the situation.The speaker said he would issue an official 36-hour notice before the House votes.Johnson said, \"There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.\"Johnson has kept the House out of session since it passed a continuing resolution in September to fund the government through mid-November.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R.-S.D., speaking on the Senate flood Monday morning, urged his colleagues to vote as soon as Monday to send the deal to the House.\"Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out,\" Thune said. \"Let's get it done. Get it over to the House so that we can get this government open.\"\"I am grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro-bill or anti-bill, not to stand in the way of being able to deliver the coming relief quickly,\" Thune said.\"The American people have suffered for long enough.\"Any one senator can delay voting on the bill for days with procedural hurdles. But a vote can be held quickly if the entire Senate agrees that it should happen.The Senate deal, forged over the weekend, drew support from seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democrats, which, combined with 52 Republican senators' votes, was enough to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass.The deal does not include what had been the key demand for Democrats: an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of December.But the agreement, for the first time since the shutdown began, includes a guarantee by Republicans of a vote in December on a bill chosen by Democrats to extend those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance plans purchased on ACA marketplaces.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government. CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdown, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Police officers stand guard outside the Supreme Court on November 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Monday morning that it still wants a block on a Rhode Island federal judge's order mandating that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits for November.The message came a day after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, for a second time, flatly rejected a request by the Trump administration to stay that order pending its full appeal of the decision.That judge's order remains temporarily paused as a result of a prior ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.But Jackson on Monday told the Trump administration to inform the Supreme Court by 11 a.m. ET whether it intends to continue to seek a stay of the order. The administration quickly did so, and said it would comply with her directive to file a supplemental brief on the request by 4 p.m. Monday. Plaintiffs in the case were told to respond by 8 a.m. on Tuesday.Separately on Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order blocking the Trump administration's memo over the weekend telling states that they had to \"undo\" any full SNAP benefits payments to recipients, or face financial penalties.The ruling Sunday night by a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued that memo.And it came hours after the Senate narrowly passed the first step of a bipartisan deal that might reopen the government within days, and fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through next September.\"In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,\" wrote Circuit Court Judge Julie Rikelman in the panel's decision Sunday. \"As the district court found, 'this is a problem that could have been avoided.'\"\"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" Rikelman wrote.\"In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 [temporary restraining order] after the government had failed to comply with it.\"The Trump administration on Oct. 24 broke decades of precedent when it said it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because Congress had not appropriated money for the program, or any other government program, past the date the shutdown began, Oct. 1. Past administrations had paid SNAP benefits in full during other shutdowns.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration rejected the idea of using the remaining $4.6 billion in a contingency fund that Congress had specifically allocated to backstop SNAP.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of nonprofits, local governments, a union and a food retailer, sued the administration in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island seeking a judicial order forcing the administration to use the contingency fund and other pools of money to fully fund SNAP benefits.Judge Jack McConnell, who is overseeing the case, ordered the administration to make at least partial benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund, and to investigate if other money could be used.McConnell on Thursday ordered that the administration pay full benefits, days after the administration told him it would pay only partial benefits — but that it would take some time to do so — and told him that it had ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds.McConnell ordered that the administration use Section 32 funds to make up the difference between the 65% of benefits the administration planned to pay by using the contingency fund and the full value of the benefits. SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion each month.The administration then asked the 1st Circuit for a temporary stay of McConnell's order on an emergency basis, which the appeals court rejected Friday.But the appeals court at the same time also said it was still considering the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] ... and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"On Friday night, Jackson, acting on a request by the administration, paused McConnell's order from taking effect and told the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the request for the stay pending appeal.Jackson's order paused for 48 hours any ruling by the 1st Circuit from taking effect.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 100 lawmakers urged Starbucks to resume bargaining talks with Workers United, the union representing the coffee giant's baristas, in letters sent to CEO Brian Niccol on Monday.The two letters, from the Congressional Labor Caucus and a group of senators led by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., come as the union threatens a strike in 25 cities starting Thursday. That coincides with Starbucks' Red Cup Day, one of its biggest sales days of the holiday season.\"It is clear that Starbucks has the money to reach a fair agreement with its workers,\" the Senate letter, signed by 26 lawmakers, reads. \"Starbucks must reverse course from its current posture, resolve its existing labor disputes, and bargain a fair contract in good faith with these employees.\"A second Congressional Labor Caucus letter is signed by 82 lawmakers.The lawmakers argued the coffee giant has the resources to increase workers' pay and benefits, citing Niccol's $95 million compensation since his hiring. The company said $90 million of the compensation package was in the form of stock awards to cover equity Niccol left behind at Chipotle when moving to Starbucks to take the CEO role.Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber of the US Capitol Building on Nov. 8, 2025 in Washington, DC. Aaron Schwartz | Getty ImagesLast week, Workers United said its strike authorization vote won a 92% approval from its members. If the union decides to strike, it would be open-ended. Workers United is pushing for improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against the company.The two parties are not in active contract talks after discussions fell apart late last year. Starbucks and the union entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April.Both sides have pointed blame for failure to reach a bargaining agreement at the other party and say they're ready to negotiate.Workers United, which began organizing at Starbucks in 2021, says it now represents more than 12,000 workers across more than 650 stores. The company last week told CNBC that the union only represents 9,500 workers at 550 cafes.Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen said in a statement last week, \"We want Starbucks to succeed, but turning the company around and bringing customers back begins with listening to and supporting the baristas who are responsible for the Starbucks experience. If Starbucks keeps stonewalling, they should expect to see their business grind to a halt. The ball is in Starbucks' court.\"In response to the strike vote results last week, Starbucks said it will be ready to serve customers across its nearly 18,000 company-operated and licensed stores this holiday season.\"As everybody knows, Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners. Workers United, which represents only 4% of our partners, chose to walk away from the bargaining table. We've asked them to return—many times. If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CNBC in a statement Monday.In a letter to workers addressing the strike authorization vote last week, Sara Kelly, chief partner officer at Starbucks, echoed the belief that an agreement could be reached swiftly.\"For months, we were at the bargaining table, working in good faith with Workers United and delegates from across the country to reach agreements that make sense for partners and for the long-term success of Starbucks,\" Kelly said. \"We reached more than 30 tentative agreements on full contract articles.\"\"Our commitment to bargaining hasn't changed,\" she added. \"Workers United walked away from the table but if they are ready to come back, we're ready to talk. We believe we can move quickly to a reasonable deal.\"Reuters earlier reported on the letters from lawmakers. — CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed to this reportwatch now",

    "body": "Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) speaks at a press conference with other Senate Democrats who voted to restore government funding, in Washington, DC on November 9, 2025. Nathan Posner | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSenate Democrats are poised to help Republicans pass a bill that could lead to the end of the government shutdown. But the deal they're agreeing to doesn't directly address what was once Democrats' key demand: an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are due to expire by year's end.The Senate took a major step toward ending the shutdown on Sunday night, when eight Democrats in the narrowly divided chamber voted for a procedural motion that paves the way for approval of a negotiated funding bill.Those eight Democrats, who broke with party leadership, were just enough for the measure to hit the 60-vote threshold required to overcome the filibuster. That rule has prevented Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate, from reopening the government on their own.The procedural vote's passage broke a nearly six-week logjam in which most Senate Democrats repeatedly shot down a Republican-backed bill that would temporarily resume government funding at current levels.What Democrats wantedDemocrats had demanded that any funding bill must include significant additional spending on health care protections and other key measures.Most notably, they fought for a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits under the ACA, which were introduced during the Biden administration and are set to expire by year's end. If those subsidies lapse, millions of Americans could either lose their health insurance or see their premiums rise significantly.Democrats also sought to reverse some recent cuts to Medicaid and other health programs. And they aimed to address the Trump administration's freezing of congressionally approved federal funds, which Democrats say is illegal.What's in the funding dealThe text of the funding deal that helped spur Sunday's breakthrough leaves many of those priorities unaddressed. The 31-page bill makes no mention of the expiring Obamacare tax credits.Instead, the agreement includes a guarantee from Republican leadership that the Senate will vote on a health care bill drafted by Democrats before the second week of December.\"That is a big step, because otherwise there's no way for the minority to get a bill onto the floor of the U.S. Senate,\" Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, said Sunday night after helping to broker the deal.Even if a bill to extend the tax credits passes the Senate, it would have to be taken up and passed through the GOP-led House, and then signed by President Donald Trump. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has not promised to bring such a bill to a vote in his chamber.The deal currently moving through the Senate also reportedly does not challenge Trump's ability to make rescissions of congressionally appropriated funds.But it does include a \"minibus\" that funds three of the 12 annual appropriations bills, and it would resume funding for the rest of the government through Jan. 30.That full-year funding would cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, sources familiar with the deal told NBC News. The Trump administration has said that full SNAP benefits cannot be paid during the shutdown, prompting ongoing lawsuits from Democratic state leaders.The deal would also reverse the Trump administration's shutdown-related \"reductions in force\" or layoffs of federal workers, and ensure backpay for the paychecks they missed during the shutdown.Deal divides DemocratsSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., opposed the deal.\"This health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home, that I cannot in good faith support this [continuing resolution] that fails to address the health care crisis,\" he said Sunday.Distrustful Democrats had previously rejected Republicans' insistence that any negotiations on the Obamacare subsidies could only come once the government was reopened.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., has also panned the Senate deal, and vowed to fight it if it comes to his chamber.But King, who negotiated the Sunday compromise along with Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, maintained that it was futile to keep the painful shutdown going in hopes of getting Republicans to bend on health care.\"The question was, 'Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?' Our judgment was that it will not produce that result. And the evidence for that is almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen,\" he told the press Sunday night.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe major shift came just days after Democratic candidates trounced Republicans up and down the ballot in the first elections since Trump returned to the White House.Additionally, numerous polls have show more Americans pinning their blame for the shutdown on Trump and Republicans, rather than Democrats. Surveys have also shown most Americans supported Democrats' initial main demand of extending the health care subsidies.But the stalemate dragged on, taking an increasingly severe toll on major industries and key federal services as many government workers remain furloughed or required to work without pay.Thinned-out staffing among air traffic controllers has caused mounting flight delays and cancellations at dozens of major airports across the country.The political fallout from the Senate Democrats' shutdown shift remains to be seen. Critics were quick to accuse the Democratic defectors of folding despite holding an arguably strong position on the shutdown. But defenders of the move say it could benefit Democrats ahead of next year's midterm elections.\"With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table — or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way,\" Shaheen said in a statement.\"If they don't fix this, here's my prediction. They're going to look at last Tuesday's election as a good night compared to what they're going to see next year,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Monday morning.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Hero Minnie will appear on Disney's newest cruise ship the Disney Destiny.DisneyThe Disney fleet is expanding yet again.Later this month, the Disney Destiny cruise ship will make its maiden voyage from Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, officially becoming the seventh ship in the company's lineup.The Destiny, which is 221 feet tall and 1,119 feet long, can carry 4,000 passengers and 1,555 crew members. For its inaugural season, the ship will offer four- and five-night cruises to the Bahamas and Western Caribbean, including visits to one or both of the company's island destinations, Disney Castaway Cay and Disney Lookout Cay at Lighthouse Point.Like Disney's other cruise ships, the new vessel features themed dining, curated lounges and premium on-board live entertainment. Disney's portfolio of intellectual property has been the bedrock of its theme parks since the very first location opened its doors, and that's translated to its cruise line as well.The Destiny features a heroes and villains theme. Black Panther is the feature character within the Destiny's Grand Hall, a prominent gathering space aboard the vessel, but guests will also be able to interact with iconic Disney villains and anti-heroes like Cruella de Vil, Maleficent, Dr. Facilier, Captain Jack Sparrow and Loki.The Grand Hall of the Disney Destiny features an homage to Marvel's \"Black Panther,\" including a statue of the hero.DisneyThe Destiny sets sail at a time of rapid growth at the Walt Disney Company's experiences division, which includes its theme parks, resorts and cruise line. The company, which hadn't launched a new ship in a decade prior to the Disney Wish's debut in mid-2022, added the Disney Treasure last year and is set to have 13 vessels sailing by 2031.\"We're undergoing the largest expansion in our history,\" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney experiences, told CNBC. \"The Destiny, I think, is just going to be another example of how we continue again to push the envelope on what a cruise experience can be.\"In fiscal 2024, the experiences division posted record revenue and profit, with revenue up 5% for the full year to $34.15 billion and operating income up 4% to $9.27 billion. As of the fiscal third-quarter of 2025, Disney anticipated the experiences segment would see 8% growth in operating income for the current fiscal year. The company reports earnings Thursday.The experiences segment was the second-highest revenue driver for Disney last year behind its entertainment division, which tallied $41.19 billion in fiscal 2024. However, the entertainment segment's operating profits were smaller, at just $3.92 billion.Disney has become a leader in the family cruising space, despite its relatively small number of ships. Its fleet size of just seven ships is dwarfed by the largest cruise lines: Carnival, with more than 100 vessels; Royal Caribbean, with nearly 70; and Norwegian Cruise Line, with more than 30.Disney is considered slightly more expensive than Carnival and Royal Caribbean for base pricing, but if guests choose to upgrade to larger cabins or add food packages or experiences to their itineraries on the major cruise lines, the prices can be similar.Each stateroom aboard the Disney Destiny will showcase custom artwork depicting the epic journeys of famous Disney legends.DisneyDisney's Destiny offers four-night cruises starting at around $2,300 for two adult guests and about $4,000 for a family of four. Five-night cruises start at $2,900 for two adults and $4,700 for a family of four. These prices can increase if travelers select premium rooms or book cruises tied to Halloween or Christmas or for select seven-night cruises aboard the Destiny.Immersive, character-fueled diningLike other cruise ships in the space, the Disney Destiny features upscale restaurants, pools, spas and gaming rooms for kids, but the company injects storytelling into the mix.Additionally, Disney accommodates diners using \"rotational dining\" on its cruise ships. Passengers don't eat in one large mess hall — they are prescheduled to dine at different themed restaurants. Disney rotates the restaurant staff, too, to follow each group of passengers to their scheduled restaurant. As a result, guests have the same servers, busboys and restaurant managers throughout their trip, and the waitstaff gets to know the guests — and their preferences.Among the themed dining halls aboard Destiny is Pride Lands, a feast of the Lion King, which invites guests to dine on a menu with authentic African flavors while live musicians take the stage to present a retelling of Simba's story from cub to king.Pride Lands: Feast of The Lion King is a \"Lion King\"-themed dining experience featuring live musical performances and an African-inspired menu.DisneyAt Worlds of Marvel, families will listen to a mix of hit songs and test their superhero knowledge while they eat. Rocket and Groot from \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" will be featured in an onscreen story that will unfold during the meal. The menu features nods to in-universe locations like Wakanda and the fictional Eastern European nation of Sokovia as well as New York, the home base of the Avengers.A 1923 dining hall, named for the founding year of the Walt Disney Company, celebrates the legacy of Disney's animation. This setting features more than 1,000 drawings, props and other tools of the animation trade, including artwork from \"Hercules,\" \"Sleeping Beauty,\" \"Big Hero 6\" and \"Wreck-It Ralph.\" The menu at 1923 is inspired by the fusion of cultural flavors found throughout California, including Asian, European and South American influences.Guests looking for quick meals and snacks will have a number of other dining options including Cafe Megara and Cafe Merida as well as Edna Á La Mode Sweets, a confectionary with gelato, ice cream, cookies, candies and other specialty treats based on super-suit designer Edna Mode from \"The Incredibles.\"Kid-friendly experiencesFor many, Disney cruises are a family affair. So, the company has dedicated spaces for every age group. It's a Small World nursery offers babysitting services for children ages 6 months to 3 years, while older children can head over to Disney's Oceaneer Club, which features several immersive spaces themed to Marvel's superheroes, Disney's princesses, Star Wars and Mickey and Minnie Mouse.There's a two-story venue called Saga that plays host to interactive shows and events like \"Match Your Mate\" and \"Family Time Game Show,\" as well as Edge, a space for tweens to make friends and play games, and Vibe for those aged between 14 and 17 to watch movies, listen to music and hang out.The Walt Disney Theatre will be the home to a Broadway-style production of \"Hercules,\" a show that features innovative puppetry and state-of-the-art effects.Guests aboard the Disney Destiny will be able to see a Broadway-style production of \"Hercules\" featuring innovative puppetry and special effects.DisneyEach cruise will also include live performances of \"Frozen, a Musical Spectacular\" and \"Disney Seas the Adventure.\" There will also be Pirates Rockin' Parlay Party, a nighttime spectacular featuring a live rock band and fireworks, an \"Incredibles\" themed sports area and all-you-can-watch complimentary movie screenings at Wonderland and Never Land Cinemas.Similar to the Wish and the Treasure, the Destiny also has a Toy Story-themed area that includes a splash pool, wading pool and family waterslide. There's also an adapted version of the AquaMouse water coaster called \"Sing a Silly Song.\"Adult-friendly fareDisney has also designed locations that are just for adults.Quiet Cove is sequestered away from the bustling family activities and features an infinity pool, a poolside bar and a cafe. Senses Spa offers spa and beauty treatments, while Senses Fitness is an exercise and wellness facility.The Disney Destiny also features De Vil's piano lounge, a lavish locale for trendy cocktails, and the Sanctum, a lounge that takes inspiration from Doctor Strange from the Marvel universe.The Sanctum is a lounge for the Disney Destiny's adult guests. It is inspired by Marvel's Doctor Strange.Disney\"We're continuing to take intellectual property or franchises, not just from the big screen, but from our theme parks as well,\" D'Amaro said. \"We did that with 'Haunted Mansion' on our last ship, and 'Haunted Mansion' will be back on the Destiny this time, as well. But, you'll also see a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' lounge, for example, which is just gorgeous, and I think our guests are going to respond exceptionally well to it.\"This is the second time that Disney has brought its theme park IP to its cruise line. The Haunted Mansion Parlor debuted on the Disney Treasure last year, and a similar lounge area, featuring ghostly design elements and spooky cocktails, will be on board the Destiny.There's also Cask & Cannon, which is the eclectic but cozy pub inspired by \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" attraction. This is the first time \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" has been brought aboard a Disney ship in this capacity. The destination will feature themed drinks and decor.Loose Cannons, a drink available on the Disney Destiny at the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\"-inspired pub Cask & Cannon.DisneyMore on the horizonThe Disney Destiny's launch will be quickly followed up by the maiden voyage of the Disney Adventure, which will service Singapore starting in March 2026. Additional ships will launch between 2027 and 2031, bringing the Disney cruise fleet to 13 vessels.\"From a business perspective, the Disney cruise line is very important, not only to the Disney experiences segment, but to the Walt Disney Company,\" D'Amaro said. \"This is a huge brand ambassador for us. So, the ability to take all of the stories that we have to tell and bring them around the world with an asset that moves is very, very powerful for us.\"D'Amaro noted that the segment has seen double-digit returns on its cruise ships and continues to generate high occupancy and strong future bookings.The exterior of Disney's newest cruise ship the Disney Destiny.DisneyBut, Disney's cruise line isn't the only piece of the company's experiences business that is expanding. There are construction plans across the globe for Disney's theme parks and resorts.\"We are in the middle of turbocharging the Disney experiences segment of the Walt Disney Company,\" D'Amaro said. \"So, it's a really special time for this part of the business. We have more projects underway right now than we have ever had in the history of the company.\"The Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, is seeing its largest expansion ever at Magic Kingdom with the addition of a villains-themed land and a \"Cars\" area being added in Frontierland. A \"Monsters Inc.\" land is coming to Hollywood Studios and the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster is being rethemed to feature \"The Muppets.\" At Animal Kingdom, the company is adding an \"Encanto\" and an \"Indiana Jones\" attraction.On the West Coast at Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, Avengers Campus at the California Adventure Park will be expanded to include two more rides. The company is also adding an \"Avatar\" area and its first ever \"Coco\" attraction.Internationally, the company is set to break ground on its seventh theme park resort in Abu Dhabi. Disneyland Paris, Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland and Tokyo Disney are all getting new attractions based on popular IP.\"We have so many more stories to tell, and it's happening all over the world,\" D'Amaro said. \"Every single one of our destinations is undergoing a significant transformation, adding new capacity, adding new stories, adding new ports.\"",

    "body": "watch nowIn another attempt to make homebuying more affordable, President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 50-year mortgage in a social media post. In response, Federal Housing Finance Agency director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, posted that they are \"working on it,\" and that it would be, \"a complete game-changer.\"The purpose of a longer-term mortgage would be to lower the monthly payment for homeowners. The longer the term of the loan, the smaller the principal needed each month to pay it off in full. But such a plan has other trade-offs. Using the latest median sale price of a home from September, $415,200, according to the National Association of Realtors, and the current interest rate of about 6.3%, according to Mortgage News Daily, on a 30-year fixed loan with a 20% down payment, the monthly payment of just principal and interest would be $2,056. If you raise the length to 50 years, at the same interest rate, that payment would be $1,823, a savings of $233 per month.Homeowners, however, would not build equity as quickly because their principal payments would be smaller. The amount of interest paid to lenders would be 40% higher.How it might workThe real question is can Fannie and Freddie do this. Analysts say it is possible, but a 50-year mortgage does not currently meet the definition of a qualified mortgage under the Dodd-Frank Act, which provides investors with a backup from Fannie and Freddie if a loan goes bad. But regulators were given the authority to change that in order to insure mortgage affordability. That, however, could take up to a year, given the need for congressional approval, according to Jaret Seiberg, a financial services and housing policy analyst at TD Cowen.\"Fannie and Freddie could establish a secondary market for 50-year mortgages in advance of policy changes. They even could buy mortgages for their retained portfolios. Yet this would not alter the legal liability for lenders. It is why we believe lenders will not originate 50-year mortgages absent QM [qualified mortgage] policy changes,\" wrote Seiberg in a note to clients.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.How it would impact ratesThen there is the question of the mortgage rate. The average rate on the 15-year fixed mortgage is currently 66 basis points lower than the rate on the 30-year fixed, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This would imply that the rate on the 50-year fixed would be higher. It all depends on investor demand for the product.\"There is not currently a secondary market for such loans, nor would a robust secondary market be cultivated any time soon,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"That means that, in addition to the extremely low amount of principal paid down in earlier years of the loan, the interest rates would also be quite a bit higher than 30-year loans — a double whammy for those with any hope of building equity.\"Graham said that for all practical purposes, the loan would be more akin to an interest-only loan, because very few people would keep a home for 50 years. Homeowners could still gain equity through home price appreciation, but prices have been softening swiftly across the nation this year, with nowhere near the appreciation seen in the years previous.How it impacts affordabilityEven realtors agree that the savings to homeowners would be minimal.\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability. The administration would do better to reverse tariff-induced inflation, which is keeping the rates on existing mortgages high,\" wrote Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com in a release.Others note that this new mortgage product would likely depend on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remaining under government conservatorship. The Trump administration has said that the two will be taken private and then have an initial public offering sometime in the near future.\"Adoption of a 50-year mortgage product might complicate the path to privatization for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\" analysts at Evercore ISI wrote in a note to clients. \"That said, we understand that the Administration is expecting the GSEs to remain under conservatorship after it sells roughly a 5% stake to the public. This would allow the Administration to maintain control of the GSEs for the foreseeable future.\"Home affordability has been a major pressure point for the Trump administration. Historically low interest rates resulting from pandemic-driven economic policy caused an historic run on housing that catapulted home prices more than 50% higher in just five years. As a result, home sales have weakened dramatically, as has mortgage demand.The average age of a typical first-time buyer in 1991 was 28. By 2024, it had reached 38, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors, whose deputy chief economist called the number, \"shocking.\"The Trump administration has been pressuring builders to put up more homes in order to ease prices, claiming they are sitting on an oversupply of empty lots. Builders contest that claim and continue to cite high costs for land, labor and materials.On the company's latest earnings call, PulteGroup CEO Ryan Marshall said he agreed with the president's perspectives as it pertains to an undersupply of roughly 4 million homes for sale, but added, \"While this supply deficit certainly has an impact on affordability generally, the complexities of the new home construction industry dictate that tackling a problem of this scale requires a coordinated and comprehensive approach that brings together federal, state, and local leaders working in partnership with the new home construction industry.\"",

    "body": "Flight timings and cancellations are displayed on the departures board, a month into the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, U.S., November 9, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersFlight cancellations were again piling up on Monday as air traffic controller shortages, worsened by the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown, snarled air travel coast to coast while President Donald Trump threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they are absent from work.On Monday, 1,623 of the 25,735 scheduled U.S. flights were canceled, around 6.3% of the day's schedule, though on-time departures were better than average, a good sign after days of travel snarls, according to aviation data firm Cirium.Last week, the Trump administration ordered airlines to cut domestic flights at 40 major U.S. airports starting with 4% reductions last Friday and ramping up to 10% by this coming Friday, Nov. 14, citing strains on air traffic controllers.\"All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who didn't take any time off during the shutdown. He said those who don't immediately return to work would be \"docked.\"The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, their union, didn't immediately respond to Trump's comments on Monday.Disruptions over the weekend included 18,576 delayed flights while 4,519 were canceled, according to FlightAware. Cancellations spilled over from regional, short-haul jets — which the largest U.S. airlines rely on for around half of domestic flights — to mainline flying.United Airlines and Delta Air Lines were each offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up flights, according to company messages seen by CNBC. United was also offering pilots extra pay for more flights than it usually does, an airline spokesman said. Such extra pay is common during storms or other disruptions.American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said Monday that 250,000 of its customers were affected by disruptions over the weekend, with 1,400 cancellations attributed to air traffic control.\"This is simply unacceptable, and everyone deserves better. Our air traffic controllers deserve to be paid and our airline needs to be able to operate at a level of predictability and dependability that no major airline was able to provide the flying public this weekend,\" he said in a note to staff that was seen by CNBC.Airlines were waiving change fees and in some cases, fare differences, depending on when customers could rebook travel. Customers could also request a full refund for the portion of their tickets they were unable to fly.A sign of how severe air travel disruptions have become during the government shutdown: Sunday's 2,631 U.S. flight cancellations, 10% of the day's schedule, marked the fourth-worst day since January 2024, Cirium said.In comparison, on Friday morning, as Trump administration-mandated flight cuts took effect, cancellations ranked 72nd since the start of last year.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?American Airlines hires industry veteran to lead commercial team as profits trail rivalsThe disruptions that upended the travel plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers forced them to look for alternative transportation. Car rental company Hertz last week reported an increase in one-way demand. There's also been increased demand for private jet flights in recent days, according to the CEO of charter and fractional ownership company Flexjet.Though the Trump administration order didn't initially require private aviation to cut in the same way as commercial airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday began limiting those flights at a dozen U.S. airports. However, many private jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the National Business Aviation Association.Increased strainAir traffic controllers missed their second paycheck of the shutdown on Monday, though they are still required to work. Some of them have taken second jobs to make ends meet, government and union officials have said.A commercial airliner takes off past the air traffic control tower at San Diego International Airport during the first day of a partial U.S. government shutdown in San Diego, California, U.S., Oct. 1, 2025.     Mike Blake | Reuters\"Now, they must focus on child care instead of traffic flows. Food for their families instead of runway separation,\" Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a news conference on Monday. \"The added stress leads to fatigue, the fatigue has led to the erosion of safety and the increased risk every day that this shutdown drags on.\"The Senate made progress overnight on a deal that could end the shutdown, but it has not yet approved a funding bill.Daniels said it isn't yet clear how long it would take for controllers to receive back pay for their work. In the shutdown that ended in 2019, it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole, he said.Trump's comments about air traffic controllers on Monday drew criticism from Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, who called the statement \"nuts!\" and said it ran counter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's call for aviation workers' support.\"The women and men working long hours in air traffic control towers to keep the aviation system running deserve our thanks and appreciation, not unhinged attacks on their patriotism,\" Larsen said.This is breaking news.

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Department of Agriculture, in a memo late Saturday evening, threatened to enact financial penalties on states that issued full monthly SNAP benefits for November if they don't \"undo\" those food stamp payments.The late-night directive from the Trump administration adds to the chaos surrounding the anti-hunger program that serves more than 42 million Americans.The memo, signed by Patrick Penn, Deputy Under Secretary of the USDA's Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Services, warned states that the administration had not cleared full SNAP benefit payments for November.\"To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,\" the memo said.State program administrators were directed to distribute 65% partial payments of SNAP benefits for the month instead, the memo said.States must also \"immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025,\" the memo said. Failure to comply could result in the USDA cancelling the federal share of administration costs or holding states financially liable for \"any overissuances that result from the noncompliance.\"It was unclear how the USDA expects states to claw back any unauthorized SNAP payments.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., blasted the Trump administration's move.\"The cruelty is the point. It is their choice to do this,\" Klobuchar wrote in a post on the social media site X.The USDA and the White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe memo was first reported by The New York Times.It comes as some states scrambled to comply with a court ruling on Thursday, when a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to pay full SNAP benefits for November on Friday. The judge rejected the administration's plan to partially fund the food stamp program amid the U.S. government shutdown.The USDA subsequently told states that it would begin disbursing full SNAP benefits to comply with that order, even as the ruling faced an appeal from the Trump administration.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe Associated Press reported late Friday that more than half a dozen states had \"confirmed that some SNAP recipients already were issued full November payments on Friday.\"The administration asked the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals for an emergency injunction to block the order that it pay full food stamp benefits pending the outcome of its appeal of that order. A three-judge panel on the appeals court denied that request on Friday.But within hours, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily paused the order. Jackson directed the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the administration's motion to impose an indefinite stay on the lower court's order mandating full benefits.The Trump administration previously said that it would not use a contingency fund containing $4.65 billion to fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in November.U.S. District Court of Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell on Oct. 31 told the administration to use that fund to pay partial benefits, at least, and to explore other options to provide full benefits.The administration, days later, said it would pay 65% of the benefits, but ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds to make up the difference.The total cost of full SNAP benefits for the month is around $8 billion.The program, like other federal programs, has no currently appropriated money, as a result of Congress failing to pass a spending bill. That failure led to the U.S. government shutdown on Oct. 1. Hopes that the shutdown may be nearing an end were buoyed Sunday evening after Senate lawmakers took a critical step towards a potential deal to reopen the government, but there are no guarantees lawmakers will come to an agreement anytime soon.Past administrations have continued paying SNAP benefits during prior shutdowns.",

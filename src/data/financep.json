    "body": "Gia Huynh is the founder of crystal candy company Silky Gem.Courtesy of Gia HuynhWhen Gia Huynh immigrated to the United States from Vietnam in 2016, like many other immigrants, life for her wasn't easy. For years, she worked 14-hour days at nail salons to stay afloat.At the time, she was in her 20s with just $50 in her pockets, Huynh told CNBC Make It. \"I was working at a nail salon pretty much seven days a week, from morning to night, 14 hours a day,\" she said. At one point, Huynh found herself homeless, living out of her car as a single mother with a 5-week old son. \"I was facing homelessness, and with a baby in my arm. I had nothing,\" she said.Today, she is the founder of Silky Gem, an online candy company known for their handmade crystal-like confections, also known as 'kohakutou' in Japan or 'mứt rau câu' in Vietnam. Her business brought in over $9 million in 2024, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Scars from childhood Huynh was born in Dong Nai, Vietnam, and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City. She says she was the youngest of four siblings and grew up in a poor family.\"My dad used to just go in the jungle to chop bamboo and wood and things like that to sell. He's never home, really. He's always working. And my mom just, you know, worked [however] she [could] to put food on the table,\" she said.As a kid, Huynh's parents always had to work so they would often leave her in the care of their neighbor, who she called \"uncle\" at the time. \"It was a rough childhood,\" said Huynh. \"I [became a] domestic and sexual harassment victim [at age] four ... That was my first childhood memories, basically. It was under the man I call uncle.\"Gia Huynh (left) was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the U.S. in 2016.Courtesy of Gia HuynhIn school, she was often made fun of for her skin color and she didn't finish fifth grade. \"I was always got bullied, [people] called me names, just because I had darker skin, basically,\" said Huynh. \"Because I didn't graduate fifth grade, family and friends [would] always belittle me.\" This environment created mental scars for Huynh. She says she felt very underestimated and this manifested in her being very quiet and never speaking her mind. It wasn't until recent years that she's learned her own worth, she said.Homeless as a single motherIn 2016, Huynh immigrated to the U.S. with her husband and lived in Florida. She says that the first few years in the U.S. were extremely difficult and in some ways, life was easier back in Vietnam.\"In Vietnam ... even if I make a little money, it's still plenty for us to take care of our lives there. But [when] we moved [to Florida], it was a lot of struggle, because I was the main [source of] income for the family, and we were living out of my mother in law's house,\" she said.After about a year in the U.S. together, in 2017, Huynh and her ex-husband separated, largely due to financial struggles and conflict, she said. After that, she met her ex-boyfriend and had her first son.\"I had my son in 2019 with my ex-boyfriend and that was a very abusive relationship,\" said Huynh. \"I ended up losing everything on that relationship. I lost my job, I maxed out all [my] credit cards. I took my son out of [my ex-boyfriend's] house when he was only five weeks old and lived out of my car.\" After a few weeks of living out of her car with her newborn baby, Huynh decided to move to Maryland and got a job working at her sister's nail salon. However, since it was Covid, Huynh says she was barely making enough to get by and she had to be separated from her son for ten or more hours a day.She was determined to create a better life for her family and son, so she began to experiment with online business ideas. Starting Silky GemOn top of taking care of her son and working at the nail salon during the day, Huynh would experiment with her business ideas after she got home from work. From selling handmade soaps to bikinis, she says she tried out about six other online business ideas before landing on the idea of Silky Gem.In late 2021, Huynh was scrolling on social media when she saw a few videos showing creators eating crystal candy. Silky Gem brought in over $9 million in 2024.Courtesy of Gia Huynh\"I recognized the candy because we used to make it back home with my great grandma,\" said Huynh, adding that it was something they had during special occasions like Lunar New Year. \"I asked my mom, and she said ... we had the recipe for it. So that's when I started practicing.\"She was inspired to recreate the candy she loved as a child in Vietnam, and ultimately spent $500 on ingredients to start experimenting with the recipe in her own kitchen. \"After I come back from the nail salon, I play with my son, put him to bed and pretty much [make candy] from midnight to three, four in the morning,\" she said, adding that she'd then wake up at 6 a.m. to go to work the next day. By early 2022, she started selling her candy creations on Etsy and quickly began to make money.\"The first three months was hardest ... we were making like I would say, $600 to $1,000 a month, [but] I was so happy. That's enough for my son's diaper and milk,\" she said. In March that year, she landed her first influencer post, which went viral and brought in $3,000 that day. From there, sales grew quickly, said Huynh. In the first nine months in business, Silky Gem brought in over $1.8 million, she added. Founder of Silky Gem, Gia Huynh with her son.Courtesy of Gia HuynhToday, Huynh has been able to hire both of her parents, and they all help to run the business together. \"It has just been amazing ... It really changed what I view about myself,\" she said. \"My whole life, I believed that I'm worthless, useless. I don't have the skills, I don't have the education for any of this.\"One of the biggest lessons she's learned is that: \"You are your own enemy. You are the reason that you would fail in life,\" she said.\"I was blaming all the people about my confidence, my education and everything else. I was playing the victim card for my whole entire life,\" she said. \"But that's not true. You can do it if you put your mind [to it]. I didn't go to language school. I didn't graduate fifth grade, but because I put my mind to this, I make it work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

Kennedy Jr. attend a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission event, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 22, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Tuesday said it was freezing $10 billion in federal grant funds for certain child care and family assistance programs in five states because of \"serious concerns about widespread fraud\" in state-administered programs.All five states targeted by the freeze — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York — are led by Democrats.The action applies to three programs overseen by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Children and Families: Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Social Services Block Grant.The move comes a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dropped his bid for a third term amid political fallout from widespread fraud in social service programs in the state, including child-care services, which a federal prosecutor has estimated cost more than $9 billion.\"Families who rely on child care and family assistance programs deserve confidence that these resources are used lawfully and for their intended purpose,\" said Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O'Neill in a statement.\"This action reflects our commitment to program integrity, fiscal responsibility, and compliance with federal requirements,\" O'Neill said.More than $7.3 billion in TANF funds have been frozen, and nearly $2.4 billion in CCDF funds have been frozen. Nearly $840 million in Social Services Block Grant funding was frozen.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker blasted President Donald Trump for the freeze.\"Rather than making it more affordable for families, Trump is stripping away child care from those just trying to go to work,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on X. \"Thousands depend on these programs, and now their livelihoods are at risk,\" Pritzker wrote. \"It's wrong and cruel — we'll take every step possible to defend Illinoisians.\"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, in a tweet, wrote, \"Trump is threatening to freeze $10 billion in child care funding in blue states to make life harder and more expensive for kids and families. It's vindictive. It's cruel. And we'll fight it with every fiber of our being.\"HHS on Monday announced that it was rescinding a series of child-care rules implemented under the Biden administration \"that required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.\"\"The change will roll back provisions in the 2024 Child Care and Development Fund rule that weakened oversight and increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse in federally-funded state child care — including programs now under investigation in Minnesota,\" HHS said in a statement on Monday.The department last week froze all federal child care funding for Minnesota, which totals about $185 million annually.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 6, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday said that the company is seeing \"very high\" customer demand in China for its H200 AI chips, which the U.S. government recently signaled that it would approve for export. Huang added that Nvidia has started producing the chips again and is working out the final details about export licenses with the U.S. government. Nvidia's chips are critical for companies developing artificial intelligence models. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas. Investors see the Chinese market as a massive opportunity for Nvidia as the country's tech companies develop their own AI models. Huang has previously said that the market could be worth $50 billion per year, and none of those sales are currently included in Nvidia's forecasts.In December, President Donald Trump said that Nvidia could export its H200 chip to China as long as the company paid 25% of those sales to the U.S. government. The H200 is a generation or two behind the latest Nvidia models, but unlike previous chips that Nvidia was approved to export to China, this model has not been slowed down on purpose to comply with export restrictions.China must also approve the import of Nvidia's chips. Huang on Tuesday said that he is not expecting China to make an announcement that imports have been approved and that Nvidia would know the regulatory status as purchase orders come in. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Huang added that any H200 sales would be in addition to the $500 billion two-year forecast the company provided last year. \"It appears that we're going to be going back to China,\" Huang said.WATCH: Nvidia is clearly the chips leader in AI trade, says Silvant Capital's Sansoterrawatch now",

Xny/star Max | Gc Images | Getty ImagesSeven U.S. service members were injured during Saturday's U.S. military operation in Venezuela that captured Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a Pentagon official told MS Now on Wednesday.Two of the seven are still recovering, while five have recovered from their injuries sustained in the operation dubbed \"Absolute Resolve.\"\"The fact that this extremely complex and grueling mission was successfully executed with so few injuries is a testament to the expertise of our joint warriors,\" the official said.The official said an assessment of casualties on the ground was still ongoing and is being led by the U.S. intelligence community.Venezuelan officials previously told MS Now that more than 70 people were killed in the raid. Special operations forces from multiple service branches and more than 150 military aircraft were involved in the capture of Maduro.U.S. President Donald Trump said the military action was conducted in coordination with American law enforcement authorities, according to a post on Truth Social on Saturday.Cuba said on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed during the operation, adding that those individuals were carrying out missions for Cuba's armed forces and interior ministry. The statement was posted by Cuba's presidential office on Facebook.The U.S. strikes followed weeks of military buildup in the region and repeated threats by Trump against Maduro.The deposed leader appeared in a New York court on Monday, where he said he had been \"kidnapped\" with his wife by U.S. forces from his home in Caracas and described himself as a \"prisoner of war.\" He pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.— CNBC's Lim Hui Jie and MS Now's Julia Jester contributed to this report.watch now",

    "body": "An oil refinery, operated by Bharat Petroleum Corp., in Mumbai, India.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesState-owned refiners in India are still buying Russian oil, even as New Delhi seeks relief from U.S. tariffs imposed for those purchases, according to energy analysts.The U.S. imposed a \"secondary\" 25% tariff on Indian goods in August, citing New Delhi's continued imports of Russian crude. Washington also sanctioned Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft in late November. On Sunday, U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham claimed that India's U.S. ambassador, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, had asked him to urge President Donald Trump to lift these tariffs, arguing that New Delhi has reduced its purchase of Russian oil.While India's overall demand for Russian crude fell in December, analysts said the decline was largely driven by reduced buying from Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries, which had been a major importer before the U.S. sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft took effect in late November.State-owned refiners, known as public sector undertakings (PSUs), have offset part of that drop for Russian oil, analysts added. State-owned Indian firms like the IOC (Indian Oil Corporation) and BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corporation) \"have continued to buy Russian crude for future delivery, through non-sanctioned suppliers,\" said Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at tanker tracker firm Kpler.BPCL declined to comment, while IOC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, as well as the Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC.India has faced sustained pressure from the U.S. to cut back on Russian oil imports, an economic lifeline that enables Moscow to withstand Western economic sanctions over its war against Ukraine.\"Despite declining aggregate imports, PSU refinery intake of Russian crude has remained resilient, highlighting a redistribution rather than a collapse in demand,\" said Rystad Energy's Pankaj Srivastava.Rystad estimates India's Russian crude imports fell by about 300,000 barrels a day since November to 1.7 million barrels on a sequential basis.However, a \"modest recovery\" to 1.8 million barrels a day is expected in January, it said.\"Public sector refiners continue to process Russian crude with a slight upward trend, driven by domestic fuel demand and pricing economics,\" said Srivastava, the senior vice president of commodity markets at Rystad Energy.Kpler's data also showed a decline in India's import of Russian oil.\"India's imports of Russian crude fell by 595 kbpd month-on-month in December, dropping to 1.24 mbpd—the lowest level since December 2022,\" according to Kpler.On Sunday, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said the United States could raise tariffs on India if New Delhi fails to curb purchases of Russian oil.",

    "body": "Signage for Bitcoin cryptocurrency in Hong Kong, Nov. 26, 2025.Lam Yik | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFollowing President Nicolás Maduro's deposition last weekend, all eyes are on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves. But there's another resource Maduro's regime is believed to have had in abundance — an asset that, if liquidated or seized, would have implications for global financial markets: bitcoin.Venezuela is likely sitting on sizable amounts of the cryptocurrency — a stash that could be worth billions of U.S. dollars, experts told CNBC. \"It's very fair to assume Venezuela had meaningful exposure to bitcoin,\" said Gui Gomes, founder and CEO of Latin America-based bitcoin firm OranjeBTC. \"Given that they were excluded from the global financial system, probably they had gold, bitcoin and some dollars under their mattress.\"Sanctions levied against Venezuela restricted the nation's access to financial markets. To work around this, the country likely experimented with cryptocurrencies, experts said. They noted that it's virtually impossible to ascertain the exact amount of bitcoin Venezuela may be sitting on, or where those holdings could be stored, due to the privacy features of the decentralized asset and its underlying technology. However, one thing is clear: If Maduro and his allies have tokens in their coffers, the assets might soon be on the move, they said. And whether those bitcoins are sold, confiscated or exchanged, cryptocurrency holders could feel the impact. Billions in bitcoin? Digital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold roughly $60 billion, citing unnamed sources that were not confirmed through blockchain analysis. Such a stash would put the regime among the biggest holders of the crypto in the world, alongside bitcoin treasury firm Strategy. Data provider Bitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela's holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth roughly $22 million. To reach this estimate they used data from a blockchain analytics firm that was cited by a media outlet.  Based on their rankings, it would the ninth largest pile of bitcoin held by a government entity.  All these estimates must be taken with a grain of salt. Many of the largest firms offering crypto custodial solutions, including digital asset bank Anchorage Digital and Fireblocks, are registered in the U.S. or allied nations, so Venezuela would have had to turn to more covert techniques to amass its shadow reserve, Haun Ventures general partner Diogo Mónica told CNBC. \"There are so many [solutions] for bitcoin off the shelf, it is actually very easy for you to meet the threshold of high security\" through those means, Mónica said. As a result, any bitcoin held by Venezuela is likely distributed across thousands of crypto wallets under the control of various generals and other members of Maduro's party, making it difficult to identify and track, according to OranjeBTC's Gomes.On-chain analysis can reveal transaction histories and balances of public addresses linked to hardware wallets, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. But those methods cannot offer conclusive insights into wallet owners' identities, making it difficult for cybercrime experts to identify which wallets belong to Venezuelan officials.That said, it's still probable that Venezuela could have amassed large amounts of bitcoin in recent years to navigate the consequences of its exclusion from global financial markets, Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, told CNBC. He noted that the country has a history of using unorthodox methods to convert and transfer its wealth, including by flying allies of Maduro to foreign locales to exchange tangible assets for more liquid funds.\"If they're willing to send a guy on a private jet with a ton of gold on board, it would make a lot of sense that they would also seek to utilize crypto assets for both store of wealth and also for cross-border trade,\" Fierman said. He declined to estimate the value of Venezuela's holdings.  The South American nation also has a long history of experimenting with cryptocurrencies, Fierman said. He cited the issuance in 2018 of a token called petro, which later failed and was sunsetted in 2024, as an example. Given its history with digital assets, it's also possible the Venezuelan government holds other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, including stablecoins, according to Fierman.However, bitcoin would likely be the favored asset as it is issued by an agnostic network and has no direct ties to the U.S. dollar, unlike most stablecoins, said Jorge Jraissati, president of the nonprofit Economic Inclusion Group. He added that some of the regime's bitcoins could have been acquired through local authorities' seizures of crypto miners' token rewards. In 2017, CNBC reported on Venezuelan authorities' efforts to curb crypto mining by arresting bitcoin miners and seizing their assets. That was before the nation completely outlawed the practice in 2024, citing energy concerns. Data from Hashrate index shows that Venezuela still accounted for about 0.6% of all hash rates, a measure of power used to mine tokens on the bitcoin blockchain as of 2025. What happens next?Assuming Venezuela holds bitcoin, speculation abounds on what happens next. One possibility is that the Maduro regime's holdings will go up for sale, according to Sebastian Pedro Bea, president and chief investment officer at ReserveOne.\"Anytime you have a chaotic regime change, the assets of that country become unstable, like people can just steal stuff,\" Bea said. \"I'm not suggesting that's likely, but it is more likely today than last week that, if they have bitcoin, some of that bitcoin could end up on exchange, or could end up being sold.\"That sell-off could dent bitcoin's price in the near term. Alternatively, the U.S. could seize Venezuela's bitcoin as part of its enforcement actions, according to Bea. \"Nothing is stopping the U.S. from doing more enforcement actions that go after bad actors [in Venezuela] who could happen to have a lot of bitcoin,\" Bea said. \"And when they do that, that bitcoin can go right to Treasury.\"Some cryptocurrency holders have speculated the Trump administration could confiscate some of Maduro and his allies' bitcoin, with the aim of creating a U.S. bitcoin reserve at no cost to taxpayers.U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve at no cost to taxpayers — a central tenet of his pro-crypto policy plans. However, critics and proponents alike have questioned the logistics of the proposal, including how bitcoin could be accumulated in a tax-neutral way.Chris Perkins, managing partner and president of investment firm CoinFund, said it's unclear whether the U.S. could legally use Venezuela's bitcoin to create its planned strategic reserve. However, such a scenario would ultimately be bullish for the asset, according to the executive. \"... To the extent that the Trump administration comes into possession of a significant amount of bitcoin, don't expect them to dump it into the market,\" said Perkins, who served as a U.S. marine. Whatever happens next, the U.S.' recent actions in Venezuela underscore the Trump administration's ability and willingness to wield its power to advance its policy objectives, which include promoting and advancing the digital assets industry, according to Bea. \"Crypto seems to be an unintended beneficiary, long term, of the [U.S. military intervention in Venezuela],\" Bea said.

    "body": "Sermitsiaq Mountain looms behind a row of houses in Nuuk, Greenland, on March 4, 2025.   Odd Andersen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump is fixated on taking control of Greenland, a vast, sparsely populated and mineral-rich island situated between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic Ocean. \"It's so strategic,\" Trump told reporters on board Air Force One on Sunday. \"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place. We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.\" His comments, which came hot on the heels of an audacious military operation in Venezuela, sounded the alarm across Europe, with Denmark warning that an American takeover of Greenland would mark the end of the NATO military alliance.The U.S. president, however, is yet to waver. Indeed, the White House ramped up transatlantic tensions even further on Tuesday, saying that Trump and his team are considering \"a range of options\" to make the self-governing Danish territory a part of the United States — including \"utilizing the U.S. Military.\" Positioned between the U.S. and Russia, Greenland has long been viewed as an area of high strategic importance, particularly when it comes to Arctic security.  The territory of nearly 57,000 people is in close proximity to emerging Arctic shipping routes, with the rapid melting of ice creating opportunities to substantially reduce Asia-Europe travel time when compared to the Suez Canal.Greenland also sits astride the so-called GIUK gap, a naval choke point between Greenland, Iceland and the U.K. that links the Arctic to the Atlantic Ocean. Alongside its strategic geopolitical position, Greenland is known for an abundance of untapped raw materials, from oil and gas reserves to critical mineral deposits and a treasure trove of rare earth elements. AFP | Getty ImagesThese critical minerals and rare earth elements are vital components in emerging technologies, such as wind turbines, electric vehicles, energy storage technologies, and national security applications. China repeatedly sought to leverage its near monopoly of rare earths to exert pressure on the U.S. last year.\"Trump is a real estate guy,\" Clayton Allen, head of practice at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy, told CNBC by video call.\"Greenland is sitting on some of the most valuable real estate in terms of economic advantage and strategic defense for the next three to five decades.\" Shipping routes To be sure, the U.S. already has a presence in Greenland. The Pituffik Space Base, formerly Thule Air Base, is located in the northwest of Greenland, just across the Baffin Bay from Nunavut, Canada.It is estimated that around 150 U.S. service members are permanently stationed there, down from around 6,000 during the Cold War era.watch now\"For good reasons, the U.S. has an early warning air base in northwestern Greenland because the shortest route for a Russian ballistic missile to reach the continental United States is via Greenland and the North Pole,\" said Otto Svendsen, associate fellow with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a Washington-based think tank. The base, which also has an active airfield and is home to the world's northernmost deep-water port, has traditionally been pivotal to the monitoring of Russian submarines traversing the GIUK gap, Svendsen said. \"A more recent and emerging threat or factor is the fact that Greenland straddles two potential shipping routes through the Arctic, the Northwest Passage and the Transpolar Sea Route,\" Svendsen told CNBC by telephone. \"And as climate change continues to render those routes more viable, there are commercial interests there as well that add to the national security value of the island,\" he added.A fishing boat navigates around icebergs that broke off from the Jakobshavn Glacier and are floating in Disko Bay on March 10, 2025, in Ilulissat, Greenland.Joe Raedle | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesOpinion polls have previously shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark. 'Golden Dome' Analysts say that Greenland could prove useful to the U.S. as a staging ground for a greater defensive presence and as a location for U.S. missile interceptors — particularly in the context of one of the Trump administration's key policies: a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.The multibillion-dollar initiative, rolled out in May last year and often compared to Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system, is a visionary plan designed to shield the U.S. from all missile attacks. Read more\"The U.S. needs access to the Arctic and it doesn't really have that much direct access today. Greenland has a tremendous amount. The U.S. needs air defenses deployed closer and closer to Russia to combat next generation weapons that are not currently defensible with what we have available. Greenland provides that,\" Eurasia Group's Allen said. \"Trump wants to build a 'Golden Dome' over the U.S.,\" he continued. \"Part of that is going to have to depend on Greenland.\" National or economic security? For some, Trump's assertion that annexing Greenland is a core part of U.S. national security has raised eyebrows. The declaration marks a notable shift in tone from almost a year ago, when the then president-elect cited \"economic security\" as a primary factor for annexing the island. Marion Messmer, director of the International Security Programme at London's Chatham House think tank, acknowledged that it is true to say that both Russia and China have increased their military activities in the Arctic in recent years — and, if Moscow launched missiles at the U.S., they would likely fly over Greenland.  \"However, what is not clear is why Washington needs full control over Greenland to defend itself,\" Messmer said in a written analysis published Tuesday. watch nowShe cited the fact that the U.S. already has a presence at Pituffik Space Base, as well as a decades-old defense agreement with Denmark that allows Washington to continue to use it. \"During the Cold War, the US stationed up to 6,000 troops across a range of camps across the island,\" Messmer said. \"It could presumably surge troop presence again if it felt it needed a greater presence in the region – without disputing Danish sovereignty.\"",

    "body": "Two employees in pharmaceutical industry wearing protective gloves, mask, cap and white suit seen standing by the machine that is the part of the medicaments production during the working hours in a pharmaceutical manufacturing.Extreme-photographer | E+ | Getty ImagesA multitude of factors are coming together to bring a big burst in biotech M&A.The high-profile bidding war between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over Metsera and its leading weight loss drug candidate shows just how competitive some pockets of the sector have become, as Big Pharma frantically works to fill the looming revenue hole.Some of the best-selling drugs in the world are facing a loss of exclusivity in key jurisdictions in what the sector calls \"the patent cliff.\" By 2032, losses of exclusivity for best-selling brands are worth at least $173.9 billion in annual sales, according to CNBC calculations. Estimates vary on the total amount of revenue at risk when factoring in smaller brands, with some analysts putting the number between $200 billion and $350 billion.That poses a real threat to their makers' top lines — unless they manage to replenish their pipelines with new, revenue-bearing innovations.The need for pharma to top up their pipelines coincides with the broader biotech sector coming back to life after years of depressed valuations following a boom in healthcare investing during the Covid-19 pandemic.M&A in the sector picked up dramatically in September and October 2025, following a terrible start to the year. The lifting of overhangs from Trump's war on high drug prices for Americans and threats of triple-digit pharma sector tariffs, as well as the beginning of an interest-rate cutting cycle, has further encouraged dealmaking.Now, companies are facing a situation where they need to fill their pipelines, while also navigating a competitive environment for the best assets.Filling the revenue holeThe biopharma sector is unique in that companies face a loss of patent for lead assets every decade or so. That lifecycle of assets requires companies to constantly come up with new innovations – or buy those who do.\"Biotech, being the innovation kind of engine of healthcare, is where pharmaceutical companies have come historically to build their biopharma businesses,\" Linden Thomson, senior portfolio manager at Candriam, told CNBC.Pharmaceutical firms, many of which started as chemical companies, typically built their businesses on simpler, small molecule drugs, while biotechs use living organisms to make medicines like antibodies and mRNA. Over time, the distinction between the two has blurred as pharma invested heavily in biotech and many of the drugs on the market today were instead discovered by biotech companies or involved with biotech manufacturing, Thomson said.The looming patent cliff, which includes the loss of exclusivity on Bristol Myers Squibb's Eliquis, Merck's Keytruda, and Novo Nordisk's Ozempic, is a driving force behind M&A and a key part of many large-cap pharma companies' business strategy.watch nowAccording to analysis by healthcare market researcher and consultant Joanna Sadowska, about half of the blockbuster drugs approved between 2014 and 2023 were bought, as opposed to being developed internally. The two most successful drugmakers in terms of the number of blockbusters approved over those years were Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca, which acquired eight and five medicines out of a total of 13, respectively.European heavyweights GSK and Novartis are among those clear about the need to add to their pipelines through deals. Both are looking for what they call \"bolt-on deals\" that fit in with their key therapeutic and technology areas.During an investor event in London in November, Novartis CEO Vasant Narasimhan emphasized the company's strong cash generation \"that really allows us to invest in the business.\"While Novartis doesn't put a size on these bolt-on deals, having done deals of up to $12 billion, GSK is more specific.Chris Sheldon, global head of business development at GSK, calls it the \"sweet spot\": going after validated biology, often in mid-stage development in the $1 billion to $2 billion range, where the outcome of a drug candidate isn't yet obvious. Many acquisitions of late-stage assets end up becoming a maths problem, Sheldon told CNBC, particularly if it's a listed company that has reached fair value.\"BD [Business development] I always describe as a contact sport. If an asset is good enough, there's multiple suitors,\" he added.Deals can range from partnerships and licensing and royalties agreements to clear-cut buyouts.\"We would do licensing every day of the week versus M&A if we could, because you can manage risk and reward the partner as value is unlocked and risk is discharged,\" Sheldon said.However, an acquisition with a big price tag paid up front may at times be the only option, and it can have some attractive benefits, such as taking total control of the development plans and acquiring talent as well as the molecules. \"The reality is actually the seller often dictates that, a lot of people don't realize that,\" Sheldon said.A competitive environmentAs biotech M&A became hot again, November saw arguably the sector's most dramatic event of the year take place: the public bidding war between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk over clinical-stage weight loss drug maker Metsera, ultimately won by Pfizer in a deal worth up to $10 billion.It's rare for bidding to take place in the public eye, said Stefan Loren, managing director at Oppenheimer. \"It's a very public thing to chase a company, and so you have to worry about the reputational damage: A, if you lose; B: if you get too exuberant and go to buy,\" he told CNBC.\"That definitely says something about the biotech market and companies wanting to play catch-up,\" Loren added. \"They are responding to what their situation is, their situation is that they're about to have a lot of things come off patent.\"[Business development] I always describe as a contact sport. If an asset is good enough, there's multiple suitors.Chris SheldonGlobal head of business development at GSKTypically, pharma shopping sprees tend to last up to a year and a half before pulling back, Loren added.The GLP-1 market for weight loss drugs has become one of the most competitive segments in global pharma as major players race to secure next-generation assets through both internal development and acquisitions, noted PitchBook researchers in their 2026 Healthcare outlook published early December. More than 120 metabolic assets are currently in development across 60 companies, creating a deep pool of potential M&A targets, they added.\"The high-profile battle between Pfizer and Novo Nordisk for Metsera underscores the escalating strategic urgency in this space,\" they said. \"We expect competition to intensify as differentiation windows narrow and policy tailwinds expand reimbursement and regulatory support.\"While the obesity space lends itself well to illustrate current competitive dynamics, the biotech boom isn't confined to one single therapeutic area. Neurology, oncology, immunology, and inflammation are other key areas of activity.\"It's idiosyncratic what's popular at any given point,\" said Loren. \"They [companies] are going for what can fill the pipelines as quickly as possible.\"A boom, dip and another boomDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, biotech sailed to the top of investors' wishlists. Amid increased attention, investors' optimism, and low interest rates, the sector flourished, valuations skyrocketed, and many biotech companies went public or were bought by larger peers.As the biopharma industry is a cost-intensive research business, raising money is critical for drug discovery. Early-stage biotechs operate with high stakes, often making them early casualties of a risk-off market like the one following the pandemic boom.Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration also clouded the outlook for biopharma with threats of high sector tariffs, cuts to federal health agencies, and lower drug prices. But as companies have made deals with Trump on pricing and the president has made clear that if they invest in U.S. manufacturing, they would be exempt from additional tariffs — two big overhangs for the sector have cleared.A flurry of good data readouts has also boosted biotech valuations, said Loren. Only a year ago, even good data sent stocks down, he said. \"People were using everything as an event just to get out.\"By late spring, the market started to shift and now, investors take good data and run with it. \"There's a point at which these things get so low that at the end of the day, what's the risk?\" Loren said. \"And now, when we saw the acceleration of M&A, the good news is that that play became very real.\"More deals in 2026In 2026, deals could pick up even further, analysts say.\"We see 2026 as providing one of the best investing opportunities we have seen in decades,\" the PitchBook analysts said, driven by the clearing of U.S. healthcare policy overhangs and additional rate cuts spurring more speculative investing postures.Rajesh Kumar, head of European life sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, similarly expects a \"big ramp up of deal flows\" in the year ahead now that the noise around drug pricing has settled.\"The market's margin expectations beyond [2026] might be a bit more optimistic than it should be, but nonetheless, the companies are deploying capital in the U.S., manufacturing is happening, clarity is there, and that is a great environment for actually doing biotech deals and early stage biotech funding,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowOther developments in the pharma sector could make for another year of significant headwinds – potentially adding to the urgency for drugmakers to make deals.Prices for certain bestselling drugs will start to come down under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act in 2026, which appears to treat the active ingredient of drugs by the same manufacturer as the same, limiting life cycle management options in some cases, HSBC analysts said. Biosimilars in the U.S. might also become easier to launch if a recent Food and Drug Administration draft guidance is implemented. \"All these factors might mean that the fade beyond the patent cliffs, especially for biologics, might be more aggressive than in the past,\" the analysts said.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersElon Musk's xAI said it raised $20 billion in a funding round, exceeding its prior target of $15 billion. CNBC reported in November that a financing would value the artificial intelligence startup at about $230 billion. After an initial report that xAI was raising $15 billion, Musk called the story \"False\" in a post on X.Investors included Nvidia and Cisco Investments as well as long-time Musk company backers Valor Equity Partners, Stepstone Group, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi's MGX and Baron Capital Group. Both Nvidia and Cisco work with xAI as vendors and strategic partners.AI startups reached sky-high valuations in 2025, raising massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for their foundational models. In October, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation, and a month later Anthropic was valued at around $350 billion, with capital coming from Microsoft and Nvidia. Musk's AI venture now owns and operates his social network X after merging with the company, formerly known as Twitter, in March. The company faces a new flurry of regulatory probes by authorities in Europe, India and Malaysia after its Grok chatbot generated sexualized images of children and non-consensual intimate images of adults, mostly women. Users shared the images widely on X.Musk is centering xAI's infrastructure buildout in Memphis, Tennessee. The data centers, which use natural gas-burning turbines as a power source, have drawn consternation from many nearby residents, as emissions have contributed to air quality problems in the area, according to local researchers.Despite its controversies, xAI landed a deal with the Department of Defense, which recently added Grok to its AI agents platform. Grok is also the main chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi.WATCH: xAI raises $20 billion watch now",

    "body": "A Samsung Electronics Co. CXL memory module displayed on a monitor during the Semiconductor Exhibition (SEDEX) in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024.SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 16.3% higher this year. Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.\"The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.\"We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models.\"This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMicron and ASML stocks have rallied this year so far. The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.Intel shares are up 7.6%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise 15.2% this year. Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. \"ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027,\" with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit \"from the upcoming DRAM super cycle.\"Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. \"Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure,\" Barringer said.\"That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand.\"",

The amped-up bets come as Wall Street and Main Street note the Trump administration's shift toward quick and forceful international strikes.\"The big takeaway for investors is Trump is growing much more comfortable with, and confident in, the use of military force,\" Piper Sandler analyst Andy Laperriere wrote to clients on Monday. \"His first year in his second term was characterized by boundless energy and risk-taking, and that has been extended to the use of the military.\"Odds that Trump will \"take back the Panama Canal\" before early 2029 jumped above 35% on the Kalshi prediction market, from less than 30% late last week. Trump said last year that he wouldn't rule out using military force to gain control of the maritime route linking the Pacific to the Atlantic.The likelihood that the U.S. will \"take control of any part of Greenland\" rose to 38% midday Tuesday — an increase of roughly 8 percentage points since the middle of last week. At one point over the weekend, the odds shot above 46%.A larger market, based on the dollar amount of wagering, that Trump will \"buy at least part\" of the Danish territory, hovered near 25% odds, up from less than 20% seen late last week.Combined betting on both questions on Kalshi amounts to close to $2.5 million.Painted houses and residential apartment blocks overlooking the fjord in Nuuk, Greenland, Nov. 3, 2025.Juliette Pavy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLeaders in Greenland have repeatedly rejected Trump's comments that the U.S. aims for a takeover.

The chance of this happening, part of nearly a $1 million market, now trades at around 54%.Trump authorized bombings on Iran last year, bringing the U.S. into the conflict between the Islamic republic and Israel. Last week, Trump threatened to \"knock the hell\" out of Iran if it sought to rebuild its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down,\" Trump said. \"We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening.\"watch now",

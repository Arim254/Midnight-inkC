    "body": "I spend my days focused on the organ that defines us: the human brain. As a neurologist, I diagnose everything from chronic headaches to complex neurodegenerative diseases. But some of the most important work I do to protect the brain happens in my family's kitchen as my wife and I raise our kids.Infancy through early childhood is a critical window of neuroplasticity and growth, and what we feed our children can directly impact their brain health in the long run.The best foods for the brain are universal: fruits, vegetables, and high-fiber options. My philosophy isn't restrictive, and my kids eat the same varied diet as most of their friends. Still, I was firm on three key rules, especially during infancy.1. No honey before they're 12 months oldHoney can be deadly to an infant, if rarely. This is because honey contains spores of the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, even in small amounts and in cooked items. Infants' gastrointestinal tracts aren't mature or diverse enough to outcompete these spores, allowing them to germinate and grow into active bacteria that produce botulinum neurotoxin. This can cause infant botulism, a rare but extremely serious form of food poisoning.The toxin attacks the nervous system, leading to muscle weakness. Babies can present with a weak cry, poor sucking reflex, and decreased muscle tone. In severe cases, it can cause paralysis of the breathing muscles and can lead to respiratory failure and even death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics stress that infants \"should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked honey.\"2. Expose them early to common allergensFor years, parents in many parts of the world were advised to delay exposing their kids to common allergens like peanuts and eggs. We now know that this advice was wrong. Delaying introduction can actually increase their risk of developing a severe food allergy.Guidance to parents evolved after a landmark study showed that introducing peanuts early and maintaining their consumption significantly reduced the risk of peanut allergy in high-risk infants by up to 86%. Additional research has supported the early introduction of other common allergens, such as cooked egg, and showed this helped protect against allergy development.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at workChanges in behavior or mood, such as irritability or hyperactivity, are sometimes observed in children with food allergies. These effects may be due to discomfort and pain from systemic immune responses rather than direct neurological injury, but they can influence neurological and behavioral outcomes.Once my children were ready for solids — that's usually around four to six months, depending on their risk factors — my wife and I introduced age-appropriate forms of highly allergenic foods like peanuts and cooked egg. We kept them in regular rotation after that to build a healthy immune system and brain.3. No sweetened drinks in infancyI avoid all forms of liquid calories and non-nutritive sweeteners — which add flavor but little to no nutritional value — in my kids under the age of 1. This means no juice, no sugar-sweetened beverages (like soda, fruit drinks, and sweetened waters), and no artificially sweetened beverages (like diet soda). Excess sugar can cause metabolic stress and can trigger reward pathways similar to addictive substances. And it has been linked to impaired learning and memory. Even small amounts of sugary drinks in infancy are also associated with increased risk of obesity later in childhood. Moreover, early exposure to sweet flavors can reinforce lifelong preferences for sweet foods, potentially influencing emotional regulation and behavior for years to come.Fruit juices may seem healthy, but they're a poor substitute for actual fruit. No matter how natural or organic they are, they strip away beneficial fiber that slows sugar absorption. They provide kids with too many calories, don't leave them feeling full, and can displace nutrient-rich foods, all of which can contribute to poor diet patterns.Artificial sweeteners lack long-term safety data in children, especially infants. Though more research is needed, there are concerns that they may alter gut microbiota, disrupt blood sugar regulation, and affect sweet taste perception. Artificially sweetened beverages may also make children feel full and skip nutrient-rich foods.Before my kids turned 1, breast milk was their primary source of nutrition. We introduced water in small amounts with complementary foods after about six months. And since then, they've been drinking mostly water and milk. But while we keep sweetened drinks to a minimum, my wife and I believe it's more important to teach our kids how to make good choices than to enforce strict restrictions as they get older.As always, you should consult with a health care professional about your kids' diet. Baibing Chen is a double-boarded certified neurologist and epileptologist practicing at Henry Ford Health.

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, arrives to speak during a site expansion groundbreaking ceremony at the Boeing South Carolina (BSC) manufacturing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, US, on Friday, Nov. 7, 2025. Sean Rayford | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday the U.S. was not at risk of entering a recession in 2026 and claimed Americans would soon benefit from the Trump administration's economic policies on trade and taxes. \"I am very, very optimistic on 2026,\" Bessent said in an interview on NBC News' \"Meet the Press.\" \"We have set the table for a very strong, noninflationary growth economy.\" Parts of the GOP's massive spending package — the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act — are still going into effect and have yet to be felt in the economy, Bessent said. The new law makes permanent Trump's 2017 tax cuts, along with a senior \"bonus\" to offset Social Security taxes and a bigger state and local tax deduction. The plan also has tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay and auto loans.Health-care costs are also expected to become more affordable, Bessent added. The secretary said the Trump administration would have more news on that subject this week. For now, a congressional deadlock tied to the extension of enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace is expected to push up health-care costs for millions of people. Bessent acknowledged that there are parts of the economy showing signs of struggle, including housing and interest-rate-sensitive sectors. He cited the services economy as contributing to inflation, claiming that lower energy prices will soon help to drive down prices.Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, also said on Sunday that economic data from the fourth quarter could show weakness because of the government shutdown. The 43-day congressional stalemate in Washington, D.C., was the longest in U.S. history. Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, a recent NBC News poll found. Americans' views of the economy largely depend on their income level, according to JPMorgan's latest Cost of Living Survey.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average, the bank found. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10. In contrast, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. ",

    "body": "Michael Bender named Kohl's Interim CEO.Courtesy: Kohl'sKohl's said Monday that Michael Bender, who has served as its interim CEO, will become its permanent chief executive as the department store tries to get back to sales growth. He becomes the third CEO for the department store in about three years. The move is effective as of Sunday.Bender, who has been director of Kohl's board since July 2019, became the company's interim CEO in May. The retailer appointed Bender to the position after firing CEO Ashley Buchanan after just a few months into his tenure.Kohl's fired Buchanan after it said a company investigation found that he had pushed for deals with a vendor with whom he had a personal relationship. That person was Chandra Holt, a former retail executive who had a romantic relationship with Buchanan.Kohl's leadership announcement comes a day before the retailer reports fiscal third-quarter earnings. Along with leadership turmoil, Kohl's has struggled with declining sales. The company said in August that it expects net sales to drop by 5% to 6% for the fiscal year. Kohl's has had many changes at the top since former CEO Michelle Gass left the company in 2022 to join Levi Strauss & Co., where she later succeeded then-CEO Chip Bergh. She was followed at Kohl's by Tom Kingsbury, a then-board member of the company, who became interim and then permanent CEO. Bender, 64, previously held leadership and management roles at retailers including Victoria's Secret, Walmart and Eyemart Express. Along with his role as CEO, Bender will continue to serve on the company's board.In a news release, board chair John Schlifske said Kohl's hired an external firm and \"conducted a comprehensive search\" for the retailer's new leader. He said Bender is the right person for the job because of his \"three decades of leadership experience across retail and consumer goods companies and a deep commitment to the Kohl's brand.\"\"Over the past several months as interim CEO, Michael has proven to be an exceptional leader for Kohl's – progressively improving results, driving short and long-term strategy, and positively impacting cultural change,\" he said.Bender said in the news release that he's pleased by the company's progress, but there's still work to do.\"Kohl's has a storied and important role in the retail industry, serving and celebrating families with great products, compelling value, and a differentiated shopping experience,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to reestablishing our leadership position by putting our customers first every day.\" Over the past five years, Kohl's shares have fallen by about 53%. So far this year, its stock is up nearly 12%.",

    "body": "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo star in Universal's \"Wicked: For Good.\"UniversalUniversal's \"Wicked: For Good\" defied gravity at the box office, snaring an estimated $150 million from domestic ticket sales.It marks the second-highest opening weekend for a film released in 2025, just behind Warner Bros.' \"A Minecraft Movie,\" which tallied $163 million back in April. It also outpaces the debut of last year's \"Wicked,\" which tallied $112.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.The film's haul sets the record for the biggest opening weekend of a Broadway adaptation. With additional ticket sales from international markets, \"Wicked: For Good\" is set to reach a $226 million global haul for its first three days in theaters.An estimated 10 million tickets were sold for \"Wicked: For Good\" during opening weekend, topping the 8 million sold during the opening of \"Wicked\" last year, according to data from EntTelligence. The box office data company also reported that 30% of domestic screenings were in premium large format theaters, up from 18% for \"Wicked.\" These tickets are more expensive than general admission and can help bolster blockbuster releases. EntTelligence noted that general tickets for \"Wicked: For Good\" averaged at around $15.25 each while tickets for premium screens averaged at $18.75 a piece.\"Team Universal did a fantastic job of following perfectly on the success of the original film a year ago and have parlayed that into an even bigger debut for this second installment,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Wicked: For Good' will look forward to incredibly strong playability throughout Thanksgiving week and beyond during the all-important holiday movie-going season.\"Last year, the combination of \"Wicked,\" Paramount's \"Gladiator II\" and Disney's \"Moana 2\" helped boost the Thanksgiving holiday box office to its highest haul ever. This year, \"Wicked: For Good\" is joined by Disney's \"Zootopia 2.\"The first \"Zootopia\" opened in 2016 to $75 million domestically but went on to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. Pent-up audience demand could push the film's three-day opening to around $100 million and the five-day Thanksgiving period to north of $125 million. \"The impressive expected over-performance by 'Wicked: For Good,' in combination with the other films in the marketplace, could give last year's record Thanksgiving literally a run for its money,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This is great news after all the negative stories about the challenging October box office drove the narrative.\" Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Restaurants and bars in the Boat Quay district in Singapore, on Wednesday, May 17, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSingapore's inflation rate rose for a second straight month, year on year, with price growth in October scaling a near 1-year high and topping analysts' expectations.  After reaching a 4-year low in August, consumer prices rose 1.2% — highest since August 2024 — compared with the average 0.9% estimated by economists polled by Reuters and the 0.7% rise in September.Core inflation in the city-state — which strips out prices of accommodation and private transport — also rose to 1.2%, up from 0.4% and compared with the 0.7% expected in the Reuters poll.On a month-on-month basis, the consumer price index was flat, with core inflation coming at 0.5% compared to the prior month.Headline inflation was fueled by a 3.4% increase in transport prices alongside higher core inflation. Health costs also rose by a sharp 4%.The increase in core inflation was due to higher inflation in areas such as services, food, and retail, as well as a milder decline in electricity and gas prices, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.Zavier Wong, market analyst at investment and trading firm eToro, said that while the figure was \"not alarming,\" it was \"enough to raise an eyebrow.\" However, Wong pointed out that the headline inflation figure was driven by select categories such as health and private transport, and there was non broad-based acceleration.He said that domestic demand continues to signal caution. \"People are still spending, just not with the kind of confidence that pushes prices higher. Until that changes, it's hard to see broad inflation picking up on its own.\"The inflation data comes as Singapore on Friday upgraded its economic growth forecast to 4% from 1.5%-2.5%, as it posted robust third-quarter GDP numbers.The economy grew 4.2% in the third quarter from a year earlier, beating estimates and extending the second quarter's 4.7% expansion. Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry said that global economic conditions had turned out more resilient than expected, but warned that growth would likely cool in 2026 as U.S. tariffs weigh on global demand.Singapore's exports to the U.S. are subject to a 10% baseline tariff, despite the country having a trade deficit with the U.S. and also a free trade agreement going back to 2004. The country's economy is hugely dependent on trade, with World Bank data showing that Singapore has a trade-to-GDP ratio of over 320% in 2024. In the third quarter, Singapore recorded a 3.3% fall in non-oil domestic exports, or NODX, year on year, dragged by weaker pharmaceutical and petrochemical exports. In October though, NODX surged 22.2% compared to a year earlier, driven by exports of non-monetary gold and electronic products.The Monetary Authority of Singapore has forecast inflation around 0.5% to 1% for 2025. The MAS held monetary policy unchanged in its October meeting, saying that Singapore's economic growth had been stronger than expected. Chua Hak Bin, regional co-head for macro research at Maybank, told CNBC that both core and headline inflation will likely come in at above 1% in 2026, compared with under 1% in 2025. He said that this is due to an upcoming increase in public transport fares, a higher carbon tax and a new sustainable fuel levy on flight tickets.The rise in consumer prices will be driven by stronger economic growth, falling interest rates and rising credit growth, Chua added.—CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.",

His new publication, titled \"Cassandra Unchained\" with a $379 annual subscription fee, arrives with a familiar warning: He believes markets are once again deep in bubble territory.In announcing the launch, Burry referenced the parallels between the late-1990s tech mania and today's rush into AI and how the bubbles have been ignored by policymakers, in his view.\"Feb 21, 2000: SF Chronicle says I'm short Amazon. Greenspan 2005: 'bubble in home prices … does not appear likely.' [Fed Chair Jerome] Powell '25: 'AI companies actually… are profitable… it's a different thing. 'I doubted if I ever should come back. I'm back. Please join me,\" Burry wrote in a post Sunday night on X.He highlighted then-Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's 2005 insistence that U.S. housing prices showed no signs of a bubble, just two years before the subprime implosion validated Burry's famous \"Big Short.\" And now he argues history is rhyming again.Like the dot-com era, investors are extrapolating exponential growth, dismissing profitability concerns and funding massive capital expenditures on the assumption that the technology will rewrite the economy, he believes.The investor noted Powell has waved off bubble fears, saying that AI companies are \"actually profitable\" and \"a different thing\" from past booms, \"This is different in the sense that these companies, the companies that are so highly valued, actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said during a news conference in October.Burry took it as an eerie echo of the assurances offered by Greenspan two decades ago. At the height of the dot-com boom, Burry was publicly short Amazon. Today, he has been openly bearish on the poster children of the AI boom, Nvidia and Palantir.",

Joe Skipper | ReutersAmazon said Monday it will begin allowing businesses to test its recently rebranded internet-from-space service that seeks to compete with SpaceX's Starlink.Select businesses will be able to test Amazon Leo production hardware and software as part of an \"enterprise preview\" of the service \"ahead of a wider rollout,\" the company said in a blog post. The test program will allow Amazon to collect feedback and \"tailor solutions for specific industries\" ahead of a broader launch, the company said. Earlier this month, Amazon renamed its satellite internet offering from Project Kuiper to Amazon Leo and rolled out a new website to market the service. The name is a nod to low-Earth orbit, a region of space that's within 1,200 miles of Earth's surface and where Amazon's satellite constellation will be concentrated. Six years ago, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of 3,236 low-Earth satellites, designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners, such as United Launch Alliance and Elon Musk's SpaceX. It's aiming to compete with Starlink, owned by SpaceX, which currently dominates the market and has nearly 9,000 satellites in orbit.Amazon has inked deals with JetBlue, L3Harris and Australia's NBN internet network, among others. Amazon said it's shipping units of its \"Pro\" terminals, as well as its \"Ultra\" antennas, to members of its enterprise preview program. The company on Monday showed off the final production design of its Ultra model, which will offer download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second and upload speeds up to 400 megabits per second powered by an in-house custom silicon chip, \"making it the fastest commercial phased array antenna in production.\"Amazon said it expects to expand the program to more customers as it adds coverage and capacity to the Leo network.  The company has yet to disclose pricing and availability for consumers.

Photographer: Will Oliver/EPA/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesWill Oliver | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta halted internal research that purportedly showed that people who stopped using Facebook became less depressed and anxious, according to a legal filing that was released on Friday. The social media giant was alleged to have initiated the study, dubbed Project Mercury, in late 2019 as a way to help it \"explore the impact that our apps have on polarization, news consumption, well-being, and daily social interactions,\" according to the legal brief, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The filing contains newly unredacted information pertaining to Meta. The newly released legal brief is related to high-profile multidistrict litigation from a variety of plaintiffs, such as school districts, parents and state attorneys general against social media companies like Meta, Google's YouTube, Snap and TikTok. The plaintiffs claim that these businesses were aware that their respective platforms caused various mental health-related harms to children and young adults, but failed to take action and instead misled educators and authorities, among several allegations. \"We strongly disagree with these allegations, which rely on cherry-picked quotes and misinformed opinions in an attempt to present a deliberately misleading picture,\" Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement. \"The full record will show that for over a decade, we have listened to parents, researched issues that matter most, and made real changes to protect teens—like introducing Teen Accounts with built-in protections and providing parents with controls to manage their teens' experiences.\" A Google spokesperson said in a statement that \"These lawsuits fundamentally misunderstand how YouTube works and the allegations are simply not true.\" \"YouTube is a streaming service where people come to watch everything from live sports to podcasts to their favorite creators, primarily on TV screens, not a social network where people go to catch up with friends,\" the Google spokesperson said. \"We've also developed dedicated tools for young people, guided by child safety experts, that give families control.\" Snap and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The 2019 Meta research was based on a random sample of consumers who stopped their Facebook and Instagram usage for a month, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit alleged that Meta was disappointed that the initial tests of the study showed that people who stopped using Facebook \"for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and social comparison.\" Meta allegedly chose not to \"sound the alarm,\" but instead stopped the research, the lawsuit said.\"The company never publicly disclosed the results of its deactivation study,\" according to the suit. \"Instead, Meta lied to Congress about what it knew.\"The lawsuit cites an unnamed Meta employee who allegedly said, \"If the results are bad and we don't publish and they leak, is it going to look like tobacco companies doing research and knowing cigs were bad and then keeping that info to themselves?\"Stone, in a series of social media posts, pushed back on the lawsuit's implication that Meta shuttered the internal research after it allegedly showed a causal relationship between its apps and adverse mental-health effects.Stone characterized the 2019 study as flawed and said it was the reason that the company expressed disappointment. The study, Stone said, merely found that \"people who believed using Facebook was bad for them felt better when they stopped using it.\"\"This is a confirmation of other public research (\"deactivation studies\") out there that demonstrates the same effect,\" Stone said in a separate post. \"It makes intuitive sense but it doesn't show anything about the actual effect of using the platform.\"CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed reporting.WATCH: Final trades: Meta, S&P Global and Idexx Lab.",

The busiest days are expected to be the Sunday after Thanksgiving, with about 3.4 million people flying, followed by the Monday after Thanksgiving, with around 3.1 passengers.Airline executives have expressed relief after the longest-ever government shutdown ended Nov. 12. Shortages of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular pay, delayed and canceled flights, disrupting travel plans for some 6 million people, A4A said.The industry is now pushing lawmakers to pass legislation to ensure that air traffic controllers are paid in the case of another shutdown, with executives complaining in recent weeks about air travel becoming a political bargaining chip. The latest bill funds the government only through January, so industry members are hoping to avoid a repeat of the closure just before winter break and spring break seasons begin.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

    "body": "A view shows a Novo Nordisk sign outside its office in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, on July 14, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersShares of Novo Nordisk on Monday fell to a four-year low after the Danish pharmaceutical company said a highly anticipated trial for Alzheimer's disease failed to meet its main goal.The trial tested whether semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo's blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy — helped slow progression for Alzheimer's disease. While treatment with semaglutide resulted in improvement of Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers in two separate trials, this did not translate into a delay of disease progression, Novo said in a statement Monday. The goal had been to slow patients' cognitive decline by at least 20%.Novo stock was down 10% to 274 Danish kroner ($42.33) as of 1:30 p.m. London time (8:30 a.m. ET), its lowest level since mid-2021. Analysts had prior to the results called the trial a long shot, whereas Novo itself had referred to it as a \"lottery ticket.\"\"Based on the significant unmet need in Alzheimer's disease as well as a number of indicative data points, we felt we had a responsibility to explore semaglutide's potential, despite a low likelihood of success,\" said Novo's chief scientific officer, Martin Holst Lange.A long shotThe trial results are a setback for Novo investors that had hoped that it might reignite the company's battered share price. Even before the Monday readout, Novo stock had halved year to date amid a series of guidance cuts and heighted competition, especially in the key U.S. market. \"While hopes were not high for a positive readout, potential success had perhaps kept some in the name, with this result removing a near-term upside scenario,\" wrote Jefferies analysts on Monday.Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is notoriously difficult to treat. It is also expected to affect an increasing proportion of people worldwide as populations grow older. Read moreCurrent treatments such as Eli Lilly's Kisunla and Biogen/Eisai's Leqembi have been shown to slow down the progression of the disease by up to a third, but come with the risk of severe side effects. Shares of Eli Lilly fell slightly while Biogen stock rose nearly 3% in early U.S. trading.Novo's decision to test Rybelsus, an oral form of semaglutide, had been largely based on real-world evidence suggesting a correlation between Alzheimer's and taking semaglutide.The drug works in a similar way to Lilly's rival medicines Mounjaro and Zepbound by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 that naturally occurs in the body, to regulate blood sugar levels and enhance feelings of fullness. It's not yet clear how GLP-1s might benefit Alzheimer's patients, but the theory is that it targets the neuroinflammation thought to impact them.Top-line results will be presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease conference on Dec. 3, with full results at the 2026 Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Diseases Conference in March, Novo said.A competitive marketWhile shares of Novo Nordisk have plunged over the past 18 months, rival Eli Lilly only last week became the first pharmaceutical company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.Even as Ozempic hit the market four years before Mounjaro, Novo's head start hasn't prevented Lilly from quickly grabbing a bigger market share in the U.S. This year, Novo has cut its guidance several times, blaming so-called compounders which sell copycat versions of semaglutide for a cheaper price. watch nowNovo recently replaced its chairman and half its board members over a disagreement between the former board and Novo's controlling shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, about the scope and pace of change needed. It came just months after former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen was booted after an eight-year reign due to the stock decline.The former board was \"too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States,\" new Chair Lars Rebien Sørensen said at the time.New CEO Mike Doustdar, who previously headed Novo's ex-U.S. operations, quickly set out to refocus the company's commercial priorities to its core obesity and diabetes businesses and to cut more than 10% of its global workforce.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks at the McDonald's Impact Summit at the Westin Hotel in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 17, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is \"laying siege on the minimum wage.\" Trump's comments at the McDonald's Impact Summit likely referred to California's higher hourly pay floor for fast-food workers, which took effect a year and a half ago. However, data so far indicate the policy hasn't been the danger Trump described. Research shows that the state's fast-food worker turnover is down. Widespread closures haven't occurred, and restaurant chains are still opening locations in California. To be sure, the increased wages have put more pressure on restaurant chains and operators at a time when other costs are climbing and diners are eating out less frequently. Plus, consumers are paying more for their burgers, chicken tenders and fries as a result of the new pay floor. But after a protracted fight over whether higher pay for workers would harm restaurants, critics' worst fears have not come to pass.Fast-food workers in California at chains with more than 60 national locations started earning $20 an hour in April 2024, 25% more than the state's broader minimum wage of $16 an hour. The sectoral pay floor is part of larger law passed in California that also establishes a council that will recommend proposed industry standards to state agencies and carries the authority to raise the hourly minimum wage annually. Fast-food workers' big break only came after a compromise between the restaurant industry and unions that ended months of fighting between the two parties. The Service Employees International Union championed the legislation, saying it would improve workers' lives and help with industry turnover. Quick-service restaurants argued that they were being unfairly targeted and the wage hike would burden their businesses. \"I firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to a fair wage. The issue that I and my colleagues in this industry have is that we, as an industry, were targeted,\" said Kerri Harper-Howie, who runs WEH Organization and its 25 McDonald's locations in Los Angeles County with her sister, Nicole Harper-Rawlins.. \"If someone works at Macy's and they're making minimum wage, or they work at CVS ... They also should deserve that increase in wages.\" California hasn't supported a wider minimum-wage increase. Last November, just months after the fast-food pay floor went into effect, voters in the state struck down a ballot measure that would have raised the statewide minimum wage to $18 an hour. It reportedly was the first time in nearly three decades that voters shot down a statewide minimum wage hike on any state ballot.For now, other states have yet to follow California's lead, as the nation monitors the effects of the law and the restaurant industry continues to lobby against it. A scramble for franchiseesA McDonald's worker prepares to deliver an order at a McDonald's restaurant on May 8, 2024 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesBroadly, the restaurant industry struggles with razor-thin profit margins. Labor is typically the biggest cost, and operators often aim to keep it roughly 30% of their overall costs. The higher minimum wage has been yet another challenge for operators, on top of commodity inflation and weakness in consumer spending.\"What we can say without a doubt is that it's really tough to operate any restaurant, any concept, any size, in California right now,\" said Sean Kennedy, executive vice president of public affairs for the National Restaurant Association, a major trade group that opposed the wage hike. For 17 months after the higher minimum wage went into effect, Harper-Howie's WEH Organization saw its same-store sales decline. The trend finally reversed in October, as McDonald's rounded the one-year anniversary of an E. coli outbreak that sent company-wide sales plunging by double-digits overnight. The burger chain more broadly has seen its U.S. performance struggle, although it reported same-store sales growth in the third quarter.\"For a long period of time, we were just bleeding money,\" said Harper-Howie, who formed the California Alliance of Family Owned Businesses with fellow McDonald's franchisees to push back against the California legislation.Harper-Howie estimates that her restaurants passed along price increases of less than 10% to customers. Raising prices further would be difficult amid a pullback in dining across the restaurant industry, particularly from low-income consumers. Plus, she said other minimum-wage workers who frequent McDonald's didn't receive the same pay hike, which made the food \"unaffordable for many.\"Harshraj Ghai, who operates more than 200 Burger King, Taco Bell and Popeyes locations across California and Oregon, has similarly raised menu prices by roughly 10% to 12% at California locations. That wasn't enough to offset the wage increases, Ghai said.To further mitigate the higher costs, Ghai has worked to cut labor hours by testing artificial intelligence to take drive-thru orders, using pre-cooked bacon for breakfast and adding automatic batter mixers.\"The cost and maintenance of of these technologies starts to become a little bit better than it would to pay somebody to actually do it,\" he said. The wage hike was just one more rapidly increasing cost for franchisees to wrangle. For example, Harper-Howie said WEH's insurance costs have soared, on top of rising prices for beef and other key ingredients. The Los Angeles wildfires put more pressure on Harper-Howie's business. One of her locations was temporarily closed, but the bigger blow came from the shrinking traffic as fires raged across the county, displacing many residents and scaring off tourists. Trump's hardline immigration stance has been another issue. \"Our employees are predominantly Latino, and they're terrified,\" Harper-Howie said. \"That's all of our hourly workers, our general managers, our shift managers, our department managers, and supervisors — and it's our customers.\"Harper-Howie said that she hasn't had to close any restaurants yet, crediting WEH's decades in the McDonald's system after her parents joined the franchise in the 1980's.But that isn't the case for Ghai, who has had to shutter some unprofitable locations permanently. He said that he's shuttered roughly 10 California locations over the last year and half, and he anticipates shuttering another 12 over the next year or two. While closures are a typical part of a large-scale restaurant business, those closures are much steeper than normal for Ghai, he said.For comparison, Ghai operates only Taco Bell restaurants in Oregon, but those locations are \"significantly more profitable\" than those in California, he said. He hasn't had to close any of his Oregon Taco Bells, but he has closed at least three in California. Taco Bell broadly has outperformed the broader fast-food industry over the last year, helped by its value perception and strong brand equity.Meanwhile, Kennedy said some franchisors are choosing to refranchise their California restaurants, collecting franchising fees in place of the headaches of operating the locations themselves.Despite higher labor costs, California is still a desirable market for fast-food chains. The state added nearly 2,300 fast-food restaurants from the first quarter of 2024 to the first quarter of 2025, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That increase represents a 5% jump, faster than the rest of the country's growth of 2% and outpacing California's increase of 2% in the year-ago period, based on analysis by the California Fast Food Workers Union.A lifeline for workersAn employee hands items to a customer at the drive-thru of a Jack in the Box restaurant in Los Angeles, California, US, on Monday, April 1, 2024.Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile the mandated pay hike brings another challenge for restaurant operators, workers see it as a win, even if it means fewer scheduled hours.For Zane Marte, 28, the pay bump meant that he could offer more support to his family and buy some of his own groceries, rather than leaning on his parents.Marte worked for Jack in the Box in the San Jose area for seven years. When he started, he earned $12 an hour. Over time, his pay crept up, lifted by raises and eventually a promotion to a management position. Still, until the $20 fast-food wage went into effect, his hourly pay was still several dollars below the new pay floor. His experience aligns with research from the University of California Berkeley's Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics. Researchers Michael Reich and Denis Sosinskiy found that the average pre-policy wage for fast-food workers in California was $17.13 an hour, suggesting that the average hourly pay hike after the $20 minimum took effect was about 17%. A separate report from the University of Kentucky published in April found that hiring for fast-food jobs fell after the new pay floor was implemented. However, turnover shrank as the higher wages encouraged workers to stick around. That decline in turnover offset a slowdown in hiring for fast-food workers in California, according to the report.Historically, turnover has been a major problem for the fast-food industry. Hiring and training new workers is expensive and time consuming for operators. For his part, Marte left Jack in the Box months after receiving the raise after he said he grew \"fed up\" with his manager. He has since left California and found employment using his college degree.Before the higher minimum wage went into effect, one concern from operators and trade groups was that other restaurants not included in the policy would have to raise their own wages to stay competitive — which critics said could be particularly hard for small businesses. But that fear largely doesn't seem to have been realized.The Berkeley study did not find any evidence of a spillover into the wages of workers at full-service restaurants chains such as Denny's, Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, Red Robin and Outback Steakhouse. And more broadly, the researchers from the University of Kentucky did not find evidence that other non-food, low-wage employers raised their pay. The slowdown in fast-food hiring meant that other employers didn't have to worry much about their workers leaving for those jobs. Research from the Shift Project, a partnership between Harvard and the University of California San Francisco, found that the wage hike did not result in employers cutting scheduled hours or lead to understaffing in the immediate aftermath of the policy. Anecdotally, however, some fast-food restaurants have cut back their hours. For example, Julia Gonzalez, 21, lives in Los Angeles and works at Pizza Hut and Yoshinoya, a Japanese fast-food chain with roughly 100 locations in California. She told CNBC that she's been scheduled for fewer hours, but the increased wages still mean that she's able to save more money. (Gonzalez is affiliated with the California Fast Food Workers Union, which was a proponent of the industry's higher minimum wage.)Harper-Howie also told CNBC that her restaurants cut the number of overall labor hours because of slumping sales, as higher menu prices scared away diners.Meanwhile, the number of fast-food job losses caused by the policy is still hotly debated.Analysis of BLS data by the Employment Policies Institute, which opposes minimum wage hikes, found that roughly 16,000 fast-food jobs in California have been eliminated since Newsom signed the law in September 2024. However, Reich and Sosinskiy reported no related job losses using employment data that was adjusted to remove seasonal fluctuations, citing California's more temperate climate than the rest of the country.For his part, Newsom, widely believed to be a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election, still includes it in lists of his policy wins as California governor.\"After raising the minimum wage for workers, California now has 750,500 fast food jobs — the MOST in state history! California's fast food industry continues to boom every single month with workers finally receiving the wages they deserve,\" he wrote in a post on X in August last year.",

    "body": "watch nowTesla sales in China dropped to a three-year low in October, raising concerns the electric vehicle maker could see its first full-year sales decline in the country this year. Fierce competition from local rivals such as NIO and Li Auto — both reporting this week — and a bruising price war in the face of a down economy pushed Tesla's China sales to 26,006 last month. The U.S. automaker's share in the Chinese EV market shrank to 3.2% in October from 8.7% in September. \"Tesla is getting surrounded by a swarm of Chinese automakers — from above, below, left and right,\" Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights and auto analyst, told CNBC. \"Like a swarm of drones, each is taking some sales from the company with a target on its back.\"Tesla's newest direct competitor in the upper echelon of the Chinese EV market is Xiaomi. The smartphone maker's YU7 sports utility vehicle and SU7 sedan posted record sales in October despite accidents that raised concerns about the cars' safety.The auto newbie sold nearly 109,000 cars in the third quarter — compared with 170,000 for Tesla. Xiaomi's EV unit turned a profit for the first time.Late bloomer Leapmotor is pressuring Tesla, too. The Chinese EV startup was founded in 2015, but only this year started beating out its local peers in terms of sales and stock price. Analysts credit its in-house production for keeping costs down. Its C10 mid-sized SUV is priced at roughly half of a Model Y. Leapmotor also has a JV partnership with Europe's Stellantis.Leading EV sales in China this year is the Geely Geome Xingyuan. The hatchback is not a direct competitor to Tesla since it serves the cheaper end of the market with its sub $10,000 price tag. Yet it is an indication of where Chinese buyers are at — budget-conscious but looking for value.The Geome Xingyuan's success also highlights another trend — traditional automakers such as Geely making inroads in EVs. That trend is turning Huawei into a more notable Tesla rival. The Chinese tech giant partners with old-line carmakers like Seres, Chery, and Beijing Auto. The Aito M8, a Seres model, has become popular among high-end SUVs.Despite the steep competition, Tesla's Model Y is still holding up, ranking 6th in the overall market. At Tesla's annual general meeting this month, Musk said he expected the Chinese to approve the company's \"Full-Self Driving\" software in early 2026.Yet analysts say Tesla needs to refresh its models to keep pace with its local rivals.Tu Le, founder of consultancy firm Sino Auto Insights, sees 2026 as a \"pivotal year\" for Tesla in China.\"Reality is catching up to Tesla in China,\" Tu said. \"Tesla has done an admirable job via price cuts, non-price-cut price cuts and other tricks to maintain sales of almost five and four-year-old cars versus some of the world's most advanced EVs. But not keeping up with the Xiaomi's, BYD's and XPeng's seems to be finally starting to show itself in its monthly sales.\"Last month, Tesla reported its total third-quarter revenue increased 12% from a year earlier to $28.10 billion, following two straight periods of declines. Even with the overall revenue growth, Tesla's third quarter was marked by a continuing sales slump in Europe, driven partly by competition from EV makers like Volkswagen and BYD.",

    "body": "Daniel Gray and his husband, Douglas, and their dog.Courtesy: Daniel GrayOn Oct. 23, the day after Daniel Gray's 56th birthday, he received an email that made him feel like he was dreaming: The U.S. Department of Education would forgive his more than $170,000 student loan balance.\"I could not believe it,\" Gray said. \"This is the first time I've been without debt since I'm 18.\"Yet the relief should not have been so surprising. Gray began paying his student loan debt in the 1990s and was eligible for the loan cancellation under the terms of his income-driven repayment plan. IDR plans lead to loan erasure after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. But, like many borrowers, Gray was worried by reports that the relief was becoming harder to access under the Trump administration. \"Because of what's been going on, it was unclear whether they'd get forgiven,\" Gray said. Recently, many student loan borrowers have been left doubting if they'll get the loan cancellation to which they're entitled, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"When borrowers worry about whether the Trump administration will renege on the student loan forgiveness promised by the federal government, it places them under extreme financial and emotional stress,\" Kantrowitz said. The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment. Loan forgiveness becomes uncertain under Trump Earlier this year, the Education Department stopped forgiving the debt of borrowers in two long-standing student loan repayment plans, the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay As You Earn plan, or PAYE. It also temporarily paused debt forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. More than 12 million student loan borrowers are enrolled in one of the Education Department's IDR plans, according to Kantrowitz.  But then, in October, there was a major victory for borrowers: The Trump administration agreed to resume clearing people's debts under ICR and PAYE, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers. That same month, eligible borrowers enrolled in IBR also began to see their debts canceled again. The AFT contended that Trump officials were blocking borrowers from their rights mandated in their loan terms. \"We cannot say for sure, but it is possible that the AFT lawsuit prompted the discharge,\" said Weena Sanchez, a student loan counselor at the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, a nonprofit, about Gray's student loan forgiveness. EDCAP worked with Gray on his request for the relief. Gray had earned the loan cancellation by May 2024, according to his loan forgiveness statement. \"We've heard of other clients receiving similar notices,\" Sanchez said.

The Trump administration announced this week that it will transfer much of the Education Department's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency. Education Department officials are also exploring options to sell portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student portfolio to the private market, Politico reported in October.A lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain. Mark Kantrowitz higher education expert Whatever changes lie ahead, it's important for borrowers to remember that the original terms of their student loans, spelled out in their Master Promissory Note, cannot change in the middle of repayment, Kantrowitz said. When borrowers signed that agreement, any programs that were in existence at the time, including repayment plans that conclude in loan forgiveness, must remain available to them, by law.Since student loans can't be discharged in normal bankruptcy proceedings, like other types of debt, borrowers \"depend on there being a light at the end of the tunnel,\" with the government's forgiveness, Kantrowitz said.\"When a low-income student is forced to borrow to pay for college, a lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain,\" he said. Student loan forgiveness 'the only way out' For some 30 years, Gray says his student loan debt weighed on him. He graduated in the mid-1990s from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a degree in film studies and began working technical jobs in video and television production. But in the following years, he says, he grappled with substance abuse issues and clinical depression. As a result, his career took a hit, and Gray struggled to keep up with his monthly student loan payment, he said. Originally, he borrowed roughly around $30,000, but his balance steadily grew due to interest charges. \"This system is designed for students to graduate, get good jobs and start paying,\" Gray said. \"But what about for those of us who don't get our lives together until we are 37 or 38?\" By then, he said, his debt was already nearing six figures. By the time his debt was canceled by the government in October, his balance had spiraled to more than $170,000. \"I couldn't believe I had allowed it to get to this point; I felt incredibly guilty and ashamed,\" Gray said, but he also \"felt like the whole situation was engineered to take advantage of the borrower.\"  In 2011, Gray got a job offer at a television studio in Brazil. Frustrated with the cost of living in the U.S. and hoping for a major change, he made the move to São Paulo. He's lived in Brazil ever since. He met his now-husband, Douglas, a chef, there. The couple live close to the beach and take their dog for long walks every day.The biggest change Gray has felt since his student debt was wiped away is psychological: \"I suddenly feel like I can relax,\" he said. \"It's easy for people to say, 'Why don't people just pay them off? What's the big deal?\" Gray said, about his student loans. But he went on: \"It reached a point where it was beyond control. It seemed impossible. Student loan forgiveness is the only way out for a lot of people.\"",

    "body": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (not seen) and the President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak during a joint press conference after their official meeting at the Presidential Complex in Ankara, Turkiye on November 19, 2025.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesUkrainian officials have spent the weekend scrambling to make up lost ground when it comes to talks with the U.S. over a peace plan to end the war with Russia, with Kyiv having to tread a fine line between showing the U.S. it's willing to engage in discussions, while anxious to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.Talks between U.S. and Ukrainian officials were held in Switzerland over the weekend after it emerged last week that Russia and the White House had held secret discussions and had devised a 28-point peace plan which largely favored Moscow's demands.The plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial conditions, including that Ukraine make territorial and military concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region and reducing its army by 50%, as well as other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"While media reports about the \"peace plan\" were initially met with a grim silence by Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and his European allies, some analysts said it amounted to a capitulation to Russia's maximalist territorial demands.Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an ultimatum to Kyiv to respond to the plan by Thursday and Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled his approval of the plan, saying it formed the \"basis of a final peace settlement.\"Breaking his silence on the proposals last Friday, Zelenskyy said Ukraine was facing one of the most difficult moments in its history and was essentially facing a choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.Pressured talksTrump turned the screws on Saturday, posting on Truth Social that Ukraine had shown \"zero gratitude\" for the U.S. peace efforts, adding an extra layer of presidential pressure to talks held between the U.S and Ukraine on Sunday.While giving few details away, the discussions, which involved U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and a Ukrainian delegation led by Zelenskyy's top aide, Andriy Yermak, appear to have gone well. Rubio told reporters that both sides had made \"tremendous progress\" with negotiators having drawn up an \"updated and refined peace framework\" that would be worked on this week.While Ukraine may have accepted that NATO membership is unlikely (and this is one of Russia's key demands) this means that postwar security guarantees are crucial for Kyiv.Read moreUkraine has also pushed back on ceding partially occupied Ukrainian territory to Russia and its European allies fearing that Russia would only regroup and stage another invasion in future to capture more of Ukraine. Kyiv has repeated its stance that it needs a \"just and lasting peace\" and not an agreement that won't stand the test of time.Asked about U.S.-Ukraine security guarantees being included in the document, Rubio was vague but told reporters on Sunday:\"I think we all recognize that part of getting a final end to this war will require for Ukraine to feel as if it is safe and it is never going to be invaded or attacked again. So that's clearly something that has to be discussed. I think we've made substantial progress on that and other points.\" U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks to journalists at the John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport after the G7 foreign ministers meeting, in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Nov. 12, 2025. Mandel Ngan | Via ReutersRubio conceded that the progress of talks with Ukraine was contingent on Russia's approval, stating: \"No matter what we came up with today, obviously, we now have to take what we come up with, if we can reach that agreement with the Ukrainian side to the Russian side, that's another part of this equation. They have to agree to this in order for this to work.\"On Monday, Trump appeared to question progress in talks, posting on Truth Social, \"Is it really possible that big progress is being made in Peace Talks between Russia and Ukraine??? Don't believe it until you see it, but something good just may be happening,\" he said.Red linesFor his part, Zelenskyy said the talks were \"substantive\" and said Monday on social media that, \"right now, it is crucial that every joint action with our partners is throughly thought out. All decisions must be doable in order to ensure lasting peace and guaranteed security ... Together, we will certainly safeguard our shared interests and our people.\"Oleksiy Goncharenko, a Ukrainian lawmaker, told CNBC on Monday that he hoped the latest talks would be fruitful but that security guarantees were \"absolutely vital.\"\"There are some things in this proposal [peace plan] which are unacceptable for Ukraine, there are some things which should be changed but, in general, finally we have a framework and we should work on it and improve it and that's diplomacy,\" Goncharenko told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowAside from security guarantees, other red lines for Ukraine related to the proposal, in the original 28-point plan, that its armed forces hand over parts of the Donbas region, including several large, fortified cities, that they still control.\"I think this is something that's unacceptable for Ukraine because we can't just leave our people,\" Goncharenko said. \"The freezing of the conflict, the peace deal should be reached on the current [front] line, that is something which has been said many times and I think we need to stick to this,\" he said.",

The requirements can be difficult to follow amid changing legislation and IRS guidance, experts say.\"RMD mistakes rarely come from neglect. They come from complexity,\" said certified financial planner Scott Van Den Berg, president of advisory firm Century Management in Austin. \"People don't realize how many accounts they have, who's responsible for what or how quickly the rules have changed.\"If you don't take your full RMD by the due date, the penalty is 25% of the amount you should have withdrawn. But that can be reduced to 10% if the RMD is \"timely corrected\" within two years, according to the IRS. Here are some of the biggest RMD mistakes and how to avoid them.  One of the 'biggest mistakes' is waiting  While Dec. 31 is the RMD deadline for most retirees, many investors don't start the process soon enough, according to CFP Tom Geoghegan, founder of Beacon Hill Private Wealth in Summit, New Jersey.\"One of the biggest RMD mistakes is waiting until December to sort everything out,\" he said. \"When retirees rush, they are more likely to miscalculate the [RMD] amount, sell the wrong assets or miss the deadline altogether,\" he said. By starting early, there is more time to verify the year-end balance needed to calculate the RMD, confirm beneficiary details and pick the best way to pull cash from the portfolio, Geoghegan said.Missed accounts When calculating RMDs, you need to consider the requirements for each one and tally each RMD for your final number.  But one of the biggest mistakes is skipping accounts, such as an old 401(k), a forgotten rollover or an inherited individual retirement account from years ago, said Van Den Berg of Century Management.However, you can avoid this error by making a \"master list\" of your accounts every January, including which company holds the assets and the RMD requirements for each one, he said.  watch now'Underused' qualified charitable distributions If you donate money to charity, you can use so-called qualified charitable distributions, or QCDs, which are direct transfers from an IRA to an eligible nonprofit, to reduce RMDs. The move is \"underused\" and can satisfy your yearly RMD, according to Geoghegan of Beacon Hill Private Wealth.    Once you're age 70½ or older, you can use QCDs to donate up to $108,000 in 2025. For married couples filing jointly, spouses aged 70½ or older can also transfer up to $108,000 from their IRA.Another benefit of QCDs is the strategy will \"keep the income off the tax return, which helps with Medicare surcharges,\" Geoghegan said.

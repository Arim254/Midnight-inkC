    "body": "Workers demolish the facade of the East Wing of the White House on Oct. 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe White House on Tuesday dismissed anger over the demolition of parts of the building's East Wing to build a new ballroom at the behest of President Donald Trump.\"In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House,\" the White House said in a statement.The White House called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.Photos of construction workers tearing down parts of the building went viral online Monday, triggering public anger over the planned 90,000-square-foot, $250 million ballroom.\"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back,\" Trump said during a Rose Garden event Tuesday. \"That's music to my ears. I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it.\"In July, Trump said that construction of the ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building.\"\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said of the White House at the time.The Treasury Department has told staff not to share photos of the East Wing, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. The department is located next to the White House, and has a clear view of the demolition work.\"Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details,\" the Treasury spokesperson told CNBC.\"Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images.\"The Wall Street Journal first reported Treasury's message to employees.\"Trump's billionaire ballroom. This is a disgrace. Welcome to the Second Gilded Age,\" Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., tweeted Monday, above a photo from The Washington Post showing the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will finance the construction of the ballroom.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom's construction. It is unclear how much Comcast and other donors contributed. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.",

DraftKings targeted the company for its team and proprietary technology. \"We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,\" DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC. \"We believe that Railbird's team and platform—combined with DraftKings' scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.\"Predictions markets allow customers to trade on the outcomes of various events in the worlds of finance, culture and entertainment, which will allow DraftKings to expand beyond its sports betting business. The markets on election outcomes and sports are the most controversial.  Dozens of states, their gaming regulators and tribes are suing or taking other actions to try to prohibit companies from offering trades based on sporting events, because they see it as unlicensed gambling.  Nevada is among the states warning that companies risk losing their gambling licenses if they offer sports in their prediction markets.If DraftKings offers sports events contracts, it's likely to focus only on states that don't offer licensed sports betting, like California and Texas, to avoid running afoul of the states where it offers sports betting.  Additionally, technology exists to prevent those sports trades from being available on tribal lands.  DraftKings also may offer more advanced \"know your customer\" guardrails, a term commonly used to reference identity verification, given its experience in the regulated gambling market.  ",

Its popularity has spurred Netflix to release it twice in theaters — once in August for a two-day weekend event and again next week around Halloween.Partnering with Mattel and Hasbro will allow Netflix to offer a suite of consumer products based around the film.Mattel will handle dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets, while Hasbro will focus on plush, electronics, roleplay items and board games, the companies announced Tuesday. There will likely be some overlap in product categories between the two toy makers, however. Mattel is currently taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. And Hasbro's first product is a \"KPop Demon Hunters\" themed Monopoly Deal game. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.\"Netflix, Mattel and Hasbro joining forces on this first-of-its-kind collaboration means fans can finally get their hands on the best dolls, games, and merchandise they've been not-so-subtly demanding on every social platform known to humanity,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, said in a statement Tuesday.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix is \"all in\" on leveraging generative artificial intelligence on its streaming platform, according to the company, as AI continues to make its way into mainstream entertainment.The comments came from Netflix's earnings report Tuesday, which highlighted AI as a major focus for the world's largest streaming service by subscriber count. \"For many years now, [machine learning] and AI have been powering our title recommendations as well as production and promotion technology,\" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.Netflix added that generative AI presents a \"significant opportunity\" across its streaming platform, including improving its recommendations, ads business, and movies and TV content.\"We're empowering creators with a broad set of GenAI tools to help them achieve their visions and deliver even more impactful titles for members,\" it said.Netflix provided recent examples of this, noting that in its recently distributed film Happy Gilmore 2, it used generative AI tools to help de-age characters. Meanwhile, producers for the Netflix series Billionaires' Bunker have used various generative AI tools during pre-production to explore wardrobe and set designs.Concerns of AI replacementNetflix's comments come amid broader concerns in the entertainment and art world regarding the potential for AI to replace human workers and the technology's use of human-made content.  Speaking during an earnings call, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos seemingly addressed those issues, noting that AI can enhance the overall TV and movie experience, but \"can't automatically make you a great storyteller if you're not.\"\"We're confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster and in new ways — we're all in on that,\" Sarandos said. He added: \"We're not worried about AI replacing creativity.\" However, many in the entertainment industry remain skeptical of AI and its growing presence in media. An upstart production studio called Particle6 recently faced massive backlash for its plan to create, design, manage and monetize AI-generated actors and talent, including from the media union SAG-AFTRA. SAG-AFTRA previously led a significant actors' strike in July 2023, amid a broader series of Hollywood labor disputes that saw concerns about the use of artificial intelligence brought to the forefront.The strike lasted over 100 days before a tentative agreement was reached between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which included the establishment of contractual AI protections for film and TV performers for the first time.To further encourage the responsible use of such AI tools, Netflix recently released a new AI-focused production guidance aimed at its creators. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Netflix fell around 7% in extended trading Tuesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said. \"It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,\" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a have a material impact on our results going.\" Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.Here's how the company did in the period ended September 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share:  $5.87 vs. $6.97, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.51 billion vs. $11.51 billion, according to LSEGNetflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%. Still, Netflix said it posted its best ad sales quarter ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.\"Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. \"This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.\"Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of \"Strangers Things\" and new seasons of \"The Diplomat\" and \"Nobody Wants This\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" and Rian Johnson's \"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.\"Netflix is also still riding the coattails of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated film has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" dolls, plush, roleplay items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.",

    "body": "watch nowLauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, said the surge in enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has all the markings of a bubble.\"We are absolutely in an AI bubble now. It is going to burst,\" she said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday to David Faber. \"I don't know when, I don't know the order of magnitude. A lot of people are going to lose money.\"Her remarks come as enthusiasm for AI continues to drive markets higher, with investors betting the technology will transform industries and lift corporate earnings. Taylor Wolfe said investors are underestimating the risks tied to the surge in AI-related spending by major technology companies.\"There are trillions of dollars that are being earmarked to be spent relative to hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow generated by the Mag 7,\" she said, referring to the group of large-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. \"They're going to have to borrow to invest in all this CapEx, and we have yet to see the returns on investment.\"Her remarks come at a time when analysis shows the S&P 500 has become pretty much an AI index.Taylor Wolfe believes the mismatch between capital expenditures and profit potential makes current valuations difficult to justify.\"Show me the trillions of dollars of profits that are going to be generated in the next five years,\" she said. \"And you just can't. The math doesn't work.\"She said the current environment is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when investors chased anything associated with the internet regardless of valuation or business model. During the dotcom era, the right thing to do wasn't short the bubble companies; it was to look where no one else was looking, she said.\"You'd have been better off owning a railroad in 2000 than buying Cisco at 35 times earnings, Taylor Wolfe said. \"So at Impactive, what we're doing today is looking for our railroads.\"At the 13D Monitor's Active-Passive Investor Summit Tuesday, Taylor Wolfe presented her new idea Advanced Drainage Systems, which she called the undisputed leader in plastic stormwater and residential septic systems. She said the company is AI proof.",

More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, 1-day performanceIt's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBYND, all timeYet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.watch nowThe return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.",

    "body": "The Mattel, Inc. logo is displayed outside the headquarters of the toy company known for products including Barbie and Hot Wheels in El Segundo, California on June 8, 2023.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBarbie-maker Mattel posted third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations as ongoing global tariffs continue to hamper the toy manufacturer's sales in North America.Shares of the company fell 4% in after hours trading.Here's what Mattel reported for its third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. $1.07 expectedRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $1.83 billion expectedFor the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $278 million, or 88 cents per share, down from $372 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs associated with restructuring and certain product recalls, per-share profit was 89 cents.Net sales fell 6% to $1.74 billion, coming in short of Wall Street's expectations.This is the first time in three quarters that the toy giant has missed on both earnings and revenue expectations.In May, Mattel pulled its annual financial targets and said it would increase prices for some products in the U.S. to counter higher input costs due to the Trump administration's tariffs on key trading partners. On Tuesday the company issued full-year guidance that calls for net sales to increase between 1% and 3% and for earnings per share to come in between $1.54 and $1.66.\"While our U.S. business was challenged in the third quarter by industry-wide shifts in retailer ordering patterns, the fundamentals of our business are strong,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said in a release. \"Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, orders from retailers in the US have accelerated significantly.\"Tariffs have put pressure on toy manufacturers industry-wide. Approximately half of Mattel's global toy sales come from the U.S., and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China, Kreiz noted on CNBC in May.During the third quarter, sales in North America fell 12%, with the largest year over year declines in the company's infant, toddler and preschool category. International sales meanwhile climbed 3%.Overall, sales for two of Mattel's largest toy brands saw declining sales: Global Barbie sales fell 17% from the same quarter a year earlier, and Fisher-Price sales dropped 19%. The company's global Hot Wheels sales ticked up 8%.Moving forward, Mattel has focused on expanding its entertainment offerings and employing new technology. On Tuesday, Mattel and Hasbro partnered with Netflix to capitalize on the success of the movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" to offer dolls and other consumer products tied to the film.Mattel is producing dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets and currently is taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.Correction: Mattel reported net income of $278 million. A previous version of this article misstated the figure. ",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has demanded that the Department of Justice pay him a whopping $230 million in compensation for its criminal investigations of him dating to before his first term in the White House and afterward, The New York Times reported Tuesday.The Times noted that any potential settlement might have to be approved by federal officials whom he has appointed during his second term.One of them, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, represented Trump as a defense attorney in criminal cases before he returned to the White House in early January.\"As far as all of the litigation ... yeah, they probably owe me a lot of money,\" Trump told reporters at the White House later Tuesday.\"It could be\" the $230 million reported by the Times, he acknowledged.The president also said that any decision by the DOJ to pay him compensation \"would have to go across my desk, and it's awfully strange to make a decision where I'm paying myself.\" \"In other words, did you ever have one of those cases where you have to decide how much you're paying yourself in damages?\" Trump said.\"But I was damaged very greatly, and any money that I would get I would give to charity,\" he added.Trump submitted complaints related to the DOJ's probes \"through an administrative claim process that is often the precursor to lawsuits,\" the Times reported.One claim, submitted in 2023, requests damages in connection with the DOJ's investigation of interference in the 2016 presidential election by Russia and potential connections to Trump's campaign that year, the Times said.The other claim, filed in mid-2024, accuses the FBI of violating Trump's rights by conducting a search of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022 as part of an investigation into his retention of classified government documents after leaving the White House at the end of his first term.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump wants $230 million from DOJ for investigating him: NYTWhite House calls Trump ballroom demolition work furor 'manufactured outrage'Trump Jan. 6 pardon recipient accused of threatening to kill Dem leader JeffriesTrump idea to buy beef from Argentina will hurt U.S. ranchers, GOP Sen. warnsTrump can deploy National Guard in Portland, appeals court panel saysU.S. and Australia sign critical minerals agreement with $8.5B project pipelineComey seeks case dismissal, says Trump-picked prosecutor appointed unlawfullyWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

I don't know, how do you settle the lawsuit, I'll say give me X dollars, and I don't know what to do with the lawsuit,\" Mr. Trump said.\"It sort of looks bad, I'm suing myself, right?\" Trump said. \"So I don't know. But that was a lawsuit that was very strong, very powerful.\"A spokesman for Trump's legal team, when asked about the Times report, told CNBC, \"President Trump continues to fight back against all Democrat-led Witch Hunts, including the 'Russia, Russia, Russia' hoax and the un-Constitutional and un-American weaponization of our justice system by Crooked Joe Biden and his handlers.\"The White House referred questions from CNBC about the Times article to the DOJ.Generally speaking, we have no comment on the status of the claims, and off record would refer you to the President's personal attorneys on the specifics of what's being sought. The DOJ declined to comment on the status of Trump's claims.But DOJ spokesman Chad Gilmartin said, in reference to the potential for department officials being conflicted in the situation, \"In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials.\"— CNBC's Eamon Javers contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Elon Musk interviews on CNBC from the Tesla Headquarters in Texas. CNBCA day ahead of Tesla's quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.Tesla's board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting next month.On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package \"outrageous,\" in part because Musk's \"political activities have damaged Tesla's brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.\" The site says the plan doesn't require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\"Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,\" the site says. \"That's our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.\"Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People's Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk's previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.Following those firms' suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, \"ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.\" The company added that shareholders who sold would \"have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.\"watch nowThe Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\" The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI's ChatGPT.By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he \"vociferously opposes this pay package\" and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.\"Most of the time we've held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it's grown over time, and that's why we haven't chosen to dump it,\" Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he's preferred to \"hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.\"Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.He said he views Tesla's board he as \"insufficiently independent,\" and that it's allowed Musk to be an \"absentee CEO.\" The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it's still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.Musk has \"been an inconsistent CEO at best,\" Lander said, \"and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.\"Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.WATCH: Former Tesla board member on Muskwatch now",

    "body": "Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBCMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is getting a big bump in his compensation, as the company's stock price has continued to rally, propelled by the boom in artificial intelligence. Nadella's total pay for fiscal 2025 climbed 22% to $96.5 million from $79.1 million last year, Microsoft said in a proxy filing after the close of regular trading on Tuesday. That includes more than $84 million in stock awards and over $9.5 million in Nadella's cash incentives.The pay plan is largely tied Microsoft's share performance. So far in 2025, Microsoft's stock price has risen by 23%, topping the S&P 500's 15% gain. The shares have more than doubled in valued over the past three years.Microsoft is scheduled to report results for the fiscal first quarter next week. In its fourth-quarter disclosure in July, the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales climbing 18%, the fastest growth in more than three years. Microsoft Azure business is driving expansion as companies' cloud infrastructure needs grow to meet AI demand. In fiscal 2024, Nadella's pay jumped 63% from 48.5 million the prior year, with 90% of his compensation coming from stock awards. Nadella was eligible for a $10.66 million cash incentive last year, but he asked the board's compensation committee to reduce that number to $5.2 million as a result of a series of cyberattacks that the company endured.Despite Microsoft's strong financial and stock performance, the company has seen turmoil among its workforce in recent months. In July, Nadella penned a memo to employees saying that the company's elimination of more than 15,000 employees in 2025 had \"been weighing heavily\" on him.Microsoft has also terminated several activist employees who protested the company's work with the Israeli military.WATCH: Microsoft is trending toward a $5T market cap, says Wedbush's Dan Iveswatch now",

    "body": "Employees work on Buick Envision SUVs at General Motors' Dong Yue assembly plant, officially known as SAIC-GM Dong Yue Motors Co., Ltd., in Yantai, Shandong Province, China, Nov. 17, 2022.Tang Ke | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesDETROIT — General Motors plans to move production of a Buick compact SUV from China to the U.S. for domestic sales, the company confirmed Thursday.GM said the next-generation vehicle is expected to be built at the automaker's Fairfax Assembly plant in Kansas City, Kansas, beginning in 2028. The next-generation Buick compact SUV that will be built in the U.S. will be sold domestically, meaning production of the vehicle in China may continue as well for sales elsewhere.The move comes as President Donald Trump has been pressuring companies to onshore production and as the relationship between the U.S. and China grows increasingly contentious, including with tariffs on vehicles. The Detroit automaker has produced the compact Buick Envision SUV in China for the U.S. since 2017. However, the company declined to confirm the name for the next generation of the vehicle that it will be moving stateside. \"General Motors will onshore production of the next-generation Buick compact SUV to Fairfax Assembly in Kansas City, beginning in 2028. This decision further strengthens GM's domestic manufacturing footprint and supports U.S. jobs, building on $5.5 billion in new investments announced across our U.S. manufacturing sites in the last year,\" GM said in an emailed statement.The compact Buick is expected to join production of the gas-powered Chevrolet Equinox at the Kansas factory following limited production of the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt. Equinox production will start in 2027, GM said.U.S. sales of the Envision have topped 40,000 for the past three years, representing roughly a quarter of Buick's sales during that time period.GM's decision to produce the compact Buick SUV in the U.S. was first reported by Reuters.",

    "body": "Niphon | Istock | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump's plan to grant Nvidia licenses to ship some of its more powerful artificial intelligence chips to China is ruffling the feathers of some of Washington's most prominent China hawks, including members of his own party. The pushback intensified this week with the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee advancing a bill that seeks to expand congressional oversight of AI chip exports.The proposal, known as the AI Overwatch Act, was introduced last month by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the committee chairman.It would require both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Banking Committee to approve any shipment licenses for advanced chips in 30 days, giving lawmakers the power to block sales through a joint resolution.The bill comes as the Trump Administration plans to grant licenses allowing Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China, which are far more powerful than the processors previously permitted for export. If passed, the AI Overwatch Act would revoke existing licenses for such AI chip transfers and impose a temporary ban until the administration submits a national security strategy on AI exports. It includes exemptions for \"trusted\" U.S. companies shipping chips abroad under U.S. control, provided they meet security standards.\"Companies like Nvidia are requesting to sell millions of advanced AI chips, which are the cutting edge of warfare, to Chinese military companies like Alibaba and Tencent,\" said Chairman Mast, framing it as a national security risk. The bill was also cosponsored by the Republican Chairman of the Select Committee on China, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who called it a \"critical step toward protecting America's technological edge.\"Still, it remains unclear the extent of support that the AI Overwatch Act can attract in the House and Senate. Disagreement in WashingtonThe act is likely to serve as a linchpin in a larger battle developing in Washington between lawmakers who see Nvidia chip exports as a national security risk and officials who argue that the exports help maintain U.S. technological dominance.Among the latter camp is White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who has already criticized the AI Overwatch Act. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor recently reposted a viral social media claim that the bill would undermine Trump's authority over AI chip exports.Sacks and those in the Trump administration who support more Nvidia shipments overseas have argued that U.S. chip restrictions have been counterproductive and have ceded ground to Chinese competitors. Instead, they say it is advantageous for U.S.-designed chips to remain at the center of global AI infrastructure.  This is consistent with arguments made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and industry lobbyists.Bipartisan lawmakers on the other side, however, have argued that Nvidia's H200s could bolster China's AI capabilities and be leveraged by its military. Current U.S. chip controls require individual licenses from the Commerce Department for any exports or transfers of high-performance AI chips to entities in \"countries of concern,\" including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.These controls have covered Nvidia's H200, one of its most powerful AI chips. But last week, Trump confirmed his administration would approve sales of the processors to China, provided the U.S. receives a 25% cut of the proceeds.Mounting pushback Much of the pushback from lawmakers has come from the opposition party. In December, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., criticized Trump's approval of H200 exports as evidence of a \"haphazard and transactional approach\" lacking a coherent strategy against China. \"American companies must remain the undisputed leader in AI hardware because our strategic competition with China on AI will boil down to whose ecosystem drives adoption and innovation globally,\" he said.Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also warned that China seeks such chips for military modernization, weapons design and AI surveillance, citing Justice Department assessments.However, Trump has also faced bipartisan resistance. Before the H200, the president had also announced he would allow Nvidia to resume its sales of the H20 to China, a chip the President had restricted just months earlier. At the time, lawmakers had also responded with additional AI chip proposals, including the GAIN AI Act, introduced in November by a bipartisan group that included Warren and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. The bill would require U.S. firms to prioritize domestic sales of advanced chips before exporting to China. Despite Trump's policy shifts on chip exports, Chinese regulators have not allowed Nvidia's chips to flow back into the country freely. Reuters reported last week that Chinese customs authorities have been instructed to block imports of H200 chips and warned tech companies against purchasing them unless necessary. ",

    "body": "Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, speaking on Squawk on the Street at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20th, 2026. Oscar Molina | CNBCCloud software stocks have started this year where they left off in 2025: selloff mode. The continued downward spiral is setting the stage for a flurry of acquisitions, investors told CNBC. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, which tracks cloud software, has dropped more than 8% so far this year, while the Nasdaq is slightly up. Leading software names like Salesforce, ServiceNow and Adobe are down more than 14% after badly underperforming the market a year ago. The overriding concern is that artificial intelligence will eventually displace key pieces of the enterprise stack, as IT buyers turn to AI agents to handle tasks currently handled by software vendors, both large and small. Those fears were amplified last week when Anthropic's Claude launched an AI agent tool named Cowork that is aimed at the enterprise customer. A senior investor at a large private equity fund who asked not to be named in order to speak candidly on the subject said the disruption in software is happening today and will force several mid-sized software companies to seek financing options, potentially spurring acquisitions by private equity. Orlando Bravo, co-founder of software-focused buyout firm Thoma Bravo, is looking to buy the dip, and sees value in companies that are building their own agentic solutions to work with their existing systems.\"We're seeing just incredible buying opportunities right now,\" Bravo told CNBC's Sara Eisen in Davos on Wednesday. He said his firm is doing deals and \"will be a lot more active.\"While investors like Bravo remain bullish on software in an AI-dominated world, analyst Jackson Ader at KeyBanc sees real vulnerabilities. He conducted an analysis of the major threats facing software in August, and said then that seat-based application companies like Monday.com, Asana and Sprout Social are the most exposed. All three stocks have seen double-digit drops in 2026.In that same note to clients, Bader said those companies aren't tied to an anchor system of record like enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM), and have yet to become multi-product platforms. Representatives from Monday, Asana and Sprout didn't respond to requests for comment. Even companies with a wider breadth of products and more established enterprise footprint are facing significant market skepticism. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has spent months defending his company and trying to reassure investors that it's well-positioned in AI. In Davos, Benioff told Eisen that the company's latest quarter was \"the best quarter we've ever had in our careers,\" and that \"we're one of the largest cash-producing companies in the world.\"\"But it's not enough,\" Benioff said, referring to the market action. \"Because if you don't produce a large language model you're evidently not in fashion right now.\"ServiceNow is responding to the pressure by joining the potential competition. On Wednesday, the company announced a deal with OpenAI to use its models to offer AI agents to business customers.The news didn't ease concerns. ServiceNow shares dropped for six consecutive trading days before rising on Thursday, and are down 17% in January.  HubSpot, Atlassian and Braze are having an even worse start to the year, with shares of each down more than 20%. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC that the recent pullback in software stocks could force certain companies to \"explore strategic alternatives,\" and that any new deals that don't have a compelling AI angle won't gain much traction with investors. In a note published in late November, Jaluria highlighted Asana, Box and DocuSign as potential acquisition targets in software. The companies didn't respond to requests for comment. With tech earnings season kicking into high gear next week, Wall Street will start to get a clearer picture of where particular companies stand in adopting AI or getting swallowed by it. Luria said one of the crucial questions is how quickly AI agents like Claude's Cowork go beyond developing new code and actually automate different parts of the software lifecycle. That timeline will be critical in understanding the reality of the AI threat and how soon cloud software companies might feel the pain. — CNBC's Noah Broder contributed to this report.WATCH: AI challenging software incumbents watch now",

The company said it will provide data speeds of \"up to 6 terabits per second\" from satellites positioned in low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit, regions of space that are between 100 miles and 21,000 miles from the Earth's surface. Blue Origin said it expects to begin deploying its constellation in the fourth quarter of 2027.

The service recently rebranded from Project Kuiper to Leo. The company has sent up 180 satellites since last April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners such as United Launch Alliance and SpaceX. Several future deployments are expected to be handled by Blue Origin. Amazon aims to build a constellation of 3,236 low Earth satellites that will serve businesses, governments and consumers. Last November, the company opened up an \"enterprise preview\" to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch.  Bezos predicted in 2024 that Blue Origin would one day be a bigger company than Amazon. He founded Blue Origin in 2000, and Dave Limp, Amazon's former devices boss, serves as its CEO. \"I think it's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved in, but it's going to take a while,\" Bezos said in a 2024 interview at The New York Times' DealBook Summit.Blue Origin is primarily a rocket launch company, flying tourists and research to the edge of space on short trips. Last January, the startup notched a major milestone when it successfully launched its towering New Glenn rocket for the first time, though it was unable to return the rocket's booster back to a barge for reuse. Blue Origin nailed the landing of its New Glenn rocket booster last November following the successful launch of a pair of NASA spacecraft. watch now",

Last year, OpenAI closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.OpenAI also finalized a $6.6 billion share sale in October that boosted its valuation to $500 billion.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump attends a reception with business leaders during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF), in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump's latest retreat from a trade war has catalyzed an international asset rally — and revived investors' talk of \"TACO\" — \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" Speaking to CNBC's Joe Kernen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday evening, Trump said he'd walked back tariffs on European allies because he now had \"the concept of a deal\" over Greenland, after weeks of demanding to annex it for the U.S.He had threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that opposed his push to \"buy\" the Arctic island. They would have risen to 25% from June 1.watch nowEurope vowed an \"unflinching\" response to any new tariffs and stocks, bonds and the U.S. dollar staged a steep sell-off on Tuesday, as investors panicked about the fresh possibility of a trade war. But Wall Street's major averages jumped after Trump's walk-back on Wednesday, with stock futures pointing to an extension of those gains on Thursday morning. The rebound rippled globally, with equities listed in Europe and Asia also rising when regional markets reopened Thursday. Read moreReturn of the TACO trade?  Amid the global rally, one of the key fixtures of investing in 2025 stepped into the new year: the \"TACO\" trade.The phrase refers to the president's history of threatening to leverage intense levies, only to ease, delay or cancel them. It was coined last year after Trump's \"liberation day\" announcement of tariffs in April shocked markets but investors grew skeptical of his follow-through when he eventually backed down. Market reactions to subsequent U.S. trade policy announcements were more muted or saw recoveries more quickly.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, likened today's market moves to those seen last year. \"Donald Trump's TACO bell has rung once again, much to the joy of financial markets,\" he said in a Thursday morning note. \"Trump has form in chickening out of his threats … there are a lot of similarities with the liberation day market wobble in April 2025 and now.\"In both situations, Trump took an aggressive stance and then backed down after financial markets wobbled.\"watch nowHowever, Mould added that some signs of lingering caution remain at play, with markets appearing to be regaining balance rather than \"moving into top gear.\"\"Gold's rally paused for breath, albeit it was notable there wasn't a major sell-off in the metal,\" he said. \"That suggests investors are keen to keep some safety elements in their portfolio. Healthcare and tobacco stocks were also in vogue, which is normally what you would expect on a day of worry, not when markets rebound.\"Alan Siow, co-head of emerging market corporate debt at asset management giant Ninety One, told CNBC on Thursday that the TACO mindset was the driver of the risk asset rally seen after liberation day — and that it seemed to still be influencing markets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 price\"We don't have any evidence yet that this has changed, but over the last two days at Davos, I think we have seen from the rhetoric of global leaders that something has hardened and perhaps permanently changed at the policy level, which will then feed down into wider economy via changes in business and investment plans,\" he said.\"Even if the reality remains TACO in the near term, perhaps we will now see a lasting change in underlying behavior — but to be fair, given how fast moving the recent developments have been, it's too early to tell.\"Paul Surguy, managing director and head of investment management and proposition at London-based wealth management firm Kingswood Group, said that although markets do react negatively to certain White House policies, those reactions have generally grown more muted since liberation day. \"The initial position — a worst-case scenario is announced with the view of a more palatable deal being struck later — is exactly what we have seen with comments over Greenland,\" he told CNBC in an email. \"As yet, scant details have been released regarding the 'framework' deal. That being said, with a more conciliatory tone, markets have responded positively.\"Toni Meadows, head of investments at BRI Wealth Management, struck a more skeptical tone on the TACO trade, urging investors to wait for details on the Greenland \"deal\" — and for Europe's response.  watch nowMeadows said the markets would initially \"claim back some or all of the falls\" before Trump announced a potential Greenland deal.\"There is relief but this is just one area of many that the U.S. president is seeking to shake the tree to see what he can get for America, based on his agenda of resource imperialism,\" he added.Meadows noted that markets were also monitoring domestic White House policies like a proposed cap on credit card rates. \"Investors will [now] likely try to get back to digesting the impact of the U.S. earnings season,\" he said. \"But this will only last until Trump's next announcement.\"",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle exits a charging lot on Jan. 15, 2026 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesAlphabet's Waymo said Thursday that its robotaxi service is now open to paying riders in Miami, kicking off a 2026 market expansion.Miami is the sixth market where Waymo offers driverless ride-hailing service, extending its lead over Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox. As U.S. competition has lagged, Waymo's planned 2026 expansions could lock in rider demand and loyalty in the U.S.To start, Waymo will offer its services within a 60-square-mile area that includes Miami's Design District, Wynwood, Brickell and Coral Gables neighborhoods, the Google sister company said. The company began testing its vehicles in the Florida city in early 2025. Waymo said it plans to extend its service to the Miami International Airport in the near future, but did not give a specific timeline. The company said \"nearly 10,000 residents\" of Miami have already signed up to try its robotaxi service, and Waymo will be \"inviting new riders on a rolling basis.\" Riders can hail a Waymo robotaxi in Miami using the company's app. Waymo is partnering with mobility company Moove for fleet management services including vehicle charging, cleaning and repairs.The Miami launch comes after Waymo has faced public concerns over the safety and driving behavior of its vehicles.Waymo's vehicles contributed to gridlock during storms and widespread power outages in San Francisco last month. The company has been refining its systems to better navigate during such circumstances and weather, Waymo said afterward.The company ended 2025 with its robotaxi service available in five major U.S. markets, including Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix and the San Francisco Bay Area.For 2026, Waymo has said it plans to expand to more U.S. markets, including Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington and Nashville, Tenn. The company is also testing in New York, Tokyo and London, and has also said it will launch its first overseas commercial service this year.In December, Waymo crossed 450,000 weekly paid rides, and the company said it had served 14 million trips in 2025. The company is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding, CNBC reported last month. The Alphabet company faces its most formidable competition from Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide in Asia, but Amazon's Zoox and Elon Musk's Tesla, along with startups like May Mobility and Nuro, are aiming to compete with Waymo in North America.— CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 taxis at Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from Boston on September 1, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSpirit Airlines is in talks with alternative investment firm Castlelake for a potential takeover as the discount airline looks for a path out of bankruptcy, CNBC has learned.Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last August for the second time in a year after its previous turnaround plan fell flat. Fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines had been in talks with Spirit over the years for a potential merger, including in recent months, but didn't secure a deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about the discussions. The two had reached a deal four years ago but it was called off after a surprise all-cash offer from JetBlue Airways.Spirit and Castlelake didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear if Spirit's bondholders and Castlelake would reach a deal or what form it could take. Minneapolis-based Castlelake has been active for years in aviation finance. In August, it announced it was launching a new aviation lending arm, Merit AirFinance, with $1.8 billion in deployable capital. Spirit in mid-December said it amended its agreement with creditors to receive another $50 million in funding immediately, a lifeline for the carrier. Further funding would be contingent on \"further progress on a standalone plan of reorganization or a strategic transaction,\" Spirit said Dec. 15. \"Spirit is currently in active negotiations on each of these possibilities,\" the company added.In its fight for survival, Spirit has slashed flights, reduced its fleet and cut jobs to save money. Unions last year agreed to pay cuts for the carrier's pilots and flight attendants. That amounted to $100 million in concessions, the Air Line Pilots Association said in a Jan. 13 open letter, urging bondholders to support Spirit's restructuring and avoid a liquidation.Dania Beach, Florida-based Spirit for years enjoyed largely steady profitability and enviable margins in the often-rocky airline industry. But things took a turn after the pandemic, when wages and other costs soared, customer preferences changed, and an oversupply of domestic flights drove down airfare. That was especially punishing for U.S.-focused carriers that don't enjoy a buffer from plush first-class cabins and large credit card and loyalty program deals.The carrier's problems snowballed after a Pratt & Whitney engine recall grounded dozens of its Airbus aircraft starting in 2023 and the planned acquisition by JetBlue was blocked two years ago by a federal judge who ruled it was anticompetitive, leaving both carriers to fend for themselves against a backdrop where larger carriers dominate.Spirit has been trying in recent years to win over higher-spending customers by offering roomier seats or bundled fares that include seat assignments and baggage, or allow for changes, to better compete with larger rivals whose profits have been buoyed big-spending customers post-pandemic.

He had met Trump in private shortly before his speech.\"Europe still feels more like geography, history, a tradition, not a real political force, not a great power,\" Zelenskyy added.\"Some Europeans are really strong, it's true, but many say 'we must stand strong', and they always want someone else to tell them how long they need to stand strong, preferably until the next election.\"watch nowZelenskyy also revealed there would be tri-lateral meetings in the UAE on Friday and Saturday involving Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S. He added the Russians \"have to be ready for compromises\" for the war to end.'Nothing has changed'In a week where the focus in Davos has been on U.S. threats to annex Greenland, its tariffs on European countries and a new Gaza \"Board of Peace,\" Zelenskyy began his speech saying Europe's inaction left his country feeling like it was living through \"Groundhog Day.\"Zelenskyy said: \"Just last year here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words, 'Europe needs to know how to defend itself.'

What message does it send? What's the message to Putin? To China?

    "body": "Packages of Pampers diapers are displayed at a Target store on June 05, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesProcter & Gamble is selling diapers made with silk fibers in China as part of the company's strategy to entice shoppers to spend more, even as demand for some of its products wanes.China is the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States. In both markets, P&G has turned to innovation, rather than discounts, to attract consumers who are otherwise trying to spend less at the grocery store. For example, last year, it unveiled a new formula for its liquid Tide detergent in the U.S. In China, P&G also faces another challenge: a record-low birth rate. Government data released on Monday showed that births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023. For P&G, fewer babies means that the company is selling fewer diapers. To boost the sales of its baby care division, P&G is leaning into luxury.Executives touted the success of the Pampers Prestige product on the company's earnings conference call on Thursday. It added silk fibers to the inside of the diaper for skin comfort and protection.\"Chinese parents want only the best for their baby,\" P&G CEO Shailesh Jejurikar said.He added that \"reframing\" the company's super-premium diaper line has fueled double-digit organic sales growth and a 3% market share increase for P&G's baby care business in Greater China over the last 18 months. The company did not share how the pricing of Pampers Prestige compares to its other diaper lines in China.In the latest quarter, P&G's overall baby care division reported single-digit organic sales declines, despite a 20% jump in organic sales in Greater China, according to CFO Andre Schulten.More broadly, the focus on innovation is paying off for P&G. Consumer sentiment in China is still negative, yet P&G saw 3% growth in the market in the latest quarter, Schulten said on a call with press on Thursday.Stateside, P&G's sales were weaker. Organic sales in North America fell 2% in its fiscal second quarter. P&G is hoping that the strategy that is working in China could soon pay off in the U.S. The current bifurcated — or \"K-shaped\" — economy has showed that wealthier Americans are still willing to flex their purchasing power, even as lower-income shoppers pull back. Shares of P&G rose more than 2% in morning trading on Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. However, the company's revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by weaker demand in the U.S.",

Gavin Newsom on Thursday showed off knee pads that he suggested were for leaders \"selling out\" to the Trump administration. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Newsom said the red knee pads were available to buy via a website he had created. \"The last round of knee pads sold out, just as our law firms are selling out. Many American universities are selling out, and yes, many corporate leaders are selling out to this administration,\" Newsom said.\"These are available in bulk, too,\" he said, holding up one of the knee pads, which showed U.S. President Donald Trump's signature.On Tuesday, Newsom accused world leaders of \"rolling over\" for Trump. \"I can't take this complicity of people rolling over,\" Newsom said in Davos. \"I should have brought a bunch of knee pads for all the world leaders,\" he said.A scheduled appearance by Newsom at USA House, described on its website as an \"official U.S. venue\" at Davos, was said to have been canceled on Wednesday soon after Trump addressed the forum. \"I was going to speak last night. It was a well established event at the USA house, a simple conversation, discussion after Trump's speech. They made sure that I didn't. They made sure it was canceled,\" Newsom said on Thursday.USA House is privately organized and does not represent the U.S. government. It is sponsored by large companies including Microsoft, Pfizer and blockchain company Ripple. Newsom is a potential 2028 Democratic presidential candidate and has previously sparred with Trump. ",

    "body": "People shop at a Costco store in the Staten Island borough of New York City, U.S., Jan. 16, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersInflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday.The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month both for headline and core, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices.The monthly figures showed a 0.2% increase for both months. The BEA released the October and November numbers together due to impacts from the government shutdown during which official agencies suspended data collection and reports.In addition to the inflation figures, the report showed personal income up 0.1% in October and 0.3% in November, the latter 0.1 percentage point below the forecast. Also, personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer spending, rose 0.5% in both months, matching the November forecast.The personal savings rate rose in November to 3.5%, down 0.2 percentage point from the prior month.Price figures for November reflected 0.2% increases in both goods and services. Food was flat while energy-related costs rose 1.9% and after falling 0.7% in October.The report comes the same day that the BEA said gross domestic product rose 4.4% in the third quarter, according to the second and final estimate. In addition, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims are trending around their lowest level in two years.Together, the data indicates an economy continuing to expand, with consumer spending ahead of inflation despite a somewhat softening labor market.\"The consumer continues to drive the U.S economy, with today's data pointing to another strong gain in spending. This resilience comes in spite of last year's slowdown in the labor market, and still elevated inflation, both of which have weighed on real incomes,\" said James McCann, senior economist for investment strategy at Edward Jones. \"Today's data should reassure the Fed that the economy remains on a solid footing, despite a cooler labor market.\"Markets expect the Federal Reserve to stay on hold at its policy meeting next week following three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025. Futures traders see at most two rate reductions this year as policymakers weigh the impact of last year's easing, coupled with continued inflation pressures and an uncertain geopolitical landscape.",

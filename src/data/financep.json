However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump gestures as he greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives for a meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 17, 2025.Tom Brenner | AFP | Getty ImagesUkraine's President Volodymr Zelenskyy said Monday that he has asked for up to 50 years' worth of security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the weekend.Commenting on the talks with Trump in Florida on Sunday, Zelenskyy told journalists that he said a meeting with Russia would only be possible after the president and European leaders had agreed on a framework peace deal for Ukraine. The comments, reported by Reuters on Monday, included Zelenskyy stating that he had asked for security guarantees for up to 50 years for Ukraine, but that the current 20-point peace plan envisaged guarantees — aimed at deterring future Russian aggression — for 15 years. Zelenskyy said he plans to meet with European leaders in the coming days to discuss the proposals. Any peace plan should be put to the Ukrainian people in a referendum, he added, noting that any vote to approve or reject the agreement should be held during a 60-day ceasefire. Zelenskyy said \"Russia clearly does not want a ceasefire for now\" after several days of heavy drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine's comments come after talks with Trump in Mar-a-Lago on Sunday. Trump said the discussions had gone well but acknowledged that \"one or two very thorny issues\" remained.\"I do think we're getting a lot closer, maybe very close,\" Trump told reporters after emerging from the talks.Meanwhile, Zelenskyy described the talks as a \"really great discussion\" in which security guarantees were \"100% agreed\" upon, but Trump gave a slightly lower estimate when asked about that part of the proposal.watch nowWhen asked by a reporter what issues remain unresolved, Trump said it was about \"the land.\"\"Some of that land has been taken,\" Trump said. \"Some of that land is maybe up for grabs, but it may be taken over the next period of a number of months, and you are better off making a deal now.\"Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede the eastern Donbas region to Russia and has rejected security guarantees for Kyiv so far. For its part, Ukraine has repeatedly rejected calls for the Donbas, which is mostly but not fully occupied by Russian forces, to be handed to Moscow. It's unclear whether Zelenskyy would meet face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a peace agreement was agreed in principle, with both leaders vehemently refusing to meet in the past. When asked to comment on the U.S.-Ukraine talks which followed that call, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, \"We don't know how they went. We can't judge. After these talks, the two presidents — I mean the President of Russia and the President of the United States — agreed to have a phone call again. Then we'll get the information.\"— CNBC's Hugh Son contributed reporting to this story.",

    "description": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headline",
    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

The public comment period ends Jan. 25.Beijing's planned rules would mark the world's first attempt to regulate AI with human or anthropomorphic characteristics, said Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU School of Law. The latest proposals come as Chinese companies have rapidly developed AI companions and digital celebrities.Compared with China's generative AI regulation in 2023, Ma said that this version \"highlights a leap from content safety to emotional safety.\"The draft rules propose that: AI chatbots cannot generate content that encourages suicide or self-harm, or engage in verbal violence or emotional manipulation that damages users' mental health.If a user specifically proposes suicide, the tech providers must have a human take over the conversation and immediately contact the user's guardian or a designated individual.The AI chatbots must not generate gambling-related, obscene or violent content.Minors must have guardian consent to use AI for emotional companionship, with time limits on usage.Platforms should be able to determine whether a user is a minor even if the user does not disclose their age, and, in cases of doubt, apply settings for minors, while allowing for appeals.watch nowAdditional provisions would require tech providers to remind users after two hours of continuous AI interaction and mandate security assessments for AI chatbots with more than 1 million registered users or over 100,000 monthly active users.The document also encouraged the use of human-like AI in \"cultural dissemination and elderly companionship.\"Chinese AI chatbot IPOsThe proposal comes shortly after two leading Chinese AI chatbot startups, Z.ai and Minimax, filed for initial public offerings in Hong Kong this month.Minimax is best known internationally for its Talkie AI app, which allows users to chat with virtual characters. The app and its domestic Chinese version, Xingye, accounted for more than a third of the company's revenue in the first three quarters of the year, with an average of over 20 million monthly active users during that time.Z.ai, also known as Zhipu, filed under the name \"Knowledge Atlas Technology.\" While the company did not disclose monthly active users, it noted its technology \"empowered\" around 80 million devices, including smartphones, personal computers and smart vehicles.Neither company responded to CNBC's request for comments on how the proposed rules could affect their IPO plans.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump, flanked by Navy Secretary John Phelan (R), announces the US Navy's new Golden Fleet initiative, unveiling a new class of frigates, at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, on December 22, 2025. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Dated 1941. (Photo by: Photo12/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Photo 12 | Universal Images Group | Getty Images\"Historically, we looked at battleships and the bigger the better... [and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center spaJames Cheung, partner at Mamou-ManiArtificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed, forcing a rethink of how the power-hungry servers behind the boom can coexist with — and draw less from — the environment.Data centers form the backbone of the internet, underpinnning nearly every digital service. But the facilities require huge amounts of energy and water, and are often considered an eyesore and a burden on the communities that house them. As more AI workloads are scaled into the facilities, the pressure on power supply chains will intensify.There's going to be a \"tipping point,\" where the architecture of data centers will no longer be fit for purpose, Simone Larsson, head of enterprise AI at Lenovo, told CNBC.In the face of a looming digital infrastructure crisis, tech giants and developers of the expensive infrastructure are exploring sustainable and out-of-the-box solutions.Data spas and villagesTraditional data centers are failing to efficiently power AI workloads and falling short of sustainability targets and compliance demands, according to the \"Data Center of the Future\" November study carried out by Lenovo in partnership with Opinium. The study found that the majority of IT decision makers prioritize technology partners who reduce energy, but only 46% of those surveyed said their current data center designs supported sustainability goals. In the face of those challenges, Lenovo has worked with architects from Mamou-Mani and engineers from AKT II to design data centers that can integrate better with the environment and address energy limitations. The outcome: designs that see data centers sequestered underground by utilizing disused tunnels or bunkers, or suspended in the air to make use of 24/7 energy from solar power.Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center bunker that utilizes disused tunnels or transport systems.James Cheung, Mamou-ManiIn so-called data villages, servers are stacked in a modular format near urban areas, allowing excess heat from the data centers to be transferred to power local amenities like schools or homes. The same goes for data center spas, which would see excess heat from data centers used in a wellbeing setting. The heat generated by the spa could in turn be repurposed to power cooling technology for the data center.But there's a catch: even Lenovo admits its designs will likely not be feasible until 2055 or later. The company said its study was designed to spark discussion and acknowledged that significant regulatory changes would be required before any such designs could be deployed. The cost and engineering complexity of some of the concepts, as well as legal and scalability constraints, also present challenges.Adoption would also vary widely by region. The U.S., for example, is more likely to adopt large-scale, ultra-high-density campuses due to high demand, more available land, and a relatively flexible regulatory environment, said Perkins Liu, senior research analyst at S&P Global's 451 Research. Meanwhile, Europe has a more constrained grid and stricter regulations, he said.That's not to say that novel data center designs are an entirely new concept. In 2018, Microsoft deployed a submarine-like data center 117 feet below sea level to take advantage of the cooling benefits of seawater and tidal power to enable the project to be powered fully by renewable energy.There are also many examples of operators redistributing heat from the facilities to warm nearby residences. Last summer, excess heat from an Equinix data center was used to heat the Olympic swimming pools in Paris.Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagines the data centers of the future: a data center spaServers in spaceFrom Google's \"moonshot\" Suncatcher project, Alibaba and Zhejiang Lab's \"Three-Body Computing Constellation\" initiative, to Nvidia's Starcloud — the orbital data center race is heating up. Smaller players including Edge Aerospace and Loft Orbital are also exploring the tech.It might seem like the stuff of science fiction — and indeed, Google cites a short story from science fiction writer Isaac Asimov as inspiration for its idea to tap directly into the sun as a source of energy – but these proposals are being explored more concretely by tech giants.The EU-funded ASCEND study, in partnership with Thales Alenia Space, explored the feasibility of launching centers into orbit using robotic technologies.Thales Alenia Space is now developing the technology required for this process with the goal of conducting a first in-orbit demonstration mission in 2028. In November, Starcloud, the startup backed by Nvidia, sent a chip into outer space that's 100 times more powerful than any GPU compute that has been in space before.Around 70 million euros ($82 million) of private capital has been invested in space-based data center projects since 2020, according to a report from the European Space Policy Institute (ESPI). However, in the near term, orbital data centers remain out of reach as the cost of sending such equipment into space remains a significant barrier.\"Radiation-hardened hardware, cooling in the vacuum of space, and the extremely high cost of launching large, power-dense compute systems into orbit are major hurdles,\" said S&P Global's Liu. Challenges also include reliable high-speed communication, space debris, and the difficulties of maintenance, he said.ESPI's cost model for data centers depends on the success of Starship's launch price being as low as $10 million.\"If you asked me now, this is unrealistic in the near-term,\" said Jermaine Gutierrez, research fellow at ESPI. \"In the long run, however, the question is whether terrestrial developments and continued cost savings thereof, outpace the cost savings from deployment in space.\"'Faceless mega-juggernauts' Lenovo's Larsson said that its futuristic data center plans have co-existence and \"symbiosis\" at their core. This includes leveraging some of the heat from the data centers for use in the community and by other involved stakeholders.James Cheung, partner at Mamou-Mani, told CNBC that another goal was to make the facilities more visually appealing so that they aren't viewed as \"faceless mega-juggernauts of boxes.\" The Data Village involves a modular, stackable brick or pod system of data centers linked to city needs. Lenovo in partnership with AKT II and Mamou-Mani imagined the data centers of the future.James Cheung, partner at Mamou-ManiHe explained how the architects used techniques like biomimicry to explore how natural algorithms can show the most efficient ways to disperse heat.\"We interact with [data centers] every day, with our computers and with our phones. But this gentle giant, in the background, is putting massive pressure on water and our resources,\" he said.Future proofingIn order for many of these innovations to take place, experts told CNBC that regulation will need to be amended and new policies implemented to address the growing energy demands of AI and data centers.\"Data center operators could adopt green technologies at their wish, but it will have to be justified financially,\" said S&P Global's Liu. He added that the grid will need to be upgraded and renewable energy needs to be built out quickly for this to happen.watch nowSimply retrofitting data centers won't always work, said Lenovo's Larsson, as it leaves operators \"trying to enter into a cycle that's been broken to begin with.\"Instead, companies will need to think outside of the box and try to \"figure out what regulatory constraints would need to be flexed in order to not only serve the people on the planet but also the profits [of companies],\" she said.",

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confer during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing titled Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request for The Environmental Protection Agency, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "QTS's data center in Cambois, North East of EnglandWhen the U.K. announced its AI Opportunities Action Plan — a grand blueprint to deploy the tech across society — in January, Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared the strategy would make the country an \"AI superpower.\" One of the key pillars of this plan was a rapid buildout of data centres capable of providing the huge compute requirements for the rollout of AI. This would be driven by \"AI growth zones\" — designated areas with relaxed planning permission and improved access to power. Nearly one year on, and Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google have all committed billions of dollars to AI infrastructure in the country. Four AI growth zones have been unveiled, and homegrown startups like Nscale have emerged as key players in the space. But critics point to heavily restricted access to energy via the national grid and slow-moving buildouts as signs the country is at risk of lagging further behind global rivals in the AI race. \"Ambition and delivery are not yet aligned,\" Ben Pritchard, CEO of data center power supplier AVK, told CNBC. \"Growth has been held back largely by constraints around power availability. Grid bottlenecks, in particular, have slowed the pace of development and mean the U.K. is not yet deploying infrastructure quickly enough to keep pace with global competitors.\"Grid connection delaysIt is still early days in the U.K.'s AI infrastructure buildout as AI growth zones are currently in their initial phases of development.A site in Oxfordshire, the first to be announced in February, has yet to begin building work and is still considering delivery partner proposals. Ground preparation work has begun at one in the North East of England, announced in September, with formal building beginning early 2026.Two more sites, in North and South Wales were unveiled in November. The former is searching for an investment partner, which the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSIT) told CNBC it expects to be confirmed in the coming months. The latter is made up of a cluster of sites, some of which are already operational with additional construction work to be done on others, DSIT said. watch nowThe U.K. government said in July it was targeting a core group of AI growth zones serving at least 500 megawatts of demand by 2030, with at least one scaling to more than one gigawatt by that time.But the most serious challenge to realising those ambitions is the U.K.'s limited grid capacity, said Pritchard.\"Developers expect grid connection delays of eight to ten years, and the volume of outstanding connection requests, especially around London, is unprecedented,\" he told CNBC. AI workloads are also \"dramatically increasing energy demand\" as businesses and consumers begin to use the tech, putting additional pressure on a stretched energy system, Pritchard added. \"They are no longer isolated risks; they are actively slowing down or blocking developments across the country.\"The open call for applications for the AI growth zone initiative created a situation where landowners with pylons or powercables running across their land applied for the designation, said Kao Data's Spencer Lamb.\"This resulted in the national grid being inundated with power grid applications from speculative sources,\" with no realistic chance of success, he told CNBC.Laying the groundworkThe National Energy System Operator (Neso) — The U.K.'s public body responsible for managing the national grid — has made moves to fix the situation. Earlier this month it announced plans to prioritise hundreds of projects for faster access to the grid. Neso declined to comment on whether AI infrastructure projects were among those prioritised when asked by CNBC, but did say a significant portion were data centers.There have also been big money commitments from tech giants, many of which were paraded by the U.K. government in September.Microsoft, Nvidia, Google, OpenAI, CoreWeave and others announced billions of dollars of AI investment during U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, which involved plans to deploy the latest chips in the country and open new data centers. Homegrown startup Nscale, which provides access to AI compute and is building data centers, also announced deals to deploy tens of thousands of Nvidia chips at an AI factory just outside London by early 2027.Nvidia GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip is displayed at the company's GTC conference in San Jose, California, on March 19, 2025.Max A. Cherney | Reuters\"Investment from major private players has laid important groundwork,\" Puneet Gupta, general manager for the U.K. and Ireland at data infrastructure company NetApp, told CNBC. \"Momentum is also building around national research supercomputers and plans for new compute capacity, with commitments to build AI 'gigafactories' in the UK.\"But the \"real test\" will be how quickly those plans translate into usable compute for U.K. organisations, said Gupta.Avoiding an AI infrastructure 'sugar rush'The long-term success of the country's AI infrastructure buildout will require it to invest in the \"full stack,\" including data pipelines, storage, energy sourcing, security, talent and skills, Stuart Abbott, U.K. and Ireland's managing director at AI infrastructure company VAST Data, told CNBC. \"If the UK wants this to be durable rather than a one-year sugar rush, it has to treat AI infrastructure like economic infrastructure.\"Stuart AbbottU.K. and Ireland's managing director at AI infrastructure company VAST DataThat means \"developing an operational fabric that lets real institutions deploy AI safely at scale,\" he added. \"If the UK wants this to be durable rather than a one-year sugar rush, it has to treat AI infrastructure like economic infrastructure.\"The challenges are significant. The value of data center deals in Europe pales in comparison to sums funneled into projects in the U.S. The U.K. also currently has the costliest energy in Europe, which is around 75% higher than before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and legacy grid infrastructure which can take many years to connect to new sites.One potential solution for projects that are unable to secure access to the national grid are microgrids, AVK's Pritchard said. Microgrids are self-contained power networks from sources like engines, renewables and batteries. AVK is currently designing two microgrids for partners building cloud compute, though not for AI, in the U.K. They can take around three years to build and cost around 10% more than energy from the grid at the moment, according to Pritchard. Co-locating compute where power already exists, rather than \"forcing everything to be greenfield\" — the term for undeveloped sites — is also a way to get AI infrastructure up and running faster, VAST Data's Abbot said.The pace of implementation will be critical, Kao Data's Lamb told CNBC. \"Unless fundamental issues around energy availability and pricing, AI copyright and funding for AI developments are solved quickly, the U.K. will miss out on one of the most remarkable economic opportunities of our time and ultimately risks becoming an international AI backwater.\"",

    "body": "McDonald’s restaurant in San Diego, California, U.S., Oct. 31, 2025.   Mike Blake | Reuters\"Value\" was the buzzword du jour for restaurant executives that lasted all year — and it will likely stick around in 2026, too.Over the last year and a half, diners, particularly those who make less than $40,000 a year, have been eating out less frequently and spending less money when they do. Higher costs, like rent and child care, have put pressure on consumers' wallets. Plus, uncertainty about the economy, President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, layoff fears and immigration crackdowns have all hurt their willingness to spend. As diners strain under pressures on their wallets, restaurants, takeout and food delivery is the category where discretionary spending is most likely to fall, according to the EY-Parthenon U.S. Consumer Sentiment Survey. Nearly a quarter of respondents said that they would first cut spending on eating out, ahead of entertainment, travel and home maintenance. It's no surprise, then, that data from Black Box Intelligence shows that traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month this year through November, with one exception: July. That month, guest count ticked up 0.1%.To win back a shrinking pool of diners, restaurants have responded by doubling down on efforts to offer diners more \"value.\" In the fast-food segment, that means combo meals and value menus. For casual-dining chains, value has translated into appetizer deals, marketing that compares the narrowing price gap with fast food, and a focus on the in-restaurant experience. And fast-casual chains have responded by emphasizing their quality while trying to stay away from the so-called value wars.\"This is the most intense discount environment since the Great Recession,\" Cava co-founder and CEO Brett Schulman said on the company's earnings conference call in November.McDonald's value pushTo understand the industry's evolving value strategy, look no further than McDonald's, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales and often a bellwether for the consumer economy. The burger giant briefly became the poster child for higher fast-food prices in 2024, leading the company to make a rare public rebuttal against social media posts claiming that its prices had more than doubled since 2019. But that didn't stop consumers from viewing its prices as too high, which put the company on the defensive. In 2024, it launched a $5 value meal in the U.S. in a bid to attract the low-income consumers who had been cutting back on their visits.As the value gap closed between casual-dining chains like Chili's and fast-food restaurants, McDonald's and its peers haven't benefitted from the spending pullback the way they typically would when consumer spending falls, according to Moody's analyst Michael Zuccaro. This year, McDonald's further stepped up its emphasis on value. It extended the $5 value meal months longer than expected and added a buy one, get one for $1 deal for select menu items in January. In September, the chain brought back its Extra Value Meals, which save customers 15% on combo meals compared with buying the entree, fries and drink separately.The chain's efforts have succeeded in winning back some customers, plus attracting new diners. In the third quarter, it reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 2.4%.\"I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low-income [consumers],\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call in early November. \"But value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income, feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\"Plus, McDonald's has other promotions that also seem to offer value. The chain is currently offering a Grinch Meal, which comes with an entree, dill pickle McShaker fries, a drink and collectible socks. \"This time of year, you've got promotional things that you can do that really promotes value. You can get a free pair of socks,\" said Jay Bandy, president of Goliath Consulting Group, which has worked with Church's Chicken and Zaxby's, among others.McDonald's fast-food rivals have followed its lead, offering their own more sophisticated value options for price-conscious customers. For example, Yum Brands' Taco Bell followed up the introduction of its $7 Luxe Cravings boxes in 2024 by adding $5 and $9 versions earlier this year.\"The numbers that I've seen is [Taco Bell has] converted a lot of their customers to the higher-price boxes, and that's what you want. If you can't grow your traffic, you're getting them to stop spending $7 and start spending $9,\" Technomic analyst Rich Shank told CNBC.Broadly, operators have to balance discounts that will attract customers with the razor-thin margins common in the industry. Usually that means companies offer value items that get customers into the drive-thru lane, and then dangle tantalizing enough options as an add-on, whether it's a McFlurry or a premium entree.\"It's hard to sell things in the [quick-service restaurant] world for $5 and make your margins,\" Bandy said. \"Those chains are hoping that somebody in the car is also ordering a full price value meal at $9 so they can balance it out, so that's part of the strategy there.\"McDonald's, which franchises about 95% of its restaurant footprint, has helped its operators offset the hit to their margins by chipping in with corporate marketing support and co-investing in the discounts on the Extra Value Meals. Longtime partner Coca-Cola contributed marketing funds as well, making the deals more attractive to franchisees.\"McDonald's offering subsidies to franchisees is definitely unusual, and [it shows] that they have high conviction that what they're doing is really going to help repair the value perception to lead to a healthier trajectory as we get to 2026 on same-store sales,\" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles told CNBC. Heading into 2026, McDonald's will stop providing corporate support to its franchisees by the end of the first quarter, CFO Ian Borden told analysts in early November. Just as corporate support dries up, the company will start holding franchisees accountable for the value that they offer diners at their restaurants. Operators will still have the ability to set their own prices, but new franchising standards will assess if operators' prices are too high, particularly if it is affecting their restaurants' traffic or customer satisfaction scores. In other words, after more than year offering the carrot to operators, now comes the proverbial stick. The only thing that isn't changing about the strategy is the focus on value.Fast-casual's strugglesA customer carries a Chipotle bag in San Francisco, California, US, on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile fast food has aimed to compete on price, the fast-casual segment has largely stayed out of the value wars this year, to the detriment of sales.Cava, Sweetgreen and Chipotle Mexican Grill all reported underwhelming results for the last two quarters. Executives blamed younger consumers who have pulled back on spending. The demographic has a higher unemployment rate than the broader population, plus student loan repayments resumed in the spring, putting more pressure on their wallets. And as the pool of diners has shrunk, fast-casual chains have faced increasing pricing competition from both fast food and casual-dining chains. \"Fast casual has followed quick-service's playbook in 2025. What I mean by that is that they focus on limited-time offering, they focus on increased advertising, they focus on speed of service. But the last tenet of quick service that fast casual has not yet followed is value. And I think a lot are going to try to avoid it as long as they can,\" said Charles.For most fast-casual chains, the only widely available discount is on their stock price.Cava's Schulman, for example, flatly said on the company's latest earnings call that the Mediterranean chain isn't planning to get into discounts.Chipotle has similarly resisted any calls for discounts, although recent promotions like its \"Unwrap Extra\" series timed for the holiday season offer buy-one, get-one deals. Executives have instead leaned into emphasizing the chain's quality and relative value.\"We are still a 20% to 30% discount to our fast-casual peers in the sector,\" Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright said on the company's conference call in late October.Sweetgreen has become the outlier. The salad chain is planning to target infrequent members of its rewards programs with discounts. Earlier this month, it rolled out a 'Tis the Seasoned Harvest Bowl with Blackened Chicken that's only $10 for loyalty members, a discount of roughly $6. But it is more difficult for fast-casual chains to compete in the value wars. For one, the category, best known for its so-called slop bowls, doesn't have the same obvious value items as other restaurant segments. Casual-dining can discount appetizers, while fast food can throw in a free cheeseburger. Plus, once chains start leaning into lower prices, it can be difficult to stop because customers expect the deals and aren't willing to pay full price. For now, most fast-casual restaurant executives seem unwilling to take the hit to their profit margins.\"I think it's getting more difficult for fast casual to show value, because then they're pushing down to [quick-service restaurant] prices, and they can't afford to,\" Goliath's Bandy said.Panera Bread is one fast-casual chain that is trying to crack the value code. The privately held chain is working on a barbell menu strategy, which offers diners options on both the low- and high-price end. Still, Panera CEO Paul Carbone told CNBC in November that the chain hadn't yet cracked the code.The winners in valueAn aerial view of a Chili's restaurant on December 13, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile restaurants are still waging the value wars, at least one early winner has emerged.Brinker International's Chili's has reported double-digit same-store sales and traffic growth every quarter of the calendar year. The casual-dining chain's unlikely comeback follows a successful turnaround led by CEO Kevin Hochman and savvy, well-timed marketing that positioned its $10.99 Big Smasher meal against fast-food prices. The virality of its Triple Dipper promotion further fueled the chain's soaring sales growth.Chili's has succeeded in luring high-income diners to its restaurants who are trading down from the fine-dining segment. But the chain is also gaining market share with customers who make less than $60,000 a year, showing that its value messaging is resonating across a broad swath of consumers.Then there's Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and other well-known full-service chains. The restaurant company has been raising its menu prices by levels less than the rate of inflation and leaning into promotions, like Olive Garden's popular Never Ending Pasta Bowl and a $55 three-course meal at Ruth's Chris. Darden has also been rolling out the option of smaller portions at a lower price for select menu items at Olive Garden; the company isn't planning on promoting the lighter portions menu for fear of sales cannibalization, but it is improving the chain's affordability scores.Thanks to all of those efforts, Darden is seeing high-income consumers trade down into its casual-dining chains and a traffic bump from diners who are at least 55 years old, CEO Rick Cardenas said on the company's conference call on Thursday. Darden's same-store sales increased 4.3% in its latest fiscal quarter, and every restaurant division reported same-store sales growth. Still, investors haven't rewarded their success; the stock has risen just 1% so far this year. TD Cowen's Charles named Burger King and Taco Bell as two of his winners — largely because they didn't have to lean on value to same extent to report domestic same-store sales growth that topped McDonald's results.\"I think that value is really a losing track, just given the fact that you're doing lower margin, you're degrading the brand. It's not really the best strategy that restaurants can go with,\" he said.Where are the value wars headed?For now, it looks unlikely that most restaurants will ditch their value-focused strategy, although they will face more challenges ahead.Economists aren't expecting any sudden improvements in the economy. Costs — particularly beef — are still rising, which means restaurants will have to choose between preserving their profit margins by hiking menu prices or holding onto customers. And the value wars will likely intensify, particularly in January, when diners are trying to stick to New Year's resolutions, adhere to stricter budgets or stay warm during winter storms. The seasonal traffic dip in January and February could be even steeper this year, thanks to inflation, the uncertain job market and other economic uncertainties, Technomic's Shank said. Moody's has a negative outlook for the overall restaurant industry, Zuccaro said, citing declining traffic and higher labor and commodity costs.\"While inflation has eased, it's not coming down,\" he said. \"Beef is going to take some time.\"Plus, the consumer mindset has changed. For years, Technomic has tracked consumers' stance on the components of value. Traditionally, price fell below quality and service. But now, those components are all about even.\"It's certainly a price-point driven market,\" Shank said.Even value winners like Chili's and Darden won't be able to rest on their laurels in the new year. Zuccaro anticipates that the chains that have done well will be under pressure to keep up their results, particularly as underperformers steal from their playbooks and attempt to win back their market share.\"The whole pie is not growing, and it's just a matter of the companies being able to do all these things right to get their slice — and get a bigger slice of it,\" he said.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 1,400 U.S. flights were canceled and 11,000 were delayed over the weekend after a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S., putting carriers to the test during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Snowfall totals in the area were less than the earlier forecast, though New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey each recorded more than four inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.More than 130 flights, about a fifth of the scheduled departures from Kennedy Airport, were canceled, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. Another 87 were canceled from New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 20% of the day's scheduled departures, and 72, or 12%, of departures from Newark were scrubbed.Airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights on Friday, most of them ahead of the storm. Nearly 400 U.S. flights were canceled for Sunday, according to FlightAware. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers last week waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets. They said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said. Flying as early as possible is likely the best bet with few seats available during the busy Christmas week.Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, expects carriers to fly a record 52.6 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 5, with this Friday and Sunday among the busiest days.Airlines generally cancel flights ahead of time for major weather events in the forecast, like blizzards or hurricanes, to avoid planes, connecting travelers and crews from getting stranded and worsening disruptions.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport lounges",

    "body": "Mixmike | E+ | Getty ImagesMany student loan borrowers have hit a repayment obstacle: the U.S. Department of Education denied their application to switch into a new payment plan.The department rejected 327,955 borrower requests to be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan in August alone, according to a Dec. 15 court filing. The denials mean many of these borrowers may remain stuck in their prior repayment plan with a higher monthly payment, or in an interest-accruing forbearance. As of the end of November, another 802,730 IDR plan applications remain pending with the Education Department. Millions of student loan holders rely on IDR plans to afford their payments and eventually, to emerge from their debt. The plans cap borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income, and lead to debt cancellation after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. Those pursuing the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which leads to debt erasure for public servants after a decade, also typically need to be enrolled in an IDR plan. Consumer advocates said they were alarmed by the number of denials.\"This could cause further delays — losing out on qualifying months for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and IDR cancellation — and many of these borrowers will wind up paying a higher amount each month,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The teacher's union, which represents nearly 2 million members, filed a lawsuit against the administration in March, accusing it of depriving student loan borrowers of their rights. Protect Borrowers served as AFT's legal counsel.Here's what to know about the recent IDR plan application denials — and what to do next if it happened to you. Why some IDR applications were rejected The Education Department said in the court filing that it rejected the hundreds of thousands of IDR applications because of an \"unforeseen ambiguity\" about which repayment plan the borrowers should have been enrolled in.  These federal student loan holders had requested to be put in the plan with \"the lowest monthly payment,\" according to the filing. But Trump officials said two plans result in an equal monthly bill. \"In response, ED opted to procedurally deny such applications,\" the agency said in the court document.Yu said the Trump administration's reasoning did not follow established guidelines. \"The IDR application anticipated two possible repayment plans with equal payment amounts and provided a plan for such a case,\" Yu said. In these situations, there is a ranking of IDR plans the Education Department is supposed to follow, she added. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz also said he questioned the Trump officials' explanation. \"The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak,\" Kantrowitz said. What borrowers should do next The difficulty accessing an affordable student loan repayment plan comes at an already trying time for borrowers. More than 5 million student loan holders are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Education Department confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday that it will begin garnishing the wages of borrowers in default on student loans in early January. The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak.Mark Kantrowitz higher education expertIf your application for an IDR plan was rejected, file a new request as soon as possible, said Kantrowitz.Borrowers should select a specific plan on their application, \"partly because the borrower should make an informed decision,\" Kantrowitz said, and also because of the recent denials related to ambiguity over which plan has the lowest monthly payment. The Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan is now defunct, after a court blocked the program. And President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out some other IDR plans.As a result, the best current option for many borrowers is the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, Kantrowitz said. Under the terms of IBR, borrowers pay 10% of their discretionary income each month — though that share rises to 15% for certain borrowers with older loans.There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans.You can submit a request for an IDR plan at StudentAid.gov.",

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

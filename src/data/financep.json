    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks during the 2025 National Retirement Summit in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, March 12, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently opened up about his phone habits at work, including never reading text messages and having his phone notifications turned off.\"I don't have notifications,\" the finance boss told CNN's Erin Burnett in an interview. \"If you sent me a text during the day, I probably do not read it.\"He added: \"The only notifications I get is from my kids. That's it. When they text me, I get that.\"The 69-year-old revealed that he doesn't carry his phone around with him all the time and prioritizes deep focus at work.\"When I'm walking around the building and going to meetings, I don't have it on me. It's in my office,\" he said. \"When I go to my meetings, I did the pre-reads and I'm 100% focused on us, what you're talking about, why you're talking about it, as opposed to I'm distracted and I'm thinking about other things.\"Dimon has previously aired his gripes about poor meeting etiquette and said at Fortune's Most Powerful Women Summit in October that using phones in meetings is \"disrespectful\" and \"wastes time.\"\"If you have an iPad in front of me and it looks like you're reading your email or getting notifications, I'll tell you to close the damn thing,\" he said at the time.He explained that meetings should have a purpose and that checking emails and getting distracted are red flags.Working from homeDimon has remained critical of some of the newest shifts in the workplake brought about by the youngest generation at work: Gen Z. Dimon has adhered to more traditional ways of working, often expecting his employees to do the same.Earlier this year, JPMorgan Chase's CEO went on a rant in a leaked audio recording, to JPMorgan employees about working from home and phone usage in meetings after workers complained about having to return to the office five days a week.Dimon told them to quit saying he was concerned about the \"damage\" that work from home was doing to younger recruits.\"Don't give me this s--- that work-from-home Friday works ... I call a lot of people on Fridays, and there's not a goddamn person you can get a hold of ... I've had it with this kind of stuff,\" he said in the recording.\"They're here, they're there, the Zooms [Gen Z], and the zoomers don't show up ... That's not how you run a great company.\"He even took a shot at managers in the call saying they were abusing the privilege of working from home to slack off. When on Zoom, managers were looking at their mail, sending texts and not paying attention, Dimon said. \"And if you don't think that slows down efficiency, creativity, creates rudeness – it does,\" he added.Work etiquetteAnastasia Dedyukhina, a digital wellbeing expert, previously told CNBC Make It that frequently checking your smartphone reduces the quality of your conversations with friends and colleagues. A 2023 survey by Reviews.org found that Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day.She explained that even just a having a phone near you can be extremely distracting. Using a phone could also leave a bad impression on managers and colleagues and is bad working etiquette.\"I would also keep thinking about it because for our minds, a smartphone and the sound of a smartphone is a highly attractive stimuli. So when I hear my phone ringing and make a notification, for my mind, it's the same as if you were calling me by my name,\" Dedyukhina said.That's why Harvard University associate professor Alison Wood Brooks formerly shared with CNBC Make It that it's important to focus in meetings as it makes you appear smarter and more likable. This includes asking follow up questions and paraphrasing and repeating what the other person said back to them.",

    "body": "Traditional job interview methods that have a candidate tell, rather than show, their strengths may be responsible for employers \"missing diamonds in the rough,\" says Adam Grant. Instead, he says, interviewers should try incorporating two steps to assess a candidate's true potential and fit for the job.Grant, a bestselling author and organizational psychologist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, shared tips for improving the interview process while speaking at WOBI's World Business Forum in New York City on Nov. 5.He cited research that \"how well somebody does a job is not indicated by how the first interview goes, it's how much growth they show from the first interview to the second.\"Of course, hiring teams don't always have the time or resources to give everyone a second chance if they flub the first interview. But Grant shared an alternative that still affords candidates a do-over without requiring the hiring team carve out time for another interview.\"Even if you could pause an interview halfway and say, 'Hey, I've got a couple of notes for you,' and then watch the motivation and ability to grow from the first attempt to the second, that is a great window into is somebody excited to get better and also do they have the capability to learn the skills that you're trying to get them to excel at.\"Besides giving feedback and a chance to improve if candidates have a rocky start, Grant includes a task in the interview that's part of the actual job to see a person's skills and potential in action.'I have been guilty of this'Grant shared a personal anecdote of how he almost missed out on hiring a top performer because of his own approach to interviewing applicants. Before becoming an organizational psychologist, he led an advertising team and was hiring salespeople. He recalled one candidate who seemed to be \"the worst fit for sales imaginable\" based on his resume.Grant was desperate to fill the role so he interviewed the applicant regardless, but remained unimpressed. He told the company's president the candidate wouldn't be good for the role because he never made eye contact during the 45-minute interview.\"I didn't know a thing about neurodivergence then,\" Grant noted.The company's president responded, \"You realize this is a phone sales job, right? There is no eye contact in this job.\"Grant suddenly realized he'd been so focused on confirming his belief that the candidate was a poor fit, and he learned a lesson.\"I realized I had to reboot our hiring process,\" he said. \"If you want to gauge somebody's potential, the best thing you can do is actually give them a challenge that's really part of the job and watch how they handle it.\"So he brought all of the candidates back and asked them to sell him a rotten apple. Grant chose that because all of the candidates would be familiar with an apple, so it would level the playing field, and because \"if you could get me excited about a rotten apple, you could definitely sell our products,\" he said.The candidate Grant had frowned upon before dove right in with his sales pitch.\"This may look like a rotten apple; it's actually an aged, antique apple,\" Grant recalled him saying. \"You know the saying 'An apple a day keeps the doctor away?' Well, because of the nutrients in the aging process, you only need to eat one of these a week. And then afterwards you can plant the seeds in your backyard.\"Though Grant joked he had \"some serious honesty and integrity questions\" about the candidate, he hired him, and the man ended up being the best salesperson on the team.\"What I learned from that story was not just that I needed to see him in action to gauge his potential,\" Grant said. \"But also, I needed to give him a do-over.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A recent string of high-profile layoffs have taken up headlines and caused anxiety in the workforce.Companies announced 153,074 layoffs in October, adding up to 1.1 million cut announcements for the year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. That makes it the worst year for layoff notices since 2009, CNBC reported.But job experts say they're not in panic mode. Layoff news doesn't paint the whole picture of the job market. Private data around job openings, payrolls and employee sentiment show that hiring is cooling but \"not falling off a cliff,\" says Glassdoor chief economist Daniel Zhao.The Challenger monthly data can be volatile, for one, and layoff announcements haven't yet shown up in state-level weekly filings for unemployment benefits, which are still being released during the shutdown.\"I'm not alarmed,\" says Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research. The latest available data \"does not seem today to indicate that we're going into a high layoff period for the overall economy.\"Government shutdown and layoffs are hitting worker confidenceWhile economists aren't predicting a recession anytime soon, news of layoffs and the government shutdown is hitting worker confidence.The share of Glassdoor reviews mentioning layoffs is up 22% year-over-year as of October, according to data from the jobs site. Workers' confidence in the job market is down from a small rise in September and is close to a recent record-low set in June, according to Glassdoor data.Senior-level employees saw the biggest drops in confidence over the last year, dropping 4.6 percentage points since October 2024.That's concerning since leadership confidence spreads to other employees through hiring and investment plans. If senior leaders aren't confident their business is doing well, they could decide to reduce hiring or lay people off, Zhao says.Meanwhile, for those on the market, fewer people say they've gotten a job offer and declined it, signaling they have less leverage and might be settling for jobs rather than holding out for better ones, according to Glassdoor data.Health-care openings are making up for losses elsewhereMany workers are additionally competing for a smaller pool of opportunities. As of Oct. 31, job postings on Indeed are at their lowest level since 2021, continuing a declining trend for the last four years.Job postings are lowest in areas hit by the government shutdown, including Washington, D.C., and recent tech layoffs, like California and Washington.Openings are concentrated in health-care sectors, security and safety, and engineering, which on the whole are keeping the job market stable.\"I see it a tale of two economies,\" Ullrich says. \"There are certain fields where jobs are continuing to be added, and there's others that are shedding jobs.\"Health care and private education jobs have propped up the labor economy for some time: They make up about 17% of the jobs nationally but have accounted for 56% of job growth between July 2023 and July 2025.\"If health-care employment started dipping that would ring alarm bells for me,\" Ullrich says.The bigger picture: 'The job market is in a funk'Economists say available datasets can provide a pretty good picture of the job market, but official data from the Labor Department around hiring and unemployment are necessary for a best look at the health of the labor economy.The unemployment rate remained steady 4.3% in August, the last month of available government data.The Bureau of Labor Statistics missed another jobs report Friday due to the government shutdown. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect it would have shown a drop in 60,000 jobs and a rising unemployment rate to 4.5%, CNBC reported.The numbers we do have point overall to a continuously slowing job market. Economic uncertainty is weighing on employers' willingness to hire, Zhao says, meaning job-seekers are frozen out of the market and employed workers have less leverage to progress in their careers, win raises and stay engaged in the workplace.Hiring experts say building your network and asking for referrals are the best ways to get a job right now. To stand out in a competitive market, consider sharpening your resume to be outcomes-based, building your personal brand on LinkedIn and doing mock interviews, GrowthLoop senior recruiter Kathleen Nolan previously told CNBC Make It.\"Overall, I would say that the job market is in a funk right now,\" Zhao says. \"Even if unemployment is even [and] some of the top line indicators still point to a job market that is not historically bad, that doesn't necessarily mean that people are happy with where the job market is today.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Kai Yang Chan (left) and JiaYi Zhou (right) run Singapore-based bakery Cake Inspiration.Courtesy of Cake InspirationWhen Kai Yang Chan and Jiayi Zhuo matched on Tinder at age 19, neither of them expected that it would lead to marriage. Six years later, not only have they tied the knot — they're also business partners.\"I downloaded Tinder because I was very bored in school, so I was just [swiping] through during class,\" said Zhuo. \"Both of us — we didn't expect that we'd get together,\" she said.\"Personality wise, we are quite different,\" she said, adding that while she is more introverted, her husband is the life of the party.Today, Chan and Zhuo run Singapore-based bakery CakeInspiration. Their business brought in over 850,000 Singapore dollars (about $650,000) in 2024, and is on track to surpass $775,000 in revenue this year, according to documentation reviewed by CNBC Make It.The company is known for its custom cake designs, and its clientele includes family offices, hospitals and even global celebrities.A family affairCakeInspiration originally began as a home-based bakery in 2010, run by Zhuo's parents.\"My parents actually started [the business] when I was nine,\" said Zhuo. \"I was never very studious, but I really like being hands on. So I like to bake, I like to dance. I like to create all these little pretty things,\" she said. From the early days of the business, she often helped with designing cakes.Then, when the pandemic hit, sales stalled and the business began to burn through cash to stay afloat. With her parents contemplating retirement, Zhuo knew it was time for her to step in.Courtesy of CakeInspiration\"I [felt] that it's a waste to just let it go. I [saw] my parents work like 16 hours a day growing up, so ... I [didn't] want the business to get shut down,\" she said.In 2020, Zhuo officially joined her parent's business and expanded the company's product range. She eventually introduced two new brands — Eggyi.Co, which sells bento cakes, or mini, single-serving sized cakes targeted at Gen-Z, and Petissier which sells customised cakes for pets.The introduction of these two brands ultimately helped to save the family's business through Covid, said Zhuo. Today, their prices range from about $100 to $10,000 per order, and they have a staff of about 14 people across two kitchens — one for human cakes, and one for pet cakes.Shooting for the starsSimilar to Zhuo, Chan's passions lied outside of academics growing up.\"I wasn't really the most studious person, [but] I always loved the idea of entrepreneurship and doing our own thing,\" said Chan. \"Since I was 16, I did my own little startups, selling whatever. [I sold] sneakers, I'd buy them, clean them up and sell them. You know, whatever that can make money, I'll do it,\" he said.In 2022, he decided to join his wife in the family business full-time. He introduced a new strategy: rather than only selling directly to individual consumers (B2C), he suggested trying to sell to other businesses (B2B) to create a more consistent source of revenue.In addition, he was focused on building the company's brands online. Along with working to build a presence across social media platforms, Chan started targeting celebrities and influencers who came into town.A custom made cake for social media influencers, the Ha Sisters, by CakeInspiration.Courtesy of CakeInspirationIn June, three Korean-American content creators — sisters Evelyn, Erica and Emily Ha — were in Singapore for a beauty store pop-up event. When Chan discovered they were in town, he saw an opportunity to surprise them with a cake.\"It's actually quite crazy, because they were in Singapore for this beauty store pop-up... They posted a story of them in a hotel, and I thought: 'Hey, this looks really familiar. I know [which] hotel this is,'\" he said. \"So I just prepared a cake and then we just zoomed down to the hotel.\"Chan and his team quickly made a custom cake for the sisters and timed the delivery to coincide with the end of the Ha sisters' event. \"Of course, after the pop-up, you have to go back to [the hotel to] change, right? Yeah. So [that's when I] went there,\" he said.By chance, his timing was perfect. Just as he arrived at the hotel entrance with the cake in hand, he ran into the sisters — and managed to hand-deliver the surprise. One of the Ha sisters later shared a video of the cake to social media, which ultimately reached over 500,000 views.This interaction kicked off the company's celebrity marketing strategy. To date, CakeInspiration has also delivered custom cakes to K-Pop band BlackPink's Lisa, Russell Simmons, G-Dragon and more.Despite popular advice to avoid working with your partner, for Chan and Zhuo, working together as a couple has actually been a big advantage. While Chan is best at partnerships, marketing and anything external-facing, Zhuo is best at managing day-to-day operations and all things internal.\"We don't have conflicts about work because our roles are very defined ... So usually I don't tell her how to run things inside, and she doesn't really tell me how to run things outside. I guess we trust each other to fulfill our roles to the best of our abilities,\" said Chan.Want to be your own boss? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders.

    "body": "Everyone who knows me knows that I can't stand owing money. I pay down my credit cards every month, and I complete Venmo requests the second I get them.The only debt I have left is my student loan, which has been on minimum payment autopilot since I graduated from college in 2013. For many years, I left those payments on the back burner, funneling any extra savings I had toward my investments.Recently, though, my financial strategy changed after my fiancé and I began planning for a wedding in summer 2027. I sold a fair amount of stock and dialed back my retirement contributions in order to build our wedding fund.For the first time in my life, I'm sitting on a pile of cash. And I have to say, I'm very tempted to use a chunk of it to wipe out my loan.Hear me out. My student debt carries an interest rate of 6.55% and is scheduled to be paid off in late 2027. If I paid my loan off now, I could take my monthly loan payment, plus a few extra dollars, tack it on to my regular contributions to the wedding fund, and still hit our funding goal on time. Plus, I'd be debt-free.I chatted with a few certified financial planners, and pretty much everyone agreed that the math works in my favor.\"If you have the funds available, paying off the loans first is a smart move,\" says MaryAnne Gucciardi, a CFP with Wealthmind Financial Planning. \"That's a guaranteed 6.55% 'return,' which is higher than what you're likely earning in even the best high-yield savings account.\"So as you're reading this, I've already paid the loan off, right? Well, no. I actually decided against it. Here's why.My decision to hold off on repaying my loan, for nowThe mathematical principle Gucciardi points out is an important one that applies to a broad array of situations in personal finance. Paying down a loan with a particular interest rate is equivalent to earning an annualized return on an investment.It's a quick and dirty way to decide how to prioritize your financial goals. If you have credit card debt at 20% — currently right around the average, according to Bankrate — paying it down is like earning 20% a year in the stock market. Because that's a figure your portfolio is unlikely to earn on a long-term basis, the thinking goes, you're better off prioritizing the debt.The same logic applies to my loan. The 3.4% annual percentage yield we're earning in our savings account falls short of the 6.55% I owe on my loans.The cost of making such a move, Gucciardi and others pointed out to me, is liquidity. Once I make the lump sum payment, I won't be able to go to my student loan servicer and ask for my money back. Catching up by the time of our wedding date is as easy as redirecting the freed-up cash from my student loan payment to put toward the wedding fund. But a lot could go wrong between now and then.What if I lose my job? Or one of us needs expensive medical treatment? Or elements of our wedding end up costing much more than we budgeted for? I have emergency savings, but a few things going wrong could make what looked really easy on paper into something really hard in real life.So I did some more math. I've paid off 81% of my student debt, meaning that the vast majority of my payment these days goes toward paying down the principal rather than the interest. By my calculations, paying the loan now, instead of continuing with minimum payments, would save me somewhere between $400 and $500 in interest.\"That net difference is the price of financial flexibility,\" says Sean Pearson, a CFP with Ameriprise Financial Services. \"It's the price of doing the things that you want to do that are the most important to you when you need to get them done.\"To be clear, my financial priorities might not be the same as yours, and it's worth discussing your own goals with a financial advisor. Right now, the wedding is the most important thing I'm saving money for. I want it be everything my fiancé and I envision, and I want our (frankly, too many) guests to have an amazing time. Having the extra cash on hand in case anything comes up is worth paying my student loan servicer an extra $400.It's a lesson I'm applying to my broader financial life too. While certain financial strategies are mathematically optimal, they may not fit within my particular set of goals.\"While imperfect, the best solution is often to make a budget that allows you to reach your priorities when they exist on your timeline and remember that the calendar is as important to your financial plan as your calculator,\" Pearson says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "For millions of Americans, it is an uncertain time.Amazon, General Motors and Paramount have all been making layoffs, and U.S.-based employers announced 153,074 job cuts in October altogether, according to research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.The government shutdown has also left hundreds of thousands of workers without pay, millions of SNAP recipients without funds to feed themselves and their families, and now thousands of travelers with reduced flight options.There are ways to cope that don't exacerbate the financial anxiety you might be feeling. For example, financial therapist Aja Evans recommends leaning into self-care activities that cost little to no money, like going outside and spending time with family and friends.But there's a mindset shift people can make as well.Instead of experiencing uncertainty as an anomaly, remember that \"uncertainty is fundamental reality,\" says best-selling author and wellness guru Deepak Chopra. \"Every moment we breathe, live and move in uncertainty, pretending that it's certainty.\"Start with the presumption that life is uncertain.Deepak ChopraWellness guru, authorThe 79-year-old recently launched a wellness platform offering various meditations, live digital sessions with him and a Deepak Chopra AI chatbot drawing from his decades of writing and talks that users can interact with directly.Instead of thinking of uncertainty as an inhibitor in your life, think of it as a chance to try something new. \"In every uncertain event,\" says Chopra, \"there is the seed for a greater opportunity and creativity.\"That creativity can lead to fresh problem solving in whatever difficult circumstance you're facing and solutions you haven't considered before.Creativity is \"a new story, a new paradigm, a new way of dealing with relationships, new context and new meaning,\" he says.When you feel that anxiety creeping in about an unclear future, \"start with the presumption that life is uncertain,\" says Chopra. \"When you start with that, you welcome the unknown.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "In 2020, Anita Kinoshita, 28 years old at the time, started looking into buying a house.Kinoshita was living in California and making around $70,000 a year as a software engineer for the Department of Defense.As a first-generation American from a farming family in Mexico, Kinoshita believed the best way to finally achieve the American dream her family had for her was to own property.\"I had my first big girl job and thought the next responsible thing to do would be to buy a house,\" Kinoshita tells CNBC Make It. \"I didn't necessarily want to buy a house. In fact, I was trying to figure out how to finesse the purchase.\"Initially, Kinoshita was seeking a property with the intent to sublet some of the bedrooms and lower her share of the expenses. She had about $20,000 saved for a down payment.\"My vision for the future was to be able to have a family and spend as much time with them and not necessarily have an office job. [But] I still went forward with what made sense for this American Dream path,\" she says.\"I was 28 at the time, so I still kind of cared what my community defined as successful, and homeownership was part of that. At the time, I thought it was the responsible thing to do.\"Kinoshita always believed achieving the American Dream meant owning property.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita wanted to learn as much as she could about the home-buying journey she was embarking on. She enrolled in a nine-week course that teaches people how to manage their money, offered by Financial Peace University.During the retirement module of the online class, Kinoshita used a retirement calculator that helped her realize that if she started contributing a bit more to her 401(k), she could retire around age 55 and buy a house at the same time.\"All of a sudden, the vision I had for the future and the freedom and lifestyle I wanted became possible in my mind for the first time,\" she says.For two years, Kinoshita looked at least a dozen places and put in a total of four offers. She got accepted for one, but then the sellers backed out. She was also approved for a single-family home, but there was a mismatch in the appraisal, so she walked away from the deal.\"I ended up backing out because the only way to be competitive during that time was to invest less and save more for the down payment, and I wasn't willing to do that,\" she says.\"Ultimately, I felt like it wasn't the time for me at the moment, and I was not willing to invest less either. I wasn't satisfied with my career and felt like I was living my dad's dream and not really mine.\"Kinoshita viewed a dozen properties and put in a total of four offers.Anita KinoshitaRedefining successKinoshita switched her focus. Instead of saving for a down payment, she set a goal of having $500,000 invested in her retirement accounts. By April 2022, she had invested $200,000 and reached COAST FIRE — a strategy where you save and invest enough to eventually stop contributing to your retirement accounts and let the compound growth continue rising so you're on track to have a traditional retirement. She decided to quit her job.Kinoshita isn't alone in choosing to wait to buy a house. The median age of a first-time home buyer has gone up in recent years, from 35 in 2023 to 38 in 2024 alone, according to a report from the National Association of Realtors.After quitting her full-time job, Kinoshita started working part-time, creating curriculum for California State University, Monterey Bay and making financial literacy content online. Both of these positions made her more money than when she was working as a software engineer.Kinoshita, now 34, is going to wait until she reaches early COAST FIRE, which, when you have enough invested, lets you stop contributing by the age you decide, versus the traditional retirement age of 67. Kinoshita quit her job and is now making financial literacy content online.Anita KinoshitaHer projected retirement age is now 45, and she expects to have $1.5 million invested by then.\"I value my time and freedom a little bit more than I value home ownership. In retrospect, I think if I had bought the house, I would have felt trapped in my career,\" she says.Kinoshita and her husband recently moved to the California neighborhood where they would one day like to own a home. They pay $4,000 a month in rent and live in a single-family home in a gated community, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.When the couple is ready to buy, she estimates they will have about $300,000 saved to put toward the home. But they still don't know when they will start getting serious about buying.\"I'm not in a rush. I don't want to use it as a financial tool in any way. I'm looking at it more as a luxury and less as an asset these days,\" she says. \"I would rather have my money working for me in the stock market than in real estate.\"Kinoshita and her husband are now renting in the neighborhood they hope to buy one day.Anita KinoshitaKinoshita says her definition of a dream home has also changed.\"I don't want too many bedrooms. I think what I care more about these days is the charming architecture. I don't want it to be overwhelming in terms of square footage. I want it to be in a really beautiful neighborhood where I feel safe. I want to look outside and see nature,\" she says.\"I don't see a reason to settle for something else, so for us it's a as long as it takes kind of thing.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "\"My child won't tell me anything about their day!\" It's a common concern I hear from parents in my psychotherapy office. They're hoping to gain a glimpse into their child's world. But asking \"How was school today?\" usually leads to a one-word answer.As a therapist and the author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do,\" I encourage parents to ask questions that are thoughtful and spark meaningful conversations. When kids reflect on their experiences, they practice skills like emotional awareness, problem-solving, and empathy, and develop a growth mindset.Here are seven questions that lead to productive conversations while also helping kids grow mentally stronger:1. 'What was the best part of your day?'This question encourages kids to scan their brains for positives. For children who dislike school or tend to focus on what went wrong, answering this question helps them build optimism and gratitude — which are both protective factors for mental health.Frame the question with your own experience, saying, \"The best part of my day was going for a walk during my lunch break. What about you?\" Your child might share a highlight, like, \"I played kickball at recess.\"2. 'What's a mistake you learned from today?'This one normalizes errors and celebrates healthy risk-taking. Talking openly about mistakes reduces shame and helps kids see them as opportunities for growth.Ask with a tone of curiosity, not judgment: \"Did anything happen today that you'd do differently next time?\" This might prompt them to say, \"I forgot my library book so I'm going to pack it tonight so I don't forget.\"3. 'Who were you proud of today?'It works because it turns their attention to others and cultivates empathy. You will also gain insight into your child's relationships and what they value.Make the question more specific by asking, for example, \"Did you see anyone try really hard at something today?\" Your child may talk about a friend who was brave or might give themselves a pat on the back and say, \"My friend forgot her snack so I shared mine.\"4. 'What's one thing that would have made today better?'This question helps kids identify feelings like frustration and disappointment without dwelling on those experiences. It naturally opens the door to problem-solving and planning.You can ask in a fun way, such as, \"If you had a magic wand to change one thing about today, what would it be?\" This can lead to creative ideas, like, \"I wish there was more time for my art project so maybe I'll bring it home to finish it.\" 5. 'Who did you help today?'You can empower kids to engage in prosocial behavior with questions like this. When you ask regularly, kids begin to look for opportunities to be helpful and acts of kindness become second nature.  Ask about small acts of contribution: \"How were you a helper today?\" They might remember something simple, like, \"I helped the teacher pass out papers.\"6. 'What was the most interesting thing you learned today?'It emphasizes curiosity over academic performance. Showing interest in the learning process itself fuels lifelong learning.Encourage kids to talk about what they learned aside from just their subjects. They may share a fun fact, like, \"I learned that my teacher knows how to play the violin.\" Show interest and ask follow-up questions to keep the conversation going.7. 'What's something new you'd like to try?'This nudges kids to look outside their comfort zone and encourages them to be courageous. They don't have to be good at something in order to try something new — it's a learning experience. If your child hesitates to try new things, encourage an experiment by asking, \"Is there a club or activity you're curious about just trying once?\" They may be more likely to explore if they know they don't have to stick with it forever.Amy Morin is a psychotherapist, clinical social worker and instructor at Northeastern University. She is the author of several books including \"13 Things Strong Kids Do: Think Big, Feel Good, Act Brave\" and \"13 Things Mentally Strong Parents Don't Do.\" Her TEDx talk \"The Secret of Becoming Mentally Strong\" is one of the most viewed talks of all time.

    "body": "Each year, I sit down to type a heartfelt email and schedule it to send exactly a year later to an unlikely recipient: me. It's a practice I've done since 2022.When I receive a letter from my past self, it's a pleasant surprise and reminds me of what I'd hoped for 365 days ago — and what I've experienced since then.\"You are deserving of the best of everything. If that means being in a new living space next year, I know that will pan out,\" I wrote to myself in October of 2023. A year later, I sat in my first apartment reading the letter and beaming with joy.It wasn't the first time I'd had that experience. In that same letter from 2023 I wrote, \"I'm currently listening to Stevie Wonder.\" I'd just seen the music icon perform live a few days before the message arrived in my inbox.For the past three years, I've written letters to myself and scheduled them to send to me a year later.But it's not just the goals I set and achieved, or the synchronicities I didn't anticipate, that stand out to me. In each letter, I always encouraged myself to be more compassionate, to rest when I need to and to remember that \"simply existing is enough. Anything else is surplus.\"It turns out that without even realizing it, I developed a healthy routine that can have great benefits on my mental health, says Erin Clabough, a neuroscientist, author and professor of psychology at the University of Virginia.\"One thing that we don't do as much as we should as a culture is we don't stop and think about the direction that things are going,\" Clabough tells CNBC Make It. \"A letter to your future self can really help with that.\"Here's why Clabough recommends the practice, and what you should consider when you sit down to write your own letter.Be the captain of your shipPenning letters to your future self creates opportunities for checking in and gauging if you're in alignment with \"the life that we want to be living and the values that we say we have,\" Clabough says.Reading the letter days, months or years in the future is a helpful tool for reflection because it gives you the ability to grow and change, she notes. \"The idea that in the future, you're going to come back and read that letter, I think that's equally as important as writing it down.\"And the type of message you write can determine whether or not the practice will have positive or negative impacts on your mental health, Clabough says.\"I'm actually not a huge fan of specific goal-setting. What I think is more useful is to set your intentions and to leave it really open-ended,\" she says. \"You're supposed to be really compassionate to yourself and kind to yourself in this letter.\"Clabough suggests asking these questions when writing to your future self:What's working well in my life?What's not working? What doesn't feel in alignment with how I want my life to be?How am I spending my time, energy and resources?What are my priorities and values?Think of your life as a ship, and view your letter to yourself as the compass that is nudging you to go in the direction that you desire, she says.I think this is something that should be utilized by all sorts of people, no matter their walks of life.Erin ClaboughNeuroscientist and author\"You're more likely, when captaining the ship, to go towards that direction,\" as a result, she notes. \"You can look at the idea of a placebo, and you can see that our belief in what we're doing and what's happening to us actually makes a huge difference.\"Clabough recommends writing a letter to yourself at least once a year, but also encourages having \"little points along the way where we more intentionally check in with ourselves.\"In her own life, she finds it helpful to pick up her pen and write to herself, \"when I'm going through a hard thing,\" she says.\"I have in the past flipped ahead 40 pages [in my journal], and I've written my letter to my future self at that point, so that when I'm writing in my journal, at some point, I'm going to hit it,\" Clabough says.In her entry, she affirms that she's doing her best and writes about how she hopes to feel by the time she reaches the letter in her journal.\"Setting intentions makes a difference,\" she says. \"I think this is something that should be utilized by all sorts of people, no matter their walks of life.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "\"Neighbors need food NOW,\" the homepage of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana reads.Amid uncertainty around SNAP funding, food banks across the U.S. are scrambling to pick up the slack for the 42 million Americans who rely on the program for food assistance.SNAP payments have been paused since Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown. On Thursday, a federal judge ordered the Trump administration to restore full funding for the program by Nov. 7. The administration quickly appealed the ruling and on Friday sought an emergency block on the order.While the larger legal battle continues, several states have said that they've started to process full food stamp payments, the New York Times reports.CNBC Make It spoke with leaders at several food banks about how they're responding to the challenges caused by SNAP cuts and the government shutdown.Brian Greene, the president and CEO of Houston Food Bank, describes the situation as \"a rolling disaster.\"SNAP payments are typically distributed on a staggered monthly schedule in Texas, Greene says, which means that each day since the beginning of November, another 125,000 Texans run out of EBT funds.As the shutdown drags on, a growing number of furloughed federal workers in Houston are turning to food banks for assistance, Greene says.\"Every day that this keeps going, the damage gets worse and worse,\" he says.Facing 'a great increase in need'According to Leslie Bacho, CEO of Second Harvest of Silicon Valley, the effects of the SNAP disruption are already becoming clear.Within its service area of Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, more than 168,000 people rely on CalFresh, the state of California's version of SNAP, Bacho says.On Monday alone, over 1,500 unique users visited the bank's online food locator tool, which connects people to nearby food distribution sites, according to Bacho. That's nearly double the usual volume.Their hotline has also experienced a 200% increase in requests for referrals, she says.\"We're in the process of ordering additional food and really trying to ramp up for what we think will be a great increase in need,\" Bacho says.Jon Toups, the CEO of Second Harvest Food Bank of South Louisiana, says his organization was \"stretched thin\" even before the SNAP delays.The Louisiana legislature has stepped in to help provide reserve funds for SNAP users, he says, but USDA cuts earlier this year had already caused supply shortages for food banks.There's \"no question\" that there's been an uptick in demand for food assistance in the past week, Toups says, and \"we're seeing an awful lot of anxiousness.\"For every meal that food banks provide, SNAP provides nine, Toups says, creating an even larger chasm of need for banks to fill.\"The shutdown is putting an additional strain on the food bank network when we can least afford it,\" he says.How food banks are respondingAbout 425,000 Houston households rely on SNAP, Greene says, and in order to meet their typical level of need, Houston Food Bank would have to double its output.They're currently using all available resources — Greene gave the bank's procurement team the go-ahead to \"spend what [they] need to spend\" — in an effort to increase output by about 50%.Right now, Houston Food Bank is in \"disaster response mode,\" Greene says.They've set up special distribution sites specifically targeting federal employees and SNAP users in parking lots across the city, including at Houston's NRG Stadium.Houston residents line up in their cars for a special free food distribution by the Houston Food Bank at the NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas, on Nov. 1, 2025.Mark Felix | AFP | Getty ImagesIt costs around $15,000 to set up one of these \"supersites,\" according to Greene, and they're \"pulling in more volunteers and paying a lot of extra expenses,\" he says.At Second Harvest Food Bank South Louisiana, Toups requested to use a \"pretty significant\" amount of the bank's reserve funds to purchase more food, he says.He's also working to spread the word about the food bank's situation.\"Our community has really stepped up. We've seen an uptick in donations, not only financially speaking, but with their time, which is a huge piece for us,\" he says.Still, staff are \"overrun right now,\" he says: \"I almost feel like I'm asking them to work 24/7 right now to stay out in front of this.\"\"We will always do the best we can do,\" Toups says, but their current situation \"is not sustainable.\"Second Harvest Silicon Valley is in \"drop everything mode\" working to allocate 15% more food to each of their distribution sites, Bacho says.Crucially, while the charitable food system is already \"very, very strained,\" the last thing Bacho wants is for people in need to worry that banks will run out of food.\"Whether that involves going into our reserves, whether it involves raising more from our community or from our greater partnerships with our counties, we're going to do everything we can to meet that increase in need,\" she says.Still 'just at the beginning' of crisisBoth Toups and Greene liken the current situation to the aftermath of a natural disaster — but in those situations, \"the federal government was there to help,\" Greene says.\"In this case, the federal government is the cause, not the solution,\" he says.Right now, local giving is keeping many food banks and aid organizations afloat, according to Greene.\"If philanthropy holds up, we can keep doing this for quite some time,\" he says, but \"in a crisis, philanthropy shoots up, but it comes right back down.\"There are a few ways that people can support food banks right now, according to Toups.Primarily, food banks need monetary donations. That's the \"most efficient\" way to help, he says, \"because it allows me to actually use that money to go do exactly what's needed at that moment in time.\"Volunteers can also help food banks with tasks like sorting donations, packing boxes and distributing food, he says.At the end of the day, though, \"we've got to get back to some level of normalcy,\" Toups says.Right now, \"we're just at the beginning of this crisis,\" according to Bacho. As more days pass without SNAP funding, the demands on food banks will only increase, she says.\"We need this man-made problem in Washington, D.C. to resolve itself,\" Toups says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol is shown up North Capitol Street on Nov. 6, 2025 in Washington, DC.Eric Lee | Getty ImagesThe Senate was on track Sunday night to pass a deal that could end the federal government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.A person familiar with the deal told CNBC that enough Democratic senators had agreed to vote for the deal to clear a 60-vote minimum threshold. It would fund the U.S. government through the end of January.The person familiar with the deal said that there are at least eight members of the Democratic caucus who would vote in favor of it. That would give the measure 61 votes, one more than the minimum required to pass.If passed, the deal would have to be approved by the House of Representatives and signed into law before the shutdown would end.The Senate has been stalemated for weeks over the Republican majority's insistence on passing a House bill that would provide short-term funding for government operations, without addressing a key looming question over the fate of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesAnd most Democrats have refused to vote for a stopgap funding bill that does not extend the life of those ACA subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of the year.The deal calls for a vote on a bill related to the ACA credits by the second week of December. Democrats would get to pick which bill is voted on at a time when there is strong public opinion in favor of extending the subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance coverage purchased on Obamacare marketplaces.The deal also calls for a reversal of all permanent layoffs of government employees during the shutdown and protection of such so-called reductions-in-force happening until the end of fiscal year 2026.The deal guarantees that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown, when many of them were not allowed to work.The package also includes provisions for having a bipartisan budget process and preventing the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.It would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.This is breaking news.

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesDeflation pressures in China eased in October as consumer prices returned to growth after remaining in negative territory for the most part this year, supported by holiday season demand, while declines in wholesale prices also moderated.Data from China's National Bureau of Statistics released Sunday showed consumer price index reading for October at 0.2%, compared with analysts' expectations of zero, or flat growth year on year. October's reading was the strongest since January this year, and the first positive growth in consumer prices since June.On a month-on-month basis CPI also rose by 0.2%, compared with Reuters-polled analysts' expectations of zero growth.Food prices, which have been a drag on the country's CPI, dropped 2.9% year on year. However, prices rose 0.2% over the previous month.Factory-gate deflation eased with prices falling 2.1%, year on year, compared with Reuters' poll estimates for a 2.2% decline, completing three years in negative territory. Month-on-month producer prices rose by 0.1% in October.\"In October, policies aimed at expanding domestic demand continued to take effect, coupled with the boost from the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays,\" Dong Lijuan, chief statistician at the urban division of the National Bureau of Statistics, said in a statement.Read moreWhile China's steps aimed at reining in price wars and fueling demand seem to have started bearing fruit, with the country's industrial profits in September rising more than 21%, experts warn that Chinese local governments' dependence on tax revenue encourages sustained production, intensifying competition and overcapacity until there are meaningful tax changes.China's manufacturing activity in October declined more than expected, contracting to its lowest level in six months, according to an official survey released Oct. 30. The sub-indexes for production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all deepened their contraction, pointing to a sharp manufacturing slowdown.Chinese producers have been in the throes of demand uncertainty owed to trade tensions with the U.S. this year and weak consumer confidence at home as Beijing struggles with a prolonged housing downturn and headwinds to exports.The country's exports in October unexpectedly contracted, with shipments to the U.S. clocking double-digit declines for a seventh consecutive month, down 25%, customs data released Thursday showed.Going forward, export headwinds could weaken as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed to a trade truce during their meeting in South Korea on Oct. 30, defusing a potentially incendiary situation that had stoked worries of a full-blown trade war.China's leadership last month vowed to boost domestic consumption as it laid out the economic roadmap for the next five years. China must \"vigorously boost consumption,\" the meeting readout said, according to a CNBC translation.The leaders elaborated on the need for lifting consumption with calls to balance it with \"effective investment\" and \"adhere to the strategic point of expanding domestic demand.\"—  CNBC's Anniek Bao and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.",

He is very passionate about shareholder rights and good corporate governance and will go to extreme lengths to fight incompetent boards and over compensated managers. Icahn has invested across all sectors over his more than six-decade long career and has a long history in the automotive parts and services industry. He has been involved in several mergers and acquisitions in this space, acquiring some of his portfolio companies through Icahn Automotive, the automotive-segment business of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. This includes his acquisition of Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017.What's happeningOn Nov. 5, Carl Icahn filed a 13D with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, disclosing a 14.79% position in Monro.Behind the scenesMonro is engaged in the provision of automotive undercar repair and tire services in the United States, operating more than 1,100 repair shops and tire dealers in 32 states under multiple regional brands. The company has faced several challenges in recent years. Macro factors like lower consumer demand, higher material and labor costs, and a trend in consumer trade-down to lower margin tire products have applied significant margin and growth pressure. As a result, following a 4.9% decrease in sales for fiscal year 2025 — the second year in a row with a meaningful decline in revenue — the company announced that they are closing approximately 145 underperforming locations. Most recently, the company's third-quarter earnings report left a lot of investors disappointed about its strategic transition, with weaker-than-expected revenue and no specific financial guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. Shares fell 16.7% the next day. Lastly, many investors have questioned the company's dividend payout ratio, which has remained relatively large despite these ongoing struggles. Putting all this together, it comes as little surprise that shares have underperformed, down 44.73%, 66.73% and 63.25% over the past 1-, 3- and 5-year periods, respectively, prior to Icahn's announcement.Perhaps this depressed valuation is what caught the eye of Carl Icahn. He disclosed a 14.79% position in the company (67% of which was acquired since the stock's Oct. 29 downturn), immediately sending the stock up over 15%. While there are plenty of cheap stocks, this isn't Icahn taking a flyer on the automotive industry. Icahn has a rich history in the automotive parts and services industry, most notably Icahn Automotive, the automotive segment of his conglomerate, Icahn Enterprises. Icahn knows this industry well and likely sees Monro as a great business that is significantly undervalued. The timing of this public engagement is also very notable. It is not just the stock's recent fall that makes this a good entry point for an investor like Icahn. Monro recently agreed to collapse its dual class share structure, which had previously granted its sole Class C shareholder, Peter Solomon, veto power over any matter brought to a shareholder vote, effectively making this a controlled company. Pursuant to its approval in 2023, this collapse will occur prior to the 2026 annual meeting, which is expected to take place next August. So, what does this mean for the company's shareholders? It effectively sets the stage for the company being converted from a privately run company to a publicly run company for the benefit of its shareholders. With one person having veto power over all material board decisions, the rest of the board becomes somewhat irrelevant. With this conversion, the company has an opportunity to have a real, collaborative, and productive board. This would require its reconstitution, and we know of nobody better or more experienced than Icahn for that endeavor.Solomon is an 87-year-old renowned investment banker and Icahn is, well, Icahn and a contemporary of Solomon. However, there is no evidence that the two have ever crossed paths. Despite this, we would imagine that they have many relationships in common and mutual respect for each other. While there are many different ways this campaign can go down, what we would like to see is the two elder statesmen meeting in a room with an air of civility and cordiality uncommon in the average activist engagement and together coming up with a board that will oversee management, hold them accountable on behalf of shareholders and usher the company through its first real phase as a truly public company. With Solomon already agreeing to give up control, and neither Solomon nor Icahn likely to be on the continuing board, there is no reason why this should get contentious.However, we also must address the elephant in the room. Icahn has built his automotive industry on acquisitions, and Monro appears to fit in very nicely in IEP's automotive business. Icahn has launched activist campaigns at some of the auto companies that he later went on to acquire, including Pep Boys-Manny Moe and Jack in 2016 and Federal Mogul in 2017. When Icahn acquired Pep Boys he also stated: \"We believe that with our abundant resources and knowledge of the industry we will be able to grow this business and take advantage of consolidation opportunities, thereby benefiting customers, manufacturing partners and employees, as well as our shareholders.\" While we sincerely believe that Icahn's main motivation for this investment is to invest in a good company that he believes is at an inflection point and is significantly undervalued, there is always the chance that he might want to own the entire company one day. This is a very small position for him and a good return would not move the needle as much as a synergistic integration into his automative business, but we see no reason why both things cannot be true.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

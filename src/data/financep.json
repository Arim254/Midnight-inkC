    "body": "watch nowA key inflation measure was lower than expected in September, the Commerce Department said Friday in a report delayed by the government shutdown that gives a further green light for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, indicated a 0.2% monthly rise while the annual rate was 2.8%. The monthly rate was in line with the Dow Jones consensus, but the annual level was 0.1 percentage point lower. The core annual rate edged down from 2.9% in August.In addition, headline PCE increased 0.3% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate also at 2.8%, according to the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Both of those readings were in line with expectations though the annual rate was up 0.1 percentage point from August.Federal Reserve officials use the PCE price index as their primary policy tool for inflation. While officials look at both measures, they generally consider core a better indicator of longer-term inflation trends.\"The slightly stale September inflation report shows that prices remained reasonably stable despite tariffs and healthy consumer spending. This probably provides further air cover for the Fed to cut rates in December,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy.Goods prices surged 0.5% on the month as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to work their way through the economy. Services prices were up just 0.2%. Food rose 0.4% while energy was up 1.7%.The report also showed the personal savings rate was unchanged from August at 4.7%.The release was put off several weeks by the government shutdown, which had caused a halt to all data collection and economic reports.In addition to the inflation figures, the release provided information on income and spending.Personal income rose 0.4% on the month while spending was up 0.3%. Income was 0.1 percentage point above the forecast, while spending was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast.Stocks added to gains following the release as traders anticipate a quarter percentage point interest rate cut from the Fed when it announces its rate decision Wednesday.Odds of a rate cut when the Fed convenes next week held at 87.2% following the report, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. The interest rate decision will be announced Wednesday.Though the September data is backward-looking, it is the last price reading the Fed will get before its monetary policy meeting next week. However, policymakers have been unusually divided in what the next steps should be for rates. One FOMC faction supports additional cuts as a way to head off further weakness in the labor market, while another sees continued threats from inflation that would require holding rates in a more restrictive position. Recent labor market indicators show a slow pace of hiring, with some private data points exhibiting an increasing level of layoffs. Labor Department data, though, actually showed a decline last week in initial unemployment benefit claims.A separate economic report Friday showed consumer sentiment a bit better than expected to start December.The University of Michigan's consumer survey came in at 53.3, up 4.5% from November and better than the Wall Street estimate for 52. Inflation expectations also dropped, with the one-year view falling to 4.1% and the five-year at 3.2%, both at their lowest levels since January.",

At the elevated price, Musk's aerospace and defense contractor would be valued above ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which wrapped up a share sale at a $500 billion valuation in October. SpaceX has been investing heavily in reusable rockets, launch facilities and satellites, while competing for government contracts with newer space players, including Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin. SpaceX is far ahead, and operates the world's largest network of satellites in low earth orbit through Starlink, which powers satellite internet services under the same brand name.A SpaceX IPO would include its Starlink business, which the company previously considered spinning out.Musk recently discussed whether SpaceX would go public during Tesla's annual shareholders meeting last month. Musk, who is the CEO of both companies, said he doesn't love running publicly traded businesses, in part because they draw \"spurious lawsuits,\" and can \"make it very difficult to operate effectively.\"However, Musk said during the meeting that he wanted to \"try to figure out some way for Tesla shareholders to participate in SpaceX,\" adding, \"maybe at some point, SpaceX should become a public company despite all the downsides.\"WATCH: What retail investors should know about OpenAI and SpaceXwatch now",

The stock climbed 13% over the past five days, its best weekly performance since December 2023.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.25, topping Wall Street's estimates of $2.86 per share. Revenue increased 8.6% year over year to $10.26 billion but just missed analyst projections of $10.27 billion.Although the artificial intelligence boom has pushed several tech companies into record surges, cloud software firms have seen a rocky year as investors wonder whether AI will render the industry obsolete.Salesforce is hoping to persuade Wall Street that AI will be able to bolster its products rather than replace them. Investors \"somehow think software companies are under arrest from AI, when the opposite is true,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday.During the third quarter, the company acquired startups Regrello and Waii, which uses AI to generate code with natural language instructions.Despite Salesforce's shares being down 22% year to date, compared with the Nasdaq's 22% gain, analysts are more optimistic for 2026. \"CRM [Salesforce] continues to be levered to digital transformation, and we expect the company to grow at a solid rate going forward,\" Mizuho analysts wrote. \"At the same time, we believe CRM will remain fiscally disciplined and that it can continue to drive higher operating and FCF margins.\"Analysts highlighted Salesforce's AI platform Agentforce, which builds agents that automate business tasks and streamline workflow. Despite initial investor skepticism over the platform, Cantor analysts were encouraged by its strong adoption in the customer service space.\"We think CRM is starting to formalize and mature the strategy, which should make it easier for customers to understand, and therefore adopt, Agentforce,\" the Cantor analysts wrote.Annual recurring revenue of Agentforce jumped 330% year over year to $540 million.\"Why everyone is so excited about Agentforce is because this is what AI was meant to be,\" Benioff said. \"It brings together humans and data and AI and apps, and delivers an incredible experience for companies.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff goes one-on-one with Jim Cramer",

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together.Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started.  On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. \"It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. \"I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'\"Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders. Zaslav's shareZaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found.Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million.For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount's hostile playEllison has wasted no time at the helm of Paramount Skydance, transforming the company through deals and acquisitions.Since the merger closed in August, Paramount has brought on C-suite executives and high-profile Hollywood talent such as the Duffer Brothers. It secured the rights to develop a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise and struck a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights. Ellison's hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery was his biggest endeavor since taking control of the company.Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, claiming the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. Paramount has accused Warner Bros. Discovery of failing to properly consider its offer of $30, all-cash, and instead selling to Netflix as a predetermined outcome. Netflix made an initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets of $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Paramount was the only bidder interested in acquiring all of WBD's assets — the film studio, streaming service and TV networks. It has maintained that its offer is superior. Paramount's executives and advisors valued the Discovery Global networks portfolio at close to $2 a share, based on its predicted trading multiple and estimated leverage ratio, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.Warner Bros. Discovery believes Discovery Global could have a value of $3 per share or more if it trades well in the public markets, according to other people with direct knowledge of the matter.Paramount has also argued there are tax efficiencies for shareholders in acquiring the whole company rather than buying only a portion of it, and that Netflix's bid comes with steeper regulatory risk. The Trump administration's view of the proposed combination is one of \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday.Paramount offered a break-up fee of $5 billion if the proposed deal didn't get regulatory approval, according to the people familiar.  Netflix's bid included a $5.8 billion break-up fee in case the deal doesn't get regulatory approval, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Paramount is now weighing its options about whether to go straight to shareholders with one more improved bid — perhaps even higher than the $30-per-share, all-cash offer it submitted to WBD this week. If it does, Netflix would have a chance to match that bid. The end result would mean even more money for WBD shareholders — and more money for Zaslav.— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowNetflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including \"The Sopranos\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\"I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning. \"We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity,\" he said. \"It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.\"Netflix's initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets was for $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months. CNBC has reached out to Comcast and Paramount for comment.As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders. Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.Edging out ParamountThe merger could invite regulatory scrutiny given the size of the expansive streaming businesses for each company. Netflix said it surpassed 300 million global streaming subscribers at the end of 2024, the last time it publicly reported its customer count. Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 128 million global subscribers as of Sept. 30. Paramount raised the potential for antitrust concerns earlier this week in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management as second-round bids came in, The Wall Street Journal reported. The newly merged Paramount Skydance made its initial run at Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process. The David Ellison-run company was the only suitor bidding for the entirety of WBD's portfolio — the film studio, streaming business and TV networks.Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said. Earlier this week, Paramount raised questions about the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process, contending Warner Bros. Discovery favored Netflix.\"It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,\" Paramount attorneys said in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management.— CNBC's David Faber, Kasey O'Brien and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Logos of Netlfix and Warner Bros.ReutersThe Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery deal came together quickly — but its path to regulatory approval may not be so speedy. Netflix stunned the media industry on Friday when it announced its proposed $72 billion deal to acquire the iconic Warner Bros. film studio and streaming service HBO Max. The combination brings together two of the most popular streaming platforms in the business. Netflix reported 300 million global subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric. HBO Max had 128 million customers as of Sept. 30.  Netflix currently claims 46% of mobile app monthly active users in global streaming, according to data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Combined with HBO Max, that share would rise to 56%, it found. \"This deal cements Netflix's position as the premier streaming service for original content,\" according to a research note from analysts at William Blair on Friday.The size of the deal makes it ripe for scrutiny, from both industry insiders and U.S. lawmakers. The Trump administration is viewing the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren has already called for an antitrust review. \"This deal looks like an anti-monopoly nightmare. A Netflix-Warner Bros. would create one massive media giant with control of close to half of the streaming market — threatening to force Americans into higher subscription prices and fewer choices over what and how they watch, while putting American workers at risk,\" Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said in a statement. The merger would also give Netflix control over the famed Warner Bros. film studio, further consolidating the cinematic space and raising concerns that the number or typical windowing of popular releases could shrink. It's typical in the days and weeks following a deal announcement of this scale for interest groups, politicians and corporate competitors to call foul on antitrust grounds. The Department of Justice is most likely to review the deal, as it has other media mergers in the past, and it could take some time. DOJ reviews can take anywhere from months to more than a year. Netflix said Friday it expects the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months, after Warner Bros. Discovery spins out its portfolio of cable networks into Discovery Global. Netflix confidenceTed Sarandos, co-chief executive officer of Netflix , attends the annual Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 11th, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCNetflix executives on Friday said they were \"highly confident\" the deal would win regulatory approval.\"You know, this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, it's pro-creator, it's pro-growth,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call following the acquisition announcement. \"Our plans here are to work really closely with all the appropriate governments and regulators, but [we're] really confident that we're going to get all the necessary approvals that we need,\" Sarandos added. As part of the deal, Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal were to get blocked by the government. Netflix's bid won out over competing offers from Paramount Skydance and Comcast. Analysts at Deutsche Bank and William Blair were at least minimally convinced Friday of the potential for the deal to go through. \"A merger of Warner Bros. Discovery and any of the three bidders would probably succeed, even if the DOJ were to sue to block a proposed combination,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Friday, citing insights from a Department of Justice veteran who the analysts said \"does not see any significant antitrust problems with any of the three scenarios.\" \"However ... we don't know all of the detailed facts that will be collected and analyzed by the DOJ, nor do we know who the judge hearing the case will be, and both of these factors can have an impact on the outcome,\" the Deutsche Bank analysts noted.  Paramount, for its part, has been fanning the flames. Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, in which it argued the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. The Wall Street Journal reported that in a separate letter, Paramount said a Netflix transaction would likely \"never close\" because of regulatory headwinds. Paramount was the only bidder looking to buy WBD's massive portfolio of pay-TV networks — and it's unlikely to walk away from the process quietly.

Trump announced an investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and took questions on a range of topics including his presidential pardons of Jan. 6 defendants, the war in Ukraine, cryptocurrencies and other topics.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesWall Street expected President Donald Trump's second term to usher in a windfall of dealmaking. However, economic uncertainty has slowed the process for some companies, and regulatory holdups have played a bigger role than anticipated.  \"Under Donald Trump, the antitrust review process has also become a cesspool of political favoritism and corruption,\" Warren said in Friday's statement. \"The Justice Department must enforce our nation's anti-monopoly laws fairly and transparently — not use the Warner Bros. deal review to invite influence-peddling and bribery.\" Paramount's merger with Skydance was left in limbo for more than a year before it finally won federal approval in July. The Federal Communications Commission (which is unlikely to review the Netflix-WBD tie-up since it doesn't involve a broadcaster) signed off on the $8 billion merger shortly after Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to Trump to settle a lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount had also ended its diversity, equity and inclusion policies earlier in the year after the FCC said it would investigate the company over its DEI programs. In September, the newly combined Paramount Skydance, run by David Ellison, set its sights on Warner Bros. Discovery. The company is now considering whether to take a hostile bid straight to WBD shareholders and try to unseat Netflix as the would-be buyer, CNBC reported Friday. Ellison's billionaire father, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, is known to be close with Trump. The argument for whether to clear Netflix's proposed takeover of Warner Bros. would likely come down to questions around streaming — first, on pricing for consumers, and second, on how to define Netflix's audience. The pricing of streaming subscriptions has risen across the board in recent years. In 2022 Netflix instituted a cheaper, ad-supported model after years of resistance in an effort to beckon more customers. The following year, Disney followed with its own more-affordable plan. Netflix is used to upending the legacy media industry. The company ended its DVD rentals business in 2023 and went all in on streaming. It's since found massive scale and has taken over the zeitgeist with original series like \"Squid Game,\" \"Wednesday,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and \"Bridgerton.\" Its maverick approach to media and its broadening foothold in the industry may be its saving grace in the eyes of regulators. \"My expectation on the regulatory side is Netflix is going to advocate and argue with their advisors for a very expansive definition of what their market is ... so that would include broadcast, cable, subscription and ad-supported streaming,\" said said Jeff Goldstein, a partner and managing director at AlixPartners, and co-lead of the U.S. Media group. \"And really, really, really importantly, that would include YouTube,\" he said.YouTube has come to dominate the industry when it comes to viewership. Nielsen once again reported in October than YouTube had the largest share of TV usage, with Netflix in sixth place and Warner Bros. Discovery in seventh place. Traditional media companies with linear networks — Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox and Paramount — filled the spots in between. Critics of the deal will define Netflix's reach more narrowly to try to demonstrate outsized dominance, said Goldstein. \"I believe that streaming is not a category. Television viewership is a category ... you know, eyeballs might be a category,\" media industry titan John Malone told CNBC in November when asked about antitrust questions surrounding the WBD sale process. \"But if you're going to broaden the category to that, you got to take in YouTube and Facebook and the social networks, TikTok,\" he said. \"I mean, that's really the question, is streaming a category? ... Are studios a category ... and is that going to get looked at hard? These regulatory things are a little bit difficult to predict.\" — CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.

    "body": "Jocelyn Elizabeth was a new mom working part-time as a marketing administrator when her dad brought home a $5 lamp from a church yard sale in Dillsburg, Pennsylvania.It was 2011, Elizabeth says. Though the lamp wasn't fancy or new, her dad was sure he'd made a good investment, and found a cleaned-up version of the same lamp listed at $70 on eBay. Elizabeth says she promptly went thrifting the next weekend, intending to flip her finds for a profit online, her baby son tagging along in a stroller.Elizabeth, who uses her middle name professionally and asked not to share her last name, now makes her full-time living from her thrifting-centric YouTube channel Crazy Lamp Lady and her online thrifting marketplace NikNax, she says. NikNax hosts more than 5,000 other sellers listing resale items ranging from mugs and glassware to jewelry, books, trading cards and local snacks.NikNax has brought in more than $5.2 million in 2025 revenue, as of Oct. 31, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. Elizabeth, 37, keeps a 5% cut of each sale, meaning she's personally received at least $260,000 from the marketplace so far this year. District, the online platform that hosts NikNax, also takes a 5% cut of each sale.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossElizabeth also sells her own thrift finds on NikNax, and her store is responsible for about 5% of NikNax's total sales, she says. Her YouTube channel has also brought in roughly $298,000 in 2025 advertising revenue as of Oct. 15, documents show.Both NikNax and the YouTube channel are profitable, says Elizabeth. She employs two other people who help with listing and shipping her thrift finds, she adds. She works about three days per week on NikNax, and two or three days on her YouTube channel — and her working hours vary significantly, she says.\"These days, I spend anywhere from 50 to 100 hours a week working. It really depends on what's going on. Some weeks I'm doing more thrifting trips, and other weeks I'm focused on selling,\" says Elizabeth, a mom of three. \"NikNax has become such a big part of my daily life that even when I'm not actively selling, I'm usually watching other shows, chatting, or listing items. It's technically work, but a lot of it just feels like part of my everyday routine.\"Here's how she built her YouTube channel side hustle and turned thrifting into her full-time job.'It was definitely risky'When Elizabeth first discovered thrift flipping in 2011, she was making $14 per hour at a part-time corporate marketing job, she says. Soon, she started traveling to antique shows and stores across the U.S., studying the vintage and collectible secondary market and developing an eye for items with a higher resale value.By April 2016, she felt unfulfilled sending marketing emails to clients every day, she says — so she decided to launch a YouTube channel dedicated to her thrifting. Her first inkling that this could become a real money-making business was the first time she made $600 in advertising revenue in one day, she says.\"I remember having to pull over my car and just be like, 'What in the world is happening?'\" says Elizabeth.By the end of 2018, Elizabeth was \"consistently earning more from YouTube than from my part-time job,\" she says — so she quit her marketing gig that December. \"I was like, 'You know what? I don't want to be here anymore' ... It was definitely risky, and it was scary.\"Roughly six months later, Elizabeth had a house full of antiques and five employees, two who listed items on eBay and three who packed and shipped them. Elizabeth says she brought on three more employees during the Covid-19 pandemic, as declining ad revenue pushed her to try selling more on eBay. She also grew dissatisfied with seller fees on the platform, she says.In October 2023, she launched a marketplace on District — an internet platform founded in 2022 — after being invited by a company representative who'd seen her YouTube channel. District currently hosts 98 marketplaces, according to its website, including NikNax.Elizabeth also rents a commercial space to store her own thrift finds, and a separate operating space for day-to-day responsibilities like listing and shipping orders. Combined, those spaces roughly cost $2,000 to $3,000 per month including utilities, she says.The challenges of owning a marketplaceOwning a marketplace — rather than just being a seller — presents a new set of challenges, Elizabeth says. Online trends shift quickly, and staying on top of them can be difficult. Livestream sales, where you sell items in real time to buyers actively watching your live video feed, are a major sales driver for NikNax, but Elizabeth wasn't initially comfortable in front of a live camera, she says.She's also responsible for enforcing platform rules, like removing people who make rude comments or determining whether a buyer is falsely claiming that an item wasn't shipped to get an illicit refund.Building a community of buyers and sellers, on the other hand, was fairly easy, she says: She brought some of her YouTube audience with her, and now casts many of her NikNax livestreams on YouTube and other social channels to market the platform.Elizabeth has used some of her earnings to invest in real estate, purchasing an Airbnb rental property and a separate rental home in Pennsylvania. Each three-bedroom house cost around $300,000, she says. The Airbnb runs guests roughly $300 per night, including fees, according to the rental platform.Anyone can replicate her experience — from thrift flipping to YouTube and NikNax — to a certain degree, as long as you have the \"drive\" and dedication, she says. She travels the country at least once a month looking for thrift items to flip, while filming and editing online content and livestreaming multiple times per week, she says.Still, even if you only have a few dollars in your pocket, you could turn that into a profit if you know what to look for, she notes.\"I think anyone can do it if they put the work in,\" says Elizabeth. \"Anyone could go to Goodwill and pick something up and be like, 'Oh my gosh, how much is this worth?' And find out it's worth $50 ... If you're willing to put in the work, if you're willing to learn, I think anyone can really accomplish this.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump makes an announcement from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC on December 3, 2025. Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.\"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power,\" the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.Those boards \"wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers\" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.\"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members,\" ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.The Trump administration is challenging the 90-year-old precedent set by Humphrey's, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally remove the heads of certain independent government agencies. The Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear oral arguments in a case that could determine whether Humphrey's is overturned. The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.\"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency,\" Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.\"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country,\" she wrote. \"Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent.\"Pan added that her colleagues \"redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies.\"Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does \"not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified \"a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials.\"Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21.Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have \"solely adjudicatory functions,\" Katsas and Walker noted.They cited the \"War Claims Commission,\" a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example.Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on \"whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials,\" they wrote.",

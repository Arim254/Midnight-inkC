    "body": "People walk past Morgan Stanley global headquarters in Manhattan on March 20, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley on Thursday reported fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations on the back of strong revenue from wealth management. Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:Earnings per share: $2.68 vs. $2.44 expected Revenue: $17.89 billion vs. $17.77 billion expectedFourth-quarter net income rose to $4.40 billion, or $2.68 per share, from $3.71 billion, or $2.22 per share, a year ago. Revenue increased to $17.89 billion from $16.22 billion a year ago.The bank stock jumped about 6% on Thursday following the report. The wealth management unit posted $8.4 billion in net revenue in the most recent quarter, up from $7.5 billion a year earlier. For the full year, the division generated a record $31.8 billion in net revenue. Total client assets in the wealth and investment management business climbed to $9.3 trillion, fueled by more than $350 billion in net new assets.\"Morgan Stanley delivered outstanding performance in 2025,\" Ted Pick, the bank's CEO and chairman, said in a statement. \"Our performance reflects multi-year investments which have contributed to growth and momentum across the Integrated Firm.\"Investment banking was also a standout for the firm. Net revenue for the segment jumped 47% to $2.41 billion from $1.64 billion a year earlier, driven by stronger advisory fees as completed M&A activity increased across all regions.The firm bought back $1.5 billion of its stock during the quarter and $4.6 billion over the full year under its share repurchase program.Morgan Stanley shares have gained more than 43% over the past 12 months.Other banks have mostly posted solid results. JPMorgan Chase topped expectations for fourth-quarter results on strong equities and fixed income trading revenue. Wells Fargo posted weaker-than-expected revenue, while Bank of America and Citigroup beat consensus estimates.",

    "body": "Aerial view of cargo ship and cargo container in harbor.Adoff 01 / 500px | 500px | Getty ImagesIndia's exports to China soared in December while shipments to the U.S. declined as President Donald Trump's steep tariffs prompt New Delhi to focus on alternative markets. Exports to China surged 67% in December to $2 billion, in contrast to goods shipped to the U.S. — New Delhi's biggest export market — that dropped 1.8% to $6.8 billion, according to government data released late Thursday.The U.S. has slapped 50% tariffs on New Delhi, among the highest on any country and even more than on China, upending both the trade and diplomatic relations between the two countries.During the first nine months of the fiscal year ending March 2026, India's exports to mainland China have risen nearly 37%, while shipments to Hong Kong have jumped more than 25%. Earlier this week, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri met Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China Sun Haiyan in New Delhi to discuss the \"progress made in stabilizing and rebuilding bilateral ties with priority on business and people-centric engagements.\"Relations between the two countries have been thawing since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in September sharing a vision of being partners not rivals.China has emerged as India's largest goods trading partner, doing business worth $110.20 billion between April and December 2025, upstaging the U.S. at $105.31 billion, data from the India's commerce ministry shows. But India's widening trade deficit with Beijing and border disputes have been a bone of contention between the two. The country's trade balance with China is in sharp contrast with the U.S.New Delhi runs a trade surplus with Washington, while it's trade deficit with Beijing has been soaring. During April to December, India's trade surplus with the U.S. was more than $26 billion, deficit with China stood at $81.7 billion.In fiscal year 2025, India traded goods worth $131.84 billion with Washington and $127.71 billion with its Asian neighbor, not accounting for Hong Kong.Deficit, tariffs and diversificationIndia's merchandise trade deficit for December rose 21.4% year on year to $25 billion. The country's merchandise exports in December rose 1.9% while imports grew 8.8% compared to a year ago. However, the deficit was lower than a Reuters poll estimate of $27 billion. Exports had registered a surprise growth of 19.4% in November, with shipments to the U.S. rising 22.6% amid hopes a possible deal. India's trade secretary Rajesh Agrawal on Thursday said that New Delhi was \"very near\" to finalizing a deal with Washington but refused to put a deadline to it, according to domestic media reports.Despite the two sides being engaged in negotiations for months, a deal has been elusive. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on a podcast last week said the India–U.S. trade deal fell through because Prime Minister Modi did not call President Trump. \"I set the deal up. But Modi had to call President Trump. They were uncomfortable with it, so Modi didn't call,\" Lutnick said.The Indian side has called these comments \"inaccurate.\"U.S. Ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, who took charge last week, has said that finalizing a trade deal with a large nation like India is \"not an easy task to get this across the finish line, but we are determined to get there.\"India, which has ambitions to become an export powerhouse, has been looking to diversify its exports to make up for the impact of U.S. tariffs.Agrawal said that the country was close to signing a much-awaited trade deal with the European Union this month, according to a report by Reuters.Since U.S. tariffs were announced, India has entered into trade pacts with the UK, Oman as well with New Zealand which will be signed in the first half of 2026. India has a \"well-diversified and resilient export footprint,\" said S. C. Ralhan, president, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, highlighting UAE, China, Netherlands, UK and Germany as India's top export destinations in addition to the U.S.\"This diversification is particularly critical at a time when global trade routes are being reshaped due to geo-political conflicts, sanctions, shipping disruptions and strategic realignments, he said in a statement.",

    "body": "Fans watch Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals during an NBA playoffs watch party at a New York bar on May 31, 2025.David Dee Delgado | Getty ImagesA version of this article first appeared in the CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman, which brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.As prediction market trading volume booms, Truist analysts say there could be an unlikely source behind the surge. Analyst Barry Jonas wrote this week that 18- to 20-year-olds, who are too young to gamble legally in most states, could be contributing significantly to the growth of prediction markets.Specifically, data from HoldCrunch, founded by a former FanDuel executive, shows prediction platform Kalshi is taking more trades on college football than on NFL and NBA. While non-college students could still wager on college results, of course, the trend could offer a clue into the demographics of prediction platform users. HoldCrunch analyzes the data on an \"OSB-equivalent handle\" rather than on volumes alone.   During the week ended Jan. 4, Kalshi's college football handle hit its highest percentage of total at 32%, the prediction platform said. The NFL accounted for 24% of total wagers, and the NBA represented 22%. The tide has been shifting in that direction since October, according to Kalshi.  Prediction markets — in which users can bet on the outcomes of events in everything from politics and world news to pop culture and sports — have skyrocketed in popularity with the help of platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket. They're quickly filling a gap in the market in states where online sports betting is not legal. And in states where it is legal, online sporting betting is often limited to those 21 years or older. Kalshi and Polymarket are open to anyone 18 or older, with some state-by-state exceptions for sports and other certain trades. \"It's clear that these new offerings are having an impact on sports bettor behavior,\" Jonas wrote. NCAA President Charlie Baker wrote this week to the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission, which regulates prediction markets, asking the agency to remove college sports from options to trade until more safeguards are in place. Juice Reel, an app that allows sports gamblers to track wagers and provides analysis of wagering and trading activity, found higher uptake of prediction markets in states where sports betting isn't legal. According to Juice Reel, 9% of its California customers have connected prediction accounts, the most of any other state. Just over 6% of Juice Reel's Texas customers have linked prediction market accounts. Neither California nor Texas offers legal, licensed sports betting.  Curiously, New York, which has legal online sports betting, ranks second on Juice Reel in customers who have connected prediction accounts (6.8%), perhaps because of the concentration of financial traders accustomed to trading futures, options and other volatile financial derivatives. Truist's analysts hypothesize 18- to 20-year-olds could be fueling the predictions action in the state, too. Residents of both New York and California demonstrate a notable propensity for gambling outside the bounds of regulated sportsbooks. New York charges a tax of 51% on sportsbooks, but not on sweeps, daily fantasy, bookie accounts and offshore sportsbooks. And those alternate platforms get 40% of the overall handle, or money wagered, from the Juice Reel customers.In part, that's because gamblers who really know what they're doing can't bet big on platforms like DraftKings or FanDuel. \"Some of the biggest and best bettors are going to prediction markets because they're limited to smaller bets by the sportsbooks,\" Juice Reel's founder Ricky Gold told CNBC. Fully 70% of the bets tracked by Juice Reel are in regulated sportsbooks, but they account for only 38% of the handle. By contrast, predictions account for only 1% of the number of bets, but 13% of the handle.  \"Prediction markets amplify bettor skill and variance,\" Truist's Jonas concluded, adding they \"show substantially larger downside for low-wallet users and substantially higher upside for high-wallet users.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship. ",

    "body": "The Nave Photon, carrying crude oil from Venezuela, is docked at Port Freeport in Freeport, Texas, U.S., January 15, 2026.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThe U.S. is securing about 30% higher prices for Venezuelan crude, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Thursday, as the country has started selling oil from the Latin American nation after capturing its former President Nicolas Maduro.Washington has completed its first sale of Venezuelan oil valued at about $500 million, according to a U.S. Department of Energy spokesperson, with more expected in the coming days and weeks.\"We're getting about a 30% higher realized price when we sell the same barrel of oil than they sold the same barrel of oil three weeks ago,\" Wright said at a U.S. Energy Association event, without specifying prices.U.S. special forces captured Maduro earlier this month during an operation that Washington said was aimed at restoring political stability.President Donald Trump said last week that Venezuela would hand over between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil currently under U.S. sanctions, which would be sold at prevailing market prices. In a social media post, he noted that the proceeds would be controlled by him to ensure the funds benefit both Venezuela and the U.S.That would just be the first tranche of oil, as the Department of Energy has said the oil sales from Venezuela will continue \"indefinitely.\"Venezuela holds the world's largest proven crude reserves at about 303 billion barrels, but years of underinvestment have left its oil industry in severe decline, with output now around 800,000 barrels per day from a peak of 3.5 million bpd in the 1990s. Trump also announced last Friday that oil companies would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector, adding that the U.S. would provide security to ensure investors earn strong returns. He met oil industry leaders from Exxon, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Halliburton, Valero and Maratho at the White House to discuss investments in Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.  Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.The developments come as global oil markets face a supply overhang that has weighed on prices in the past year. Brent futures inched 0.14% higher to $63.85 a barrel as of 8:33 p.m. ET, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $59.31. This follows a sharp fall on Thursday as traders appear to brush off tensions between U.S. and Iran. \"Venezuela's oil problem is not technical, and it is not commercial,  it's fundamentally human and political,\" said Baron Lamarre, former head of trading at Petronas and co-founder of Index.\"Until investors have confidence in long-term political continuity, capital will remain cautious, incremental, and conditional,\" he said.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump, in front of U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., delivers remarks at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Sept. 22, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Thursday rolled out the broad outline of a health-care plan that the White House claims will lower drug prices and insurance premiums.The announcement came as a congressional effort to extend key Affordable Care Act tax credits faces headwinds from Senate Republicans, leaving millions at risk of seeing their health insurance premiums spike.The Trump administration dubbed the initiative \"The Great Healthcare Plan,\" the president said in a video unveiling the policy Thursday morning.\"I'm calling on Congress to pass this framework into law without delay,\" Trump said. \"Have to do it right now.\"The plan would codify the deals Trump recently struck with major drugmakers to slash the cost of certain prescription drugs in the U.S. by pegging them to lower prices abroad, as part of his \"most-favored-nation\" policy.More than a dozen pharmaceutical companies agreed to lower prices on certain products for Medicaid patients in exchange for a three-year exemption from tariffs. As part of those deals, companies also agreed to sell some medicines at a discount on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, Trump Rx.Trump, in his video announcement, said those lower drug prices will take effect on the platform when it launches this month. He claimed that those prices would plunge by as much as 500%, even though that would mean prices would fall far below $0.The health-care framework would \"make more verified safe pharmaceutical drugs available for over-the-counter purchase,\" according to a White House fact sheet.It would also purportedly send money for health insurance coverage \"directly to the American people\" instead of giving \"big insurance companies billions in extra taxpayer-funded subsidy payments,\" the fact sheet says. Trump has repeatedly floated similar proposals in recent remarks.The plan would additionally \"fund a cost-sharing reduction program,\" which the administration says would \"reduce the most common Obamacare plan premiums by over 10%.\"Other components of the policy include requiring health insurers to prominently post coverage comparisons \"in plain English\" on their websites, along with other information about overhead costs and claim denial rates.It would also require providers who accept either Medicare or Medicaid \"to publicly and prominently post their pricing and fees to avoid surprise medical bills.\"The new proposal from the White House comes as senators remain at loggerheads on a deal to extend the now-lapsed ACA, or Obamacare, subsidies. A bipartisan group of senators has been working for weeks on a way forward, but hit a snag recently on language relating to the Hyde Amendment, a statute that bars the use of federal funds for abortion services. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt holds a press briefing at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 15, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe White House plan notably leaves out an extension of the ACA subsidies, which Democrats are demanding be extended as a part of any health-care deal. The White House had not publicly put forward a proposal until Thursday, but Trump has repeatedly said he wants funds to go directly to patients rather than insurance companies.Some negotiators wondered whether the White House plan would hamper negotiations.\"We've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House,\" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, one of the negotiators, told reporters Thursday. \"Does this set things back if he signals that he does not support extending [the subsidies]? I mean, that's the basis of our plan here.\"Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., who is leading talks on the Democratic side, said Thursday that she hadn't yet seen the Trump plan, but signaled optimism about the discussions.\"Most of the areas have agreement, so what we need to do is get bill text together and then get final sign-off so that we can talk to our colleagues about what we're proposing,\" Shaheen told reporters. A White House official on Thursday said the plan does not close the door on extending the subsidies, but lays out the president's preferences. \"This does not specifically address those bipartisan congressional negotiations that are going on,\" the White House official said. \"It does say that we have a preference that money goes to people, as opposed to insurance companies.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "watch nowOil prices fell more than 4% on Thursday, after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump eased market speculation that an American strike on Iran could be imminent. Brent crude oil futures, the global benchmark, lost 4.15%, or $2.76, to close at $63.76 a barrel. Front-month West Texas Intermediate crude lost $2.83, or 4.56%, to settle at $59.19 a barrel.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said he had been informed by \"very important sources\" in Iran that \"the killing has stopped.\"\"There's no plans for executions, I've been told that on good authority,\" he said, adding that the White House would watch how the situation unfolds. The U.S. Treasury Department on Thursday announced sanctions on Iranian officials such as Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed after mass unrest in Iran was met with a violent crackdown by the Islamic Republic's security forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if civilians are killed or executed by the state. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude priceOil prices jumped on Tuesday after Trump canceled meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that \"help is on its way,\" and extended gains on Wednesday amid mounting concerns that a U.S. strike on the country was looming. Those fears were fueled by a report from news agency Reuters that some personnel had been directed to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening. The BBC also reported that some British personnel were being moved out of the base. On Tuesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory to American citizens to leave Iran by land to Armenia or Turkey. \"Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help,\" the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran said. \"If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items.\"In a note on Thursday morning, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said Trump's comments about the killing in Iran stopping had been taken by markets as \"a signal that the U.S. might hold off on a potential military response.\"\"[But] there's clearly lingering caution, not least given the unexpected timing of U.S. strikes on Iran in June 2025,\" he noted. \"Brent crude is still clearly above its lows below $60/bbl last week, but Trump's comments had a clear impact.\"\"Bear in mind as well that Iran is a more significant oil producer than Venezuela, producing 4% of the world's total in 2023, so developments there have the potential for wider spillovers in the oil market,\" Reid added.",

Trump, however, told reporters in the Oval Office: \"We need Greenland for national security.\" The U.S., Denmark and Greenland agreed to establish a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island, although, as had been widely expected, the three countries were unable to find a diplomatic resolution to defuse tensions.(L/R) Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak during a news conference at the Danish Embassy in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2026.Oliver Contreras | Afp | Getty ImagesBefore the meeting, Denmark announced plans on Wednesday to beef up its military presence in and around Greenland, saying the exercise activities could include guarding national infrastructure, deploying fighter aircraft and conducting naval operations. Germany's Defense Ministry said it would deploy a \"reconnaissance team\" of 13 personnel to Nuuk, Greenland, at the invitation of Denmark.The mission, which will take place Thursday through Saturday, is designed to explore the framework for possible military contributions to ensure security in the region, the German Defense Ministry said, including maritime surveillance capabilities.'Operation Arctic Endurance'French President Emmanuel Macron said in a social media post that France will also participate in the joint exercises organized by Denmark in Greenland, referring to it as \"Operation Arctic Endurance.\" \"The first French military elements are already on their way.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (right) and C.C. Wei, chief executive officer of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (left), shake hands during an announcement of an additional $100 billion into TSMC's U.S. manufacturing at the White House in Washington, DC, U.S., on March 3, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBuoyed by yet another blockbuster earnings report and a new U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is poised to accelerate its multibillion-dollar expansion in Arizona. The world's largest contract chipmaker has already committed $165 billion in the U.S., aligning with Washington's push to rebuild its domestic chip manufacturing. But TSMC executives have signaled that spending will rise even further as the company expands capacity to meet demand for artificial intelligence chips.Speaking Thursday with CNBC's Emily Tan, TSMC Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said the firm would continue to ramp up its investments in Arizona.\"We have strong conviction on the AI mega trend, and that is the reason we are stepping up the capital expenditures to expand in Taiwan and in the U.S.,\" Huang said. \"Not just to expand, but also try to accelerate where it is possible to satisfy or narrow the gap.\"The comments came just hours after Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei said on the company's quarterly earnings call that TSMC had recently purchased additional land in Arizona and planned to build a \"gigafab cluster\" in the state. While the company did not disclose the dollar value of its planned expansions in the U.S., it forecast capital expenditure in the new year to increase over 30% at the midpoint compared with 2025. Trade deal timing The Arizona expansion coincides with a U.S.-Taiwan trade deal signed Thursday that caps U.S. tariffs on Taiwanese goods at 15%, down from 20%, without stacking on existing rates. Under the agreement, Taiwanese firms commit $250 billion in direct U.S. investments across semiconductors, AI and related sectors, along with $250 billion in credit guarantees to strengthen supply chains. The deal also grants favorable treatment for chips, supporting efforts to reshore manufacturing to the U.S.It demonstrates that our manufacturing excellence can be repeated in the U.S.Wendell HuangChief Financial Officer, TSMCU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC's Brian Sullivan that the goal of the trade deal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S.Ahead of TSMC's earnings release and the trade deal, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Taiwanese chip giant had been planning a significant expansion in Arizona as part of trade negotiations between the U.S. and Taiwan, citing confidential sources. However, on Thursday, Huang denied that its U.S. investment plans were directly tied to those trade talks.\"The [U.S.-Taiwan] trade deal is between two governments, and we are not part of the discussions,\" he said. \"But what I will say is we are continuing to invest and accelerate our investment in Arizona because of customers' demand, and we actually are making very good progress with our [first fab] in Arizona being up and running. U.S. progress The push to expand follows progress at its current U.S. facility following years of delays and concerns.According to executives, TSMC's first fabrication plant, which has already begun mass production, is now producing chips with yields and technology levels comparable to those of the company's leading facilities in Taiwan. \"It demonstrates that our manufacturing excellence can be repeated in the U.S. It's very meaningful for ourselves, and it's also very meaningful for our customers,\" Huang said.However, he noted that the company's most advanced technologies would continue to be developed and scaled up in Taiwan, where TSMC benefits from the necessary collaboration between its research teams and manufacturing operations.watch nowProfit margins in Taiwan also remain higher than in the U.S., partly due to lower labor costs.Still, the company's outlook in the U.S. has improved. TSMC has moved up the production timeline for its second Arizona plant to the second half of 2027, with construction on a third facility accelerating this year. It has also begun applying for permits for a fourth plant, the company said at its recent earnings call.According to Huang, TSMC's original plan for its first 1,100 acres in Arizona included six wafer fabrication plants, two advanced packaging facilities and a research and development center. However, that land proved to be insufficient for the expansion plans, prompting the purchase of an additional 900-acre lot. Some facilities that were part of the original plan will now be built on this second piece of land instead, with the remainder \"used for future flexibilities,\" Huang said. TSMC shares were trading up more than 3% in Taipei on Friday.",

Cost overruns have been a point of contention between the Fed and the White House, with the latest developments pointing to a potential criminal prosecution of Powell.While Goolsbee said he wasn't commenting directly on the legal issues, he expressed support for Powell's statement Sunday that the questions over the construction project could be seen as a pretext toward President Donald Trump getting his way on interest rates.\"I agree with it, with his argument that if you're investigating as a pretext because you disagree with the rate decisions, that's a mess. We should not be in that place,\" he said.Trump has been relentless in his biting, often-personal criticism of the Powell Fed. He repeatedly has called for much lower interest rates and has nicknamed Powell \"Too Late\" even though the Fed has cut its benchmark rate three times since September 2025.Powell's term as chair ends in May, though he could stay on as a governor until 2028.Like other Fed officials, Goolsbee said the independence of the Fed is critical for it to achieve its goals.\"I know that there have been countries that had criminal investigations of their central banks, but those countries are Zimbabwe and Russia and Turkey and a bunch of places that you would not characterize as advanced economies,\" he said.Before taking his position at the Chicago Fed in December 2022, Goolsbee had a long history of involvement in Democratic politics.He chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama and served as an advisor during Joe Biden's campaign in 2020. However, he said Thursday that once \"you've become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the elections business.\"Goolsbee has called Powell a \"first-ballot Hall of Famer\" as a Fed chair for bringing down inflation without causing a recession.watch now",

Wall Street had largely soured on AI as of late, Cramer said. But Taiwan Semiconductor's successful earnings suggest business is also strong for customers, namely Nvidia, he continued. Chip stocks led the market higher on Thursday, with the major indexes finishing in the green. Taiwan Semiconductor hit a new 52-week high and closed up 4.44%, while Nvidia added 2.13%.Cramer also pinpointed other action from Thursday's session he feels is positive, including gains in banks and consumer-oriented stocks like restaurants and retailers. He lauded the rise of housing names, noting that the sector broadly had been hit with downgrades recently. He also mentioned the \"monster move\" in small cap stocks, saying the Russell 2000 managed to break out.\"But the turn in Nvidia, which had become an eyesore of this market, is what gives me hope that the bubble talk may have finally run its course,\" Cramer said. \"At least for the moment.\"watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nvidia.

The crew of an American-flagged barge will lay cable to connect the Empire Wind farm to New York City's grid a milestone for an embattled sector. Bryan Derballa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmpire Wind will resume construction off the coast of New York, after a federal judge on Thursday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. The preliminary injunction issued by Judge Carl J. Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is the latest setback for President Donald Trump's efforts to stop offshore wind projects. Equinor, the Norwegian company developing Empire Wind, said it \"will now focus on safely restarting construction activities that were halted during the suspension period.\"\"In addition, the project will continue to engage with the U.S. government to ensure the safe, secure and responsible execution of its operations,\" Equinor said in a statement Thursday. The Department of Interior halted five wind projects off the East Coast, including Empire Wind, on Dec. 22 claiming national security concerns. Equinor in its lawsuit called the suspension \"the latest unlawful action\" by the Trump administration to stop the development of offshore wind.Empire Wind is expected to generate electricity for more than 500,000 homes by 2027, according to Equinor. It will provide power to New York City through a substation in Brooklyn. The other projects targeted by Trump are Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts, Revolution Wind off Rhode Island, and Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England. A federal judge on Monday allowed Revolution Wind to resume construction. A hearing on the suspension of Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is scheduled for Friday at 11 a.m. ET at the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia in Norfolk. Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, owned by Dominion Energy, is the largest project of its kind in the U.S. ",

    "body": "Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon speaks during an interview at the Economic Club of Washington, Oct. 30, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said Thursday the giant Wall Street investment bank is actively exploring opportunities in prediction markets, signaling growing institutional interest in a corner of finance that has gained increased traction among traders.\"The prediction markets are also super interesting,\" Solomon said on Goldman's fourth-quarter earnings call, according to a FactSet transcript. \"I personally met with the two big prediction companies and their leadership in the last two weeks and spent a couple of hours with each to learn more about that. We have a team of people here that are spending time with them and are looking at it.\"Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket allow investors to trade contracts tied to the outcome of world events, ranging from elections and economic data releases to policy decisions. Goldman's interest comes as prediction markets gain visibility amid debates over market transparency and regulatory boundaries.Some platforms operate under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a distinction that Solomon said makes the products look increasingly similar to traditional financial instruments.\"When you think about some of these activities, particularly when you look at some of the ones that are CFTC regulated, they look like derivative contract activities,\" said the 63-year old CEO, who's led Goldman since 2018. \"So I can certainly see opportunities where these cross into our business.\"Still, Solomon struck a note of caution on timing, pushing back on expectations that Wall Street's embrace of prediction markets will be rapid.\"I think there's a lot of reason to be excited and interested in these things,\" he said. \"But the pace of change might not be as quick and as immediate as some of the pundits are talking about. But I think they're important, real. And we're spending a lot of time.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship. ",

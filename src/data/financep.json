    "description": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations",
    "body": "Building a healthy romantic relationship takes time and intention. Over time, meaningful experiences, personal disclosures and authentic conversations create closeness and intimacy.To genuinely know someone, you must understand what matters to them — their likes and dislikes, passions, limits — and respecting those traits even when they differ from your own.In fact, many strong couples come to appreciate differences, recognizing that a person's history, quirks and tendencies are what make them unique. Here are eight phrases couples who are truly close use when talking about each other, and they should be relationship goals for all of us.1. 'They are who they are.'Your partner's mistakes aren't yours to carry, and their successes aren't yours to claim. They are their own person living alongside you, not an extension of you.Similar phrases:\"She's always been like that.\"\"I know that's one of his favorite things to do.\"2. 'I'm not surprised at all!'When you really understand your partner, you're not likely to be taken aback by what they say or do. If friends are shocked by a comment or action they make, you might just smile and shrug. Similar phrases: \"Oh yeah, that's my mate alright!\"\"That's totally her style.\"3. 'They're quirky like that.'Everyone has their own quirks, odd habits or routine preferences, from how they drink coffee to how they fold their towels. These are little things that no one else probably knows about them. But if you really know your partner, you notice those details and often find affection in them.Similar phrases:\"They sneeze like a train!\"\"His hiccups are kind of adorable.\"4. 'I trust them to be themselves.'Deep knowledge builds trust. When you know your partner, you trust them to act authentically and responsibly, whether you're together or apart.Similar phrases:\"She can be a little intense, but I trust her to make good choices.\"\"I know they'll be respectful.\" 5. 'That is a core value.'Intimacy means understanding your partner's fundamental ideas, beliefs and principles. Even when you disagree, you can acknowledge what truly matters to them without dismissing or demeaning it.Similar phrases:\"I know this is really important to them.\"\"He's very passionate about politics.\"6. 'They struggle with that.'Knowing someone deeply means understanding their fears, vulnerabilities and emotional triggers. When those struggles surface, you respond with empathy rather than judgment or defensiveness.Similar phrases:\"I know this is painful for them.\"\"I see her struggle and want to support her through it.\"7. 'I can't change them.'Knowing your partner means accepting that you can't — and shouldn't — try to change who they are, even if it's something you really dislike about them. True growth only happens if they choose it.Similar phrases:\"They'll change only if they want to.\"\"I accept that we see this differently, even if I don't like it.\" 8. 'I didn't know that about them!'Even in long-term relationships, there's always more to learn. When couples truly know each other, discovering something new feels like an opportunity to grow, not a threat.Similar phrases:\"I never realized they felt that way.\"\"Even though we've been married for years, I'm still learning new things about him.\"Want to get to know your partner better? Here are a few ways to start:Ask open-ended questions with genuine curiosity.Practice seeing situations from their perspective.Speak with respect during difficult conversations.Use physical touch, like hugging or holding hands, to bond.Show presence by putting down your phone, making eye contact and prioritizing time together.The answer to real intimacy is simple: You have to understand and choose each other, every day.Dr. Cortney S.

    "body": "I spent the last three years of my life researching money and wealth.During that time, I developed and battle-tested my own set of money principles, mindsets, tips, guardrails, and tools that helped me build a life that feels truly abundant.Here are 25 money rules I'm following to live a wealthy life.1. Avoid errorsYou can get pretty damn far by just avoiding errors: silly impulse purchases, avoidable debt, emotional investing, neglected responsibilities. Slow down, think clearly, and protect yourself from…yourself. 2. Never allow self-worth to be dictated by net worthMarkets fluctuate. Seasons change. Businesses rise and fall. Your sense of worth must be anchored in something deeper: character, values, relationships, interests, service.3. Track progress You can't improve what you don't track. Use a financial tracking and management tool to get a clear picture.4. Live below your meansManage financial expectations by keeping your lifestyle well below your means, creating slack in the system, and never matching an economic leap forward with a lifestyle one.5. Focus on value, impact, and serviceThe people who do the best financially are usually the ones who obsess over solving real problems, creating real impact, or genuinely helping others. 6. Treat income as the leverage pointThe return on improving your skills, expanding your scope, building new earning streams, or stepping into higher-impact roles dwarfs the difference between a 6% or 8% market return.7. Spend more for quality, not for brandWhen purchasing products for their utility, always invest a bit more and opt for quality. They'll last longer and create fewer headaches. 8. Ignore external expectationsThe world is full of silent scripts about what you should buy, achieve, or own by certain ages. Most of them are complete nonsense. Your life is not a race with anyone else. There are no timelines. You get to create your own.9. Debt is a tool, but use it sparinglyNever use debt to live a life you can't truly afford. A simple rule I follow: Never finance a luxury material purchase if you can't buy it twice over in cash. 10. Follow a 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases above a certain thresholdThis reduces impulse purchases and improves saving and investing rates. If you still want to buy the thing after 24 hours, go for it.11. Consider time and moneyThere are some investments that require money and no time (index funds) and some that require money and a lot of time (active multi-family real estate). Make sure you consider both when evaluating returns on an opportunity.12. Remember that returns come in many formsEarly in my career, I started making angel investments in early stage technology companies. On paper, it didn't make a lot of sense: I didn't have much excess capital and I knew that most of the startups would fail. But what they lacked in financial returns, they made up for in access, networks, and learning.13. Never think twice about investments in yourselfThere are a lot of things that look like expenses but are better regarded as investments in yourself: fitness, quality food, books, personal development, mental health, etc. You'll have more energy, feel better, and show up better in the world.14. Never use money to optimize the life out of your lifeWhen you start making more money, an entire menu of options materializes to reduce life's minor frictions. You can hire a personal chef, a full-time cleaner, a staff, or a driver. But sometimes that friction was what created meaning. Cherish the meaningful friction in your life.15. Check in with your partnerMoney trouble rarely comes from math. It comes from misalignment. A monthly financial check-in creates transparency, trust, and shared direction. Focus on values. What matters this month? What doesn't? 16. Focus on expanding your savings rateEven small percentage increases have an outsized long-term impact when you consider the magic of compounding.17. Work toward a 12-month emergency fundIt may seem excessive, but there's value in peace of mind. Knowing you have that financial security allows you to see and capitalize on exciting opportunities when they come. 18. Run quarterly disaster simulationsYour willingness to imagine bad times during good times is what allows you to safely navigate them. What if you lost your job? What if you had a major healthcare expense? 19. Don't waste energy Bestselling financial author Ramit Sethi says people ask $3 questions (can I buy this coffee?) when what truly matters are $30,000 questions (how can I earn twice as much?). I see friends spending countless hours thinking about optimizing credit card points when they could be thinking about how to get promoted three times in the next year. Unless it brings you joy — some people love the game of credit card points — skip them.20. Consider a barbell approach to your investmentsA barbell has weights on the ends with nothing in between. A barbell investment approach would have the vast majority of your investments on the safe, simple, and steady side (e.g., index funds, bonds, cash) with the remainder having a high-risk, high-reward profile (e.g., startups, crypto). The goal is to get some exposure to the high rewards of the risky stuff, but without taking on too much risk because it's a small portion of your overall financial pie.21. SimplifyAccounts everywhere, investments you don't understand, obligations you can't track. This is how people lose control. Automate, consolidate, and reduce unnecessary friction. The simpler the system, the more likely you are to stay the course.22. Automate payments for recurring expensesEliminate the cognitive burden to free up headspace for executing on bigger opportunities that can help you earn more.23. Conduct a quarterly auditI've found hundreds of dollars in monthly burn through random subscriptions I never use and didn't know I had. Use your financial tracking tool to find and eliminate these.24. Tip generously whenever you canBe frugal with yourself and generous with others. Generosity creates significantly more happiness than consumption. 25. Use money as a tool for more meaningful forms of wealthI believe the best uses of money are those that create one of four things in your life: time, experiences with people you love, purpose, or health.Sahil Bloom is an entrepreneur, investor, and inspirational writer and content creator who writes the biweekly newsletter, The Curiosity Chronicle.

    "body": "Five years before Abi Caswell opened her own bakery, she had never made a single cookie. Today, she owns and manages two bake shops that bring in seven figures in sales, she says.Caswell, 30, is the founder of Batter, a bakery with two storefronts in Hammond, Louisiana and in New Orleans.Her ultimate goal has always been to own her own business, she tells CNBC Make It. \"Since I was a kid, I always knew I wanted to work for myself,\" she says. \"I wanted to be able to control my schedule, and I wanted to make my own money.\"Her interest in sweet treats began as a teenager: Caswell worked at a local cupcake shop from ages 16 to 20 and \"loved everything about it,\" though she wasn't involved in the baking process.After graduating from Louisiana State University of Alexandria in 2018 with a major in business administration and a minor in marketing, Caswell moved to Hammond with her husband Trey.While working full-time as an executive assistant, Caswell started experimenting with baking her own cakes as a hobby.After she made a cake for a friend's husband, \"one of our mutual friends was like, 'This is so good. You've got to sell these. We have nothing like this here,'\" Caswell recalls. Caswell initially planned to stick to cakes and cupcakes, she says, but with the rise of popular cookie chains like Crumbl and Insomnia Cookies — neither of which had storefronts in Hammond at the time, Caswell notes — she decided to capitalize on the craze and make cookies the focus of her baking side hustle.Courtesy of Abi CaswellFrom home baker to business owner In fall 2021, Caswell started experimenting with cookie recipes with the help of her husband Trey, who works as a high school basketball coach. It took Caswell six months to develop her now-signature chocolate chip cookie recipe.\"We made so many batches of cookies that were terrible,\" she says. \"They would just never be quite right because I had no clue what I was doing. So every time I made one, I just learned something new about it.\"She began posting her bakes online and on social media, and says she quickly attracted a strong local customer base.In spring 2022, Caswell left her full-time executive assistant job to focus on baking.\"I was going to work from 8 to 5:30 [p.m.], and then I was coming home and baking till like 1 a.m.,\" she recalls. \"It was just too much.\"Around the time Caswell left her job, she landed a spot at the farmer's market in Hammond. Every Friday, she baked 500 cookies with her husband's help to sell at the market on Saturday, and they regularly sold out within 30 minutes, she says.\"That was when I realized, we've got to get in a store. Like, this is not sustainable. We have to find another way to sell,\" Caswell says.The Batter storefront in Hammond, LA.Courtesy of Abi Caswell.It wasn't easy for Caswell to secure a storefront in Hammond. Caswell developed a business plan to open a bakery with the help of her local small business development center, but she had no money saved at the time and several banks rejected her request for a loan.Finally, a bank representative helped her secure a $40,000 loan, for which Caswell says she had to put up her house as collateral, to rent a storefront and install baking appliances. In November 2022, Caswell officially opened her first Batter shop in downtown Hammond with a team of eight employees — a head baker and seven part-time bakery clerks. She had just turned 27 years old.Scaling the businessCaswell was \"running off adrenaline\" for the first few months, she says. She spent up to 18 hours a day working at the bakery to keep up with demand.\"We couldn't keep anything in stock,\" she says. \"We had an amazing time, but it was very, very stressful.\" Batter brought in mid-six figures in its first year of operation, according to Caswell, and she was able to pay off her bank loan entirely by May 2023.After the success of the Hammond location, Caswell opened another Batter location in New Orleans in December 2024 with the goal of reaching a larger customer base.Last year, the two locations collectively brought in seven figures in yearly sales, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Some of Caswell's cookie creationsCourtesy of Abi CaswellCaswell estimates that she sells over a thousand baked goods each day. Cookies, cupcakes, cakes, petit fours and pull-apart loaves are staples on Batter's menu year-round, she says, but they also offer seasonal treats like a king cake-inspired cookie for Mardi Gras. The bakery's signature chocolate chip cookies cost $3.75 each.Batter also sells cake balls, croissants and homemade pop tarts that Caswell sources from other local women-owned bakeries, and both locations serve coffee.Right now, Caswell is close to achieving a longtime dream: developing her signature chocolate chip cookie recipe into a wholesale mix.She says her first drop of 150 bags of cookie mix, which she sells for $14.99 each, quickly sold out online, and her goal is to get the product into grocery stores this year.\"Before I ever opened Batter, I always said to my husband, 'We're going to be on these shelves one day,'\" she says.Developing a mix will make her cookies \"more accessible,\" rather than being tied to a storefront, Caswell says.'Never truly off the clock'One trait that Caswell believes is crucial to her success is adaptability.\"A lot of being a business owner is what your tolerance level is for your plans to change, for things to pop up and things to go wrong,\" she says.Running both bakeries hasn't been easy – \"every day there's something new going on,\" Caswell says.Caswell currently doesn't have a cake decorator for the New Orleans store, so she's filling the position herself until she can hire a new decorator.Caswell typically splits her time between both stores, which are an hour's drive apart, but since her New Orleans store is understaffed, Caswell has been working at that location \"pretty much full-time\" every day of the week, she says. That's the \"joy of being a small business owner,\" she jokes: you're \"never truly off the clock.\"Caswell holds a bag of her signature chocolate chip cookie mix.Courtesy of Abi CaswellOnline marketing has always been a key element of her business, Caswell says: it's how she reached many of her early customers, and she credits her social media reach for boosting her business to this day.Caswell currently has almost 300,000 followers on her TikTok account, where she posts about her daily routine, shares behind-the-scenes baking videos and opens up about the challenges of running her bakeries.Beyond promoting her bakes, Caswell's goal is to show her audience what it really takes to run a small business.\"I try to be as honest as I can be on social media,\" she says. \"I really think that people don't understand the mental undertaking, but also the time commitment.\" When you own a business, \"there is no real downtime,\" Caswell says. \"Even when I'm on vacation, if the stores are open, I'm on the clock.\"Most of the time, \"the losses hurt more than the wins feel good,\" she continues, but Caswell's goal for this year is to give herself a chance \"to relish what we've done.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Delroy Lindo, finally an Academy Award-nominated actor, only had to wait five decades to earn the honor — overcoming \"strategic missteps\" that once threatened to derail his career along the way, he's said.Lindo, 73, is a longtime character actor whose appearances on film, television and stage have earned him critical acclaim, even as his industry's highest honors eluded him. On Thursday, Lindo earned his first Oscar nomination, in the Best Supporting Actor category, for his work in the 2025 blockbuster \"Sinners.\" The nomination comes five years after some of the actor's supporters complained that he'd been \"snubbed\" by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his work in the Spike Lee film \"Da 5 Bloods.\"Lindo was \"profoundly disappointed\" by getting shut out of the 2021 Oscar nominations for that role, he told Entertainment Weekly on Thursday. Lee, an Oscar-winner himself, also expressed disappointment over Lindo's lack of awards recognition, commenting in March 2021 on Instagram that it \"does not take away from the impact of his work that spans decades.\"Before his Oscars nomination, the actor had a long, well-respected career that included acclaimed performances in notable films such as \"The Cider House Rules\" and the Lee-directed \"Malcolm X\" and \"Crooklyn.\" Still, Lindo has lamented his career floundering for multiple years in the mid-1990s as he developed a reputation as being a \"difficult\" actor to work with, he's said.\"I made some strategic missteps. One of the biggest missteps was probably thinking that I was important,\" Lindo told The Hollywood Reporter in March 2021, discussing why high-profile roles \"dried up\" for him nearly three decades ago. He'd bring passion and intensity to his work, occasionally leading him to butt heads with directors when their creative visions didn't fully align, he said.At one point, Lindo walked away from a Lee-produced film over concerns about the script, leading to a nearly 25-year pause between collaborations for the actor and director, Lindo told GQ in April 2021. He might've walked away from acting altogether if fellow actor Denzel Washington hadn't talked him out of the idea, telling Lindo he was \"too good\" an actor to quit, Lindo said at a \"Sinners\" screening in December 2025, according to Deadline.\"That period had to do with these various missteps that I made, which resulted in perhaps being seen as less viable as a film actor, less desirable,\" Lindo told GQ. \"Was that frustrating and painful? Absolutely. I was playing catch-up.\"Ultimately, Lindo came to the realization that he needed to adjust his approach to collaboration, rather than hoping his acting talent would be enough to keep landing him high-profile work, he told THR.\"I thought it was a meritocracy, that good work would beget more good work. No, not quite,\" said Lindo. \"I also was not as strategic or as diplomatic as I could have been in certain situations. I needed to communicate in a way that could not be perceived as either ungrateful or bigheaded.\"Communication expert: 'Don't think of them as conflict conversations'Effective communication is a key skill that can make or break anyone's career, some experts say. Mastering the art of having tough conversations at work — like raising a constructive criticism with a colleague or respectfully disagreeing with your boss — can help you get ahead in your career without alienating others, workplace expert Henna Pryor told CNBC Make It on Aug. 21.Try reframing those conversations as opportunities to seek clarity, rather than as confrontations, Pryor recommended. \"So much comes down to how we prime and frame [conversations],\" she said. \"I don't think of them as conflict conversations. I think of them as clarify conversations. I am seeking clarity about an issue, about why we're disagreeing.\"Lindo didn't specify exactly how he's adapted his approach to be more diplomatic when expressing his creative opinions at work, but he's returned to landing notable acting roles. In addition to his roles in \"Da 5 Bloods\" and \"Sinners,\" Lindo also landed a recurring role on the Emmy Award-nominated Paramount+ series \"The Good Fight\" between 2017 and 2021.Now, Lindo is up for an award that many actors spend their entire lives and careers chasing. After enduring the ups and downs of his own career, Lindo says he's still letting the honor sink in.\"It feels terrific,\" Lindo said on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" on Friday. \"I'm still processing, if I'm really honest, but it's wonderful.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "For many Americans, $1 million is seen as a savings benchmark for retirement. But in 32 U.S. states, the estimated minimum needed to retire at 65 is less than that.That's according to a state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates, which estimates the minimum household savings needed to retire at 65 and cover essential living expenses over 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health care. To determine savings minimums in each state, GOBankingRates looked at cost of living data for retirees 65 and older from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, minus average Social Security income. It then used a 4% annual withdrawal rate to estimate the total amount of savings needed to cover remaining expenses.These estimates focus on the minimum needed to cover day-to-day living costs, not a comfortable retirement. They exclude discretionary spending and don't account for factors like inheritances or paid-off mortgages.The analysis is also based on household expenses, meaning that retirement costs could be supported by more than one person's savings or income for a given home.Even so, basic living costs in retirement can exceed what many people expect. About half of U.S. workers say they'll need at least $500,000 to retire comfortably — not just cover essentials — according to a 2025 Bankrate survey.Here's a look at the U.S. states where the estimated minimum savings needed to retire at 65 comes in below $1 million.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "A federal agent cordons off the area as people gather at the scene of a shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 24, 2026.Tim Evans | ReutersMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Saturday called on President Donald Trump to end sweeping Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the state after a second fatal shooting this month by federal agents in Minneapolis.\"I just spoke with the White House after another horrific shooting by federal agents this morning,\" Walz wrote in a post on X. \"Minnesota has had it. This is sickening. The President must end this operation. Pull the thousands of violent, untrained officers out of Minnesota. Now.\"At a briefing Saturday afternoon, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said authorities had identified the victim as a 37-year-old white male and Minneapolis resident, adding that the man had no known criminal history beyond traffic citations. The man was later identified as ICU nurse Alex Pretti by his parents and the Associated Press.An undated handout image of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by U.S. immigration agents as they tried to detain him in Minneapolis, Minnesota, obtained by Reuters on Jan. 25, 2026.U.S. Department Of Veterans Affairs | Via Reuters\"The only interaction that we are aware of with law enforcement has been for traffic tickets, and we believe he is a lawful gun owner with a permit,\" O'Hara said, though he noted details surrounding the encounter remain under review.O'Hara said his department has been in touch with the Department of Homeland Security, but that it has not provided specific details around the incident itself.The latest shooting adds to a tense standoff between Minnesota authorities and federal immigration agents that has persisted for weeks. Earlier this month, an ICE agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old Minneapolis resident, during an enforcement action, which triggered widespread protests and accelerated political backlash against the federal operation.U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks by a screen showing an image of a handgun that the Department of Homeland Security says was recovered from a man who was shot during his arrest in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during a press conference at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) National Response Coordination Center in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 24, 2026. Nathan Howard | Reuters\"At 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis against an illegal alien wanted for violent assault,\" a DHS spokesperson said in a statement on X. \"An individual approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, seen here.\"Federal agents attempted to disarm the suspect but the suspect violently resisted, DHS said: \"More details on the armed struggle are forthcoming.\"About 200 protestors arrived at the scene, the department said, and \"crowd control measures were deployed for the safety of the public and law enforcement.\"Customs and Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino said in a news conference Saturday afternoon that the federal agent involved in the shooting has been with the agency for eight years.Tear gas clouds during clashes between federal agents and community members at the scene of a shooting involving federal immigration agents in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on Jan. 24, 2026. Tim Evans | ReutersTrump responded to the shooting in a Truth Social post, defending the federal operation and condemning criticism of his immigration enforcement surge.\"This is the gunman's gun, loaded (with two additional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren't they allowed to protect ICE Officers?\" he wrote. \"The Mayor and the Governor called them off? It is stated that many of these Police were not allowed to do their job, that ICE had to protect themselves — Not an easy thing to do!\"In a news conference Saturday evening, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem portrayed Pretti as a man intent on violence against federal agents: \"This looks like a situation where an individual arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.\"When asked if the 37-year-old ever pointed his weapon at federal agents, Noem sidestepped the question and instead asked why an individual would bring a gun to a protest.But despite Noem's claims, multiple videos by bystanders and observers at the scene of the shooting published on social media appear to tell a different story. In one video obtained by The Associated Press, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and shouting profanities at agents on Nicollet Avenue.The video shows an officer shoving a person who is wearing a brown jacket, skirt and black tights and carrying a water bottle. That person reaches out for a man and the two link up, embracing. The man, wearing a brown jacket and black hat, seems to be holding his phone up toward the officer.The same officer shoves the man in his chest and the two, still embracing, fall back.The video then shifts to a different part of the street and then comes back to the two individuals unlinking from each other. The video shifts focus again and then shows three officers surrounding the man.Soon, at least seven officers surround the man. One is on the man's back, and another, who appears to have a canister in his hand, strikes a blow to the man's chest. Several officers try to bring the man's arms behind his back as he appears to resist. As they pull his arms, his face is briefly visible on camera. The officer with the canister strikes the man near his head several times.A shot rings out, but with officers surrounding the man, it's not clear from where the shot came. Multiple officers back off of the man after the shot. More shots are heard. Officers back away and the man lies motionless on the street.In another video, seen by CNBC, it appears a federal officer removes a weapon from the man on the ground before any shots are fired. The DHS said it is planning to investigate the shooting, rather than the FBI, two sources told MS Now.In response to a request from Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt, Walz on Saturday afternoon agreed to activate the Minnesota National Guard to support first responders. \"The Minnesota National Guard's role is to work in support of local law enforcement and emergency responders, providing additional resources. Their presence is meant to help create a secure environment where all Minnesotans can exercise their rights safely, including the right to peacefully protest,\" according to the sheriff department's statement.Minneapolis officials urged the public to avoid the area and remain calm as local law enforcement and state patrol units arrived to separate protesters from the ICE personnel, The Minnesota Star Tribune reported.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., joined the governor's call for ICE to end its operations in Minnesota.\"The world is watching. Thousands of citizens stopped and harassed. Local police no longer able to do their work. Kids hiding. Schools closed. Get ICE out of Minnesota NOW,\" she said in an X post.But Trump administration officials placed the blame for the shooting on the armed man. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called Pretti a \"domestic terrorist,\" claiming that he \"tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and CEO of Ford Jim Farley clap, as President Trump visits a Ford production center, in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersDETROIT — The only consistency has been inconsistency for the U.S. automotive industry during the first half of this decade — a trend that's expected to continue amid challenging market conditions in 2026.The U.S. auto sector — a crucial driver of the economy estimated around 4.8% of America's gross domestic product — has endured rolling crises since the Covid-19 pandemic shuttered U.S. assembly plants in early 2020. The global health crisis was followed by yearslong supply chain issues, semiconductor chip shortages, political whipsawing, tariffs and other challenges for all-electric and autonomous vehicles.Automakers have been surprisingly resilient during the challenges, but those issues are now combining with more traditional industry problems of affordability and slowing consumer demand. That's all creating a more challenging environment for automakers in 2026.\"We've got to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\" Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker told CNBC during an interview. \"That's the situation that we're in right now.\"Other executives have expressed similar sentiments as they prepare for a \"new\" U.S. automotive industry: one that's more expensive, smaller and, by many means, less predictable.Automotive forecasters are calling for steady to lower sales this year, despite industry sales only hitting 16.3 million units last year. That was the highest level since the pandemic in 2020, but down from more than 17 million for five consecutive years before the global health crisis, according to industry data.\"Anyone in the auto industry … we should all be very careful about consumer demand,\" Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley said Jan. 13 during an event for the Detroit Auto Show. \"That's really important.\"'Affordability crisis'One of the largest industry issues — and one that's a culmination of many factors — is the affordability of new vehicles. New vehicles prices have climbed; the average transaction price was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from less than $38,747 to begin 2020, according to Cox Automotive.Average transaction prices historically increased on average 3.2% year-over-year, but from 2020-2022 that average nearly tripled to 9%.\"Pandemic-induced production constraints and supply chain chaos didn't just disrupt the market temporarily. They fundamentally restructured pricing dynamics. This elevated plateau is now the new baseline, which has the market anchored at these higher price points,\" said Erin Keating, Cox Automotive senior director of economic and industry insights.It's not just vehicle prices hitting consumers' wallets either. They're also dealing with inflation, increases in maintenance and repairs, and 13% annual average increases for insurance over the past five years, according to Cox Automotive.\"The cumulative weight of all these increases has pushed total vehicle ownership costs beyond reach for many middle- and lower-income households, constraining market access and accelerating the affordability crisis,\" said Cox Automotive interim chief economist Jeremy Robb. Cox Automotive reports it took 33.7 weeks of median household income to buy the average new vehicle in November 2019. Now it's 36.3 weeks. That's down from a record high of 42.2 weeks during the pandemic, but still means vehicles cost thousands of dollars more than historic levels.David Christ, Toyota Motor's U.S. sales chief, warned that the current tariff and trade environment will cause prices to continue to increase this year, despite the concerns.\"On our end, we're just taking it month-to-month, and we're watching the competitors closely,\" Christ said on a call with reporters earlier this month. \"But we feel prices are going to go up for us and for our competitors.\" To combat the slower sales and affordability challenges, Toyota and other automakers have said they will refocus on lower-priced vehicle models — a change from recent years when automakers prioritized their most expensive, highly profitable vehicles during supply chain shortages.\"Every automaker must face the reality that the American market has changed for the foreseeable future,\" said Lance Woelfer, head of American Honda Motor's U.S. sales.For Honda, Woelfer said that means increasing production on less expensive trims as well as focusing on certified pre-owned vehicles, which are used but backed by company warranties. For others, such as Ford, that could include reentering abandoned segments such as sedans, according to its CEO.\"Never say never,\" Farley told reporters during the event in Detroit. \"The sedan market is very vibrant. It's not that there isn't a market there. It's just we couldn't find a way to compete and be profitable. Well, we may find a way to do that.\"Ford sells sedans outside of the U.S. but exited the domestic market with the cancellation of the Michigan-made Fusion in 2020. It also eliminated the larger Taurus sedan and smaller Ford Fiesta and Ford Focus before that.Ford's crosstown rivals General Motors and Stellantis have largely exited the traditional U.S. sedan market as well.Affordability concerns are generating attention from outside the automotive industry as well. A Senate committee led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, requested a hearing with CEOs from Ford, GM and Stellantis about affordability and other issues in the automotive industry. The hearing was scheduled for Jan. 14 but was postponed amid scheduling conflicts and general pushback from Ford about Tesla CEO Elon Musk not attending the meeting, according to a letter from the company to the subcommittee that was obtained by Politico.2025 Jeep Grand Cherokees are displayed for sale at Larry H. Miller Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and Ram dealership in Thornton, Colorado on Wednesday, Jan. 7, 2026. Hyoung Chang | The Denver Post | Getty Images'Prepared for surprises'Automakers are also bracing this year for potentially volatile U.S. regulations and trade negotiations, such as the upcoming renegotiating of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that's scheduled for later this year.Currently, automakers can import new vehicles from South Korea or Japan with lower tariffs than from Canada or Mexico, depending on their U.S. content. The Trump administration has reached trade deals on vehicles with those Asian countries but not its neighbors to the north and south. Depending on the outcome of those discussions, USMCA could be a tailwind for automakers that have a lot of production in the U.S.\"Looking to 2026, our cycle work would suggest that autos would have a difficult time outperforming given a relatively flat y/y volume outlook. However, we see reasons for optimism for US [automakers],\" UBS analyst Joseph Spak wrote last month in an investor note. Wall Street will begin getting its first outlooks from automakers this week beginning with GM announcing its fourth quarter and year-end earnings on Tuesday, followed by Tesla on Wednesday. GM CEO Mary Barra earlier this month reconfirmed that the automaker expects 2026 will be better than 2025.  GM's 2025 guidance included adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.But depending on the automaker, Wall Street analysts expect mixed results for the U.S. industry as it continues to deal with uncertain times.\"It is hard to imagine how 2026 could bring more external shocks and share price divergence than 2025 but, with no visible end to industry disruption, we are also prepared for surprises, impairments and strategic shifts,\" Jefferies analyst Owen Paterson said in an investor note this month.",

    "body": "About a decade ago, Andy Hill was looking for a change.  Hill, now 44, was feeling burnt out at his job in corporate events marketing. While the frequent travel and weekend events were fun while Hill was in his 20s, the gig had begun to lose its luster after he got married and started a family.In 2016, Hill started a side gig hosting the \"Marriage Kids and Money\" podcast, where he and his guests discussed their journeys and stories around family finances. It was around this time that he became interested in FIRE, which is short for \"financial independence, retire early.\"The strategy generally involves saving a high percentage of your income in service of aggressively investing. Save enough, and you can either buy income-producing investments, such as real estate, or begin withdrawing from your stock portfolio to replace income from a 9-to-5 job. Hill was all in. \"I was very interested in FIRE, like traditional FIRE, hard-charging, get me out of here,\" Hill tells CNBC Make It, referring to an early model of FIRE that prioritized slashing expenses to maximize savings and retire quickly. \"I want to save as much as possible, and I don't care what happens now. That did not work well for my life.\"Hill and his wife were saving upwards of 50% of their dual income, often cutting out many of life's niceties to do it. They shopped at lower-cost grocery stores and sold anything around the house they determined they didn't need. If family, friends or colleagues invited them to events that didn't align with a strict budget, they said, \"no thanks.\"In many ways, it worked — the couple wiped out $50,000 in debt and built a portfolio worth $500,000. But when Hill suggested saving even more in order to retire as quickly as he could, money discussions started turning into money fights, he says. \"We did the 'super saver' thing for a while, and that led us into marriage counseling,\" Hill says.Talking in counseling gave Hill and his wife a new approach to managing their marriage — one built on compromise, communication and empathizing with each other's feelings. They also took on a new approach to money, what he and some other financial pros call \"Coast FIRE\": Once you save enough such that your portfolio can grow to where you want it in retirement, you take your foot off the gas, savings-wise, and \"coast.\" It's a philosophy he shares in his new book, \"Own Your Time: 10 Financial Steps to Put Your Family First and Escape the Corporate Grind.\" For couples in particular, he says, taking this approach allows you spend more money — or time — pursuing the things you value in life together. \"[It's about] starting from that position of dreaming personally and then sharing those dreams with your spouse, asking them to do the same, so that you can come together for some cool family goals that work for both of you,\" Hill says. Finding middle groundHill discovered that his aggressive FIRE strategy meant sacrificing on both ends. Not only was the pressure to cut back on spending limiting what the family could do, but his hope to bank as much money as possible meant that work was taking him away from the people he loved.\"I was traveling during my children's birthdays, working with supervisors that graded my performance on how late I could stay at the office and overall, I was giving a lot more time to work than to my health or my family,\" he says.Still, abandoning the strategy seemingly threw a wrench into Hill's hopes of leaving his job for good — his plan was to save enough to invest in rental properties for passive income, he says. Hill's wife suggested that he take the money he'd been saving for rental property and use it to turn his side hustle — something he enjoyed much more than his day job — into a full-fledged business. \"It was this epiphany moment,\" he says. Rather than waiting for the early retirement finish line, he could use some of his savings to buy time and space to pursue his passion. Hill kept his podcast and added financial coaching and speaking engagements, going into business for himself full time in 2020. When he left his job, he was making about $180,000 a year working 40 to 50 hours a week. These days, he pays himself about $100,000, but works about 20 to 25 hours a week. As for his savings rate, \"We found a middle ground,\" Hill says. \"We said, 'Well, we can continue to save and invest, but maybe let's dial it back by like a cool 20, 25% and then dial some of that back into our lifestyle.'\"Unlocking time freedomHill says his shift to a Coast FIRE lifestyle allowed him and his wife to focus on time freedom. If you can build enough of a retirement nest egg, the thinking goes, you can let it grow on the back burner and use money you would have been socking away to enrich your life, either in the form of spending more or finding a different approach to work. \"Do we want to inflate our lifestyle and just have more fun, or do we both want to work less?\" Hill says. \"Wouldn't it be cool to work 20 to 25 hours a week until we're in our 60s and then just enjoy more time now?\"Hill and his wife have both taken the latter approach. The couple had about $500,000 saved by age 40, and have since pumped their net worth up to over $1 million. They've used their financial flexibility to scale back at work. While Hill built his business, his wife realized that she was tired of working for clients at all hours at her marketing agency. \"She said, 'I've always wanted to work with my hands. I've always wanted to do something where when the work day was done, I was done,'\" Hill says. So she went back to school to become an esthetician. Now she works part-time at a dermatologist's office and goes back to her own life when the office closes. The goal, Hill says, is to find the balance between saving for the future and living a fulfilling life now. The two spend Mondays sipping coffee after sending the kids to school and exercising together. Hill cooks family dinner twice a week. They've taken dance classes together and are learning pickleball. \"With that extra 20 to 25 hours that we're not working, we can take care of our health,\" Hill says. \"We can invest time in our marriage so that we're actually having conversations with each other and not being surprised by arguments. We can be more present parents and be there for the important moments for our kids.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "For many Americans, buying your first home feels like a rite of passage. And while rising home prices and high mortgage rates may make it more difficult to put down roots, there are still favorable markets for first-time buyers that are close to major metropolitan areas like Washington, D.C., and Cleveland, Ohio.A recent report from Realtor.com ranks the best markets for first-time homebuyers. To determine the top markets, the report analyzed over 10,000 locations within the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S., giving each a score out of 10 based on the following components: Affordability (25%)Local amenities (25%)Housing availability (10%)Young peers (10%)Commute quality (10%)Economic health (10%)Housing outlook (10%) Realtor.com then determined the 10 highest-ranking markets with at least 500 active for-sale listings from December 2024 to November 2025. Many of the markets from last year's ranking performed well this year and remain good options for first-time buyers, including Granite City, Illinois, and Birmingham, Alabama, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"Affordability remains good, the amenities in the cities remain good and the fact that these prices are remaining attainable for younger owners or would-be owners is really impressive,\" Berner says. On the other hand, this year's ranking saw all Florida markets drop out of the top 10 best places for first-time homebuyers. Berner says the overall Realtor.com forecast for 2026, in terms of price and sales growth, is weak in Florida markets. \"We're expecting a pretty slow year in 2026 in Florida,\" Berner says. \"Even though there are good options there, we don't recommend those this year because we anticipate those homes actually falling in value.\" The report states that the fall in the value of Florida homes is due to softer prices and home sales projections. \"The main driver of price softness in Florida over the past several years is a growing supply of homes for sale at the same time that demand for those homes has weakened a bit,\" Berner said in a 2025 report. Rochester, N.Y., is the No. 1 market for first-time homebuyers Rochester, New York.Copyright Matt Kazmierski | Moment | Getty ImagesRochester, New York, ranked as the top market for first-time homebuyers with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in the New York city is $139,900, which is below the national median of $399,950, according to Realtor.com. Realtor.com forecasts that in 2026, 25- to 34-year-olds will make up 21.3% of homeowners in Rochester. \"Rochester has quite a fair share of listings on the market, so there are a lot of options for buyers,\" Berner says. \"It's a nice town that is also a good place to raise a family.\"The best markets for first-time homebuyersRochester, N.Y.Harrisburg, Pa.Granite City, Ill.Birmingham, Ala.North Little Rock, Ark.Syracuse, N.Y.Baltimore, Md. St. Louis Park, Minn.Pittsburgh, Pa.Garfield Heights, OhioHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, ranked second among the top markets for first-time homebuyers in 2026 with a score of 9.3. The median listing price for a home in Harrisburg is $151,999.Harrisburg, PennsylvaniaRichard T. Nowitz | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesSimilar to Rochester, Berner says Harrisburg is seeing significant growth and offers options for buyers. \"They have more inventory than most places in that part of the country,\" he adds. Having so many midsize markets in the top 10, Berner says, points to the fact that these markets are becoming more popular than really big cities, but aren't necessarily totally rural areas. \"There are a lot of opportunities for young homebuyers to be part of that trend and build up some of these cities even further with young families,\" he says.

But the shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis is now threatening to derail the funding package as a growing chorus of Democrats warn they will oppose it unless funding for the Department of Homeland Security is stripped out. \"Democrats sought common sense reforms in the Department of Homeland Security spending bill, but because of Republicans' refusal to stand up to President Trump, the DHS bill is woefully inadequate to rein in the abuses of ICE. I will vote no,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday night. \"Senate Democrats will not provide the votes to proceed to the appropriations bill if the DHS funding bill is included,\" he said.The funding package needs 60 votes to overcome the filibuster and pass the Senate. Republicans hold a 53-47 vote majority in the Senate, meaning Democratic support will be needed to pass the measure. Of the 47, two are independents who caucus with Democrats.

Here's why it matters for MoscowTrump's latest geopolitical gambits all lead back to ChinaTrump says anything less than U.S. control of Greenland is 'unacceptable' ahead of talksSome Democrats were already opposed to the funding measure, which, in addition to DHS, includes the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Labor; Housing and Urban Development; Transportation; Education; State and Treasury. But Pretti's death is rapidly galvanizing Democratic opposition to the measure. \"Federal agents cannot murder people in broad daylight and face zero consequences,\" said Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., on X Saturday. \"I will NOT support the DHS bill as it stands. The DHS bill needs to be split off from the larger funding package before the Senate—Republicans must work with us to do that.\"It's unclear if the Senate can split the DHS portion off from the rest of the funding bill to minimize a partial shutdown. While the House passed the DHS bill separately from the rest of the bills, they were all tied together into one bill to be sent to the Senate, meaning the majority Republicans would need to support splitting the bill up. The House, which left Washington last week for a pre-scheduled recess, would likely need to return to approve any changes the Senate makes. Complicating matters further is a massive snowstorm over Washington, D.C., and wide stretches of the U.S. The Senate canceled votes on Monday due to the storm, shortening an already tight timeline to avoid a shutdown.

Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that the U.S. would impose 100% tariff on goods sold in the U.S. if the country strikes a trade deal with China.\"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A.,\" the president wrote in a Truth Social post.Trump also suggested Saturday that China would try to use Canada to try to avoid paying U.S. tariffs. \"If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken,\" Trump stated.Earlier this month, Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that Canada and China reached a preliminary deal to remove trade barriers and lower tariffs. Under the tentative agreement, Beijing cut tariffs on some Canadian agricultural products, while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles, applying the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Just a week ago, Trump had voiced his support for Carney on the China trade deal.\"That's what he should be doing. It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal. If you can get a deal with China, you should do that,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Jan. 16.\"Canada's government has transparently outlined that the agreement with China is fundamentally about domestic consumers and businesses in Canada and China, not schemes aimed at other markets,\" Matthew Holmes, executive vice president and chief of public policy of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement.\"A structured and stable relationship with China or any other country ... are not to replace our deeply rooted relationship with the United States that continues to be overwhelmingly good for workers, consumers and North American competitiveness,\" he added.   The White House and the office of the Canadian prime minister didn't immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Duties aren't imposed on most Canadian exports under the Canada-U.S.-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA), but some goods, including steel, copper and certain autos and auto parts, are subject to U.S. tariffs. The new tariff threat comes one day after Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace\" after Carney's address at the World Economic Forum in Davos that cautioned against economic coercion by the world's superpowers.In his speech, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers.Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but the details hadn't been worked out.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's pay package of up to $1 trillion highlights the continued escalation in CEO compensation, even as worker pay slows and rewards to shareholders remain mixed, according to several studies.  Already, Musk is the richest person on the planet with a net worth that tops $660 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk saw his 2018 Tesla pay package -- now valued at over $130 billion -- reinstated in December, and his company SpaceX looks set to for a potential public offering in 2026. Those two events could well put Musk on his way to becoming the world's first trillionaire this year. In addition, his new pay package, valued at up to $1 trillion, could also start paying out over the next decade.While Musk may be an outlier, his stock-fueled gains highlight the booming compensation and wealth gains of CEOs in recent decades that has been driven by rising stock markets and a broader adoption of stock-centric pay packages Over the past 50 years, top CEO compensation has climbed 1,094%, according to the Economic Policy Institute. That compares to a 26% increase in typical worker compensation. Median total compensation for S&P 500 CEO's was $17.1 million in 2024, up nearly 10% from 2023, according to Equilar, a corporate analytics firm. CEOs now make 192 times more than the average employee, up from a 186 to 1 ratio in 2023. Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersDriving the acceleration in CEO pay is a shift in the types of stock awards used to incentivize and reward corporate chiefs. CEO compensation typically includes four categories: salaries, long-term incentives, short-term incentives and perks. Long-term and short-term incentives are largely stock awards, and make up far and away the largest portion of CEO compensation. Stock awards accounted for 72% of CEO pay packages in 2024, with the median value increasing 15% that year, according to Equilar. Musk's trillion-dollar pay package, for instance, doesn't include any salary. The potential value of the $1 trillion would come entirely from stock awards pegged to various targets. For Musk to get the full payout, Tesla must hit key milestones, including certain market capitalization and operational achievements. He could still earn billions in stock even if Tesla doesn't meet all the targets.\"Milestone achievements built into CEO pay packages could be the norm in the future,\" said Amit Batish, senior director marketing at Equilar.Company boards and CEOs themselves say that because their pay is tied closely to stock performance, their compensation reflects the larger wealth created for shareholders. The CEO only does well if shareholders do well, they argue. If stocks plummet, CEO's can also see big pay drops. Others others argue that CEO's have only a partial impact on their companies' share price. A 2021 MSCI study of top executive pay between 2006 and 2020 found a weak correlation between higher CEO pay and company performance. \"This notion that the guy in the corner office is somehow almost single handedly responsible for company value, and everyone else is just little minions who don't contribute much of anything ... everyone can see that is not true,\" said Sarah Anderson, at the Institute for Policy Studies. Tesla's Optimus robots walk on the day of an unveiling event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 10, 2024, in this still image taken from a video.Tesla | Via ReutersAccording to the 2021 MSCI study, average performing CEO's took home only 4% less in realized pay than top-performing CEOs. More importantly, CEO's with the lowest awarded pay saw the strongest returns for shareholders.\"When we measured pay and performance against CEO tenure, we found little evidence that high CEO pay achieved this lofty goal of CEO incentivization,\" according to MSCI, an investment research firm.Since the 1990s, company boards have shifted away from stock options, which incentivize short-term performance, with stock awards, which boards argue are driven by longer-term incentives. Shareholders of publicly traded companies can now vote in an advisory capacity on CEO pay, known as \"say on pay\" votes, but company boards have final say when it comes to compensation packages.While restraining CEO pay has proven ineffective, given the natural \"ratcheting up\" of median CEO pay by board compensation committees, some economists advocate more stock awards for employees to help close the gap between employees and CEOs. Employee Stock Ownership Plans, or ESOPs, for instance, are qualified retirement plans that give employees shares in the company through a trust. Employees who can partake in ESOPs tend to end up with better financial security, said Loren Rodgers, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership. That in turn benefits their companies, he said. \"Employee-owned businesses are more productive,\" Rodgers said. \"They're more able to recruit people. People quit at lower rates. They're more competitive.\"Watch the video above to hear more about the uptick in CEO pay and what is driving these massive pay outs.",

    "body": "watch nowThe sudden collapse last fall of a string of American companies backed by private credit has thrust a fast-growing and opaque corner of Wall Street lending into the spotlight.Private credit, also known as direct lending, is a catch-all term for lending done by nonbank institutions. The practice has been around for decades but surged in popularity after post-2008 financial crisis regulations discouraged banks from serving riskier borrowers. That growth — from $3.4 trillion in 2025 to an estimated $4.9 trillion by 2029 — and the September bankruptcies of auto-industry firms Tricolor and First Brands have emboldened some prominent Wall Street figures to raise alarms about the asset class.JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned in October that problems in credit are rarely isolated: \"When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\" Billionaire bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach a month later accused private lenders of making \"garbage loans\" and predicted that the next financial crisis will come from private credit.While fears about private credit have subsided in recent weeks in the absence of more high-profile bankruptcies or losses disclosed by banks, they haven't lifted completely.Companies that are most linked to the asset class, such as Blue Owl Capital, as well as alternative asset giants Blackstone and KKR, still trade well below their recent highs.The rise of private creditPrivate credit is \"lightly regulated, less transparent, opaque, and it's growing really fast, which doesn't necessarily mean there's a problem in the financial system, but it is a necessary condition for one,\" Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in an interview. Private credit's boosters, such as Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, have said that the rise of private credit has fueled American economic growth by filling the gap left by banks, served investors with good returns and made the broader financial system more resilient.Big investors including pensions and insurance companies with long-term liabilities are seen as better sources of capital for multiyear corporate loans than banks funded by short-term deposits, which can be flighty, private credit operators told CNBC. But concerns about private credit — which tend to come from the sector's competitors in public debt — are understandable given its attributes.After all, it's the asset managers making private credit loans that are the ones valuing them, and they can be motivated to delay the recognition of potential borrower problems. \"The double-edged sword of private credit\" is that the lenders have \"really strong incentives to monitor for problems,\" said Duke Law professor Elisabeth de Fontenay.\"But by the same token … they do in fact have incentives to try to disguise risk, if they think or hope that there might be some way out of it down the road,\" she said.De Fontenay, who has studied the impact of private equity and debt on corporate America, said her biggest concern is that it's difficult to know if private lenders are accurately marking their loans, she said.\"This is a market that is extraordinarily large and that is reaching more and more businesses, and yet it's not a public market,\" she said. \"We're not entirely sure if the valuations are correct.\"In the November collapse of home improvement firm Renovo, for instance, BlackRock and other private lenders deemed its debt to be worth 100 cents on the dollar until shortly before marking it down to zero.Defaults among private loans are expected to rise this year, especially as signs of stress among less creditworthy borrowers emerge, according to a Kroll Bond Rating Agency report.And private credit borrowers are increasingly relying on payment-in-kind options to forestall defaulting on loans, according to Bloomberg, which cited valuation firm Lincoln International and its own data analysis.Ironically, while they are competitors, part of the private credit boom has been funded by banks themselves.Finance frenemiesAfter investment bank Jefferies, JPMorgan and Fifth Third disclosed losses tied to the auto industry bankruptcies in the fall, investors learned the extent of this form of lending. Bank loans to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs, reached $1.14 trillion last year, per the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.On Jan. 13, JPMorgan disclosed for the first time its lending to nonbank financial firms as part of its fourth-quarter earnings presentation. The category tripled to about $160 billion in loans in 2025 from about $50 billion in 2018.Banks are now \"back in the game\" because deregulation under the Trump administration will free up capital for them to expand lending, Moody's Zandi said. That, combined with newer entrants in private credit, might lead to lower loan underwriting standards, he said.\"You're seeing a lot of competition now for the same type of lending,\" Zandi said. \"If history is any guide, that's a concern ... because it probably argues for a weakening in underwriting and ultimately bigger credit problems down the road.\"While neither Zandi nor de Fontenay said they saw an imminent collapse in the sector, as private credit continues to grow, so will its importance to the U.S. financial system.When banks hit turbulence because of the loans they made, there is an established regulatory playbook, but future problems in the private realm might be harder to resolve, according to de Fontenay.\"It raises broader questions from the perspective of the safety and soundness of the overall system,\" de Fontenay said. \"Are we going to know enough to know when there are signs of problems before they actually occur?\"",

    "body": "watch nowSoon, parents and guardians can open a Trump account for their children — and a number of large employers are piling on the incentives to get set up. For starters, babies born in 2025 through 2028 may receive a one-time $1,000 contribution from the Department of the Treasury. There are no income requirements, and all U.S. families are eligible for the initial seed money. But, in some cases, that is just the half of it. To help fund these savings accounts from the outset, a growing list of companies, including SoFi, Charter Communications, BNY, BlackRock, Investment Company Institute, Robinhood and Charles Schwab, announced they will match the federal $1,000 contribution for employees' children.

Children 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025, — who wouldn't qualify for the $1,000 initial deposit from the Treasury — could get a $250 contribution thanks to a $6.25 billion pledge made by tech CEO Michael Dell and his wife, Susan. Children in Connecticut may qualify for an additional donation from billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio and his wife, Barbara. Philanthropists in other states could follow suit as part of a \"50-state challenge,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said at a White House press conference last month. As it stands, those additional donations are geared toward families who live in a ZIP code where the median income is less than $150,000. How to set up a Trump accountTrump accounts, also known as Section 530A accounts, were created to encourage early wealth building as part of President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed in July.To open the account, an election must be made on IRS Form 4547, named for Trump's presidential terms. The form also includes a check box for the $1,000 Treasury contribution for children born between 2025 and 2028.   Form 4547 can be filed separately or with your 2025 tax return as soon as Jan. 26, which marks the official start of the 2026 tax filing season. Later in the year, this election can also be made via Trumpaccounts.gov.Once an account is established, parents, guardians, grandparents and others can contribute up to $5,000 a year in after-tax dollars up until the year before the beneficiary turns 18. The annual contribution limit adjusts for inflation after 2027.As part of the $5,000 limit, employers can contribute up to $2,500 per worker per year, which won't count as taxable income, according to the IRS. This figure also adjusts for inflation after 2027.Qualifying charitable organizations and state and local governments can also make contributions that do not count toward the $5,000 limit.How much a Trump account may be worthExperts say the additional Trump account contributions could make a difference over time. For example, let's say a family receives $1,000 from the Treasury and a $1,000 matching contribution from their employer for a total of $2,000 during their baby's first year.That account could be worth about $6,800 after 18 years, assuming 7% annual returns, according to certified financial planner Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management in Washington. He is also a member of CNBC's Financial Advisor Council.Many experts encourage families to accept \"free money\" from the Treasury, an employer or other sources. But beyond that, families can also weigh other investing options, such as 529 college savings plans and taxable brokerage accounts, among others, depending on their goals and timeline.

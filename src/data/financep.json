    "body": "watch nowNetflix is likely to amend its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, making an all-cash bid, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday. In December, Netflix reached a deal to purchase WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio in a transaction comprised of cash and stock. The deal is currently valued at $27.75 per WBD share. This would put the deal's equity value at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Bloomberg first reported this week that Netflix was considering adjusting its offer to be all-cash. An amended offer would allow WBD shareholders to vote to approve the offer on a faster timeline, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Under the current deal, shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer, Faber reported. Deals comprised of stock typically mean more financials and accounting need to be issued as part of seeking approval, which requires more time and expense, Faber added.If Netflix were to make its offer all-cash the shareholder vote could move up to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported.The change would come as Paramount Skydance has turned up the heat on its hostile push to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery's business. Earlier this week Paramount sued Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav seeking more information about why the company's board continues to reject its $30 per share offer in favor of Netflix. Paramount has repeatedly argued its deal is superior in value, given the estimated value of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV networks. It has also amended its bid to solidify the backing of Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. ",

    "body": "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during an event in Turin, Italy, Nov. 25, 2025.Daniele Mascolo | ReutersDETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa views 2026 as an execution year for the embattled maker of Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles in the U.S. after years of market share declines.Filosa has been undertaking a turnaround plan since he was named CEO in May. So far, his plans have included prioritizing the company's Jeep and Ram brands in the U.S. as well as undoing many decisions his predecessor Carlos Tavares made to focus on all-electric vehicles.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa, wearing a Jeep vest over a white button-down shirt, said this year is a \"first step\" in remaking the company, which was formed five years ago through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and French automaker PSA Groupe.He declined to discuss specifics, adding that his executive team will lay out a detailed future strategy for the automaker at a capital markets day in the first half of this year.Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also include Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.Filosa said he does believe that the company wants \"to stay together\" following some Wall Street speculation in recent years that it would be better to sell off assets or brands. \"We are building a culture,\" Filosa said.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come next week during a meeting with more than 200 company executives that will focus on the company's capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.\"We are a global company with strong regional roots,\" Filosa said, referring to one of three guiding cultural principles he's attempting to instill in the company. The others are being customer focused and working together.Stellantis' global sales under Tavares fell 12.3% from 6.5 million in 2021 — the year the company was formed — to 5.7 million in 2024. That included a roughly 27% collapse in the U.S. in that period to 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, falling from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame.",

The feature, called Personal Intelligence, is available for personal accounts, Google said in a blog post Wednesday. \"Whether it's connecting a thread in your emails to a video you watched or finding nuance in your photo library, Gemini now understands context without being told where to look,\" Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and the Gemini app, wrote in the post. It's Google's latest attempt to build more reasoning AI capabilities within its Gemini app and lure users as the company goes head-to-head with OpenAI and others in the increasingly competitive generative AI market. While Gemini could already retrieve information from Google apps, the company said Wednesday that Gemini 3 can now \"reason across your data to surface proactive insights.\"The new feature will compete with Apple Intelligence, Apple's personal AI system that integrates apps to help with writing, image creation and understanding context. Apple said Monday it chose Google to power  its AI features, including a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. Personal Intelligence will first be available to Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S., the company said, and will be added to Google's search tool \"AI Mode\" in the future. The feature will be off by default, Google said. Woodward, who has launched successful products in Gemini in the past year, warned that the beta version of the new feature hasn't eliminated mistakes, and is asking users to give feedback. \"Gemini may also struggle with timing or nuance, particularly regarding relationship changes, like divorces, or your various interests,\" he wrote. For sensitive topics like health, \"Gemini aims to avoid making proactive assumptions\" but \"will discuss this data with you if you ask,\" Woodward added.Woodward also said the company doesn't train its AI models \"directly on your Gmail inbox or Google Photos library\" but does utilize \"limited info, like specific prompts in Gemini and the model's responses, to improve functionality over time.\"WATCH: Google unveils 'Gemini 3 Flash' AI model focused on speed and costwatch now",

That was below the Dow Jones consensus for a 0.3% gain though one-tenth of a percentage point higher than October.Excluding food and energy, the core PPI was flat on the month against expectations for a 0.2% gain.Though the monthly readings were soft, the headline PPI was up 3% from a year ago, well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The core PPI excluding trade services posted a 3.5% annual gain, the biggest 12-month move since March 2025, according to the BLS.A 0.9% gain in goods prices fueled much of the PPI increase, with more than 80% attributable to a 4.6% jump in energy prices. Services prices were flat.On the consumer side, retail sales rose 0.6% for November, according to Commerce Department figures adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales were up 0.5%, compared with the 0.3% estimate.The November gains were broad based, with motor vehicle and parts dealers, building material and garden centers, gas stations, sporting goods stores, and miscellaneous outlets all seeing gains eclipsing 1%. On a year-over-year basis, sales rose 3.3%, ahead of the 2.7% increase in the consumer price index for that month. The control group, which strips out several categories and feeds into the gross domestic product calculation, rose 0.4%, in line with market consensus. The BLS remains behind schedule in the PPI data due to the government shutdown last year, while the retail sales reports are also lagging.Financial markets reacted little to the data, with stock futures pointing lower and Treasury yields near flat. Traders continued to price in virtually no chance of a Fed rate rate when it meets later this month.",

    "body": "A home with a \"Sold\" sign from a real estate company in North Patchogue, New York.Steve Pfost | Newsday | Getty ImagesSales of previously owned homes in December rose to a seasonally-adjusted, annualized rate of 4.35 million units, a 5.1% increase from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was higher than analysts' expectations for a gain of 2%. Sales were 1.4% higher than a year earlier. For the full year, there were 4.06 million existing home sales, unchanged from 2024.After adjusting for seasonal factors, December sales were the strongest in nearly three years. Sales increased in all regions month-over-month and were higher annually in the Northeast and Midwest, but lower in the South and West. This count is based on closings, so sales contracts likely signed in October and November, when mortgage rates weren't moving much. The average rate on the 30-year fixed loan hovered between 6.2% and 6.3% during that time. That rate, however, was lower than it was last spring and summer, when it was closer to 7%.\"2025 was another tough year for homebuyers, marked by record-high home prices and historically low home sales,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for The Realtors, in a release. \"However, in the fourth quarter, conditions began improving, with lower mortgage rates and slower home price growth.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory was the big headline of the monthly report. There were 1.18 million units available for sale at the end of December, down 18% from November, although 3.5% higher year-over-year. With stronger sales, that dropped the supply to just 3.3 months, which is considered quite lean. Low supply kept prices in positive territory, although just barely. The median price of a home sold in December was $405,400, up 0.4% annually and the 30th straight month of annual gains. The increase, however, was smaller than the 1.2% gain in November. \"With fewer sellers feeling eager to move, homeowners are taking their time deciding when to list or delist their homes. Similar to past years, more inventory is expected to come to market beginning in February,\" Yun added. ",

    "body": "Mark Mason, then CEO of Citi Private Bank, speaks during the Global Wealth Management Summit in New York, June 17, 2014.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersThe biggest U.S. banks show no sign of capitulating to President Donald Trump's mandate to slash credit card interest rates, setting up a confrontation just as the president is expected to take the world stage next week at Davos.Executives at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup warned this week that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has directed should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.\"An interest rate cap is not something that we would or could support,\" Citigroup CFO Mark Mason told reporters on Wednesday.It would \"restrict access to credit to those who need it the most and frankly would have a deleterious impact on the economy,\" he said.On Tuesday, JPMorgan CFO Jeremy Barnum indicated that the industry could defend itself in the courts if needed, saying \"everything's on the table\" in terms of a response. Trump, keen to address voters' concerns over affordability ahead of midterm elections this year, began his broadside against banks in a late-Friday social media post by alleging that the industry was ripping off credit card borrowers. In media interviews and follow up posts, Trump has doubled down on his push and endorsed a separate bill that takes aim at the swipe fees paid by merchants.But five days after the original threat, bankers and their lobbyists told CNBC that they have yet to receive any formal or written guidance from the Trump administration about the policy.That gives some of them hope that the administration isn't serious about pursuing the interest rate cap, according to industry insiders, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly.Deal time?While Trump has said banks that don't comply on rates will be \"in violation of the law,\" there is currently no U.S. law capping card rates. A bill introduced last year that would cap rates at 10% for five years has stalled in Congress.\"We are legally compliant right now,\" said one person with knowledge of a large card issuer's operations.Barring legislation, which is not likely, the industry will either dodge the caps entirely or be forced to offer concessions, similar to how Trump dealt with the pharmaceutical industry, Wolfe Research analysts led by Tobin Marcus said Tuesday in a note.\"We continue to view the drugmakers as the case study in how this kind of dealmaking-under-threat could go,\" Marcus said. \"In that case, Trump had enough leverage to secure some new pricing commitments, but not enough to extract truly painful commitments.\"watch nowThe financial sector is keenly focused on two upcoming events for a sense of how the credit card battle will unfold, sources tell CNBC.The first is Senate meetings this month where bills being worked on could see the addition of Trump's rate cap or the push to limit interchange fees. But that path is murky, given that several Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have already indicated they wouldn't support price controls on credit cards.The other looming date is next Wednesday, the day after Trump's Jan. 20 deadline. That's when Trump will address leaders from the corporate and political realms at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and CEOs including JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon are also scheduled to attend.At last year's Davos conference, Trump surprised Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan by accusing him and Dimon of discriminating against conservatives when it comes to access to bank accounts.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he arrives to address House Republicans at their annual issues conference retreat, at the Kennedy Center, renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center by the Trump-appointed board of directors, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 6, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are down in the polls with less than 10 months until the midterm elections. Now, Trump is giving the economic populism of the left a try. Last week, Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest at 10%, unveiled plans to bar large private-equity funds from buying up housing and said he would bar defense companies from issuing dividends or stock buybacks. These moves check off many policy wishes of the populist progressive left and borrow from political opponents like former Vice President Kamala Harris.It comes as Trump, who strode into a second term on a pledge to lower costs, finds himself underwater on the economy. A recent CBS News poll found that only 39% of voters approved of his performance on the issue, while 61% disapproved, one of his worst polls since retaking the presidency. That's a big problem for Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who could lose their slim majorities in both the House and the Senate in the November elections. Democrats are pounding the administration with an election-year message centered on affordability, arguing that the president and his allies have failed to bring down costs for everyday Americans. This line of attack on the cost of goods worked well for Democrats in gubernatorial races in late 2025.Republicans hold a razor-thin 218-213 vote majority in the House and a 53-47 seat majority in the Senate. A growing number of Republicans in the House have decided to retire at the end of this term, and Trump has warned that if Democrats take the House, \"they'll find a reason to impeach me.\"Trump's moves appear aimed at addressing voters' concerns around affordability — in the Truth Social post where he announced the credit card interest cap, the president wrote \"AFFORDABILITY!\" But not all Republicans on Capitol Hill are convinced that Trump's populist shift represents a life raft as Democrats take a consistent lead in generic congressional ballot polling.\"Self-control, clear messaging, clear priorities would be helpful,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who will retire at the end of this term, in an interview with CNBC. \"He actually sounds more and more like a Democrat, if you think about it.\"  Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probe\"When you talk about limiting businesses buying houses, limiting the salaries of corporate heads, I mean, that's much more like a Democrat messaging to me,\" Bacon said. Other Republicans were even more dismissive of the effort. One longtime House Republican, granted anonymity to discuss Trump's proposals candidly, said, \"The kind of stuff we're talking about right now ... is called hiding from your record.\"The Trump administration is defending the president's populist shift amid the complaints from some in the GOP.\"President Trump was given a resounding mandate by the American people to smash Washington, D.C.'s obsession with consensus orthodoxy that has let Americans down,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. \"The Trump administration is turning the page on Joe Biden's economic disaster by implementing traditional free market policies that do work – like deregulation and tax cuts – while rectifying the America Last policies that have Americans behind.\"But even top House and Senate Republicans have not exactly embraced Trump's latest moves to lower costs for Americans, and appear to be coalescing around the message that Trump is an \"ideas guy.\" Trump in the past has thrown a myriad of policy proposals at the wall to see what will stick, forcing his Republican allies to quickly adjust their priorities. \"The president is the ideas guy, and what he's doggedly determined to do, and laser-focused upon doing, is the same thing that we are, and that is reducing the cost of living,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference on Tuesday when asked about the credit card interest cap proposal. \"I wouldn't get too spun up about ideas that are out of the box that are proposed or suggested,\" Johnson added.Republicans have largely echoed banks in warning against a 10% cap on credit card interest, arguing such a cap could result in fewer people being offered credit and depress spending. Trump's credit card interest cap proposal came in a Truth Social post, hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted about it. Sanders, the former presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020, has long pushed a populist economic agenda and proposed a credit card interest cap in 2019. He sponsored a bill with Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri with a populist streak, to impose the cap. \"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder,\" Sanders wrote. \"Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards … Unacceptable.\"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to the crowd at U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) campaign rally in the Bronx borough of New York City, U.S., June 22, 2024. Joy Malone | ReutersHours later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was \"calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%.\"Trump's housing proposal, too, is similar to a proposal from former Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2024, during her presidential campaign, Harris urged Congress to pass a bill that would have curtailed investors from buying large numbers of single-family rental homes. Large private equity firms currently own less than five percent of single-family rental homes. \"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in his Truth Social post announcing the policy. It's unclear whether Trump's populist turn will end up providing any cover for Republicans, who are planning to crisscross the country selling voters on their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law that cut taxes and advanced other policy items sought by Trump.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has become a frequent foil of the Trump administration after leading the charge to compel the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, said it's unclear if the ideas will even be popular. \"Its populist economics is what it is,\" Massie said in an interview. \"It may very well be popular, I mean, there are going to be some downsides to it as well. We'll see how it plays out and whether he can actually pull it off.\" Pollsters say Trump is looking for a \"game changer\" to change voters' minds on the economy. \"He needs to convince people that things are going to be better economically in a short period of time and that's what all of these moves, I think, are intended to do,\" said Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling. \"It might tighten, and the bottom might come out, and the other side could run away with it.\"How Trump pulls it off remains to be seen. Many of the proposals would likely require congressional authorization. To that end, Trump appears to be reaching out to Democrats — including those he has repeatedly maligned.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Trump called her on Monday after she gave a speech at the National Press Club, where she laid out a case for a Democratic victory in 2026 by arguing that \"when the choice is between 'make the rich richer' and 'help everybody else,' winning elections is about choosing 'everybody else.\"\"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it,\" Warren said in a statement after the president's call. \"I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who represents Silicon Valley and is an oft-discussed potential presidential candidate in 2028, welcomed the president in an interview with CNBC.\"Well, I'm glad Trump is proposing populist policies. I support the idea that we should ban private equity from buying up single-family homes; that was my bill,\" Khanna said. \"If he wants to propose policies that are progressive or populist that are going to help Americans, I'll vote for them.\" That's not to say all leading Democrats are ready to help Trump lower prices and salvage the midterms for Republicans. \"I don't know why we would take what he says seriously, because it's his policies that are jacking up prices,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif, the vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, during a press conference this week. \"Unless he reverses his policies, these prices are going to keep on increasing.\" Then, there's the possibility that Trump is using his slew of economic proposals to drive the news cycle away from his weak points. The president has recently come under immense scrutiny for his use of the military after the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, his appearances in the Epstein files and his aggressive deportation agenda.\"Quite frankly, he's the master of distraction. In the middle of something, he'll make a statement or then look over to something else,\" said Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump's Secretary of the Interior in his first term. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump looks on before signing a bill in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 14, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said that his administration will approve China sales of Nvidia's H200 chip for artificial intelligence, but the U.S. government will take 25% of sales, one day after formal regulations were published by the U.S. government. Unlike Nvidia's previous China-targeted chip, the H20, the H200 is a version of the company's Hopper generation that is also sold in the U.S. and in other markets. The H200 was not specifically designed and slowed down for export. Trump pointed out in remarks on Wednesday that the H200's performance has been exceeded by two generations of Nvidia chips currently in production, naming Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips. \"It's not the highest level, but it's a pretty good level, and China wants them and other people want them and we're going to be making 25% on the sale of those chips, basically,\" Trump said. Trump initially announced the approval of H200 chips and the 25% government cut a month ago.Previously, Nvidia said the Chinese market could be worth $50 billion per year. \"We're allowing them to do it, but the United States is getting 25% of the chips, in terms of the dollar value,\" Trump said. In a filing published on Tuesday, the Department of Commerce said that the rule change had some requirements, including that the exporter certifies that there is sufficient supply of the H200 chips in the U.S., and that the chips won't take global foundry capacity needed for more advanced AI chips headed for the U.S. Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseThe government said that the customers for the chips would have to have sufficient security procedures, and that the chips will need to undergo independent, third-party testing in the U.S. to confirm their specifications before shipping out. Shipments of the chips to China would be capped at 50% the total product shipped to U.S. customers. The filing also mentions AMD's MI325X chip. \"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" an Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America.\"\"The Administration's critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors on U.S. entity lists — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial business, supporting real jobs for real Americans,\" the spokesperson continued. Last week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told reporters that the company is seeing \"very high\" interest in its H200 chip from China customers, and that the company had started producing the chip again. ″We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas.It's unclear whether Chinese regulators will approve the import of the Nvidia chips as the country aims to promote home-grown but inferior AI chips for self-sufficiency. Huang said last week that he isn't expecting an announcement from China. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Last year, Huang provided a two-year forecast for AI chip sales of $500 billion through the end of 2026. Any H200 sales to China would be in addition to that forecast, he said last week. The White House said on Wednesday that it had also imposed a 25% tariff of imports on some chips like the H200, which have to be imported to the U.S. to be tested before they are shipped to China.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowTesla CEO Elon Musk said Wednesday that the electric vehicle maker will stop selling its Full Self-Driving (Supervised) software for a flat rate and instead will only offer it as a monthly subscription.\"Tesla will stop selling FSD after Feb 14,\" Musk said in an early morning post on his social media platform X. \"FSD will only be available as a monthly subscription thereafter.\"Shares of the company closed 1.8% lower on Wednesday.FSD, which starts at $99 per month, is key to the future of the company as Musk tries to establish Tesla as a leader in autonomous mobility. The one-time price was $8,000. Tesla's FSD requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time, and does not turn the company's vehicles into self-driving cars. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company does not regularly disclose how many people subscribe to or actively use the FSD software.On Tesla's third-quarter earnings call in October, CFO Vaibhav Taneja said that \"the total paid FSD customer base is still small, around 12% of our current fleet.\"Tesla launched a robotaxi service with limited availability in Austin, Texas, last year, a service that includes human safety supervisors on board. Tesla also offers a ride-hailing service in San Francisco, with drivers at the wheel. Tesla hasn't obtained permits required in California that would allow it to test or operate autonomous vehicles without a driver at the wheel there. In December, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles found Tesla has engaged in false advertising around the capabilities of its \"self-driving\" systems, and the company is also facing a consumer class action suit on the matter that's now on appeal.

    "body": "Srdjanns74 | Istock | Getty ImagesAmericans haven't been this worried about falling behind on their debt since the start of the pandemic, new data from the New York Federal Reserve shows.The central bank's monthly Survey of Consumer Expectations found that Americans' perceived probability of missing a minimum debt payment in the coming months rose to the highest level since April 2020. The increase was most pronounced among adults over the age of 60, those without a college degree and those with annual household incomes below $50,000, according to the New York Fed survey, which polled roughly 1,300 households in December.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageMore Americans expect to miss a debt payment: What that does to your credit scoreStudent loan borrowers in default may miss Trump's 'largest tax refund season'IRS could see modest budget cut as Congress proposes funding plansAs enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, millions poised to drop health insuranceBigger tax refunds are coming for 2026 — what it could mean for the economyHere's the inflation breakdown for December 2025 — in one chartMore drivers have $1,000-plus car loan payments.

Amid a softening labor market, a growing share of adults are \"nervous about their current jobs, worried it'll take forever to get their next one, concerned that it'll be harder to get credit and unsure about their ability to make all of their minimum debt payments over the next few months,\" he said. However, even a single missed payment can have lasting financial consequences, LendingTree's research shows.Missed payments hurt prime borrowers moreOne missed payment can ding a credit score by about 80 points, on average, a new report by LendingTree found. In October, site researchers analyzed 100,000 credit reports. Consumers with a single missed payment average a 553 score, roughly 80 points lower than those with perfect payment histories, the report found. Credit scores typically range between 300 and 850.\"Paying your credit card bill even just a few days late can cost you,\" Schulz said. \"You can get stuck with late fees up to about $40 each time. However, the biggest hit comes later.\" The consequences of lower credit scores could include lower credit limits, higher interest rates for new loans and less access to credit overall. In general, the higher your credit score, the better off you are when it comes to getting a loan and obtaining better financing terms. watch nowThe credit score implications worsen for borrowers with better scores, research also shows. \"The bigger they are, the harder they fall,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate.If your score is near perfect, you could lose 100 points or more because of a single 30-day delinquency, according to Rossman. If you have a lower score, the impact of a missed payment would not be as significant, he added. Because borrowers in riskier credit tiers typically have a few dings on their credit, \"that new one isn't going to hurt you as much,\" Rossman said. The damage also gets successively worse depending on the extent of the delinquency, the experts said, referring to the difference between a missed payment being 30 days delinquent and \"late-stage delinquency,\" or over 90 days past due on payments.Before a missed payment, reach out to your lenderIf you are in jeopardy of missing a payment, \"ask the lender for a break,\" Rossman said. \"Many will work with you, perhaps pausing payments for a time or lowering your interest rate,\" he said. \"It can be possible to avoid credit score damage if you speak up early enough and get permission to pay less or maybe even nothing at all this month.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe traditional role of an investment banker is to provide advice on deals and financings. But JPMorgan's bankers recently began noticing that clients were asking for more from the firm – like how the nation's largest bank was navigating artificial intelligence or what cybersecurity practices it used. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had an idea: formalize a group that can give certain clients access to much of JPMorgan's \"secret sauce.\" They're calling the initiative the \"Special Advisory Services,\" which launches Monday, with Liz Myers, who also serves as the global chair of investment banking, at the helm. \"These capabilities are on par or better with some of the specialized consulting firms out there,\" said Myers in an interview with CNBC. \"We think it could help C-suite executives be more effective in their roles and learn from our best practices.\" JPMorgan identified several dozen adjacent capabilities to offer clients, ranging from investor relations to real estate selection to health-care benefits to technology procurement. At the outset, the firm does not plan to charge for these services. However, if a client seeks a more time-consuming project or a service that exists on an ongoing basis, they may negotiate some sort of fee structure. The services are intended for clients that \"have, or seek to have, deep and long-term relationships with the firm,\" the company said in a press release. That cohort may include, \"companies considering JPMorgan as their lead IPO adviser, long-tenured clients preparing for transformational deals, or growing mid-sized clients looking to use JPMorgan as their primary operating bank,\" according to the release. \"More than two-thirds of our experts are internally facing people – their No. 1 job is to make sure they're delivering for our firm,\" Myers said. \"They're a precious resource, to some extent, so we have to be thoughtful about who gets it.\" Myers, a 30-year veteran of the firm, had previously served as global head of equity capital markets, and in her expanded role, she'll work with advisory teams and experts across JPMorgan. She said that in the beginning, the Special Advisory Services group will have a \"handful\" of people. And then over time, the firm may scale it if there's a sizable uptake in client demand. JPMorgan is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week. LSEG estimates that for the year through Dec. 11, JPMorgan raked in $9.44 billion in investment banking fees, making the firm No. 1 worldwide, with 7.4% of wallet share. ",

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, Oct. 28, 2025.Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro is easier said than done. Chevron holds the advantage as the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela, according to Wall Street analysts. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the industry and seized their assets in 2007. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, at 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a long and expensive road lies ahead for U.S. oil majors to restore Venezuela to its peak production of 3.5 million barrels per day reached in the 1990s.\"It's a high-risk area for oil companies to invest in,\" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at Global Risk Management.It would require roughly $53 billion of investment over the next 15 years to just maintain crude oil production level of 1.1 million barrels per day, or bpd, according to estimates from consulting firm Rystad Energy. The capital expenditures needed to reach 3 million bpd by 2040 would more than triple, to $183 billion, according to Rystad.Certainty and stabilityU.S. oil majors will want certainty about who is charge in Caracas and how stable the government is, said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy. They will need to know whether the legal and fiscal regime will last long term because energy investments are 30-year projects, said David Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's special envoy for international energy affairs from 2009 to 2011.The situation in Caracas right now is anything but certain. Trump declared Saturday that the U.S. will run Venezuela after Maduro's overthrow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to backtrack, telling NBC News in a Sunday interview that the U.S. will use its leverage to pressure Caracas to meet U.S. demands. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has assumed power in Venezuela, pledging over the weekend that the government would defend the country's resources, but later said Caracas sought to cooperate with the U.S. A major question is whether Venezuela could return to a regime similar to Maduro's in the future and nationalize oil assets again, said Global Risk Management's Rasmussen.Surplus reserves U.S. oil majors will grapple with whether it makes financial sense to invest tens of billions of dollars in Venezuela when there is already so much oil in the world, said McNally, a former White House energy advisor under President George W. Bush. \"There are plenty of reasons to think this is going to be more of a long and winding road, rather than a quick shot,\" McNally said.Chevron maintains joint ventures with state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela through a special licensed issued by the U.S. government. Those partnerships are responsible for about 23% of Venezuela's output, according to JPMorgan. \"The company would be in an advantaged position to potentially scale future output as they have significant oil resources in place through their JVs and have been a key developer of the country's energy infrastructure,\" JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients in a Monday note. Chevron shares climbed more than 5% Monday. — CNBC's Hayley Cuccinello contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Limited-time retro packaging will highlight Chick-fil-A's heritage, the company said.Source: Chick-fil-AFor Chick-fil-A's 80th anniversary, the chicken chain is going all out: retro packaging, collectible cups, themed merch and even the chance to win free food for a year.The chain's anniversary comes as the restaurant industry struggles with declining traffic. To win back diners, many restaurants have leaned into deals, buzzy promotions and larger marketing budgets. As a privately held company, Chick-fil-A does not disclose quarterly financial results, but franchise disclosure documents show that the company's system sales growth slowed to 5.4% in 2024, making it the first year in more than a decade with less than double-digit sales growth.Chick-fil-A has stayed out of the so-called value wars other restaurants have leaned into to compete, but the anniversary gives the chain the opportunity to attract more customers to its restaurants. The yearlong marketing campaign kicks off on Monday and represents the biggest promotional push ever for Chick-fil-A. Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A's vice president of brand strategy, advertising and media, told CNBC that new advertising will spotlight the anniversary in both national TV spots and on social media.At the center of the campaign is what the company is calling \"newstalgia,\" a portmanteau of \"new\" and \"nostalgia.\"\"We've thought about this as a way to celebrate our heritage with customers who've been with us, potentially for decades, for all 80 years, or whether they've been with us for eight days or have never tried Chick-fil-A before,\" Cooper said.While Chick-fil-A's growth is slowing, its sales are still rising even as the broader restaurant industry struggles with more budget-conscious consumers who are eating out less often and spending less, leading to shrinking traffic to eateries. In 2025, July was the only month with increasing restaurant visits compared with the year-ago period, according to Black Box Intelligence. Monthly traffic hit a low point in February, with the firm reporting a 5.7% fall from a year earlier.Chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Papa John's and Wendy's have reported declining traffic and falling same-store sales. Hundreds of restaurant locations, from the likes of Starbucks and Jack in the Box, permanently closed in 2025 due to weak traffic.Chick-fil-A's marketing pushTo start, Chick-fil-A is also rolling out four retro collectible cup designs every few weeks, inspired by the company's archives and the shape of its 32-ounce cup. The chain is selling the cups for $3.99 at restaurants nationwide. Plus, Chick-fil-A has come up with its own riff on Willy Wonka's famous golden ticket: the Golden Fan Cup. The 3,000 customers who buy a collectible cup and receive the Golden Fan Cup will receive free Chick-fil-A for a year.The chain will also give its iconic chicken sandwich limited-time, vintage-inspired packaging.Chick-fil-A plans to sell themed merch through its website over the course of the year. Customers who visit its restaurants will also be able to purchase limited-edition designs of its stuffed cows. Also as part of the campaign, Chick-fil-A is adding its frosted sodas and floats to its menu permanently, starting Monday. Customers can also expect to see more limited-time menu items throughout the year than Chick-fil-A typically offers, according to Cooper.The focus on \"newstalgia\" will also be front and center at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Friday, when the Oregon Ducks face off against the Indiana Hoosiers in the College Football Playoff semifinal.Chick-fil-A traces its roots to 1946, when S. Truett Cathy and his brother opened a restaurant called The Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. More than two decades later, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A location, with its trademark chicken sandwich. The business is still family owned, and Cathy's grandson Andrew serves as its CEO.The privately held chain's system sales reached $22.74 billion in 2024, making it the third-largest restaurant chain in the U.S., trailing only McDonald's and Starbucks. Over the past decade, Chick-fil-A has expanded far beyond its Southeastern stronghold, opening locations all across the U.S. and planning to expand its international business into the United Kingdom and Singapore.",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., holds a news conference in the Mansfield Room in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, December 1, 2025. Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's \"seditious\" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  \"reckless misconduct\" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. \"Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, \"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action \"with everything I've got,\" and called Hegseth \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.\"\"Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,\" Kelly wrote. \"I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.\"\"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly wrote. \"Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.\"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,\" the senator said. \"It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.\"The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealedThe legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned.In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: \"These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.\"\"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,\" Hegseth said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"",

    "body": "Home prices are expected to rise by about 2.2% nationally in 2026, but some large U.S. cities — mostly in the Midwest and Northeast — could see prices climb much faster.That's according to a recent Realtor.com forecast, which projects \"a more balanced\" housing market as higher inventory slows overall price growth. Even so, the moderation isn't expected to be evenly felt.\"The Midwest and Northeast have maintained strong demand despite the broader slowdown, largely due to persistent inventory scarcity,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It.While many markets in the South and West are seeing price growth flatten or turn negative as new construction adds supply, cities in the Midwest and Northeast have added fewer homes in recent years, which has helped kept prices moving higher, according to Realtor.com.Here are the 11 large U.S. cities expected to see the biggest home-price increases in 2026:1. Toledo, OhioExpected 2026 price growth: 13.1%Median home price: $199,9002. Syracuse, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 12.4%Median home price: $298,9503.

Hartford–West Hartford–East Hartford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 9.5%Median home price: $429,0006. Baltimore–Columbia–Towson, MarylandExpected 2026 price growth: 8.3%Median home price: $375,0007. New Haven–Milford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $439,0008. Winston-Salem, North CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $342,8999. Albany–Schenectady–Troy, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 7.5%Median home price: $419,90010. Columbia, South CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.2%Median home price: $303,30011. Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis, WisconsinExpected 2026 price growth: 7%Median home price: $379,000Realtor.com's metro-level forecasts are based on its own listings data, along with local inventory levels, new construction activity, employment and income trends, and mortgage rate expectations.What those projections show is that in markets where very little housing has been added, even modest demand is enough to keep prices rising — especially in smaller Midwest and Northeast cities. By contrast, in markets where construction has been heavier, home prices in some areas are expected to fall by as much as 10% in 2026.The metros with the highest expected gains \"have seen very limited new housing development, keeping supply tight,\" says Jones. At the same time, most of these cities have home prices \"well below national averages,\" she says.Overall, only three of the 11 cities on the list have median listing prices above the U.S. median of about $415,000 as of late 2025.Toledo stands out in particular for its relative affordability. The city's median home price of about $199,900 is well below Ohio's statewide median of roughly $275,000, per Realtor's data.Another factor is proximity to larger urban hubs. \"In the Northeast, demand has remained elevated as buyers seek more affordable, commutable alternatives to large, high-cost metros, such as New York and Boston,\" says Jones. \"Because new construction has lagged in many of these older, built-out Northeastern markets, supply constraints remain acute, amplifying the price impact of even modest demand growth.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

The announcement came as Walz, who was Kamala Harris' vice presidential pick for her failed 2024 White House bid, continues to weather heated criticism over a sweeping fraud scandal in his state.\"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all,\" Walz said in a statement.\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" he said.\"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,\" the governor said.Walz read the same statement during a brief news conference later Monday. He took no questions.Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, is weighing a Minnesota gubernatorial bid in light of Walz bowing out, The New York Times reported Monday. Walz and Klobuchar spoke over the weekend, multiple outlets reported.Walz had announced in September that he would seek a third term in office. But his plans were soon upended by damning reports on the social services fraud scams that have blossomed in Minnesota in the years since the Covid-19 pandemic, while Walz led the state.A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month estimated that the fraud schemes may have totaled more than $9 billion, though Walz has called that number \"sensationalized.\"The scandal has put focus on the state's Somali community, where the majority of people so far charged by the Department of Justice in connection with the fraud have come from.President Donald Trump has responded to the fraud reports with vehemently anti-Somali rhetoric and renewed attacks against Democratic Rep.

    "body": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to the media ahead of a secure briefing about U.S. action in Venezuela, on Capitol Hill  in Washington,, D.C., U.S., Jan. 5, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Monday briefed congressional leaders on the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, sharpening a partisan divide over the president's authority to use force without congressional approval.Top Republicans who attended the classified briefing rallied to the president's defense while Democrats questioned the scope of the operation and pushed to halt further military action.The partisan split-screen among the lawmakers briefed, who are part of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" group authorized to receive highly classified information, underscores the difficulty Congress may face in trying to rein in President Donald Trump's military efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the raid in Venezuela \"a decisive and justified action,\" rejecting claims that Trump exceeded his authority.\"We are not at war, we do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela and we are not occupying that country,\" Johnson said. Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealed\"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war; that is true. But it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander-in-chief,\" Johnson said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said that the briefing raised far more questions than it answered.\"The plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,\" Schumer said. \"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.\"Senate Democrats plan to force a vote later this week on a measure to suspend Trump's military action in Venezuela, known as a war powers resolution. The measure, brought by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would require Trump to cease military action in Venezuela unless Congress approves it. Kaine introduced a similar resolution in November, which the Senate rejected after only two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — supported it. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so at least four Republicans would need to break ranks for Kaine's measure to succeed. The House of Representatives would also need to approve the measure. Lawmakers there narrowly defeated a Venezuela war powers resolution 211-213 in December. \"There's real concern as it relates to congressional action connected to our sole power to declare war,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before the briefing. \"No further military action should be taken in Venezuela or anywhere else without explicit congressional approval, and we need to legislate that.\" The lawmakers were briefed by top members of the president's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The administration has labored to frame the use of the military in Venezuela as a law enforcement action, since Maduro had outstanding warrants for his arrest in the United States. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who was in the briefing, echoed that view. \"This was a law enforcement operation,\" Mast said. \"This law enforcement operation required great military capabilities … because the individual that had to be brought to justice could bring to bear an air force, a navy, an army.\" Mast said  Trump was not seeking a protracted military engagement, but did not rule out similar operations if the president deems them necessary to \"defend the homeland.\"The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, who have jurisdiction over the U.S. law enforcement apparatus, were not invited to the briefing. They are not traditionally part of the \"Gang of Eight,\" but issued a joint statement excoriating the snub. \"President Trump and Secretary Rubio have stated that this was a law enforcement operation that was made at the Department of Justice's (DOJ) request, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),\" the statement from Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., read.    \"The administration's refusal to acknowledge our Committee's indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the Committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro's arrest,\" they said. CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Mayor of San Jose, Matt Mahan, speaks during the NWSL Championship Welcome Reception at Rotunda at San Jose City Hall in San Jose, California, on Nov. 20, 2025.Eakin Howard | Nwsl | Getty ImagesThe Democratic mayor of San Jose, California, has come out against a proposed statewide ballot measure that would ask voters to approve a one-time 5% tax on billionaires' net worth.Matt Mahan, who took office in Silicon Valley's biggest city in 2023, said in a series of X posts on Monday that the initiative would end up costing the majority of California residents. \"We need a rising economic tide to lift all boats, not a political plan that will sink California's innovation economy,\" Mahan wrote. San Jose's population sat just below 1 million as of mid-2024, according to a U.S. Census Bureau estimate. It's the third-largest California city, behind Los Angeles and San Diego. Tech investors and executives have been vocal of late in their opposition to a tax on billionaires, claiming that it will cause companies and entrepreneurs to flee for other states. The issue has become particularly contentious for Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who backs the tax and whose district includes part of Silicon Valley, as one-time supporters in the tech industry have threatened to throw their weight behind a primary challenger. \"Even people who don't expect this initiative to pass are still planning to leave because there will be another one is the argument,\" billionaire investor Vinod Khosla wrote on X late last month. \"And California will lose its most important tax payers and net off much worse.\"David Sacks, a venture capitalist now serving as President Donald Trump's crypto and artificial intelligence czar, said on X last week that \"Austin will replace SF as the tech capital.\" Tech investor Peter Thiel and Google co-founder Larry Page, have considered leaving, The New York Times reported.David O. Sacks, chair of the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, speaks to President Donald Trump next to Sriram Krishnan, senior White House policy advisor on artificial intelligence, and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick as Trump signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | Reuters\"Driving billionaires out of state might feel good in the short run but working people (as is almost always the case) will pick up the tab for this political ploy,\" Mahan wrote on Monday. \"The people who lose in the long run are California families who will be asked to foot more of the bill for government services and infrastructure.\"Mahan said that addressing income inequality requires solutions like \"closing the massive loopholes nationally that allow the wealthiest among us to essentially never pay taxes on many capital gains.\"The proposed ballot measure, dubbed the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act, is being pushed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West labor union. If enacted, it would levy a one-time 5% tax on the assets of California billionaires to shore up an expected shortfall in the state's health-care budget. Should the measure garner enough signatures to qualify, it will be up to California voters to decide whether to implement the tax, which would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2026. California will require around 875,000 signatures before placing the initiative on the ballot.A report from some of those who drafted the measure said the tax could raise $100 billion through 2031 from the 200 wealthiest people in the state. California had over 39 million people at the start of 2025, according to state data.A major reason that tech investors and executives are united in opposing the effort is the concern that the tax would apply to unrealized gains. That means startup founders with a net worth of over $1 billion based on the paper value of their private stock would have to pay tax on their wealth even though it's illiquid.Sarah Drory, a spokesperson for Rep. Khanna, told CNBC in late December that while Khanna supports a \"modest wealth tax on billionaires to deal with staggering inequality and to make sure people have health care,\" he also advocates \"for commonsense work-arounds for startup founders whose companies are not profitable and who have illiquid stock.\"— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowVersant Media Group, the portfolio of cable TV networks and digital assets spun off by Comcast, joined the small cohort of public media companies Monday as the industry reckons with ongoing disruption. Versant began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol \"VSNT,\" opening at $45.17 per share. The company's so-called when-issued stock — a security that is expected to be issued and has been authorized to trade on a conditional basis to give investors an early chance to buy shares — initially began trading on Dec. 15 at $55 per share and ended trading Friday at $46.65 per share. As of close Monday, Versant shares had fallen to $40.57 per share, down 13% on the day. The company's market capitalization stands at roughly $6.5 billion with shares outstanding of 145.76 million based on the spinoff ratio. As part of the spinoff, Comcast shareholders received one share of Versant stock for every 25 shares of Comcast stock they owned. \"It's been a year in the making,\" said Mark Lazarus, Versant CEO, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. In November 2024, Comcast announced its intention to separate out the bulk of NBCUniversal's cable TV networks, including MS Now (formerly MSNBC), CNBC, Golf Channel, USA, E!, Syfy and Oxygen, as well as digital properties Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, GolfNow and Sports Engine. \"As part of Comcast and NBCU we had other priorities as a company,\" Lazarus said. \"We made different decisions, because we had a different company and a different strategy. Now we're bringing these [assets] into their own company, we're going to be able to invest into them. We'll invest organically ... and hopefully the market is listening to what we're saying.\" Lazarus said \"vertical scale\" is necessary to diversify the business away from a dependence on pay TV. \"While that's still a big, profitable part for us, it's not going to be the end game,\" he said.There are few traditional media companies that have gone public in recent years — namely because of the significant challenges the industry has been facing due to the shift away from the TV bundle and toward streaming.  In 2025, Newsmax, the conservative cable news network, went public on the New York Stock Exchange and quickly saw its shares soar from its $14 per share opening price. It has fallen precipitously since its debut. Instead, the media sector has been marked by a rush for consolidation and fresh M&A deals. Paramount Skydance completed its merger last year, and since then CEO David Ellison has been acquisitive. Warner Bros. Discovery, itself formed following a merger in 2022, last year kicked off a sale process that resulted in a proposed deal with Netflix. Paramount has since made a hostile offer to WBD shareholders to upend the proposed transaction with Netflix. Mark Lazarus, CEO of Versant, visits the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., July 21, 2025.  Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThe Versant spinoff was likewise a result of the disruptive media landscape. Its executives, led by CEO Lazarus, former chairman of NBCUniversal's media group, spent the final months of 2025 convincing Wall Street investors that the future of the business would be focused on growing the digital presence of its portfolio. The company has also highlighted its strength in news and sports, the two categories of programming that still receive the bulk of TV viewers. Although networks like those in Versant's portfolio are seeing declines in financials, they are still profitable and beckon ad dollars. On Monday, Lazarus once again pointed to Versant's weight in sports and news, saying 62% of the portfolio is in those two content areas. \"We have a really strong position,\" Lazarus said. In September Versant reported declining revenue in recent years as consumers exit the cable TV bundle. According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of going public, Versant's assets generated $7.1 billion in revenue in 2024 , down from $7.4 billion in 2023 and $7.8 billion in 2022. The company said its net income attributable to Versant was $1.4 billion in 2024, down from $1.5 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022. Shortly after, ratings agencies S&P Global and Fitch Ratings each issued BB credit ratings on the company's debt noting stable outlooks, placing the company's rating in junk territory. This was based on Versant's plans to issue $2.75 billion of new senior secured debt to fund a one-time $2.25 billion cash distribution to Comcast and add $500 million to its balance sheet, according to S&P. Versant's low debt levels have boded well for the company with both ratings agencies and have been a highlight in its pitch to Wall Street investors. Media peers like Warner Bros. Discovery have grappled with heavy debt loads while also contending with the decline of cable TV subscribers and lower ad revenue. Both ratings agencies noted the headwinds facing the traditional TV landscape, which S&P said \"offset the strength of [Versant's] portfolio,\" noting that revenue from linear distribution and advertising from its networks accounted for more than 80% of total revenue. Fitch said \"the strong viewer loyalty and engagement\" with Versant's TV networks, as well as its conservative debt structure, bodes as a positive for the company. Versant executives said at a recent investor day presentation that the company intends to grow its digital business through acquisitions and investments.— CNBC's Gina Francolla contributed to this article.

Hyunjoo Jin | ReutersLucid Group significantly increased its production and sales last year as it continues to ramp up production of its new Gravity SUV.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer on Monday said its deliveries last year increased to 15,841 units, up 55% compared with 2024, including a more than 70% year-over-year increase during the fourth quarter.The automaker also achieved a previously lowered production target of roughly 18,000 vehicles in 2025, down from an initial expectation of as much as 20,000 vehicles. It produced 18,378 units last year, including 8,412 EVs during the fourth quarter.Much of that increase is likely due to a prolonged ramp-up of its Gravity SUV, which has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages, the company has said. In addition to Lucid's own challenges, EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs because of tariffs and slower forecast sales of EVs, as well as regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.watch now",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the premiere of \"The Big Short\" at Ziegfeld Theatre on Nov. 23, 2015 in New York.Dimitrios Kambouris | Getty ImagesMichael Burry's quiet bet on Venezuelan oil is coming back into focus.The investor best known for \"The Big Short\" said he has owned Valero Energy since 2020, a position he views as increasingly attractive as the U.S. moves toward a deeper role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry.\"Realize that many Gulf Coast refineries were purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude,\" Burry wrote in a Monday blog post on Substack. \"So they have been running with suboptimal feedstock for years. This will, in time, produce better margins across jet fuel, asphalt, and diesel ... I have owned Valero since 2020, and I am more resolved to holding it even longer after this weekend.\"His comments came after President Donald Trump called on U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The country's oil is among the heaviest and most sulfur-laden in the world, and only a limited number of refineries are equipped to process it efficiently.Valero stands out because of its ability to process heavy crude, but Burry said smaller refiners such as PBF Energy and HF Sinclair could also benefit, even if Venezuelan oil arrives only gradually. Any meaningful recovery in exports is likely to take years.Multiple analysts on Wall Street are also highlighting Valero as the biggest beneficiary, should Venezuelan supply increase. Shares of the refiner jumped about 10% Monday. The opportunity may extend beyond refining. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has deteriorated after decades of underinvestment, creating potential demand for U.S. oilfield services companies if large-scale rehabilitation begins, Burry said.Burry said he owns Halliburton, and sees possible upside as well for Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which could be tapped to help rebuild pipelines and refineries.\"Venezuelan pipelines and refineries are old and in disrepair. This work will go to U.S. contractors,\" he said. \"Chevron is already there. Exxon and others have been litigating claims for decades and may see some justice relatively soon, if the US literally begins to run Venezuela as some have suggested. I own Halliburton, and may buy more shares or LEAPs.\"LEAPs, or long-term equity anticipation securities, are options with lengthy expiration dates that could go beyond one year.",

    "body": "2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X with Carbon Aero packageGMDETROIT — General Motors on Monday reported a 5.5% increase in its annual U.S. sales in 2025, despite a 6.9% decrease during the fourth quarter. The Detroit automaker's results were driven last year by incremental sales of EVs as well as gains in large SUVs and entry-level vehicles such as the Buick Envista. GM's 2025 sales are expected to be among the standouts for the U.S. automotive industry, which Cox Automotive expects to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units compared with 2024.GM is among a handful of automakers to report U.S. sales gains for 2025. Others include Toyota Motor's sales being up 8%; Hyundai and Kia each achieving third consecutive years of record sales with 8.4% and 7% increases, respectively; and Honda Motor up 0.5%. Chrysler parent Stellantis was down 3.3% as it executes a U.S. turnaround plan. Notably, Stellantis' Jeep brand — which was up less than 1% last year — achieved its first U.S. annual sales gain since 2018.watch now\"With consecutive quarterly sales increases and market share growth, it's clear that we are taking the right steps to reset our business in the U.S.,\" Jeff Kommor, head of Stellantis U.S. retail sales, said in a release. \"There is still work to do, but we made progress this year with a diversified powertrain lineup.\"GM, meanwhile, retained its position as the largest seller of vehicles in the U.S. It's held that title for decades, aside from Toyota outselling the American automaker for one year amid major supply chain disruptions in 2021.GM sold more than 2.85 million vehicles last year in the U.S, including roughly 703,000 during the fourth quarter. That compares to Toyota at 2.52 million U.S. sales in 2025.\"Demand for our brands and products is strong at every price point, and we are well-positioned to build on this momentum in the year ahead,\" GM President of North America Duncan Aldred said in a statement. Aside from the U.S. sales crown, GM said it grew U.S. market share by half a percentage point, to 17%, and increased EV sales by 48% to become the country's No. 2 seller of all-electric vehicles behind Tesla.",

    "body": "Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks during a news conference at the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles, June 12, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Department of Homeland Security on Monday blasted Hilton Hotels, saying that DHS officers had a reservation abruptly canceled by a Minneapolis hotel because of their work on immigration enforcement.The price of Hilton shares dipped by around 2% after the criticism by DHS in a social media post.\"NO ROOM AT THE INN!,\" DHS said on its X social media account.\"HiltonHotels has launched a coordinated campaign in Minneapolis to REFUSE service to DHS law enforcement,\" the tweet said. \"When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations,\" DHS said. \"This is UNACCEPTABLE. Why is Hilton Hotels siding with murderers and rapists to deliberately undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation's immigration laws?\"Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement officers question a man's status on Lake Street near a Somali mall called the Karmel Mall in Minnesota, United States on December 10, 2025. Christopher Juhn | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe tweet included a screengrab of two apparent emails from a Hilton.com address, with the subject line: \"Upcoming reservation.\"The email said, \"We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property,\" the message said. \"If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation.\"\"Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property,\" the email said.Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealedThe subsequent email said:  \"After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation.\"The location of the Hilton property that DHS said had canceled the reservation was not revealed by the department.Hilton, in a statement from a spokesperson, said, \"This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values.\"\"We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter and are contacting impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination,\" the statement read.Most of the more than 9,000 properties affiliated with Hilton and its brands are operated by franchisees.Everpeak Hospitality, the company that operates the Hilton-branded hotel in question, also released a statement.\"Everpeak Hospitality has moved swiftly to address this matter as it was inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all,\" the statement said. \"We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted.  We are committed to welcoming all guests and operating in accordance with brand standards, applicable laws, and our role as a professional hospitality provider.\"CNBC has reached out to DHS for comment.In September 2020, during the first Trump administration, Hilton issued a statement saying that it opposed the use of its hotels for the purpose of detaining migrants, including minors. That statement came two months after Hilton said it had confirmed reports that an independently owned and operated Hampton Inn & Suites in McAllen, Texas, had accepted reservations from a private contractor working on behalf of U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement to house migrants, including minors.\"This is not activity that we support or in any way want associated with our hotels,\" Hilton said in July 2020. \"Our policy has always been that hotels should not be used as  detention centers or for detaining individuals. We expect all Hilton properties to reject business that would use a hotel in this way.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in a tweet on Dec. 29, said, \"Homeland Security Investigations @ICEGov are on the ground in Minneapolis right now conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud. More coming.\"A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month said that about $9 billion or more that has been paid through more than a dozen Medicaid programs in the state since 2018 may have been fraudulently obtained.CBS News reported Monday that \"The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota.\"\"The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations,\" CBS reported.— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this article.",

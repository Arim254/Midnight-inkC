    "body": "Daniel Rodriguez typically takes three modes of transportation to get from his home in Philadelphia to his work in Atlanta 800 miles away.The 34-year-old project manager at an urban design firm splits his time between the two cities each week, usually taking a bus, a train and a plane to get to work.Rodriguez began supercommuting in May. He'd been living in Philadelphia full-time with his wife, but after having a hard time finding work there, he took a hybrid role where he does some work locally but also works several days a week in Atlanta, where his primary team is based. The couple considered moving to Atlanta but decided against it because of cost-of-living expenses.Now, Rodriguez typically makes his supercommute once a week, usually staying 2 to 3 days a week in Atlanta at a time.He alternates between flying out in the early morning the day he has to be in the office and catching an evening flight the day before. Rodriguez travels light, taking only a personal item holding his laptop, food and a change of clothes.Each way typically takes him anywhere from 4 to 6 hours, door-to-door. Rodriguez passes the time brainstorming or editing content, catching up on work, reading, or studying for licensure exams he plans to take soon.\"I'm working from the airport, I'm working from the plane,\" he says. \"I try to fit as much life into this as possible.\"While his co-workers think his commute is \"curious,\" Rodriguez hasn't run into any travel mishaps yet.\"My boss says, 'For some reason, it works,'\" he adds.Factoring in costsHeading from Philadelphia to Atlanta, Rodriguez wakes up around 3:30 a.m. and walks under 10 minutes from his apartment to the train station. For $8.75, he takes a regional train line to the airport. He often takes a 5:30 a.m. flight, which costs around $90 one-way and takes 1.5 or 2 hours. After landing in Atlanta, a $2.50 train and a 10-minute walk usually bring him to the office around 8 or 8:30 a.m.On his return trip, he's basically retracing his steps, with a few tweaks. He wakes a little later, around 4 a.m., in Atlanta, and usually books a ride-share to the airport, which costs around $20 and takes 15 to 20 minutes. After his flight and a half-hour regional train ride, a short walk gets him to work, whether it's his Philadelphia office or a cafe, around 9 a.m.Rodriguez usually spends up to $240 a week on transportation costs for his back-and-forth.On housing, he and his wife spend $2,000 combined on monthly rent in Philadelphia. Rodriguez is currently staying with a friend when he's in Atlanta, for which he pays $400 a month, though he plans to get his own place there soon.He also spends $200 a year for a CLEAR+ membership to get through security checks at the airport quicker.Adjusting to his supercommuteRodriguez says adjusting to his supercommute was \"easier than a lot of people think,\" partly because he's used to relying on public transit after selling his car several years ago.He thinks his commute is \"less stressful overall than committing to driving to work every day, stuck in traffic, angry.\"A lot of modern life in America feels like \"you're on autopilot,\" he says. \"You wake up, you go to work, you clock in and you clock out, and you repeat.\" Rodriguez finds that his commute \"forces you to be intentional,\" whether that's in how he spends his time in transit, or how he and his wife make time together despite being physically apart some days of the week.\"Everything needs to be thought out in advance,\" he says. \"Everything you value and prioritize in your relationship, and how you live your life, it can't be by accident.\"Rodriguez views a commute as \"a form of a third place,\" referring to the concept of a place that's neither work nor home.\"They're not just these pain points to get you to the next place,\" he says. \"They're places\" too.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "The CNN building in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday, May 17, 2021.Elijah Nouvelage | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCNN is trying again at a full-service streaming subscription.The news network, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Thursday its \"All Access\" subscription will launch in the U.S. on October 28 and cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 annually.The new plan is pitched as a centralized hub for CNN's journalism and includes access to live and on-demand U.S. and international video programming, CNN.com articles and subscriber-only content across all platforms. To attract early adopters, the company is offering a limited-time annual subscription for $41.99 for those who sign up by January 5.\"No one covers the world like CNN,\" said Alex MacCallum, executive vice president of digital products and services at CNN Worldwide, in a release. \"This is an essential step in CNN's evolution, providing a comprehensive experience that meets how audiences consume news today.\"The All Access plan builds on CNN's existing digital subscription, now rebranded as the Basic tier. Originally launched in 2024, the Basic plan includes unlimited access to CNN articles and select subscriber features, but excludes video content.The news company has toyed with the idea of different subscription options for years.CNN+, a subscription service that offered a mix of live news, on-demand programs and unique original series, was canned just a month after its launch in March 2022. The closure was partly the result of the merger between Warner Bros. and Discover in April 2022 and amid disappointing subscription numbers and internal challenges at CNN. Warner Bros. Discovery is undergoing a shakeup of its own. The media giant announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. The streaming and studios company will include its movie properties and HBO Max, and a global networks company will include CNN among other businesses.At the same time, Paramount Skydance has been eyeing a takeover of WBD prior to a possible spin.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran speaks with CNBC during the Invest i America Forum on Oct. 15, 2025.CNBCFederal Reserve Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller provided conflicting views on how quickly the central bank should lower interest rates in the face of a weakening labor market and heightened geopolitical tensions.Miran said Thursday he plans to repeat his push for a half percentage point interest rate cut when the Fed meets later this month.In a speech delivered in New York, Waller advocated a quarter percentage point reduction at the October meeting, a position that appears more in line with the Fed consensus.Taken together and combined with recent statements from other monetary policymakers, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee looks to be on a clear path to more reductions, the extent to which remains unclear.\"Based on all of the data we have on the labor market, I believe that the FOMC should reduce the policy rate another 25 basis points at our meeting that concludes Oct. 29,\" Waller told the Council on Foreign Relations. \"But beyond that point, I will be looking for how the solid GDP data reconcile with the softening labor market.\"Fed officials have been operating in a quandary between indications of a standstill in hiring against nagging inflation pressures exacerbated by President Donald Trump's tariffs. Waller has been among officials advocating an approach in which the Fed looks through the tariffs as one-off price increases that will not provide lasting inflationary pressures.Waller pointed to two scenarios — one in which gross domestic product continues its upward climb and the labor market improves, in which case the Fed would need a more cautious approach on cutting, and the other in which the economic picture darkens and additional rate cuts on the order of up to 1.25 percentage points are necessary.\"What I would want to avoid is rekindling inflationary pressure by moving too quickly and squandering the significant progress we have made taming inflation,\" he said. \"The labor market has been sending some clear warnings lately, and we should be ready to act if those warnings are validated by what we learn in the coming weeks and months.\"'It should be 50'Both Waller and Miran were appointed by President Donald Trump. Waller is considered one of the final front-runners to succeed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026.In separate remarks, Miran conceded he still expects his colleagues to vote for another quarter-point reduction even as he thinks current circumstances warrant a more aggressive approach.\"My view is that it should be 50\" basis points, he said during a Fox Business interview. \"However, I expect it to be an additional 25 and I think that we're probably set up for three 25 basis point cuts this year, for a total of 75 basis points this year.\"One basis point equals 0.01%, so 50 would be the equivalent of half a percentage point. Miran pushed for a half-point cut at the September meeting but was outvoted 11-1 on the Federal Open Market Committee.Earlier this week, Powell indicated that a softening labor market kept the door open to additional easing. Participants at the September meeting indicated the likelihood of two more moves coming this year, though Miran favored an approach that would lop a total 1.25 percentage points off the fed funds rate by the end of 2025.A government shutdown that has blocked the issuance of most key data points has made the Fed's job tougher.\"It would be really helpful to have the economic data in order to be able to make the decisions we need to make,\" Miran said. \"Certainly, we would want to be inspecting the economy for signs of moves lower in inflation, for signs of changes in the job market. But without those data, we still have to make a decision anyway, and so we'll have to rely upon our forecasts for doing so.\"Miran said economic growth largely looks \"OK for most of this year\" though he is concerned about the recent acceleration in tensions between the U.S. and China, which he sees as boosting the case for big rate cuts.The FOMC next meets Oct. 28-29, with markets pricing in a nearly 100% of a quarter-point reduction.",

Yuki Iwamura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUber plans to offer drivers and couriers in the U.S. ways to make money through the company's app when they're not ferrying around people or food.The ride-hailing company said on Thursday that it's starting a pilot with its AI Solutions Group that will allow drivers to complete small online jobs. The example Uber gave is \"uploading photos to help train AI models,\" which the company said is already being tested in India. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced the news at the company's Only on Uber 2025 conference in Washington, D.C. Uber uses the event to reveal changes the company is making based on the best suggestions from drivers and couriers. In prepared remarks, Khosrowshahi said Uber held \"more than 60 Crew sessions with over 100 Uber team members, gathering hundreds of hours of feedback on everything from product design to policy changes,\" before making product and business changes.Meghan Casserly, an Uber spokesperson, said in an email that another example of a job drivers will be able to do is \"recording themselves speaking in certain languages or accents (following prompts).\" Casserly said that tasks will not be related to any of Uber's autonomous partnerships or the development of driverless vehicles.Pay for tasks will vary based on complexity and estimated time to completion. Drivers can see how much they will be paid before accepting a task.The work is reminiscent of the small online jobs offered by Amazon's Mechanical Turk, Upwork and other data labeling and freelance platforms. Uber said it doesn't disclose the client names or nature of the specific AI-related projects that gig workers may be working on when completing a task.Also on Thursday, Uber announced the official rollout of its women rider preference offering that pairs women drivers and riders. The service, which was introduced in July, will now be available for drivers in Baltimore, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, Oregon, and Washington, D.C. \"In markets where it's already live around the world, women drivers have embraced the choice — using it on more than 100 million trips,\" Khosrowshahi said. All Uber drivers can now set a rider rating preference to avoid being paired with a low-rated passenger, the company said on Thursday. Drivers can adjust their minimum rider rating level for different times of day or night. Uber is also launching what it's calling a delayed ride guarantee for drivers, ensuring that rides that take more than five minutes longer than estimated result in a higher payout. \"In some instances costs may be passed onto the rider,\" Casserly said. It depends if a trip was delayed for something like heavy traffic or if more stops were added by the passenger. WATCH: Uber CEO on Q2 resultswatch now",

Net income increased 13.7% from last quarter, which had marked a record high at the time.As Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, TSMC has benefited from the artificial intelligence boom, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple.\"Recent developments in AI market continue to be very positive,\" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said on an earnings call, adding that increasing adoption of AI models by consumers has led to more demand for compute, and by extension, semiconductor products. \"Thus, our conviction in the AI megatrend is strengthening,\" he added.Bolstered by this AI strength, Wei said the company had raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. In July, the company had expected full-year revenue growth of about 30%.TSMC also increased its expected floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion for the full year, up from a previous floor of $38 billion.Cutting-edge chipsTSMC's high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the July-September quarter, accounting for 57% of revenue.TSMC said advanced chips, with sizes 7-nanometer or smaller, accounted for 74% of TSMC's total wafer revenue in the quarter. In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes signify more compact transistor designs, which lead to greater processing power and efficiency. watch nowGrowth in TSMC's most advanced chips particularly drove revenue gains in the third quarter, according to Counterpoint Research senior analyst William Li.\"TSMC's robust earnings are a direct reflection of the strong traction at 3nm as well as high utilization at 4/5nm – both of which are being driven by ongoing orders from AI GPU and HPC customers and premium smartphone platforms,\" Li told CNBC in a statement. TSMC executives also said Thursday that they were monitoring U.S. tariff developments as Taiwan negotiates for a lower \"reciprocal\" rate and Washington weighs industry-specific duties on semiconductors. However, TSMC is likely to receive some exemptions. \"We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments,\" Wei said, adding that the company would continue to monitor and plan for any impact. TSMC has been investing heavily in facilities in the U.S. — spending that could help reduce its exposure to tariff impacts.Shares of TSMC in Taiwan have risen more than 38% so far this year.",

    "body": "watch nowChina on Thursday accused the U.S. of creating \"panic\" over Beijing's controls on rare earth minerals, but indicated it is open to trade talks to resolve a dispute that has threatened to reignite a trade war between the world's two largest economies.\"The US interpretation seriously distorts and exaggerates China's measures, deliberately creating unnecessary misunderstanding and panic,\" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yongqian told a press conference, according to the state newspaper Global Times.Beijing last week announced sweeping controls on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on China starting Nov. 1 or sooner in retaliation.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer accused China of trying to control the world's technology supply chains in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday. Beijing's actions will determine whether the tariffs take effect, Greer said.Trump wants to work with Beijing and is still scheduled to meet with Xi in South Korea later this month, Greer told CNBC. Beijing is open to talks with the U.S., China's He said Thursday.China points finger at U.S.China's Ministry of Commerce said its export restrictions aim to protect its national security by preventing the misuse of rare earths in military applications like weapons of mass destruction.The spokesperson He pointed to restrictions the U.S. has imposed against China on semiconductors and foreign content rules that aim to push Beijing out of North American supply chains.watch now\"The accusations from the US reveal that the US is projecting its own behavior onto others,\" He said.Rare earths are used to make magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms like the F-35 warplane, Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Predator drones. Rare earth magnets are also used in commercial civilian applications such as robotics, electric vehicles and the semiconductor industry.White House leans into industrial policyBeijing dominates the global rare earth supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on China for imports. The Trump administration is working to set up a domestic supply chain that is independent of Beijing. The Department of Defense struck a deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that includes an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Wednesday that the Trump administration could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of China's rare earth restrictions.\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" Bessent said when asked about additional equity stakes. \"When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.\"The Treasury secretary accused China of using its dominace in rare earth refining and processing to slash prices and push foreign competitors out of the market. Bessent said the Trump administration will impose price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China.\"When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,\" Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.",

Photographer: Hollie Adams/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNestle said Thursday it will cut 16,000 jobs as the firm's new CEO, Philipp Navratil, looks to accelerate a turnaround at the consumer goods giant.In a bid to improve operational efficiency, the firm said it will cut 12,000 white-collar jobs and a further 4,000 roles will be reduced over the next two years.\"We are transforming how we work,\" Navratil wrote in a LinkedIn post summarizing the company's earnings report. \"We are evolving and will simplify our organization and automate our processes.\"It's unclear how Nestle plans to incorporate more automation into its corporate offices, but company spokesperson Chiara Valsangiacomo told CNBC that the initiative is \"much broader\" than replacing roles with artificial intelligence. Other companies, primarily in the tech sector, have slashed jobs as they turn to AI to replace human labor. So far this year, more than 17,000 job losses have been specifically tied to AI, according to a recent report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Shares of Nestle were last seen trading nearly 9% higher. The stock price jump boosted Europe's food and beverage sector, which was up more than 3.3% on Thursday morning.Under its former CEO, Laurent Freixe, Nestle had already announced a cost-savings program worth 2.5 billion Swiss francs ($3.14 billion). This has now been accelerated to 3 billion francs by the end of 2027. The company posted a better-than-expected organic growth rate of 4.3% in the third quarter as it battles an uncertain consumer outlook amid U.S. tariffs and an increase in raw material prices, such as cocoa and coffee beans. Notably, real internal growth, or RIG, returned to positive territory in the third quarter — up 1.5% — as the maker of Nespresso and KitKat saw growth investments pay off, also helped by easier comparisons. watch nowA miss on RIG in the second quarter had led to a sharp underperformance of Nestle shares. Ahead of the results, analysts at HSBC had already expected RIG to return to positive territory \"owing to easier comparatives, incrementally greater benefits from Nestle's own actions plus reduced elasticity effects from price increases.\"However, the company's business in Greater China continued to underperform, with the region negatively impacting organic growth by 80 basis points and RIG by 40 basis points. Nestle added that \"new management was now in place and it was executing its plan to transform the business.\" The firm's strategy of focusing on winners and turning around its losers helped driver better-than-expected third-quarter sales, said Jon Cox, head of European consumer equities, at Kepler Cheuvreux.\"Overall, it is extremely positive and certainly looks operationally as if the company has turned the corner with the better performance while the management upheaval over the summer fades into the background,\" Cox said, adding he expects the stock to react very positively.Turbulent yearThe Vevey, Switzerland-based consumer goods giant has come under pressure from investors as its operating and share performance have trailed peers.Its shares are off more than 40% from their December 2021 peak, and have fallen 9% over the past 12 months. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNestle's sharesNestle has endured a turbulent year, as it saw its CEO Freixe ousted over an undisclosed romantic relationship on Sept. 1. His successor, Navratil is the former CEO of the company's Nespresso business. He has pledged to \"fully embrace the company's strategic direction, as well as the action plan in place to drive Nestle's performance,\" and vowed to \"accelerate execution and to drive the value creation plan with intensity.\" Only two weeks later, Nestle saw itself forced to accelerate Chairman Paul Bulcke's departure, owing to pressure from institutional shareholders over his handling of Freixe's allegations. Bulcke, also a former CEO of Nestle, stepped down from his role earlier than planned, handing over the reins to Vice Chairman and Chairman-elect Pablo Isla, a former Inditex CEO, who was set to take over after Nestle's AGM in April 2026. Analysts say the new leadership duo will need to earn back trust from investors. \"Many long term investors … would have to hear more from someone who is relatively unknown to the market before becoming more positive,\" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a September note.While the initial focus will be on recovery in volume growth and its Chinese business, longer-term investors will be keen to receive updates on the partial sale of Nestle's struggling water unit as well as its underperforming vitamins business, along with plans for its 20% stake in L'Oreal. \"Now we must do more and move faster to accelerate our growth momentum,\" Navratil said Thursday in a statement on the company's earnings. \"As Nestle moves forward, we will be rigorous in our approach to resource allocation, prioritising the opportunities and businesses with the highest potential return.\"— CNBC's Amelia Lucas contributed reporting for this story.Correction: Jon Cox is head of European consumer equities at Kepler Cheuvreux.

    "body": "Workers walk through the crypt of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2025.Valerie Plesch | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith a union lawsuit against the Trump administration on hold during the government shutdown, borrowers' wait times for student loan forgiveness may get even longer.The American Federation of Teachers' legal challenge against Trump officials will be stayed until Congress restores appropriations to the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton said in an Oct. 4 filing. The government shuttered on Oct. 1 after Democrats and Republicans failed to agree on a spending deal.In its lawsuit, the AFT accused the U.S. Department of Education of denying federal student loan borrowers their rights to an affordable repayment plan and to the debt forgiveness opportunities mandated in their loan terms.The stay on the union's legal challenge could further prolong the long wait times borrowers are already facing, consumer advocates say. What's more, a law shielding student loan forgiveness from taxation expires at the end of 2025, meaning borrowers who get the relief after that point may be hit with a bill from the IRS.\"We are very concerned that, without judicial intervention, borrowers will not get their cancellation processed this tax year and could potentially incur thousands of dollars of tax liability,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, which is serving as AFT's counsel.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageGovernment shutdown delays student loan forgiveness lawsuit — what to knowHow expiring ACA health insurance subsidies could impact Roth conversionsMillions of student loan borrowers at risk of default as late payments climbHow much you can make in 2026 and still pay 0% capital gainsWhat laid off federal workers need to know about their student loansDespite government shutdown, Oct. 15 is still the tax extension deadlineBoomers still love their department stores.

Some roles could ‘radically transform'CNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedThe Education Department requested the stay earlier this month, in part because its Justice Department attorneys are prohibited from working during the government shutdown. The plaintiffs did not oppose the request.\"However, if the shutdown does not resolve before Friday, we reserved the right to request that [the] briefing resume,\" Yu said.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment on the loan forgiveness actions. A CNBC reporter's email to a spokesperson at the agency was met with an automated message, saying, \"I will respond to emails once government functions resume.\"Here's what borrowers need to know about the paused lawsuit.Lawsuit focuses on borrower backlogThe AFT, a union with some 1.8 million members, filed its lawsuit against the Trump administration in March, accusing officials of blocking borrowers from student loan repayment plans mandated by Congress, as well as a popular loan forgiveness program for government and nonprofit workers. In September, the union amended its complaint to seek class action status.\"Borrowers are unable to access affordable monthly payment plans, some borrowers are being thrust into default on their debt, and some public service workers are being denied their statutory right to lower their monthly payment and earn credit towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness,\" the lawsuit said.As of the end of August, the Education Department had a backlog of 1,076,266 income-driven repayment plan applications, September court records show. That means more than a million people are waiting to get into a new income-driven repayment plan. Those plans cap a borrower's monthly bill at a share of their income and lead to debt cancellation after a certain period.Meanwhile, there are more than 74,000 pending applications from borrowers hoping to qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Buyback program. PSLF offers debt forgiveness to certain public servants after a decade.\"The backlog provides evidence that the U.S. Department of Education is not adequately fulfilling the statutory requirements\" to offer those relief programs, higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz told CNBC in September.Clock is ticking for borrowers to avoid tax billAFT said in its lawsuit that many of the borrowers in the backlog may already be due for loan forgiveness, but that if the loan discharges occur after December, those borrowers could face a huge tax bill.The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level through the end of 2025. But Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" did not extend or make permanent that broader provision.The tax bill on student loan forgiveness can be substantial.The average loan balance for borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan is around $57,000, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.For those in the 22% tax bracket, having that amount forgiven would trigger a tax burden of more than $12,000, Kantrowitz estimates. Lower earners, or those in the 12% tax bracket, would still owe around $7,000.The difficulty accessing student loan relief programs comes at a challenging time for borrowers.More than 5 million people are in default on their federal student loans and another over 4 million are in \"late-stage delinquency,\" or between 181 and 270 days late on their payments, according to an analysis last month by the Congressional Research Service.\"The effect of the shutdown on student loans is just another blow to college graduates with huge student debt burdens who need access to affordable monthly payment plans,\" said AFT President Randi Weingarten. \"Each day of delay means more stress, more uncertainty, and more people slipping through the cracks.\"",

That's the way this ends,\" the Arizona senator said.The sticking point in passing a funding deal is that Democrats insist that any such bill extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of 2025.A Democratic bill to keep in place those extra subsidies, which about 22 million Americans use to reduce the cost of their Obamacare health plans, is expected to cost nearly $1.5 trillion over a decade.\"The president has talked about how he wants this fixed. He wants these subsidies to be dealt with,\" Kelly said.\"So he agrees we should open the government and we should fix the subsidy issue under the Affordable Care Act, and that's all we want,\" Kelly said. \"So I don't see what the issue is.\"Thune and other Republicans have said they would be willing to discuss whether to extend enhanced ACA tax credits after a short-term funding extension is approved.In an interview Thursday with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Thune said, \"We are happy to sit down and talk about a solution on the ACA, tax credits, but that needs to happen in a separate context, you know, away from having the government open.\"Johnson, in an interview on \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday, said, \"This is not a health care fight. This is a very simple funding fight. It always was.\"\"They have created a red herring. The subsidies don't expire until the end of the year,\" Johnson said.\"We were always planning to have the thoughtful debate and deliberation over that in the month of October and November, before the subsidies expired. They know that. They grabbed that issue from the end of the year and pulled it back into September to try to pretend like that was the issue. It never was,\" Johnson said.The speaker also said there \"needs a dramatic amount of reform\" with the ACA subsidies, \"if indeed they're going to be extended.\"Punchbowl News reported on Thursday that \"there's a bipartisan group of senators discussing several different potential off-ramps\" to the shutdown stalemate \"involving the enhanced Obamacare subsidies.\"\"The group, led in part by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), is discussing the possibility of holding two side-by-side votes intended to end the shutdown,\" Punchbowl reported, cited people familiar with the matter.\"The first vote would be to reopen the government, while the second would be on a one-year extension of the Obamacare enhanced premium tax credits, plus a commitment to pass a longer-term solution by a date certain.\"",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) during the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 24, 2024. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe era of artificial intelligence on Wall Street, and its impact on workers, has begun.Big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are unveiling plans to reimagine their businesses around AI, technology that allows for the mass production of knowledge work.That means that even during a blockbuster year for Wall Street as trading and investment banking spins off billions of dollars in excess revenue — not typically a time the industry would be keeping a tight lid on head count — the companies are hiring fewer people.JPMorgan said Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings report that while profit jumped 12% from a year earlier to $14.4 billion, head count rose by just 1%.The bank's managers have been told to avoid hiring people as JPMorgan deploys AI across its businesses, CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.JPMorgan is the world's biggest bank by market cap and a juggernaut across Main Street and Wall Street finance. Last month, CNBC was first to report about JPMorgan's plans to inject AI into every client and employee experience and every behind-the-scenes process at the bank.The bank has \"a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to be to hire more people,\" Barnum said Tuesday. JPMorgan had 318,153 employees as of September.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg this month that AI will eliminate some jobs, but that the company will retrain those impacted and that its overall head count could grow.'Constrain headcount'At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, CEO David Solomon on Tuesday issued his own vision statement around how the company would reorganize itself around AI. Goldman is coming off a quarter where profit surged 37% to $4.1 billion.\"To fully benefit from the promise of AI, we need greater speed and agility in all facets of our operations,\" Solomon told employees in a memo this week.\"This doesn't just mean re-tooling our platforms,\" he said. \"It means taking a front-to-back view of how we organize our people, make decisions, and think about productivity and efficiency.\"The upshot for his workers: Goldman would \"constrain headcount growth\" and lay off a limited number of employees this year, Solomon said.Goldman's AI project will take years to implement and will be measured against goals including improving client experiences, higher profitability and productivity, and enriching employee experiences, according to the memo.Even with these plans, which is first looking at reengineering processes like client onboarding and sales, Goldman's overall head count is rising this year, according to bank spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli.Tech inspired?The comments around AI from the largest U.S. banks mirror those from tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft, whose leaders have told their workforces to brace for AI-related disruptions, including hiring freezes and layoffs.Companies across sectors have become more blunt this year about the possible impacts of AI on employees as the technology's underlying models become more capable and as investors reward businesses seen as ahead on AI.In banking, the dominant thinking is that workers in operational roles, sometimes referred to as the back and middle office, are generally most exposed to job disruption from AI.For instance, in May a JPMorgan executive told investors that operations and support staff would fall by at least 10% over the next five years, even while business volumes grew, thanks to AI.At Goldman Sachs, Solomon seemed to warn the firm's 48,300 employees that the next few years might be uncomfortable for some.\"We don't take these decisions lightly, but this process is part of the long-term dynamism our shareholders, clients, and people expect of Goldman Sachs,\" he said in the memo. \"The firm has always been successful by not just adapting to change, but anticipating and embracing it.\"watch now",

    "body": "Upgrade CEO Renaud Laplanche speaks at a conference in Brooklyn, New York, in 2018.Alex Flynn | Bloomberg via Getty ImagesUpgrade, the online lender started by LendingClub founder Renaud Laplanche, has raised a new round of funding that values the startup at $7.3 billion.The company said in a press release on Thursday that it raised $165 million in a round led by Neuberger Berman, with participation from LuminArx Capital Management. Laplanche, who created Upgrade in 2016, said it's the first time the company has raised money since 2021. \"We've been cash flow positive over the past three years, so we didn't have to do a new round,\" Laplanche said in an interview. Upgrade got its start offering relatively small personal loans, operating in a similar market as LendingClub. The company has since expanded deeper into financial services with checking and savings accounts, a credit card, credit health monitoring and a buy now, pay later offering. In 2023, Upgrade acquired BNPL travel company Uplift for $100 million.Revenue has more than doubled since the company's last fundraise, Laplanche said, and annualized revenue passed $1 billion in May.Laplanche, who took LendingClub public in 2014, said Upgrade is looking to IPO but wanted additional capital for its balance sheet in the meantime. He said the company is also establishing a new valuation as it begins to offer employee liquidity. \"We were probably 12 to 18 months away from an IPO at this stage,\" he said. \"So we wanted to go ahead and make sure everyone could sell a little bit of stock now without having to wait for the IPO.\"Although consumer lending is still dominated by traditional banks like JPMorgan Chase, Laplanche said the majority of Upgrade's customers are migrating from the legacy banks to take advantage of more automated and faster services.\"This year, we're focusing mostly on making the customer experience make sense across multiple products and making sure that the customer who might have joined Upgrade through a BNPL product has a very seamless experience,\" Laplanche said.The company has also been focusing on home improvement and auto financing, areas that surpassed $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, in total loan originations earlier this year.Competition is rising across the board. Chime, which offers an array of online banking services, went public in June. SoFi has been gaining popularity. And fintech companies including PayPal and Square parent Block have been adding more banking services to their portfolios. Within BNPL, there's Affirm and Klarna, which held its IPO last month. Laplanche said Upgrade's focus in BNPL has been in the travel industry, through relationships with airlines, cruise lines, car rental companies and hotels. \"It's a pretty specific industry that's different from retail, where Klarna and Affirm are stronger,\" he said.WATCH: Trust is the key to unlocking real-time paymentswatch now",

    "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Six-Figure Side Hustle series, where people with lucrative side hustles break down the routines and habits they've used to make money on top of their full-time jobs. Got a story to tell? Let us know! Email us at AskMakeIt@cnbc.com.When Tayo Lanlehin was planning her son's first birthday party in April 2022, she bought yellow and blue signs, balloons and a cake with 3D planets. Every detail fit the \"First Trip Around The Sun\" theme, except the chairs.She only found one rental seating option near her home in Oakland, California, she says: adult-sized white plastic chairs. She borrowed a picnic table with benches instead, and ruminated on the gap in the market for weeks. In May 2022, she sourced and spent roughly $2,000 on 48 kids' chairs from a manufacturer overseas, and stored them in her basement, says Tayo. Those chairs became Bay Area Kids Rentals, a side hustle that she runs with her husband Dolu Lanlehin. Now a full-fledged party rental business, the company has brought in over $295,000 in 2025 revenue as of Nov. 25, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Bay Area Kids Rentals has been profitable since the beginning, but the couple doesn't take an income from the side hustle, and is instead reinvesting those funds back into the business to expand its rental line, Dolu says. It now offers ball pits, mini bumper cars and multiple colors and styles of furniture. Tayo and Dolu's first party was for an event planner, who found the company on Instagram and requested pink chairs for a Barbie-themed party for her daughter in August 2022. She posted photos afterward on Instagram and the review led moms in Hillsborough, an affluent nearby town, to the business's social media accounts, Tayo says.Word-of-mouth \"spread like fire,\" and by October, Bay Area Kids Rentals was supplying decor for parties celebrating professional athletes' and Silicon Valley executives' children and grandchildren, she adds. The rapid success of the side hustle was initially \"a little jarring, because of the level of celebrity,\" Tayo says. \"My day job would end, then I'd go and work on parties for Silicon Valley CEOs' children.\"The couple works a combined eight hours per week running Bay Area Kids Rentals. Tayo, a strategic partnership principal at health-care company Blue Shield of California, oversees the side hustle's marketing and customer communication, and a portion of its work with manufacturers. Dolu — the head of product for Chegg Skills, part of education tech company Chegg — manages the company's accounting and finances.They outsource tasks like delivery, running painting and jewelry-making stations, and equipment maintenance to six contract employees, they say.Here's how Tayo and Dolu started their luxury party rental business, how they attracted high-profile clients and how their individual skillsets make them strong partners: CNBC Make It: Do you think the success of your side hustle is replicable? Dolu: 100%, but there would be some prerequisites. If someone is creative, detail-oriented and in a market somewhere in the world that supports this, I don't see anything stopping them. But Tayo does a nice job of seeing around the corner a little bit, staying connected to market trends and seeing where there are gaps. What kind of skillsets does someone need to run a luxury rental business? Tayo: [My inspiration] comes from a place of empathy. I'm a parent, so I'm always thinking operationally about [their experience], the services we can provide, having a website that is easy to book from, what we can do differently and more seamlessly than other companies. Bay Area Kids Rentals table and chairs at a Peppa Pig themed partyCourtesy of Bay Area Kids RentalsKids are so visual, too. I'm always thinking like, \"Wouldn't it make sense if a princess's birthday had cute pink chairs and a cute pink bounce house?\"  Dolu: Tayo is entrepreneurial, and I tend to be analytical because I come from consulting. I wanted to do market research, so we sent out a survey, just to get a signal. Other than a mortgage, kids are the biggest spending line item for parents. People are willing to be irritational for their kids and spend money they maybe don't even have ... because your kids tend to be the embodiment of your dreams, your visions that maybe you didn't get when you were younger.How did you attract ultra-wealthy, high-profile clients to Bay Area Kid Rentals?Tayo: We've had to do some marketing [and search engine optimization], but we really haven't been pressed because very early on starting this business, we hit our ideal client — with high net worth families and their event planners — like right away. I followed [NBA player] Andrew Wiggins' partner Mychal Johnson, and she had posted about one of her daughter's parties on Instagram. I did research and noticed that her next daughter's birthday was coming up in October [2022]. I direct messaged her with a link to our website saying, \"We have luxury kid party rentals, and we would love to be a part of your kid's birthday, if you're doing a party.\" She responded in 25 minutes and put us in touch with her event planner.We did four events for their family until they moved to Miami [in 2024].What makes ultra-wealthy clients different? What do they like about your services? Tayo: Flexibility and having limited touch points are very important in the luxury space. We don't send our rentals out for just four hours. We schedule our services around when the client wants to set up and tear down, when they want you to come and leave.Bay Area Kids Rentals table and chairs at a Barbie themed partyCourtesy of Bay Area Kids RentalsThey're not looking to go back and forth, either. A lot of our competitors will take deposits to make sure people don't damage their rentals. I don't do that — I just incorporate these costs into our pricing. That way, we don't have to have another conversation to process the payments and the refund.What's it like running this business together, in addition to your full-time job? Tayo: Running this business has given me some confidence that I'm building something of my own. I'm building something that could last and the potential of generational wealth. It's also just really nice to work with Dolu. This is like our third baby. Partnerships in business don't really work out a lot of the times, and the fact that we're married and raising kids on top of having a business, and we know how to resolve all kinds of issues, gives me the confidence that [our relationship] is going to be fine.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

That figure won't be finalized until Monday, when all of Sunday's ticket sales are calculated, but would represent either the third or fourth best Thanksgiving haul of all time.The fourth-highest Thanksgiving holiday box office is currently $291.3 million, which was generated in 2012 while the third-highest is 2013's $294.2 million haul, according to data from Comscore.While the 2025 Thanksgiving period at the box office was smaller than both 2018's $315.6 million haul and 2024's record-breaking $424.9 million, it still set records. IMAX reported its best five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend ever with $40.8 million in global ticket sales, 70% higher than the previous record set during the same frame in 2024.\"'Zootopia 2' and 'Wicked: For Good' delivered a phenomenal one-two punch for the Thanksgiving holiday — hitting the sweet spot for family audiences and sending our global box office soaring well past expectations,\" Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, said in a statement Sunday.Disney, too, hit several benchmarks.Largest animated box office ever \"Zootopia 2\" had the highest global opening of an animated movie of all time, with an estimated haul of $556 million. It is the fourth-highest global opening of all time, the company reported.\"A staggering global result for 'Zootopia 2' as the Disney brand coupled with a PG-rated family film extravaganza and a beloved original installment powered the film to over a half a billion dollars worldwide,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNBC. \"This film truly cracked the code on what family audiences around the world [are] looking for when venturing out to cinemas.\"Additionally, the animated sequel posted the second-highest Thanksgiving day and Thanksgiving opening for both the five-day and three-day periods. The current record holder is 2024's \"Moana 2\" which tallied $221 million for the five-day Thanksgiving period and $135.5 million for the three-day.Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" added an estimated $93 million to the domestic box office during the five-day Thanksgiving period, smaller than the $118 million \"Wicked\" picked up during the same period in 2024.Still, box office experts expected \"Wicked: For Good\" and \"Zootopia 2\" to continue to snap up ticket sales in the weeks before Christmas and ahead of the release of Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\"This holiday weekend now sets the stage for a solid final home stretch of the box office year and with a great assortment of films on the way, including notable blockbusters and awards contenders ... this is a welcome result in the wake of what has been a very tumultuous post-summer season for the industry,\" Dergarabedian said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters during travel to Washington, D.C., from Palm Beach International Airport, Florida, U.S., November 30, 2025. Anna Rose Layden | ReutersThe White House on Monday released new details about President Donald Trump's October MRI, offering a more comprehensive explanation for the procedure after questions about why the 79-year-old underwent advanced imaging at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read aloud from a summary during the daily press briefing, saying that the MRI was part of Trump's \"comprehensive executive physical\" and was ordered because men in his age group \"benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.\" The White House described the imaging as routine and preventative, meant to identify potential issues early and confirm overall function. According to Trump's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, the cardiovascular imaging showed no signs of arterial narrowing, impaired blood flow, or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels.He found that the heart chambers were normal in size, the vessel walls appeared smooth and healthy, and there was no indication of inflammation or clotting. Dr. Barbabella also reported that all major organs appeared healthy and well-perfused, with no acute or chronic concerns detected.Barbabella described the president's cardiovascular system as being in \"excellent health.\" Despite Leavitt's detailing of the MRI and subsequent release of the memo summarizing the MRI results from Dr. Barbabella, the White House stopped short of releasing images of the tests.Until Monday, the White House only described the October Walter Reed visit as a \"follow-up evaluation\" that included \"advanced imaging,\" offering no explanation for why the procedure was done.The release came as scrutiny of the MRI intensified over the weekend after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democratic nominee for vice president alongside Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, called on Trump to release the results, reacting to a Thanksgiving Truth Social post in which Trump attacked Walz, the state's Somali community and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn. \"Has anyone in the history of the world ever had an MRI assigned to them and have no idea what it was for, as he says,\" Walz later said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",

    "body": "Alina Habba, speaks after being sworn in as US Attorney General for New Jersey, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 28, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesAlina Habba, President Donald Trump's pick to serve as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, remains disqualified from serving in that role in either a permanent or acting capacity, a U.S. appeals court ruled Monday.The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit is the latest judicial rebuke to the Trump administration's efforts to quickly install its preferred candidates in powerful law-enforcement jobs.A three-judge panel, in a 32-page opinion, unanimously upheld an Aug. 21 ruling from a lower federal court that Habba was unlawfully serving as acting U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\"It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place,\" Circuit Judge D. Michael Fisher wrote in the appellate ruling. The unusual series of legal moves taken by the Department of Justice to install Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as an acting U.S. attorney demonstrates \"the difficulties it has faced,\" Fisher wrote.\"Yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,\" the judge wrote.Fisher and another judge on the panel, D. Brooks Smith, were nominated to the Third Circuit by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other judge, L. Felipe Restrepo, was nominated by Democratic ex-President Barack Obama.Abbe Lowell and Gerald Krovatin, lawyers for one of the parties in the case challenging Habba's appointment, noted in a statement with Norm Eisen that Monday's ruling marks \"the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.\"\"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate,\" the lawyers said in a joint statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Trump nominated her in June, but she never underwent the Senate confirmation process, a Constitutionally-mandated step that can be lengthy and contentious.Habba could only legally serve as an interim prosecutor for a limited time under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. As that deadline neared, the Trump administration took a number of steps to keep Habba in the role.The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, who was set to become interim U.S. attorney for the district after Habba's scheduled departure. Trump then withdrew Habba's nomination, and Bondi appointed her as both \"Special Attorney\" to the attorney general and the First Assistant U.S. attorney, aiming to elevate her automatically to acting U.S. attorney.But the appeals court panel ruled Monday that those actions failed to comply with the provisions of the FVRA.\"Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's disqualification order,\" Fisher concluded.The ruling came one week after another Trump-picked prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was deemed invalidly appointed.That ruling, which disqualified Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also threw out the cases she brought against two major Trump foes: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.Monday's appellate ruling on Habba did not dismiss the underlying criminal charges against the two people who had challenged her appointment.",

Mikhail Metzel | Via ReutersAll eyes are on Russia this week as talks over a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine shift to Moscow and step up a gear.U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is travelling to Russia on Monday and is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for discussions on a U.S.-backed 19-point peace plan. Ukraine has tentatively supported the fledgling peace proposals, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it too can work with the framework agreement.The latest plan is an amended version of an initial 28-point plan, reported several weeks ago, that had been devised by the U.S. and Moscow without Ukraine's involvement, and which favored Russia.Russia will be eager to have its say on the amended proposals after a flurry of diplomacy and discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in the last week and talks being in Florida on Sunday. Whether Putin will play ball when it comes to a new peace plan is a big unknown, however, with Russia feeling like it has both the advantage on the battlefield and U.S. President Donald Trump's ear when it comes to the outlines of a future peace deal. The Kremlin confirmed that Witkoff and Putin will meet on Tuesday.Will Putin play ball?Putin and Kremlin officials have reacted cautiously to the amended peace plan so far, signalling that Russia is ready to talk but that the war in Ukraine might not necessarily end soon.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said during a trip to Kyrgyzstan. He added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" with Witkoff.

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesBut Putin also praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting there would only stop when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas.If they did not do so, Putin said, Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives of having full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.Read moreAnalysts at the Institute for the Study of War noted in analysis on Sunday that Russian military bloggers appear skeptical that Putin will compromise when it comes to his territorial demands on Ukraine.\"Russian information space voices continue to argue that the Kremlin will likely reject a ceasefire or any iteration of the U.S.-proposed peace plan because the Kremlin views these efforts as inconsequential and as a hindrance to Russia's goals in Ukraine and globally,\" ISW analysts noted Sunday.'Delicate' processThe lead up to the latest diplomatic scramble for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia comes after some seesawing from the White House over its position on how the war should end and what concessions are needed in order for a ceasefire. President Trump has vacillated over his support for Ukraine and has appeared, at times, to support Russia's demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. He has then backtracked, stating that Kyiv's forces can win back all their land, muddying the waters as to where het stands on a peace settlement.Following talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the process toward a peace deal was \"delicate\" and that Russia's position needed to be factored in to any deal.He said the four-hour long talks — which included Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as a Ukrainian delegation headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Ustem Rumerov — had been productive but that more work was left to be done. \"So much work remains, but today was, again, a very productive and useful session where I think additional progress was made,\" Rubio told reporters after the talks.",

The iPhone maker transitioned away from the company's processors at the start of the 2020s.Last week Intel was on the subject of a lawsuit filed by TSMC, in which it alleged one of its former senior vice president had leaked \"confidential information\" to the company.

Ben Emons, founder and CIO of Fedwatch Advisors, said that people remain \"nervous\" following the recent bitcoin sell-off, adding that Monday's reversal has broadly been attributed to a $400 million exchange liquidation.Speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday, he highlighted the sizable leverage across bitcoin exchanges, which is up to 200x in some instances. With an estimated $787 billion outstanding leverage in perpetual crypto futures, against some $135 billion outstanding in ETFs, \"you can do the math,\" Emons said. \"There is still a lot of leverage in bitcoin out there.

Perpetual futures open interest has fallen, a sign of reduced speculative positioning and leverage in the market, according to Zach Pandl, head of research at crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale.

    "body": "Strathroy | Istock | Getty ImagesFor nearly a century, John Dioguardi's family has been making custom headstones and other memorial markers at Rome Monument in western Pennsylvania. Recently, he's wondered how much time his business has left.Dioguardi has been trying to adapt for more than a decade as the rise in cremations has hurt demand for the traditional burial markers his business has become synonymous with. This year, they've been dealt another blow: President Donald Trump's broad and steep tariffs, which have driven up costs for granite coming to American graveyards from around the world.\"I hope this all works out,\" Dioguardi said. \"I have no idea if it will.\"Rome Monument is part of a fabric of small, family run companies that make memorialization products facing the dual challenges of levies and cremations. Members of the blue-collar industry are in a fight to survive the social, political and economic shifts throwing their livelihoods into a state of disruption. 'A gut punch'As Dioguardi watched the White House's trade relationship with China fluctuate in recent months, he shifted two-thirds of his supply chain out of the Asian country. Most of it went to India, which has seen a relatively lower tariff rate for much of the year.Craftsman working with compressed air at tombstone.Kzenon | Istock | Getty ImagesDioguardi said bringing production to the U.S. would likely still be more expensive — even with new tariffs — due to higher labor costs. There's another simple reason to look internationally: Some types of granite, like the multi-colored aurora found in India, come only from certain regions abroad.\"God gave the different parts of the world certain yummies,\" Dioguardi said. \"We have nothing like that in our country.\"Trump's levies have altered the bottom lines in the industry, leaving businesses struggling with how to mitigate the additional costs.In September 2024, Milano Monuments' Jim Milano paid around 29% custom duties and taxes on a container coming in from China to his Cleveland-based business. A year later, that rate nearly doubled to 59%.He's talked with fellow memorial monument suppliers about adding an addendum to large orders telling buyers that the price could be later adjusted depending on if tariff rates move. For now, Milano said he and many peers are covering the tariffs out of pocket. He's taken a pay cut as a result.\"There's just so many crazy things that have come up in the last several years,\" said Milano, whose business has been around for half of a century. \"But this tariff thing has been like a gut punch.\"In recent months, Milano has found himself rushing to communicate with his ordering controller when he sees a headline about higher levies to ensure his containers hit the water before they would take effect.Milano's showroom and a memorial made by the business.Courtesy: Jim MilanoBecause the monument industry produces specialty products, it typically runs on lead times of several weeks or months. Importers can see significantly different levy rates if the White House adjusts its trade policy between when memorial products are first ordered by customers and the granite is actually shipped to the U.S.\"The uncertainty part is the hardest part we struggle with,\" said Nathan Lange, president of Monument Builders of North America, a trade group representing hundreds of business with an average lifespan of more than seven decades.Granite wholesalers have similarly needed to recalibrate their sales practices. At Kentucky-based PS Granite, operations chief Parthi Damo said they have delayed printing annual marketing materials for next year because they aren't sure if tariff rates could change again, which would mean prices need to be adjusted. Damo said he may switch to making new documents every 60 days in case they need to keep updating prices.Trump has argued that foreign countries or, in some cases, the companies importing their products should eat the tariffs. Data shows that businesses have largely absorbed cost increases in the short term.blank stone gravestones and grave slabs in outdoor rural granite workshop.Krimkate | Istock | Getty ImagesBut memorial creators said that their smaller margins and lower volumes make it tougher to cover the costs than it would be for large retailers. Because the businesses work with shoppers feeling emotions around death, industry members say they need to be especially sensitive when deciding whether to pass down costs to consumers.\"It's hard,\" Milano said. \"We can't go back to a grieving family and say, 'You know what, we got to add an additional $1,000 to your family's memorial to cover the tariffs.'\"A changing businessEven before the tariffs ramped up, the industry was busy reorienting itself for a future with fewer traditional burials.The U.S.' five-year cremation rate has surged to more than 60% in 2024, up from under 40% a decade and a half prior, according to the Cremation Association of North America. The organization expects more than two out of every three bodies will be cremated in an average year between 2025 and 2029.Dioguardi has considered expanding the work radius around his Pennsylvania headquarters to buoy demand for grave site products, a broader trend which he said has prompted a wave of acquisitions within the industry. Dioguardi and his peers have emphasized alternatives like pedestal memorials for people remembering a cremated loved one.He's also worked on less conventional monuments: Dioguardi recently helped a cemetery install a \"rainbow bridge\" memorial that contains the ashes of pets.\"Cremation has changed our business tremendously,\" Dioguardi said. \"It's created new opportunities. It has closed some other doors.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments.

Social media users find concerning economic omens in places you wouldn't expectIf monument builders need to raise prices to account for tariffs, Milano worries it could push more consumers to opt for cremations. Beyond granite, he said levies on production materials have also taken a bite out of profits.To be sure, Canada's monument industry is feeling the heat more intensely with a five-year cremation average expected to surpass 80%. Dioguardi said granite manufacturers he worked with based in America's northern neighbor haven't increased prices due to tariffs given the shrinking domestic demand.Dioguardi said his family operation should be on solid ground for another decade, but he questions if it can exist in its current state beyond that. At the same time, the 75-year-old knows that the fate of the business is married in part to whether people want their loved ones to have any sort of memorialization. When comparing the pyramids the Egyptians opted for to today's trend of having ashes spread somewhere without a marker, Dioguardi isn't exactly confident. Part of the challenge, he and other industry veterans say, is proving that any sort of memorial product is worth the investment.\"Forget about making the pyramid,\" Dioguardi said. \"I don't even know if they want a pebble.\"",

    "body": "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, speaks to members of the media outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump knows who he's going to select as the next Federal Reserve chair but isn't saying yet. Prediction markets have their minds made up, but the front-runner also is playing it coy.While that part of the mystery appears ready to clear up in the coming weeks, what's far less certain is the type of environment the new central bank leader will face at a potential crossroads for the U.S. economy.National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett has been dubbed the clear favorite, buoyed by a Bloomberg News report last week that handicapped the five-person race to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell, whose term runs out in May.Asked Sunday about the situation, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, \"I know who I am going to pick, yeah. We'll be announcing it.\" Beyond that, he smirked when asked about Hassett, adding \"I'm not telling you, we'll be announcing it.\"The candidate himself made the rounds on the weekend talk circuit, also dodging questions about his prospects. Hassett is part of a field that also includes current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Governor Kevin Warsh and BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder.watch now\"I'm really honored to be amongst a group of really great candidates,\" Hassett said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" He did note that markets had a positive reaction to the report of him emerging as the favorite, saying that Americans \"could expect President Trump to pick somebody who's going to help them, you know, have cheaper car loans and easier access to mortgages at lower rates.\"Shortly before that, on Fox News, Hassett merely stated, \"If he picks me, I'd be happy to serve.\"Predictions markets have been off to the races in recent days, placing firm odds on Hassett getting the job. As of Monday afternoon, Kalshi traders assigned a 79% probability, while PredictIt put the chance at 75% and Polymarket had it at just 63%, with \"no announcement by Christmas\" having the second-highest probability of 22%, easily topping any of the other four finalists.A divided FedWhomever the actual pick is will take over a Fed that is currently torn between officials who think additional interest rate cuts are warranted to head off potential trouble in the labor market against those who worry that inflation continues to pose a threat that would be exacerbated by further easing in monetary policy.For the next rate decision on Dec. 19, futures market traders are assigning an 87.6% chance of a cut in trading that has been highly volatile in recent weeks.Trump and other administration officials have been vocal about their preference for much lower rates, and the president has stated that is a litmus test for the next chair. In 2026, members of the rotating cast of regional presidents who get a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee will have a hawkish tilt, meaning a preference to fight inflation and hold rates steady.But the coming Fed regime will be about more than rates.In a CNBC interview last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the Fed chair search, said he favors a rethink of the Fed's mission. \"We've gotten to this point where monetary policy has gotten very complicated, and it's more than just cutting rates,\" he said. \"I think we've got to kind of simplify things.\"Call for reformIn particular, Bessent singled out the role of regional presidents. While they play a relatively limited role — at least compared to the chair and the Board of Governors — in setting rates and other issues related to monetary policy, public commentary from the local leaders can move markets at times.Bessent said that is part of broader issues related to outsized role the Fed has grown to play in the economy and financial markets, largely since the financial crisis when the central bank played a pivotal role in implementing programs to guide the economy out of its worst slide since the Great Depression.\"I think it's time for the Fed just to move back into the background like it used to do, calm things down and work for the American people, set monetary policy on a good course,\" he said. \"All these speeches by these bank presidents ... are just redundant. Why don't they actually just come out and talk about the meaningful issues to the American people, rather than the short term view of the next meeting?\"The view on regional presidents is important in that they come up for reappointment in 2026. While the local boards hire the presidents, they are subject to the Board of Governors' approval. One issue Bessent also commented on was that several presidents are not from the districts they represent.Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz, applauded Bessent's view.\"We don't need a play-by-play Fed,\" El-Erian said Monday morning on CNBC. \"We need the Fed to cool it. We need the Fed to step back and take a bigger, sort of visionary view. And we need reforms. We desperately need reforms. And I think all five on the short list are committed to reforming that institution, which is critical, not just for the U.S. but for the global economy.\"watch now",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly logo appears on the company’s office in San Diego, California, U.S., Nov. 21, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly on Monday said it is lowering the cash prices of single-dose vials of its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound on its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, building on efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the medicine more accessible.The announcement also comes weeks after chief rival Novo Nordisk unveiled additional discounts on the cash prices of its obesity and diabetes drugs. Starting Monday, cash-paying patients with a valid prescription can get the starting dose of Zepbound vials for as low as $299 per month on LillyDirect, down from a previous price of $349 per month. They can also access the next dose, 5 milligrams, for $399 per month and all other doses for $449 per month, down from $499 per month across those sizes. Zepbound carries a list price of roughly $1,086 per month. That price point, and spotty insurance coverage for weight loss drugs in the U.S., have been significant barriers to access for some patients. Eli Lilly's announcement comes just weeks after President Donald Trump inked deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to make their GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to get and afford. The agreements will cut the prices the government pays for the drugs, introduce Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offer discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January, TrumpRx. But Eli Lilly's deal with Trump centers around lowering the prices of a different form of Zepbound – a multi-dose pen – after it wins Food and Drug Administration approval. That means Eli Lilly's Monday announcement around cutting prices on the existing single-dose vials could allow more patients to get discounted treatments more quickly. \"We will keep working to provide more options — expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access — so more people can get the medicines they need,\" said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and global customer capabilities, in a statement. Eli Lilly's stock, which has climbed more than 36% this year, fell nearly 2% on Monday. Its meteoric rise due to the success of Zepbound and its diabetes injection Mounjaro vaulted it to becoming the first health-care company to hit a $1 trillion market value last month. Though cutting prices means lower revenue per medication sold, Eli Lilly's sales — and shares — have continued to soar through past pricing announcements as demand balloons.With single-dose vials, patients need to use a syringe and needle to draw up the medicine and inject it into themselves. Eli Lilly first introduced that form of Zepbound in August 2024. It's unclear how many patients are currently using single-dose vials of Zepbound. But Eli Lilly previously said that direct-to-consumer sales now account for more than a third of new prescriptions of Zepbound. Novo Nordisk earlier this month lowered the price of its obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. That excludes the highest dose of Ozempic. The company also launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. ",

On average, these billionaires are worth $2.2 billion each.Despite Europe as a whole seeing a declinPhoto: Ingolf Pompe | LOOK-fotoSwitzerland has long been a haven for the ultra-rich. Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz.So it was perhaps unsurprising that a new inheritance tax was resoundingly rejected by voters on Sunday. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% was defeated with 78% voting against it. Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse called talk of the inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion.\"It welcomed the proposal's defeat, saying: \"The threat of forced sales of companies and the resulting weakening of the business location have convinced those entitled to vote from all political camps.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats. Money raised from the tax would have been earmarked to fund policies to combat climate change, with the party saying it would \"channel billions into climate protection every year while simultaneously combating extreme wealth inequality.\"watch now'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Before the vote, close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative, first proposed in 2024, had already shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, had threatened to leave the country if the tax became law. He told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge, from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" watch now\"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"One potential impact of the 50% tax, if implemented, would have been a fall in tax revenue, according to  Legge. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.But although Switzerland faces competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, Legge said Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowGiorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, agreed that Switzerland remains in a strong position. \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management,\" he told CNBC last week. \"We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"",

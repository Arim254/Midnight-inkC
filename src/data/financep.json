    "body": " An illustration photo shows Moore Threads logo in a smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China on October 30, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChina's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: \"It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker,\" said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies. For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.\"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify,\" said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.Institutional exposure  Northbound trading, which refers to overseas and Hong Kong investors buying mainland China stocks via Stock Connect and other schemes, will not be available until \"typically several months after any listing,\" Shou said. Even then, it's not a guarantee that Moore Threads and MetaX will be included.Overseas retail investors can gain limited exposure through offshore funds that invest in A-shares. Foreign retail investors interested in STAR Market IPOs, such as Moore Threads and MetaX, can invest in non-China domiciled funds that invest in A-shares and usually these funds do participate in IPOs, Shou said. China's STAR Market is a Nasdaq-style tech board in Shanghai focused on strategic sectors such as semiconductors, AI and biotech, with looser profitability requirements and tighter access for foreign retail investors.\"However, such participation will be indirect, very limited, and mostly non-meaningful,\" he caveated, as IPO allocations may be tiny relative to the fund's total assets.While foreign retail investors are largely locked out of access to mainland Chinese IPOs, some large institutions can participate in them.A program for qualified foreign institutional Investors, or QFIIs, allows approved global institutions to invest directly in onshore Chinese stocks, including IPOs. But it is designed for large asset managers, sovereign funds and banks, not individual investors.QFIIs include the likes of investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as well as central banks, among hundreds of other participants.The QFII and renminbi QFII schemes are programs that allow approved institutional investors to trade onshore A-shares and participate in IPOs, but they require approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, with foreign-exchange registration and settlement overseen by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE.While China's QFII and RQFII regimes do not set explicit asset-size or operating-history thresholds, applicants must be institutions with sound financial standing, relevant investment experience, robust governance and compliance systems, and a clean regulatory record.They must also appoint an onshore custodian and complete foreign-exchange registration with SAFE.The CSI 300 Information Technology Index, which measures the performance of information-technology companies within China's CSI 300, is up 32% year to date, compared with the benchmark CSI 300, up 17%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index, which has gained 24% so far this year.",

    "body": "For couples, \"holidays are a scary time\" because they often call for revealing a new side of yourself to your partner, says Sabrina Romanoff, New York-based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily. Some people have decades-long, big family traditions they want to uphold. Others prefer to keep it low key. Whatever the activities are, and whatever the meaning behind them, opening up about what matters to you can feel very vulnerable.  Ultimately, the goal is to blend \"each other's cultures and worlds,\" says Romanoff. Here's how successful couples tackle this festive time of year. They're 'direct and honest' about what they want First, each partner has to know what they want and be open about it.Do they want their partner to join them for their family Christmas? Do they want to take some time off and have a quiet Hanukkah? \"You are better off being direct and honest with your partner so you both can really get what you both need,\" says Romanoff.Ultimately, there will likely have to be some flexibility, on both sides. \"I think the healthiest couples are those who can get creative and compromise,\" she says. \"There's only one Christmas Eve, there's only one Christmas Day.\" Maybe this year, the couple spends time with one side's family and next year they spend time with the other. They create new traditions togetherSecond, successful couples create new traditions together. \"That could mean going to see the tree together a Rockefeller Center,\" says Romanoff, \"or getting an ornament together.\" It could mean cooking a holiday meal or doing a hot chocolate crawl. Building something new together is a bonding experience. \"I think that's what brings security\" in the relationship, she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Nandi Owolo's first foray into junk journaling came by accident.One day in June 2024, Owolo fell while walking her dog. \"I started junk journaling because I broke my foot on my birthday, of all days,\" she tells CNBC Make It.She was homebound on doctor's orders for two months of recovery. Then, by way of some TikTok scrolling, junk journaling came into her life.The L.A. resident says junk journaling, described as \"as a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art,\" made her feel crafty for the first time in her life. \"I personally think that I have no artistic skill,\" says Owolo, now 30. \"I can't draw; I can't knit; I can't paint.\" Arranging and gluing down souvenirs, photos and stickers into chaotically colorful spreads? That she could do.Junk journaling, also considered \"Gen Z's version of scrapbooking,\" has taken off in recent years. Enthusiasts say they like that the hobby keeps them off their phones. It taps into the nostalgia of collecting and displaying physical media. And there are no rules in arranging personal mementos from the grand, like concert tickets or birthday cards, to the everyday, like a restaurant napkin or coffee sleeve.The hobby is \"one man's trash is another man's treasure\" come to life, and its embrace of imperfection is part of the appeal, Owolo says: \"It's an artistic medium in which you can do whatever you want with the page,\" she says.Junk journaling, a cross between scrapbooking, creative journaling and collage art, has taken off in recent years thanks to enthusiasts wanting a screen-free creative hobby.Courtesy of Nandi OwoloAdd in an element of in-person gathering, which many young people are craving post-pandemic, and Owolo says she felt she had a hit on her hands.Two months after beginning her own crafting journey, Owolo launched the social media handles for Junk Journal Club and hosted her first meetup through a local social club where she was a member. The event quickly reached maximum capacity at 35 people, which Owolo says signaled to her that there was a big demand.Owolo soon held her second event at a park with 60 people. A year and a half later, she now regularly hosts ticketed events for 20 to 30 guests at $35 to $50 a pop between one and three times per month. Owolo says she believes her Junk Journal Club is the first U.S. club dedicated to hosting real-life events for the hobby. She also launched a Discord channel for users around the world to connect, share inspiration, post their pages and send each other care packages via a pen pal program. The group now boasts nearly 2,000 members around the U.S. and internationally, including Canada, Germany, Australia and beyond.From job loss to entrepreneurshipMay 2025 marked a turning point for Owolo and her Junk Journal Club. The entertainment professional lost what she calls her \"dream job\" working to turn books and comics into TV shows and movies.While grieving the \"heartbreaking layoff,\" Owolo says she recognized an opportunity in Junk Journal Club.\"As cliche as it is, it's like I had this other thing that I had more control over,\" she says. \"No one can lay me off from Junk Journal Club. It is mine.\"Owolo got to work figuring out how she wanted to grow the business and decided to go after branded events. She set a goal to collaborate with two brands by the end of 2025.Nandi Owolo launched Junk Journal Club in August 2024 and turned it into her full-time business in 2025. She hosts one to three events each month, which often sell out quickly.Courtesy of Nandi OwoloShe found her first partner in Nuuly, the clothing rental service, which came about from \"sheer emailing and networking,\" Owolo says. The brand covered the cost of supplies and other fees for an event in November, making it free for guests. It was also the first time Owolo was paid as a creator to make several Instagram Reels videos for the clothing company's social media feeds.Throughout the fall, Owolo says she hosted five collaborative events, including with artist and creative director Ramisha Sattar, Australia-based artist and author Martina Calvi (whom Owolo calls the \"junk journaling queen\"), and Paramount Pictures to promote its movie \"Regretting You.\"There's so much overwhelming noise in the world right now. Junk journaling is a great way to quiet that noise.Nandi OwoloOwolo says she was reluctant to call herself an entrepreneur as someone who had, up until now, never tried to make money from a side hustle.\"It almost felt fraudulent,\" Owolo says. She questioned herself: \"Am I allowed to call myself an entrepreneur? Am I allowed to call this a business? And eventually I was like, 'I absolutely am allowed to call it that.' It just took a while.\"Growing the business in 2026Owolo says she's still actively applying for a new full-time role in marketing and brand management, and that she hopes hiring managers will see her work with Junk Journal Club as an asset. She's currently working a contract job for a beverage company to fill in for someone on maternity leave, though that ends in January.She says that she isn't taking a salary from Junk Journal Club and that all ticket sales go back into the events themselves to cover supplies for attendees, food and drink, the venue rental, and a goodie box with stationery and stickers for guests to take home afterward.Owolo says her goal is to be able to pay herself from Junk Journal Club, but that for now, she's focused on giving \"people the best experience possible.\"\"I recognize that there is a way that I could have hosted all these events and paid myself a little bit of money,\" she says, \"but it would have been at the sacrifice of less sticker sheets, or not getting a custom thing made for the event. I've not yet reached the point where I'm willing to sacrifice those things.\"Owolo intends to grow slowly and intentionally. Though she says her events tend to sell out, usually within an hour of tickets going live and as fast as under a minute, she prefers to cap gatherings at 20 to 30 guests to curate a cozy atmosphere.Looking ahead to 2026, Owolo says she hopes to land more brand partnerships for collaborative projects.Junk Journal Club events usually accommodate 20 to 30 attendees. Tickets often sell out within an hour, or as quickly as a few minutes, of going on sale.Ximena Escobar\"L.A. is the land of activations and experiential marketing,\" she says. To touring musicians, she proposes, why not work with her on an event where eager fans create a collage inspired by their favorite song? Or for the many brands that host influencer dinners, might a junk journaling session pair well with dessert?In the meantime, Owolo expects the appetite for in-person crafting will only grow.\"There's so much overwhelming noise in the world right now,\" she says. \"Junk journaling is a great way to quiet that noise.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": "Alphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday around 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldThe power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.Waymo's Philion also told CNBC that \"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections. This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The image, which contained two separate photos showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday.  The image showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenza.One of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein, and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan, New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche early Sunday said the image was removed from the website after learning there were concerns about women in the photo, \"so we pulled that photo down.\"\"It has nothing to do with President Trump,\" said Blanche on NBC's \"Meet the Press.The disappearance of the files came despite a law signed by Trump that required the agency to make public all of the so-called Epstein files by Friday.The image went live on the DOJ's website on Friday, and disappeared from the webpage several hours later. The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all DOJ files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.",

    "body": "Jonathan Raa | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChip giant Nvidia (NVDA) is considered to be one of the key beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, thanks to robust demand for its advanced graphics processing units (GPUs). The stock has been under pressure recently due to concerns about valuations of AI plays and growing competition in the AI chip space from rivals like Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Alphabet-owned Google's tensor processing units (TPUs). Nvidia is also facing uncertainty related to chip exports to China amid geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing. Despite ongoing pressures, several top analysts remain bullish on Nvidia for several reasons, including its solid track record, strong execution, continued innovation and dominant position in the AI GPU market. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on NVDA stock with a price target of $205.Let's look at the views of three such Wall Street pros who are bullish on Nvidia's growth potential. Vivek Arya – Bank of AmericaFollowing a virtual meeting with Nvidia's vice president of investor relations, Toshiya Hari, Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya reiterated a buy rating on NVDA stock with a price forecast of $275, saying that he continues to view it as a top pick.Among the key takeaways, Arya mentioned that while Nvidia agrees that Gemini 3 is a top large language model (LLM) that is trained on Google's in-house TPU, the company contends that it is too early to declare a clear winner. Specifically, the company emphasized that the existing GPU-based LLMs available were all trained on old Hopper (2022) architecture and cannot be compared with the upcoming LLMs that are trained on NVDA's Blackwell (2024) GPUs.Arya highlighted that management is confident about the expected launch of the Blackwell-backed LLMs in early 2026, which would prove that \"they are at least a full generation ahead of competition.\" In fact, external benchmarks like MLPerf and InferenceMAX view Blackwell as the clear leader in both training and inference, with Nvidia standing out in terms of key metrics like tokens per watt and revenue per token.The five-star analyst added that Nvidia continues to have demand and supply visibility into at least $500 billion of revenue opportunity for Blackwell, Rubin and networking for calendar years 2025 to 2026. Interestingly, the recent deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Anthropic/Microsoft are incremental to this $500 billion outlook (as they are letter of intents) and represent potential upside.Overall, the meeting reinforced Arya's bullish thesis, with the analyst finding NVDA stock's valuation attractive. Specifically, its price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples of 25x and 19x of 2026 and 2027 earnings, respectively, imply only a 0.5x PEG ratio. That's compared to the average of 2x for the Magnificent Seven stocks and growth competitors.Arya ranks No. 270 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. Stacy Rasgon – BernsteinBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon is also upbeat about Nvidia's prospects and has a buy rating on the semiconductor stock with a price target of $275. In his latest note to investors, the analyst discussed some interesting takeaways from his virtual investor meeting with Stewart Stecker, senior director of investor relations at Nvidia.Rasgon noted that the $500 billion outlook announced in October for cumulative Blackwell, Rubin and networking sales for calendar years 2025 and 2026 will likely see an upside, as it doesn't include new deals such as that with Anthropic, the OpenAI 10 GW collaboration, and partnerships in the Middle East.On concerns about competition from Google's in-house chips, Rasgon noted that while Nvidia acknowledges the progress that Google has made in more than 10 years, the company believes that it is about two years ahead of the search engine giant's TPU program.Nvidia argues that, given the evolving AI market, it will be challenging for Google to persuade cloud service providers to deploy TPUs as they are meant for specific model structures. \"But they believe NVIDIA's programmable platform solutions remain the best hardware for cloud AI infrastructure,\" said Rasgon.Regarding President Donald Trump's recent post about allowing Nvidia to ship H200 AI chips to China, subject to a 25% cut that goes to the U.S., Rasgon noted that Nvidia is still waiting to secure licenses to ship H200s, after which it intends to look into demand requests and commence manufacturing. Moreover, Nvidia has not yet obtained any details about the 25% revenue sharing with the U.S. government and is currently unclear about how this fee will be accounted for.Rasgon ranks No. 144 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 67% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.3%. Blayne Curtis – JefferiesIn a research note on the 2026 outlook for semiconductors, Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis reaffirmed a buy rating on Nvidia stock with a price target of $250. Curtis called Broadcom (AVGO) as the top pick, citing ASIC (application-specific integrated circuits) inflection and the highest level of estimate revisions expected for the company in the semiconductor group. That said, he remains bullish on Nvidia.\"We haven't given up on NVDA given the technology moat and valuation at 18x the $10 EPS bogey,\" said Curtis.The five-star analyst contends that ASIC adoption is still in its early phases, giving Nvidia plenty of room to grow amid robust spending. He thinks that ongoing worries about NVDA are overstated, given that Blackwell Ultra rollout is on track and Rubin is set to ramp in the second half of 2026.Furthermore, Curtis noted Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space and expects the company's Vera-Rubin and NVLink 6 launches in the second half of 2026 to bolster its position. He expects Blackwell-backed LLMs to be introduced in the first half of 2026 and act as a potential catalyst for NVDA stock.Curtis also expects Nvidia's launch of its new CPX chip in the second half of 2026 to benefit from higher capital spending by hyperscalers and rising focus on inference. The analyst currently expects CPX to generate revenue of $13 billion in calendar year 2027. Based on all these positives, Curtis raised his 2026 and 2027 earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Nvidia to $7.82 and $9.50 from $6.83 and $9.03, respectively.Curtis ranks No. 58 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.8%.",

Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

    "body": "Sad female worker carrying her belongings while leaving the office after being firedIsbjorn | Istock | Getty ImagesLayoffs have been a defining feature of the job market in 2025, with several major companies announcing thousands of job cuts driven by artificial intelligence. In fact, AI was responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.There were in total 1.17 million job cuts through 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when there were 2.2 million layoffs announced by the end of the year. In October, U.S. employers announced 153,000 job cuts, and there were over 71,000 job cuts in November, with AI being cited for over 6,000 for the month, per Challenger. At a time when inflation bites, tariffs are adding to expenses, and firms are looking to carry out cost-cutting measures, AI has presented an attractive, short-term solution to the problem. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study in November showing that AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market and save as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. Not everyone is convinced that AI is the real reason behind the dramatic job cuts, as Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC, that it might be an excuse. Stephany said many companies that performed well during the pandemic \"significantly overhired\" and the recent layoffs might just be a \"market clearance.\"\"It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying 'we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'\" he added.Here are the top firms that cited AI as part of their layoff and restructuring strategy in 2025. Amazon Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesIn October, Amazon announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history, slashing 14,000 corporate roles, as it looks to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes AI. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\"  Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned of the cuts earlier this year, telling employees that AI will shrink the company's workforce and that the tech giant will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\" Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at the CES event in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, 2024. The event typically doubles as a preview of how tech giants and startups will market their wares in the coming year and if early announcements are any indication, AI-branded products will become the new \"smart\" gadgets of 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has cut a total of around 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent announcement in July saw 9,000 roles on the chopping block. CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that the company needed to \"reimagine\" its \"mission for a new era,\" and went on to tout the significance of AI to the company. \"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve,\" Nadella said.

However, unlike other companies that had cited AI in job cuts, Krishna admitted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. In November, the company announced a 1% global cut, which could impact nearly 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike Founder and CEO of CrowdStrike George Kurtz speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesCybersecurity software maker CrowdStrike said in May that it's laying off 5% of its workforce or 500 employees, and directly attributed the cuts to AI. \"AI has always been foundational to how we operate,\" co-founder and CEO George Kurtz wrote in a memo included in a securities filing. \"AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.\"Workday Carl Eschenbach, CEO of Workday speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBC In February, HR platform Workday was one of the first companies this year to say its cutting 8.5% of its workforce, amounting to around 1,750 jobs, as the company invests more in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs were needed to prioritize AI investment and to free up resources. ",

    "body": "watch nowLucid Motors gets rave reviews from critics. But it's sorely lacking customers.    That's a problem the company can't afford. The Arizona-based EV maker has top-shelf tech, deep-pocketed backers, and highly praised cars. However, it has struggled to meet production targets, and has been unable to steal the spotlight away from established luxury brands with century-old pedigrees. Lucid is ramping up production of its high-end, three-row, Gravity SUV, though it has sold only a few hundred units so far in 2025. The Gravity's production ramp has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages. Yet the company already has plans for another vehicle aimed more at the middle of the market, where it would compete with the top-selling Tesla Model Y SUV. And it's investing in self-driving cars for consumers while working on a robotaxi fleet with Uber and self-driving tech maker Nuro. A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, ArizonaIn the process, Lucid is burning through a lot of money. The company's third-quarter results were worse than Wall Street expected, with a net loss of close to $1 billion.  \"Their gross profit has been getting kind of worse,\" said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"A lot of people are doing the math. How long can the company keep losing cash?\"Adding to its challenges is a tougher environment for all EV manufacturers. Demand has fallen short of expectations, and many automakers are pulling back. EVs have lost key support from the federal government, including a $7,500 tax credit, funding for charging, and restrictions on state level programs that incentivize automakers to produce zero-emission vehicles. A 'fantastic car'Lucid's first vehicle, a sedan call the Air, is the most popular vehicle in its segment, according to Cox Automotive. Through the third quarter, it was the third best-selling full-size luxury sedan, and the top selling electric one, according to the company. The Air is frequently a \"critic's pick.\" No other EV can touch the 512-mile range of the Air Grand Touring, one of its top trim levels.  Last year, Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles, the majority of which were Air sedans, a 71% increase from 2023. U.S. EV leader Tesla delivered 1.8 million. Unfortunately, sedans have consistently compared to SUVs, crossovers, and pickups--which now all but dominate the roads. Of the top 10 best-selling models in the U.S., seven are from those three segments, according to Edmunds. \"It was a fantastic car,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry. \"It still is a fantastic car. But it came to market at kind of the wrong time.\"Marc Winterhoff, interim chief executive officer of Lucid Group Inc., in a Lucid Air Grand Touring model in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, July 17, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn 2023, Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the world, according to JATO Dynamics. It sold more than 265,000 units in the U.S. through the third quarter of 2024, according to Cox Automotive, about 100,000 more than the Model 3 sedan. Among EVs, the Model 3 is unusually popular for a sedan. Behind the two Tesla Models, the three vehicles that round out the top five are crossovers — Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq5. The Model S, the Air's closest Tesla competitor in terms of size, performance, and price, sold just over 4,500 units in the same period.  The highest volume EVs, such as the Model Y, are also less expensive than the Air, which starts just above $70,000 and runs up to about a quarter of a million dollars. The Model 3 is nearly half that. The average EV transaction price in November was just above $59,000, according to Cox Automotive. \"There's just not enough of a market for those premium electric sedans right now,\" Abuelsamid said. Lucid sold slightly more than 300 Gravity SUVs in the US through the third quarter of 2025, according to Cox Automotive. Like the Air, the Gravity has a high price tag. Nevertheless, the company has said the Gravity stands to attract six times as many customers as the Air. \"We'll see if that's the case,\" said Narayan. \"The latest numbers I've seen show it kind of equalizing the sales of sedans.\"Lucid interim CEO Mark Winterhoff told CNBC in an interview that the company has seen \"a very good uptick in demand when it comes to the Gravity as compared to the Air.\" He added that most customers are configuring the car in ways that run the price up above $100,000. Production troubleDemand might be strong, but Lucid also has to get the vehicle into customers' hands. Gravity's launch earlier in 2025 was beset by shortages of key materials like magnets, aluminum, and chips, Winterhoff said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"We haven't been able to produce as many as we wanted up until this point,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"We're very confident right now that we solved those problems.\"Deliveries have risen for seven straight quarters, culminating in a 47% percent jump over the third quarter of 2024. Lucid has added a second shift to the final assembly section of its factory to meet demand.The company said demand has been resilient despite worries the EV market is stalling after the federal EV incentive ended on Sept. 30.\"In October, our delivery numbers went up,\" Winterhoff said. \"Whereas in many other pure EV players or even EVs for incumbent players that also have [internal combustion] vehicles, the deliveries dropped down drastically.\"watch nowStill, analysts say it's a tougher time to make EVs than it was when Tesla was ramping up the Model 3 and Model Y. \"They were the only game in town,\" Narayan said. \"So there wasn't competition there. They also benefited from battery prices falling significantly. And they got a lot of government support. Today we're in a very different world.\" If gross profit does keep getting worse, the company will eventually have to return to investors, Narayan said. Lucid is currently about 55% owned by the Saudi Public Investment fund, according to FactSet.In the third quarter, Lucid and the PIF agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion. A DDTL is a loan the company can draw on over time, rather than all at once. That brings its total liquidity to $5.5 billion. The company has said it has enough to get through the first half of 2027.CNBC tours Lucid Motors factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Andrew Evers\"So far, the Saudis have put many billions of dollars into Lucid, and they've been very patient through Lucid's struggles as they try to ramp up production and sales,\" said Abuelsamid. \"It's unclear how long they will continue to be patient.\"The company also received a $300 million investment from Uber in September to develop a platform for robotaxis with a third partner, autonomous driving tech developer Nuro. On top of that, Uber plans to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles for the self-driving fleet. Separately, Lucid has a partnership with Nvidia to develop what it calls the \"the first true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off (L4) consumer owned autonomous vehicle.\" L4 means Level 4, nearly the highest level of autonomy in the current system devised by the Society for Automotive Engineers.\"You need to invest first and then you reap the benefits later on,\" Winterhoff said. \"And therefore we have to do a lot of things in parallel.\"Smaller SUV on the wayDespite Gravity's production challenges, the company is already at work on its next vehicle — a mid-size crossover priced closer to the industry average of about $50,000. This could boost volumes, but deepen losses. \"If gross profit is negative at a vehicle transacting around $100,000 or more on average, what Lucid's Air and Gravity are currently going for, what will it look like when the company is selling a vehicle that is closer to half of that?\" Narayan said. \"One answer could be, well, it's a much bigger scale, so you have better operating leverage,\" Narayan said. The argument, he said, is that Lucid's technology enables it to squeeze a lot more range out of a battery than competitors.\"Our vehicles are way more efficient by 30% to 40% than the competition, which means smaller battery use smaller battery to achieve the same range,\" said Emad Dlala, senior vice president of engineering and digital at Lucid. \"That means a lower [bill of materials] cost. That means better margins.\"Dlala said the Lucid Air Pure has a battery size of a Tesla Model Y, but has a range of 420 miles, about a hundred miles more than the Tesla Model Y. Lucid says the money it's spending goes to developing an array of technologies and manufacturing processes that are hard to copy. \"Lucid has about over 10 years of powertrain history,\" Dala said. \"This didn't come overnight. There's lots of IP patented technologies across powertrain, vehicle and software,\" which lead to \"gains in efficiency across the board,\" he said. Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThat even extends to the way the cars are made. \"We use manufacturing processes here that no one else in the industry uses in powertrain,\" said Adrian Price, senior vice president of operations at Lucid.\"Lucid is very highly vertically integrated,\" he said, meaning it brings much of the car-making process in house. \"We have a lot more of our own subassemblies. That's also how we get the performance that other people don't. A lot of that engineering is outsourced by other major automakers. Not only do we do the engineering, but we also do the manufacturing, and we can control some of the Lucid secret sauce by doing it in-house.\"One area where Lucid appears to lag competitors is brand awareness. \"A lot of people don't know what Lucid is,\" Narayan said. \"That's the biggest, I think, hurdle that they have.\"The company has given more thought to marketing, and raising its profile in the luxury market, where it's going up against names like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BMW. \"The buyer of a luxury brand, typically, they like things like heritage,\" Narayan said. \"The brand matters. So, you know, how do you create that from scratch?\"\"We are very well known and have tons of accolades in the motor press, Winterhoff said. \"So everybody who's interested in cars knows about it. But that's not the majority of vehicle buyers.\"So, it has begun a new marketing and advertising strategy for the Gravity, with Hollywood actor Timothee Chalamet as its first \"global brand ambassador.\" \"We're shifting from focusing on our vehicles, about the capabilities of our vehicles, to what does it mean to own a Lucid and what does it say about you?\" Winterhoff said. Winterhoff said he's confident the company can successfully ramp the Gravity, while building and eventually delivering its mid-size vehicle.  \"That is the point where I think this is a sustainable business going forward,\" he said. \"We have a clear plan also to profitability.\"Watch the video to get an exclusive inside look at Lucid's Gravity production and to find out what's next for the automaker.

    "body": "Planet A Foods' ChoViva chocolate alternativePlanet A FoodsIf you're unwrapping chocolate this holiday season, it might not contain any actual cocoa.Market turbulence, ethical concerns and sustainability questions have sparked a movement among some chocolate makers to scrap cocoa in favor of alternative ingredients — prompting calls that the real deal could soon become a \"luxury\" for consumers.  Market upheaval Poor agricultural conditions in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire — the world's leading cocoa producers — have damaged crop yields in recent years, sending cocoa prices on a rollercoaster ride. After surging to all-time highs of more than $12,000 toward the end of last year, cocoa futures have tumbled more than 50% over the course of 2025 amid tentative signs of crop recovery. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCocoa futuresPrice volatility has left businesses in the industry on edge, and it's ultimately found its way into consumer goods, with data from Circana and the U.S. Bureau for Labor Statistics showing chocolate prices surged 30% in the year to October.In its third-quarter earnings report, Mondelez International — the maker of Cadbury, Milka and Toblerone — flagged \"volatility of cocoa\" and its \"ability to effectively hedge against\" related cost pressures as potential problems that could derail the company from meeting its financial targets. As manufacturers grapple with that unpredictability, some are opting to reduce their exposure to the cocoa market by shaking up their ingredient mix. Earlier this year, a change to the composition of McVitie's Club and Penguin candy bars made waves in the U.K., when it was reported that the products could no longer be referred to as chocolate. Both products must now be labeled \"chocolate flavored,\" after parent company Pladis cut the cocoa content in a bid to reduce costs. 'Real' chocolate becoming a luxuryPladis declined to comment on whether the changes had impacted sales when contacted by CNBC. However, according to Massimo Sabatini, co-founder and CEO of Italian startup Foreverland, a move away from cocoa is gaining traction among international confectioners, so much so that it could become the norm to see \"fake\" chocolate used in more budget-friendly products. Foreverland uses carob, pumpkin seeds, and chickpeas to produce a chocolate-like product that's sold to companies producing confectionery, baked goods, and ice creams.\"In the chocolate space there are many products, from [bars] to products in which cocoa is not really the protagonist but a participant,\" he told CNBC, referring to goods like cookies, chocolate flavored cereal and chocolate-coated snacks. \"I believe the alternative chocolate will substitute this big market, while [pure chocolate bars] will be more and more a luxury product.\"Sabatini pointed to the recent Dubai chocolate trend to illustrate his point, noting that some of these chocolate bars were selling for as much as 80 euros ($93.09) per kilogram. \"[The chocolate market] is already going in this direction,\" he argued. watch nowOn top of the pricing pressure, Foreverland and other alternative makers tout their products as solutions to longstanding concerns about sustainability and ethical procurement in the cocoa industry. \"If you compare this alternative to other alternatives on the market, like a plant-based burger, chocolate is used in so many different applications, while a burger is a burger,\" Sabatini said. \"Chocolate can be a snack, can be a bar, can be a biscuit, can be whatever. There are hundreds of different products in which chocolate is not a protagonist, in which alternative chocolate can really be a solution, to bring more sustainable products on the market, but at the same time depressurize the cocoa supply chain.\"Drew Geraghty, a New York-based commodity broker at ICAP, told CNBC that despite signs of price recovery on the futures market, pure chocolate could continue to command high prices for some time to come. Large cocoa users typically lock in prices far in advance, often covering eight to ten months of production, which gives them more control over price risk, but Geraghty said smaller manufacturers don't have that flexibility, so they usually only hedge three to six months out.Futures are contracts in which the buyer of the contract agrees to buy something — in this case, cocoa — for a set price on a set date. Cocoa futures for March delivery were last seen trading at $5,897 a ton in New York.  Geraghty noted that manufacturers who bought futures eight months ago were buying the higher prices seen throughout late 2024 and early 2025. \"If you look back when the prices really skyrocketed in 2023 and 2024 and early '25, the price on the shelf did not respond as quickly because the end users were still getting through their lower price futures cover — what they bought in the futures market six to eight months ago was going to dictate pricing,\" he explained. \"Cheaper prices today, with the market being down, say 50% from the beginning of the year, that will translate into cheaper prices six to eight months down the road on the retail side.\"watch nowJessica Karch, the marketing manager for German firm Planet A Foods — which makes a chocolate alternative derived from sunflower seeds — agreed that cocoa alternatives will become increasingly prevalent in the future. \"We do believe that the issues that we see currently in the supply chain of cocoa won't go away,\" she said. \"So, the prices might stabilize to a certain point, but it will not go back to how [cheap] it was in the past.\"Planet A Foods' ChoViva chocolate alternativePlanet A FoodsKarch said Planet A was already seeing growing demand, and noted that there was an increasing variety of alternatives coming onto the market. \"We do love chocolate, we do not want to replace chocolate, but we see a growing gap as well,\" she added. \"Because on the one hand, you have the issues in the supply chain, but on the other hand, you have the demand growing, especially in countries like China and India, and that's why we see a gap, and we want to help fill that gap.\"Market 'PTSD' driving alternatives marketBoth Karch and Sabatini told CNBC that demand was rising for their products. And they aren't alone in the market — a number of startups, including the U.K.'s Nukoko and America's Voyage Foods — offer what the former calls \"cocoa-free chocolate.\" Natasha Linhart, CEO of fast-moving consumer goods wholesaler Atlante, told CNBC that chocolate alternatives would likely become more prevalent in \"specific niches and hybrid applications.\"\"Cocoa-free or fermentation-based masses are increasingly being used in coatings, fillings and bakery to substitute part of the cocoa content,\" she said. \"Many manufacturers are already diluting cocoa by shifting their mix towards 'filled' products. Brands like Milka, for instance, have expanded ranges where a significant share of the bar is filled with yoghurt cream or rice crispies, lowering the cocoa intensity while keeping the perception of indulgence and value.\"watch nowLinhart said she expected to see more products where traditional cocoa is complemented with fillings to manage cost and supply risk. \"However, for mainstream chocolate tablets, cocoa will remain the backbone of the category, because of taste expectations and the emotional weight attached to 'real chocolate,'\" she said. ICAP's Geraghty said that due to \"PTSD in the market,\" cocoa alternatives were likely to be increasingly used wherever manufacturers can get away with it. \"At one point, cocoa butter was three times the price of cocoa futures, so cocoa futures were at $9,000, $10,000 a ton, and you were looking at cocoa butter at $27,000 to $30,000 a ton — massively expensive,\" he said. \"So [manufacturers] scramble — you make a smaller bar size, you find substitutes where you can. Even though prices have halved, [they'll be thinking] why should we spend that when we could substitute shea butter or some compound chocolate?\"",

    "body": "watch nowIntel was once the world's largest semiconductor company, but its market cap plummeted in recent years as the chipmaker fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and spent billions of dollars trying to catch up. Now, Intel has entered high-volume production of 18A, the new chip node it says will turn things around.The biggest problem? Convincing a big chipmaker to trust Intel with manufacturing on the new node. For now, Intel's only major customer is itself. The company's long-awaited Core Ultra series 3 PC processor, code-named Panther Lake, will come to PCs in January as the first major product made on 18A.\"It's become an internal node for now,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Group. \"So many companies have made such massive investments into TSMC to ensure yield, to ensure capacity wafers that they just will not make the switch just yet.\"Intel is pinning its hopes of attracting customers on a new chip fabrication plant, Fab52, in Chandler, Arizona, where CNBC got an exclusive on-camera tour in November. Some 50 miles north, in Phoenix, TSMC also has a new fab, where it's making chips with 4 nanometer technology. Its most advanced 2nm tech is currently only made in Taiwan.Intel's 18A is generally on par with TSMC's 2nm node in some metrics such as transistor density. But as Intel works out the kinks after years of delays on previous nodes, some 18A wafers have had defects, making for a lower number of usable chips per wafer, typically referred to as yield.\"Yields are always an issue at the advanced node. This is not an uncommon problem,\" said Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie, who served on Intel's board from 1989 to 2018. He pointed to early yield issues with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs at TSMC that were quickly fixed.Intel's renewed focus on foundry — manufacturing chips for outside clients — came when Pat Gelsinger took the helm as CEO in 2021. Gelsinger was pushed out last December and replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March. \"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote in a memo in July. Intel's campus in Chandler, Arizona, now includes five chip fabrication plants, with Fab52 being the newest addition, shown here on November 17, 2025. Tony PuyolWith Intel awaiting a big outside customer, the U.S. government stepped up in August, taking a 10% stake in the company with an $8.9 billion investment, primarily coming from grants promised under the CHIPS Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.Days earlier, SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel, followed by a $5 billion investment in September from Nvidia, which agreed to use some Intel technology but didn't commit to using its foundry.Here's a look behind the curtain of Intel's new chip factory where it hopes to find major foundry customers and, with them, redemption.Fall of a giantFounded in 1968 by Silicon Valley chip pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and legendary investor Arthur Rock, Intel brought the world's first commercially available microprocessor to market just three years later. From the late 1970s through the early 2000s, Intel pumped out increasingly advanced process nodes at a rapid pace, leading to the term \"Moore's Law\" — the doubling of components on a chip every couple years.\"The 1990s was a period of wonder and excitement at Intel,\" Yoffie said. \"We were the world's largest semiconductor company, the world's most profitable.\"But Intel largely missed the mobile revolution, famously turning down a deal to make Apple's processors for the original iPhone. Then came a whiff in AI.In 2024, Intel saw its worst year ever, losing about 60% of its value. The plunge came after two of its previous chip nodes, 10nm and 7nm, were delayed by several years. Analysts say the delays may have been triggered by an earlier choice to hold off on using ASML's costly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines. \"I think we lost the discipline of cycle time,\" said client computing head Jim Johnson, who joined Intel more than 30 years ago. \"Cycle time requires you to commit and deliver, and we started talking ourselves into, hey, we can have longer cycle times and try and lift more or do more.\"As it hustles to get back on track, Intel told CNBC there will be at least 15 EUV machines in Fab52.Intel 18A production manager Lea Tensuan shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov the EUV machines inside Fab52 in Chandler, Arizona, on November 17, 2025.By 2021, TSMC had become the node leader, and Intel began to outsource some leading-edge chip production to the Taiwanese giant. Around the same time, Apple began replacing Intel chips in Mac computers with its own M-series chips, also manufactured primarily at TSMC. In his earlier stint at Intel, more than a decade before rejoining as CEO, Gelsinger \"was given the responsibility to build a GPU to compete with Nvidia,\" Yoffie said. \"Unfortunately, that project failed and that ultimately meant we ended up not playing a significant role in the AI revolution.\"Intel may now be considering a deal to buy custom AI chip design startup SambaNova for $1.6 billion, though the company declined to comment on the matter.'Changing our culture'The trademark of Gelsinger's tenure as CEO was Intel's focus on chip manufacturing. His ambitious roadmap had Intel catching back up to TSMC by releasing five nodes in four years.Now, Tan is CEO and Naga Chandrasekaran is in charge of foundry.\"We are making yield improvements, defect density improvements, month-over-month and hitting our goals,\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC in an interview in November. \"So I believe we have turned the corner.\" Chandrasekaran joined Intel last year after more than two decades at leading memory maker Micron. He said his top goal is finding foundry customers.\"I have to become part of their team and convince them that they can trust Intel Foundry to execute,\" Chandrasekaran said. \"That's number one. And to do that, we are changing our culture. We are bringing a huge execution focus internally into Intel Foundry.\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC that Fab52 is capable of more than 10,000 18A wafer starts per week. There's more than a million square feet of manufacturing cleanroom space in Arizona, with five fabs all connected by 30 miles of overhead track moving wafers between them. A sixth fab, Fab62, is expected to be ready around 2028.18A also uses RibbonFet, Intel's gate-all-around architecture that improves power control by fully surrounding the transistor, unlike previous designs that only contact the top and sides. Chandrasekaran said 18A offers \"more than 15% performance per watt improvement\" over Intel 3.Perhaps the biggest way Intel stands out is in advanced packaging, the assembly and connections of chips onto the final systems where they appear in real-world applications. Intel engineer Shripad Gokhale shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov its next Xeon data center chip in Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler, Arizona, on November 17, 2025.Tony PuyolCNBC went to Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler to see several steps in the process, such as protecting chips with a polymer-based seal, and exposing them to a liquid that detects any defects. Yoffie said Intel's advanced packaging \"can help mitigate some of the power consumption problems.\"\"One of the biggest problems today for everybody making chips for data centers is the power that it consumes,\" Yoffie said.Chandrasekaran said the Arizona fab is on almost 100% renewable energy. As for water, Intel's Arizona facilities used more than 3 billion gallons in 2024 and returned 2.4 billion gallons to the local supply through a water recycling plant it has on site. 'No blank checks'Tan's message to employees when it comes to spending on future foundry nodes is clear: \"No more blank checks.\" The company needs customers.Intel's big new Ohio chip fab is delayed until at least 2030, and Tan has made major cost cuts by slashing 15% of the workforce in July and axing projects in Germany and Poland.\"That's what the company needed,\"  said Newman of Futurum. \"It needed to be faster. It needed to be leaner. It needed to be more focused. It needed someone that would be a little bit more shrewd.\"Tan is waiting to see how demand shapes up before giving solid details about Intel's next node, 14A.  Chandrasekaran told CNBC it will first be developed in Oregon, with a goal of volume production in 2028.Finding customers for 18A won't be easy. Unlike TSMC which only makes chips for outside clients, Intel also makes devices powered by its chips, positioning it as a competitor to some of the customers it hopes to land. \"If I'm an Nvidia or AMD or Qualcomm or Broadcom, do you really want to put your secret sauce into a manufacturing operation where you're giving Intel access to that secret sauce?\" Yoffie said.He suggests breaking out foundry into a different company.\"If you actually separated the two, I think you'd give Intel a much better shot at being successful,\" Yoffie said. \"And you'd also give the United States a much stronger position for being the home of a major semiconductor manufacturing organization.\"Intel client computing head Jim Johnson gives CNBC's Katie Tarasov an early look at its Panther Lake CPU in Santa Clara, California, on November 12, 2025.Marc GanleyFor now, Intel hopes Panther Lake will be a big proof point when it debuts in PCs from major companies like Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer in January. Intel's next data center chip, Xeon 6+, is also made on 18A.\"If you're a major company that wants to bet on a process node, you're going to feel a lot more comfortable if you see Intel ramping the heart of their client product line to high volume on that process node,\" Johnson said.Microsoft and Amazon signed early deals last year committing to use Intel's foundry for some of their in-house custom chips.\"It's a good sign, but of course their volumes are very small relative to Nvidia and the other major chip companies,\" Yoffie said.Recent reports suggest AMD is considering manufacturing at Intel, and one analyst predicts Apple may once again make some Mac chips at Intel by 2027.In the meantime, Intel got a lifeline with the U.S. government's 10% stake.\"It shows the confidence that the U.S. government has in Intel and the belief that we need to have leading edge R&D and manufacturing on U.S. soil,\" Chandrasekaran said.The government investment came days after President Donald Trump called for Tan to resign, then reversed course.\"I worry sometimes about the scope creep here and how the U.S. could decide to take stakes in all kinds of things,\" Newman said. \"But you have industries that we have let leave the U.S. to an extent that put us into indefensible risk, and we need to bring them back.\"Some 92% of the world's most advanced chips are made in Taiwan, following a decades-long decline in the percentage of chips made in the U.S.\"The stakes are incredibly high for Intel, for the U.S. and for the world,\" Yoffie said. \"The whole idea that the world's most advanced products are dependent on a single location in an island a few miles off the Chinese coast is a terrible situation for the whole world to have to deal with.\"Chandrasekaran, for his part, is committed to turning Intel into a manufacturer of advanced chips.\"As a semiconductor community, we have to enable this solution for the world to move forward with AI,\" he said. \"There's no other option than to be successful.\" WATCH:  Inside the Arizona chip fab key to Intel's redemption",

    "body": "Company: LKQ Corp. (LKQ)Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.Stock Market Value: $7.66 billion ($30.15 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: 0.39%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.Behind the scenesLKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

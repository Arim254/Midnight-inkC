    "body": "A steak sandwich and French onion soup from Panera Bread Co. arranged in the Queens borough of New York, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 12, 2023. Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPanera Bread is entering the so-called value wars with its new \"Mix & Match\" deals in a bid to win back price-conscious diners.The chain, known for its soups, salads and sandwiches, is in the early stages of a turnaround, with a focus on reinvesting in its business and reversing years of traffic declines. Once the top fast-casual brand in the U.S., Panera has fallen to No. 3, ceding the top spots to Chipotle Mexican Grill and Panda Express. In 2024, Panera's sales dropped 5% to $6.1 billion, according to Technomic estimates. A key part of Panera's comeback strategy is focusing on value. Across the restaurant industry, executives have reported weaker spending among consumers, who are trying to save money by trading down to fast food or dining out less frequently. Chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell have leaned into value offerings to try to win back customers. About 3 out of every 4 diners said that daily specials, discounts or value promotions matter when choosing where to dine or order takeout, according to the National Restaurant Association's annual State of the Restaurant Industry report.\"[Consumers] are seeking value, and they're also seeking quality,\" Panera CEO Paul Carbone told CNBC. \"That's so, so important.\"Starting Wednesday, Panera customers can choose halved portions of sandwiches and salads, as well as cups of soup, from the Mix & Match menu. Each of the 10 items is priced at $4.99, and diners have to buy at least two items. Seasonal menu items will also rotate through the Mix & Match options. Each order also comes with the choice of a baguette, chips or an apple.Panera explored other value offerings, but the Mix & Match menu tested successfully, Carbone said. \"The guest has really, really reacted well to it,\" he said, adding the menu is expected to drive incremental visits to the restaurant.And while Panera is introducing the deal, its popular \"You Pick Two\" offering is sticking around. Carbone said that customer research showed that diners view the option to buy two entrees from the menu as an opportunity for variety, rather than a chance to save money. Like Mix & Match, the offer allows customers to choose a half salad, half sandwich or cup of soup or mac and cheese. However, You Pick Two spans the menu, rather than being restricted to just 10 items.",

    "body": "Samsung Electronics unveiled its latest series of flagship smartphones on Wednesday, with two of the models costing $100 more than their predecessors as the industry tries to recover from a global shortage of memory chips.Samsung is touting improved AI and a privacy display in its new models against a backdrop of industry-wide memory chip shortages brought about by the rapid scaling of AI infrastructure.The average selling price of smartphones in 2026 was expected to rise 6.9% as a result of the memory crunch, Counterpoint Research said in a note in December.The starting price has stayed flat on the highest end model, the S26 Ultra, compared to last year's S25 series. The S26 and S26+ saw a $100 rise compared with their S25 predecessors:Galaxy S26: $899Galaxy S26+: $1,099Galaxy S26 Ultra: $1,299Ben Wood, chief analyst at CSS Insight, told CNBC the chip shortage was \"not a short-term issue.\"He added: \"We expect the global shortage of memory chips to persist well into 2027, primarily driven by the rapid expansion of AI infrastructure, which is diverting supply away from smartphones, PCs, and other consumer electronics.\"Samsung S26 Ultra.New specsThe S26 series is the third of \"AI phones\" by Samsung, following the S24 release two years ago. The company says the new models' processing chips are faster than those of previous generations. It added they use AI tools to help with things like photo editing and document scanning.Samsung's S26 series does take some \"positive steps forward\" in making AI features easier to use for consumers, said Wood. But, he added: \"I fear that consumers will still question how much value it really offers at this juncture.\"Wood added the \"stand-out feature\" on the S26 Ultra is its privacy display, which controls how pixels disperse light, limiting what those viewing from side angles can see. The company says this feature is a world first.Samsung S26 Ultra.Memory crunchMemory prices in segments such as smartphones have doubled over the past two quarters, according to CSS Insight research, said Wood.While memory manufacturers are investing in new capacity, the chip shortage is expected to last until 2027 or early 2028, he added.\"Rising memory semiconductor prices are a global issue and impacts the global broader industry,\" a Samsung spokesperson told CNBC.They added: \"Samsung expects to be relatively well-positioned on the supply side through strategic partnerships and will continue efforts to minimize the impact on its business by responding flexibly to market changes.\"Smartphone makers are looking at ways to mitigate the memory shortage risk by diversifying suppliers,  Paolo Pescatore, TMT analyst at PP Foresight, told CNBC. The memory crunch is no longer a \"niche supply-chain talking point\", he added, but a \"strategic constraint on the AI roadmap.\"\"If memory costs stay elevated, Samsung faces a familiar squeeze: protect margins or protect volumes,\" Pescatore said.",

    "body": "Dr. Richard Axel at Le Bernardin Prive in New York on July 26, 2017.Craig Barritt | Getty ImagesDr. Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist, said he is stepping down as co-director of Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute on the heels of his association with notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein drawing public attention.\"My past association with Jeffrey Epstein was a serious error in judgment, which I deeply regret,\" Axel, 79, said in a statement on Tuesday.\"I apologize for compromising the trust of my friends, students, and colleagues,\" Axel said. \"I recognize the problems this has caused, and I will work to restore this trust. What has emerged about Epstein's appalling conduct, the harm that he has caused to so many people, makes my association with him all the more painful and inexcusable.\"This photo illustration shows redacted documents from the Epstein Library files released by the Department of Justice in Washington, Feb. 18, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesAxel has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with his friendship with Epstein, who died in August 2019 from suicide, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.But Axel is mentioned in multiple emails and other documents released by the Department of Justice in January as having been in contact and dining with Epstein.Axel has been a Columbia University professor for 53 years, and will continue his lab's research at the Zuckerman institute, he said. Axel, in his statement, said he will resign as an investigator from Columbia's Howard Hughes Medical InstituteAxel won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2004 with Linda Buck \"for their discoveries of odorant receptors and the organization of the olfactory system,\" the prize website notes.In a December 2007 New York magazine profile of Epstein, Axel is quoted saying about him, \"He has the ability to make connections that other minds can't make.\"\"He is extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have,\" Axel said in the article. \"He also has an extremely short attention span.\"The article, which was published as Epstein faced a pending indictment for soliciting prostitution in Florida, notes that Axel met Epstein \"during the early biotech days of the eighties.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageState of the Union 2026 recap: Trump touted economic gainsEpstein files: Trump sexual abuse claims withheld by DOJSenators tell CFTC prediction market contracts need clear guidanceDemocrats seek to force refunds after Supreme Court blocks Trump tariffsTrump demands Netflix fire Susan Rice as DOJ probes Warner dealAxel joins a growing list of people who have lost positions or been subpoenaed due to their relationships with Epstein.Emails and other documents contained in the DOJ's Epstein files database show that the friendship between Axel and Epstein continued for years after Epstein served 13 months in jail following his guilty plea in Florida state court to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution.Columbia, in its own statement on Tuesday, said, \"The University has seen no evidence that Dr. Axel violated any University policy or the law. However, Dr. Axel made clear that in light of this past association, and the continued fallout from the release of DOJ files, he felt it appropriate to relinquish his position as co-director.\"The University agrees with this decision, while at the same time recognizing his extraordinary contributions to the University and his dedication to his colleagues, to his students, and to science,\" the university said.",

    "body": "Pokemon \"Pikachu Illustrator\" Trainer Promo Hologram Trading CardSource: Ha.ComSocial media influencer and wrestler Logan Paul made history last week when he sold a rare Pokémon card for $16.5 million, a world record price for an auctioned trading card. The winner views it as an investment.AJ Scaramucci — son of investor and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci — won the bidding war for the \"Pikachu Illustrator\" card, made in 1998 and one of only an estimated few dozen to exist. It's the crowning achievement in the Solari Capital founder's short collecting career, which started with trading cards during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I mean, Picassos are great,\" he said in an interview, explaining the Illustrator card's importance. \"But Pokémon means way more than just a Picasso painting to people.\"After winning, Scaramucci said the card's purchase was the first action in what will be, as he dubbed, a \"planetary treasure hunt.\" He said the goal, which he is embarking on with his younger brother, is to collect a number of real-world, scarce assets across varying categories. Trading card markets have exploded in recent years. According to data from Card Ladder, an analytics firm that tracks trading card prices and sales, the monthly sales volume in secondary trading has nearly doubled in the last two years.EBay CEO Jamie Iannone in the company's earnings call last week detailed that the largest contributor to gross merchandise volume growth in the fourth-quarter were collectibles, particularly \"driven by continued strength in trading cards.\"Paul himself bought the illustrator card in 2021 for nearly $5.3 million, indicating he sold it with a more than 200% return. Card Ladder's \"Pokémon index\" has grown 145% in the past year. Compare those gains to the S&P 500, which is up 15.2% in the past year. Or compare it to \"Magnificent Seven\" darling Alphabet, which is up 73.4% in the past year. \"Especially in 2025, the growth has been astronomical,\" said Ken Goldin, founder and CEO of Goldin Auctions, which is owned by eBay. Goldin helped facilitate the auction for the illustrator card last week. \"We have people who are buying solely either because they absolutely love it or they firmly believe that trading cards and collectibles are a legitimate alternative asset class.\"AJ Scaramucci, founder and Managing Partner at Solari Capital, speaks during the Skybridge Capital SALT New York 2021 conference in New York City, U.S., September 15, 2021.Brendan McDermid | ReutersScaramucci is someone who is buying Pokémon cards for both of those reasons: his own pleasure and the investment potential. \"The compounded annual growth rate of these cards is out of control,\" he said. \"And they should be treated as investments because that's what they are. It's just obvious.\"Scaramucci added the cards are a way to play the \"debasement trade,\" where investors fearful of countries devaluing their currencies move money into hard assets. Viewing collectibles as an alternative asset is not new, even if unorthodox. Other collectibles like wine and art have been used in the past for portfolio diversification.Photo: Image Source | Getty ImagesPaul Karger, co-founder and managing partner at wealth advisory firm TwinFocus, said he works with clients who collect art, wine, watches and even guitars. But while some view these items as investments, Karger wouldn't advise clients to get into that mentality. \"Think of it as a passion first, and kind of an investment second,\" he said. \"You hope they go up over time, but they're absolutely not a replacement to financial assets, it's just maybe a complement at the margin.\"Karger warned that the illiquid nature of collectibles, and the dependency they have on others determining their worth, often via auctions, are added risks. Kaycee LeCong, managing director of the family office at Brighton Jones Wealth Management, also noted a risk is that capital gains on collectibles are taxed at 28%, higher than capital gains taxes on stocks that are around 15% and 20%.Despite the risks, Goldin projects more people will view collectibles, particularly trading cards, as alternative assets. He said as more headlines come about detailing major sales — like that of Paul's — and price discovery becomes easier to do with more data, it will only attract more participants. Scaramucci will embark on his treasure hunt through a new company called Treasure Trove. However, he did not disclose any details about what that company will be nor how it will operate, beyond that it will receive funding from Solari Capital. Scaramucci also didn't disclose if he plans to sell the Illustrator card, or any other of his collectibles, if it grows more in value. And while Scaramucci said he'd like to obtain the Declaration of Independence as part of his hunt after he won the Illustrator card, he acknowledged to CNBC that it's a goal that will take much work to achieve while not addressing a plan on how to do it. But at the moment, the lack of clarity in his future plans is the point. \"For now, if you think I'm just a crazy person buying up real-world, scarce assets,\" he said, \"that's all you need to know.\"",

His resignation came as the university was conducting a review of emails and other documents detailing Summers' connection to Epstein, which were released in recent months by the Department of Justice and Congress.\"I have made the difficult decision to retire from my Harvard professorship at the end of this academic year,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC. \"I will always be grateful to the thousands of students and colleagues I have been privileged to teach and work with since coming to Harvard as a graduate student 50 years ago.\"\"Free of formal responsibility, as President Emeritus and a retired professor, I look forward in time to engaging in research, analysis, and commentary on a range of global economic issues,\" he said.Summers, who went on leave from Harvard in November because of fallout from those emails, has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.

I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein.\"His statement then came after reports by the Harvard student newspaper, The Crimson, which detailed how Summers had sought guidance from Epstein while pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman.On Tuesday, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Richard Axel said he would step down as co-director of Columbia University's Zuckerman Mind Brain Behavior Institute in light of his own communications with Epstein drawing attention.A third Ivy League school, Yale University, on Feb. 11 said it had barred professor David Gelernter from teaching computer science classes pending a review of his contacts with Epstein, which included mentioning a Yale student for a potential project.Other high-profile people recently have suffered professional and legal fallout from their connections to Epstein being detailed in the DOJ's documents database.Epstein killed himself in a New York City federal jail in 2019, weeks after his arrest on child sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "watch nowThe major technology companies will meet President Donald Trump at the White House next week to sign a pledge that they will supply their own power for artificial intelligence data centers. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, xAI, Oracle and OpenAI will sign the agreement at the March 4 meeting, a White House official confirmed to CNBC Wednesday.\"Under this bold initiative, these massive companies will build, bring, or buy their own power supply for new AI data centers, ensuring that Americans' electricity bills will not increase as demand grows,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CNBC. Fox News first reported the development. Trump said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he had secured such a pledge from the tech sector, but did not provide detail on what the agreement entails. \"We're telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs,\" the president said. \"They can build their own power plants as part of their factory so that no one's prices will go up.\"Data centers are facing opposition in communities across the U.S. as people blame rising utility bills on the facilities' huge electricity consumption.The Trump administration has closely embraced the AI industry as an engine of economic growth and a pillar of U.S. national security. It is an alliance that poses political risks for the White House ahead of the mid-term elections. New Jersey Gov. Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger defeated their Republican opponents in landslide elections last November by campaigning against rising electricity prices.The Trump administration has warned the tech companies that they risk a backlash if the public believes their data centers are driving up energy costs, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday. \"We want to see data centers developed,\" Wright told reporters on a call. \"We want to see them rapidly sited. We want to see communities welcoming them, but to do that, it's necessary to have up front investments in the additional grid infrastructure needed.\" ",

    "body": "Bloom Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesFears over artificial intelligence are now hitting bond investors, according to the latest credit investors survey from Bank of America Global Research.An AI bubble is seen as the top risk for the first time, with investors expecting a surge in bond issuance from hyperscalers, the February poll found. Some 23% of those surveyed said it was their biggest concern, compared to 9% who said so in the firm's December poll. Companies including Amazon, Google parent Alphabet and Meta have announced big spending plans as they scale out their AI capabilities. Investors of high-grade credit now expect $285 billion in issuance by hyperscalers this year, up from the $210 billion anticipated in December's survey, Barnaby Martin, credit strategist at Bank of America, said in a note Tuesday. \"Yet, investors are more sanguine on the ultimate tech disruption ahead: just 10% say that AI-driven corporate obsolescence is their big worry,\" he wrote. Those obsolescence fears have hit the stock market in recent weeks, as concern over AI disruption spread across a variety of sectors. Software companies, for instance, have tumbled after announcements from AI company Anthropic about new AI tools. While stocks have reversed course since the latest sell off on Tuesday, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is still down more than 25% year to date. Elsewhere, geopolitics isn't a big factor on bond investors' radar these days, with only 10% saying it is their top fear, despite growing tensions between the U.S. and Iran, Martin noted. No investor said central bank policy error is the big risk, even with a new Federal Reserve chair expected to take the helm in May.",

    "body": "watch nowCava, the fast-casual Mediterranean restaurant chain, reported record-breaking revenue for fiscal year 2025 on Tuesday and forecast sales growth for fiscal year 2026.Shares surged more than 20% in midday trading on Wednesday. \"While there are a lot of factors around us that are creating pressures from a margin perspective, our model has allowed us to be very thoughtful and minimize price increases to our guests and to consumers in general, which really helps elevate our value perception,\" Chief Financial Officer Tricia Tolivar told CNBC. Though the company said last quarter that it saw a pullback among younger consumers, Tolivar said that trend came to an end in the final three months of its fiscal year.\"We actually saw firming in that category, and overall [we're] seeing improvement in our trends across income cohorts, age cohorts, different parts of the country,\" Tolivar said. \"And in fact, we believe there's a little bit of a bridge that we've been able to create in this K-shaped economy, where we want to be accessible for everyone, and we're doing our best to ensure that our amazing culinary and incredible hospitality is there for all customers across the country.\"She added that some of Cava's best-performing restaurants are in markets where median household incomes are lower.The restaurant chain reported same-store sales up 0.5% in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared to Wall Street estimates of a 1.1% decline, according to StreetAccount. Much of that growth was thanks to menu prices and product mix, and partially offset by a 1.4% decline in foot traffic, the company said. Tolivar said Cava raised prices about 1.7% at the beginning of 2025 and that 2026 would see \"very modest increases.\"The company also recorded 72 net new restaurant openings in fiscal 2025 for a total of 439 locations.Here's how Cava performed in the period ended Dec. 28 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 4 cents vs. 3 cents expectedRevenue: $275 million vs. $268 million expectedIn the fourth quarter, Cava reported net income of $4.9 million, or 4 cents per share, compared to $78.6 million, or 66 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024. Revenue of $275 million marked an increase of nearly 21% year over year. For the full fiscal year, the company reported record-breaking revenue surpassing $1 billion, a growth of more than 20% compared to the year prior. Same-restaurant sales for the year increased by 4%. \"We believe our momentum reflects more than just expansion,\" CEO Brett Schulman said on a call with analysts. \"It signals that our value proposition is resonating with today's increasingly discerning consumer, and as guests become more intentional with their spend, they are choosing brands like Cava that deliver real differentiation through bold flavors, healthy food and hospitality that creates meaningful human connection.\"For fiscal year 2026, Cava said it expects 74 to 76 net new restaurant openings, in addition to same-store sales growth of 3% to 5%. Tolivar said the company is expecting strong results from its upcoming menu additions, including a salmon offering, which will mark Cava's entry into seafood.",

    "body": "Liubomyr Vorona | Istock | Getty ImagesThe prospect of being replaced by artificial intelligence is helping to scare higher-income workers and leading them to stay in their jobs longer, according to several recent surveys.One closely followed gauge, the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, show confidence in the labor market among high earners around its historic lows going back to the late-1970s. Likewise, the New York Federal Reserve's monthly consumer survey shows unemployment angst also around record highs.Finally, payrolls processing firm ADP notes that turnover among traditionally white-collar occupations is around record lows.The reason for the trend? \"Our guess is partially 'AI fear', as white collar jobs are possibly at greater risk, but we are open to other explanations,\" UBS chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note. The rise of AI is causing both excitement and fear among investors, employers and workers alike. Policymakers also are trying to gauge the impact of the new technology and how it will fit into the economy.\"In my lifetime, I have never seen a technological revolution like this — and I have seen the birth of space exploration, the rise of the personal computer, the explosion of the internet and then smartphones,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Tuesday. \"Firms, households, and every government [agency] are all trying to incorporate it into the way they function and operate.\"watch nowFor the moment, AI appears to be contributing to angst and caution.Over the past year, the University of Michigan survey has found a general decline in sentiment over the labor market. However, it's been most pronounced among the top one-third of earners, whose sentiment score on the labor market, in this case expectations for a higher unemployment rate, to be at its lowest level since the financial crisis ended in 2009. Sentiment among lower-income workers also has declined but is actually higher than those at the top end.Likewise, the New York Fed's month Survey of Consumer Expectations is showing that expectations of finding a job in three months if one loses their job today is around the lowest for a data sent that stretches to mid-2013.And ADP's extensive data on the private jobs picture shows that professions such as finance and information and business services is showing reduced turnover rate. In January, turnover for professional and business services was the lowest the firm ever recorded.\"The normal push-and-pull of job gains and pay growth — quantity and price — that once kept the labor market dynamic has weakened, giving way to a market defined more by inactivity than vigor,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.To be sure, the jobs picture is still very strong for higher-income groups.While the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not break out the unemployment rate by income, it does classify it by profession. Finance, for instance, had a jobless level of just 2.1% in January, close to the same level a year ago. Professional and business services was somewhat elevated at 4.5%, but down 0.4 percentage point from January 2025.\"We immediately jump to the notion that a bunch ⁠of people are going to ‌be displaced\" by AI, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin ‌said at an event Wednesday. \"We should also remember ⁠people are going ⁠to be enabled.\"Similarly, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said in the long run, AI will be a benefit to the labor market and the economy.\"I personally think we're going to need AI to supplement the fact that we aren't having new entrants into the labor market like we did, let's say 30 years ago or 40 years ago,\" Schmid said during a separate event Wednesday. \"So AI is going to have to be an enhancement to do jobs.\"",

    "body": "A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Lucid Group reported mixed fourth-quarter results Tuesday as the electric vehicle maker continues to face challenging market conditions and internal struggles.The company widely missed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations, while beating average revenue estimates by roughly 12%. It also revised its 2025 production results due to internal validation issues, but guided for a notable increase in vehicle production this year.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG: Loss per share: $3.62 vs. a loss of $2.62 expected Revenue: $523 million vs. $468 million expectedLucid's results come days after the company laid off 12% of its U.S. salaried workforce in an effort to streamline operations and \"operate with greater efficiency and deliver on our commitments to gross margin improvement and long term growth,\" according to a statement from the company.Interim Lucid CEO Marc Winterhoff described the cuts Tuesday to CNBC as a needed realignment of the company's workforce amid broader market and economic concerns as well as needed gains in efficiency. \"We are adjusting and going to a level where we think we want to be and need to be,\" he said. \"But it's nothing that will continue in the future.\"For 2026, the company announced a vehicle production target of between 25,000 and 27,000 units. That would mark an increase of roughly 40% to 51% compared with the year-end figures the company released Tuesday. That compares to nearly doubling production last year and a 55% increase in deliveries.Lucid said the revision for the year — from 18,378 units to 17,840 units — came as \"538 vehicles had not completed certain internal procedures required under its final validation process to be classified as produced.\"The company said the vehicles are expected to be completed this year, with the change not affecting its previously reported financial results.Winterhoff described the expected growth as \"healthy,\" but not \"outrageous\" given the current slowdown in overall vehicle sales, including EVs.\"Our initial plans were higher, but we wanted to really be conservative and make sure that we are hitting the numbers that we are projecting,\" he told CNBC.watch nowLucid is expected to begin production of a new, less expensive midsize vehicle at the end of this year, but Winterhoff said it will not be material to its 2026 production plans. He said the automaker's Gravity SUV is expected to account for the majority of its production and sales this year, followed by the Air sedan. The company also plans to launch its first Lucid robotaxis with previously announced partners.Winterhoff said the company's main priorities this year are achieving its production target, growing sales, continuing efficiency gains and preparing for production of the midsize vehicle and robotaxis. \"We really want to make sure that we are on our path to profitability, make sure that we're not spending money that we don't have to. That's very, very important,\" he told CNBC.Lucid has yet to say when the company expects to be profitable. It is scheduled to host an investor day on March 12 in New York.Lucid said it ended last year with approximately $4.6 billion in total liquidity, which Lucid CFO Taoufiq Boussaid said was \"strong\" and would provide flexibility \"to execute near-term objectives while investing in future growth.\"Lucid reported a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2025, in line with a $2.71 billion loss a year earlier. That includes more than doubling its year-over-year losses during the fourth quarter to $814 million. It reported a loss of $12.09 per share for the year. The company's 2025 revenue was up 68% to $1.35 billion, including more than doubling year-over-year results during the fourth quarter.",

OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion and boost the company's valuation to $800 billion. Thrive's investment late last year was a separate deal, but the firm is likely to participate in the current round, according to the source, who is familiar with the discussions and asked not to be named because the talks are confidential.A representative for Thrive declined to comment.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who has a close relationship with Kushner, lauded the news in a post on X. \"Extremely grateful to work with Josh,\" Altman wrote. \"No one could ask for a more committed, more thoughtful, or harder-working investor.\"Kushner has deep connections with the White House as his father, Charles Kushner, is the U.S. ambassador to France, and his brother, Jared Kushner, is President Donald Trump's son-in-law.In December, OpenAI also took an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings, a company that buys, owns and runs companies that it believes could benefit from technologies like artificial intelligence. The startup did not disclose the financial terms of that agreement. OpenAI's latest funding round is expected to close in phases, as CNBC previously reported. Investments from strategics like Nvidia, SoftBank and Amazon, which make up roughly 90% of the round, will come first. Contributions from a broader pool of investors will follow.

I think it's pretty clear he hasn't. He has helped navigate, you know, skirmishes … but he hasn't ended these conflicts,\" said George Pollack, U.S. policy analyst at Signum Global Advisors. \"For him, I think it is more about how he's exerting U.S. strength, U.S. force and trying to make the world more peaceful but that's more optics than it is a substantive policy,\" Pollack told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Wednesday. \"And that's why, for us, we do think this Thursday meeting will likely be a success and bring about some more diplomatic opportunities,\" he added.The USS Gerald R.

    "body": "watch nowDavid Tepper, billionaire founder of hedge fund Appaloosa Management, sent a strongly worded letter to  Whirlpool's board, accusing the appliance maker of destroying shareholder value and calling for sweeping changes to its strategy.Tepper said in the letter that he watched with \"a certain astonishment\" as the company issued equity in what he called a large and unnecessary dilution of shareholders. He argued the capital raise came at a cost exceeding 10%, far higher than the company's tax-adjusted debt cost of below 5% in public markets, despite management's stated goal of reducing leverage.\"Over the years this management team has destroyed hundreds of millions of dollars of shareholder value. Enough is enough. There can be no more excuses,\" Tepper said in the letter, first obtained by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.Whirlpool, the maker of Maytag and other iconic American appliance brands, was the eighth-biggest holding in Appaloosa Management's portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter, worth $282 million, according to Verity data.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWhirlpool, 1 yearWhirlpool shares tanked 14% on Tuesday amid the secondary share sale, which will raise $454.9 million from a common stock offering and $508.1 million from a depositary share sale, according to the company.

Whirlpool didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.watch now",

    "body": "Rick Smith, CEO of Axon Enterprises.Adam Jeffery | CNBCAxon Enterprise's stock surged more than 17% after the maker of Tasers, body cameras and drones topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter estimates as artificial intelligence accelerated demand for its software productsThe company reported adjusted earnings of $2.15 per share on $797 million in revenue, surpassing the $1.60 per share and $755 million in revenue expected by analysts surveyed by LSEG. Axon also issued upbeat revenue guidance for 2026, calling for growth between 27% and 30%, compared to a 25.8% estimate.CEO Rick Smith said that since starting the company in 1993, AI has brought a \"moment unlike anything\" he has seen. \"If we deploy AI more aggressively and more thoughtfully than anyone else in this space, while honoring the responsibility that comes with the operating environment we operate in, we will create value that our customers simply cannot replicate,\" he told analysts on an earnings call Tuesday.

The tool, known as Axon Assistant, attracted more than 500 customers.Finance chief Brittany Bagley said Axon expects its software business, which grew 40% during the quarter to $343 million, to soon outpace hardware growth due to AI tail winds. Revenue grew 39% from a year ago. Net income totaled about $3 million, or 3 cents per share, down from $135 million, or $1.67 per share a year ago.

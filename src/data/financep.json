    "body": "When a child is upset, most parents reach for the same question instinctively: \"What's wrong?\"It's well-intentioned and it comes from care. But after years of teaching conscious parenting and studying over 200 kids, I've seen how often that question does the opposite of what parents hope. Instead of opening children up, it can shut them down.Emotional intelligence develops when children feel safe enough to reflect. Without that foundation, even the most caring questions can feel overwhelming in the moment.Across my research, one sentence reliably helped children pause, reflect, and communicate more openly: \"Tell me what feels hard right now.\"This magic phrase works because it matches how children actually experience emotions in real life. Rather than pushing for clarity or explanations, it creates the conditions where insight can emerge naturally.1. It reduces defensiveness before the conversation even beginsDuring meltdowns, after-school emotional releases, or moments of sudden irritability, children are already on edge. The word \"hard\" feels human and non-threatening. It signals to your child that they aren't in trouble and don't need to justify their feelings, making it easier to stay engaged instead of shutting down or pushing back.2. It allows emotional language to develop organicallyChildren don't need to label emotions precisely. They can describe a situation, a sensation, or a moment that felt overwhelming. Over time, this gently expands emotional language, allowing insight to develop naturally rather than being forced before a child has the words.3. It establishes emotional safety before problem-solvingBefore problem-solving, before advice, before correction, this phrase tells a child: \"I can handle what you're feeling.\" Emotional intelligence grows in welcoming environments where emotions are met with steadiness instead of urgency.4. It gives children agency over what they shareRather than demanding an explanation, this question invites reflection. The child decides how much to share and when, reinforcing a sense of agency over their emotional experience, which is an essential foundation for self-regulation and confidence.5. It helps calm the nervous system firstWhen children feel emotionally safe, their stress response begins to settle. This phrase is especially effective when behavior feels disproportionate or confusing because it prioritizes regulation before reasoning.6. It normalizes emotions as part of everyday lifeBy focusing on what feels hard, parents communicate that emotions can be noticed without being rushed or fixed. It teaches kids that feelings can be experienced and moved through rather than avoided or suppressed.7. It demonstrates emotional intelligence in real timeChildren learn emotional intelligence through experience, not instruction. When parents respond with calm curiosity instead of control or urgency, they model how to approach emotions with steadiness and reflection. These are skills children eventually apply to themselves.Our job as parents is to create an environment where our children feel safe sharing their inner worlds. When you adjust your language, you shape the emotional tone of your relationship. Over time, children learn that their feelings are important signals that deserve attention.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Jack Zhang is the co-founder and CEO of Airwallex.Courtesy of Jack ZhangThe word \"burnout\" isn't in the dictionary of Jack Zhang, co-founder and CEO of fintech company Airwallex.\"I never understand that terminology to be honest. I've worked 100 hours a week from [the] age of 16 for 20 plus years,\" Zhang told CNBC Make It.For Zhang, hard work meant survival. At age 15, he moved away from his hometown of Qingdao, China to Melbourne, Australia alone, to pursue better opportunities. He barely spoke English and stayed with an Australian host family. Shortly after arriving, he learned that his parents had found themselves in financial hot water back in China, and that he would have to support himself through university.\"I [had] two choices: either I just return to China and try to go back to the education system there, or I continue to stay in Australia and figure out how to pay [for my] tuition and living [expenses] on my own,\" said Zhang. He decided to stick with the latter and took whatever work he could find to make ends meet. To pay for his computer science degree at the University of Melbourne, Zhang juggled four blue-collar jobs: washing dishes at a restaurant during the day, bartending in the evening, working the overnight shift at a petrol station and packing lemons in a factory over the summer. Some weeks, he says, he clocked 80 to 100 hours of work on top of his coursework.\"When you're ... in that tough situation [where] you need to survive, you're not really [thinking] about burnout. I mean, either you survive or not, right?\" he said. Not much has changed since then. Now in his 40s, Zhang still clocks 80 hours a week \"easily,\" he said, at his own fintech firm. As of December 2025, the company is valued at $8 billion.From blue collar to millionaireAfter graduating from university in 2007, Zhang went into the corporate world. His first job was at an insurance company called Aviva, before he entered the banking industry.At the same time, he also built a few side businesses, from a shipping company where he exported olive oils and red wines from Australia to parts of Asia, to a real estate development firm. His side hustles proved lucrative. By the time he reached his 20s, money was no longer an issue. However, although he had accumulated millions through his businesses and banking career, Zhang said he had yet to find his true passion. Everything changed when he had his daughter at age 30. \"I remember I just looked at her, I [felt] like, I hadn't done anything [to] make her feel proud. And I think that's the moment I [decided] I need to stop just doing these side hustles, and I need to retire from my full time job and do something big, properly,\" said Zhang.\"I realized that while I always wanted money, money alone doesn't bring [me] the highest level of happiness,\" he added. Instead, he said he wanted to build something that he was extremely passionate about. \"I always wanted to find something [where] no one needs to ever wake me up and ... every day I feel extremely passionate, obligated, and willing to devote my entire survival towards,\" said Zhang. So, in December 2015, he quit his banking job and started the next chapter of his life.Starting AirwallexThe idea for Airwallex stemmed from one of Zhang's side hustles, a Melbourne-based coffee shop that he ran alongside his co-founder and university friend, Max Li. As part of running that business, the two would often import coffee beans and supplies from places like China and Brazil, which required them to wire money overseas. Through this process, they realized how expensive and inefficient cross-border payments and transfers were through the traditional SWIFT system. \"We thought, why can't we build a ... payment system in parallel to SWIFT and fundamentally change how money moves around the world?\" said Zhang. They wanted to create a solution to streamline cross-border payments, and thus, the original idea for Airwallex was born. Zhang and Li went on to bring together other friends from their university network to help work on the idea: Lucy Liu, Jacob Dai and Ki-lok Wong. Liu played a key role early on and invested the first $1 million into the startup. By late 2015, the group officially founded Airwallex. After about a decade of more 80-hour work weeks, as of end last year, the company crossed $1 billion in annualized run rate revenue (ARR), which estimates a company's future yearly earnings based on a shorter period of financial data.\"I'm still very excited about what's ahead of us,\" said Zhang. \"I think there's tons of opportunities ahead of us ... we think we can generate [at least] $10 billion [in] revenue by 2030 so that is our next goal post.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire.A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live.In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. By comparison, Oklahoma has the lowest estimated total, at $735,284, to cover the same basic costs.The analysis is based on the average living costs for retirees 65 or older in each state, drawn from the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs.Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Utilities and health-care costs can range by as much as $5,000 annually, the study finds.Here's a look the minimum amount of savings needed to retire at 65 in each state, in alphabetical order.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037AlaskaAnnual cost of living: $78,449Savings you need to retire: $1,400,286ArizonaAnnual cost of living: $66,838Savings you need to retire: $1,110,019ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538CaliforniaAnnual cost of living: $83,978Savings you need to retire: $1,538,508ColoradoAnnual cost of living: $63,091Savings you need to retire: $1,016,336ConnecticutAnnual cost of living: $70,094Savings you need to retire: $1,191,417DelawareAnnual cost of living: $63,152Savings you need to retire: $1,017,871FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933HawaiiAnnual cost of living: $110,393Savings you need to retire: $2,198,902IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MaineAnnual cost of living: $70,155Savings you need to retire: $1,192,953MarylandAnnual cost of living: $73,043Savings you need to retire: $1,265,135MassachusettsAnnual cost of living: $92,639Savings you need to retire: $1,755,055MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931MontanaAnnual cost of living: $67,452Savings you need to retire: $1,125,377NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New HampshireAnnual cost of living: $67,084Savings you need to retire: $1,116,163New JerseyAnnual cost of living: $70,401Savings you need to retire: $1,199,096New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684New YorkAnnual cost of living: $77,773Savings you need to retire: $1,383,392North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284OregonAnnual cost of living: $68,681Savings you need to retire: $1,156,093PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331Rhode IslandAnnual cost of living: $69,664Savings you need to retire: $1,180,666South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VermontAnnual cost of living: $69,848Savings you need to retire: $1,185,274VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405WashingtonAnnual cost of living: $69,971Savings you need to retire: $1,188,345West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the Board of Peace, Bloomberg first reported on Saturday night, citing a draft charter for the proposed group. The Board of Peace is an international body that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025. The board was established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to serve as the group's inaugural chairman, and he will choose which members to invite, according to the draft seen by Bloomberg. While a majority vote would make decisions, the chairman would have final approval. Member states would serve a three-year term on the board, but could secure a permanent seat by paying $1 billion cash within the first year of the charter's start, according to the draft.A U.S. official told CNBC there is no cost to join the Board of Peace, but the $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership. The group's mandate is to \"rebuild all of Gaza,\" and \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on that mandate. The group will operate without \"exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat,\" the official said. It's unclear where the funds collected from Board of Peace members would be held.Trump has invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday. Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday. Turkey, Egypt, Paraguay and Albania had previously been invited. The full list could be announced by the U.S. in the coming days, the Associated Press reported. Under Trump's leadership, the group has also created a founding executive board to \"oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilization and long-term success,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. Executive board appointees include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and U.S. deputy national security advisor Robert Gabriel. ",

    "body": "U.S.President Donald Trump arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of the existing U.S. tariffs already levied on goods from these countries.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its allies already average about 15% on goods from the European Union countries in Trump's crosshairs and roughly 10% on imports from the United Kingdom, with rates varying by sector. In sensitive areas such as metals and certain autos, stacked measures have already pushed effective tariffs into the mid-teens to mid-20% range.The imposition of tariffs on one or more members of the EU, which comprises 27 nations, means the new tariffs would apply to all. Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold.\"Ambassadors from the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday, Reuters reported. Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, called the meeting, which is set to start at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).Tariff strategyTrump's post suggested that the new tariffs on European allies are being imposed in response to the countries' moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the president did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that the new tariffs play right into the hands of China and Russia. \"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Some cautioned European leaders to avoid reacting hastily to Trump's tariff threat.\"Just ignore it and wait and see,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, told Reuters. \"Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.\"Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"Likewise, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., both members of the Bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, warned that threatening tariffs on NATO would raise costs for U.S. families while benefiting adversaries like Russia and China. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said: \"Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America's allies… At a time when many Americans are already concerned about the cost of living, these tariffs would raise prices for both families and businesses.\"The lawmakers said Danish and Greenlandic officials want to \"partner with the United States,\" urging the administration to \"turn off the threats and turn on diplomacy.\"— Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

(Photo by Zhu Dayong/VCG via Getty Images)Zhu Dayong | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's birthrate fell to a record low last year, underscoring a deepening demographic crisis as Beijing struggles to reverse a shrinking and aging population. Births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023, marking the lowest level on record, according to data compiled by Wind Information going back to the 1950s.About 7.9 million babies were born last year, sharply fewer than 9.5 million a year before, data from the statistics bureau showed Monday, despite Beijing's efforts to encourage larger families through widening subsidies and expanded parental leave. Even though the country began easing its stringent one-child policy nearly a decade ago, the birth rate continued to plummet — except for a brief spike in 2024, when it climbed to 6.77 per 1,000 people. The increase was widely attributed to the Year of the Dragon, which is traditionally considered an auspicious time to have children. \"The pace of the decline is striking, particularly in the absence of  major shocks,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.She added that the boost from fertility stimulus measures has faded, while young people are delaying marriage and child-bearing plans due to growing economic pressures and intensifying competition in workplaces.Policymakers have rolled out various incentives, including cash rewards and tax breaks for households with children under age 3. Beijing has also extended the maternity leave to 158 days, from 98 days in 2024. China has faced a looming population crisis as its elderly population grew. The share of the population aged 60 and above rose to 23% in 2025, up from 22% in 2024.  The population fell for a fourth year, declining by 3.4 million to 1.405 billion last year, according to the statistics bureau.Economists warned that a shrinking workforce and an ageing population pose major economic risks. Fewer babies mean a shrinking workforce in the future to support a rapidly growing cohort of retirees, piling pressure on the already-stretched pension system. It could also force higher social security contributions, squeezing disposable income for younger workers.  \"A shrinking population implies a smaller consumer base in the future, increasing the risk of wider supply-demand imbalances,\" Su noted, calling for a more forceful policy response on fertility.  World Bank data showed that the fertility rate, defined as births per woman, fell to 1 in China in 2023, the most recent year available, below the global average level of 2.2.  watch now",

    "body": "Pedestrians in the Huaqiangbei electronics market area in Shenzhen, China, on Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. Qilai Shen | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's economic growth slowed to its weakest pace in nearly three years in the fourth quarter as domestic demand softened, though full-year growth matched Beijing's target despite growing trade frictions with the U.S. and a prolonged real estate slump.  Gross domestic product grew 4.5% in the October-to-December period, data from the National Statistics Bureau showed Monday. That marked a slowdown from 4.8% in the third quarter and was the weakest reading since the first quarter of 2023, when growth also came in at 4.5%. Full-year economic output came in at 5%, meeting the official target of around 5%. Separate December data showed domestic consumption weakened and the investment decline steepened, while manufacturing improved. Retail sales grew 0.9% in December from a year earlier, missing economists' forecast for 1.2% growth and slowing from 1.3% in the prior month. That marked the softest growth since December 2022, according to Wind Information, when the gauge of consumption declined 1.8% year on year.  Industrial output climbed 5.2% in December, topping expectations for a 5% growth and up from 4.8% in the previous month.  Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, contracted 3.8% last year, worse than economists' forecast for a 3% drop in a Reuters poll. Investment in property development continued to decline as a real estate crisis dragged on, falling 17.2% in 2025, deepening from the 10.6% drop in 2024. The urban unemployment rate remained unchanged at 5.1% in December. The mainland Chinese CSI 300 rose 0.6% following the data release before paring back gains, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 0.8%. The offshore yuan rose slightly to 6.9604 against the U.S. dollar, its strongest level since May 2023, according to LSEG data. \"We must adopt more proactive and effective macro policies (and) continue to expand domestic demand,\" the statistics bureau said in an official English language release. Supply-demand imbalanceThe world's second-largest economy showed resilience in 2025, largely helped by lower-than-expected tariff rates and exporters' push to diversify away from the U.S., allowing policymakers to delay launching large-scale stimulus. China reported a record trade surplus of nearly $1.2 trillion last year, driven by surging exports to non-U.S. markets as manufacturers redirected shipments to avoid higher U.S. tariffs.The anticipated drag from front-loaded shipments, tighter transshipment controls and currency appreciation has been limited, said Tommy Xie, managing director of OCBC Bank. Xie expects China's exports to grow around 3% in 2026. China's net exports accounted for nearly one-third of its GDP in 2025, while consumption contributed 52% to the economic output, statistics bureau director Kang Yi told reporters Monday. Exports continued to face headwinds. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran, including China, and the trade truce with Washington is set to expire later this year. China's staggering trade imbalance has also drawn criticism from trading partners seeking to shield domestic industries from an influx of cheap Chinese goods.Economists have called for economic reforms to shift the growth model toward domestic consumption and reduce reliance on exports and investment, warning that the current growth model poses long-term risks. \"Plunging investment and weak household consumption have made the Chinese economy increasingly reliant on exports to power growth, a situation that is untenable for China as well as the world economy,\" said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University.Beijing has sought to rein in excess industrial capacity and curb aggressive price wars. Consumer inflation accelerated to 0.8% in December, the fastest pace in nearly three years, while producer prices dropped 1.9%.Still, China's GDP deflator, the broadest measure of prices across goods and services, has remained negative since 2023 and is expected to fall by 0.5% in 2026 in the longest streak on record, according to Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie.The economy continues to struggle with weak domestic spending amid a prolonged property slump and persistent deflationary strains. New bank loans shrank to a seven-year low of 16.27 trillion yuan ($2.33 trillion) in 2025, underscoring sluggish borrowing demand and piling pressure on the government to provide more stimulus.The People's Bank of China last week announced a package of credit-easing measures, including a 25-basis-point cut in rates on various lending tools and increasing quotas for lending programs targeting key sectors such as agriculture, technology and private enterprises.Economists at Goldman Sachs expect the central bank to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the policy rate by 10 basis points in the first quarter.watch now",

    "body": "Coolpicture | Moment | Getty ImagesAs you gauge how much income you'll need to pay for your living expenses in retirement, don't forget to consider how you'll cover unexpected costs.More than 8 in 10 retiree households — 83% — will face unplanned outlays in any given year, according to new research from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Among households that do experience unexpected expenses, the average annual amount spent across retirement is $6,000. Measured another way, the typical household will spend an amount equivalent to 10% of its yearly income.Yet many households don't have that available in emergency savings, according to the research. While roughly 58% have enough cash to cover unplanned costs for a single year, around 16% would have to tap their 401(k) or other retirement accounts and the rest — about 27% — would fall short even after using all their cash and retirement assets.\"About 40% of [retired] households do not have enough cash to cover even a single year [of unplanned expenses], let alone their whole retirement,\" the research notes. The research uses data from 3,427 retired households that have been part of the 2000-2020 Health and Retirement Study and the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, both from the University of Michigan.It's important to have some cash savingsWhile experts generally recommend nonretirees have three to six months of living expenses set aside as emergency savings in case of job loss or other financial shocks, that amount may look different for retirees — who must figure out how to stretch their savings across what may be a decades-long retirement.As many retirees struggle to keep up with prices that continue to rise, considering unexpected expenses is an important part of evaluating retirement readiness.\"That helps you plan for liquidity versus your income needs,\" said Anqi Chen, co-author of the report and associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research.While some households may struggle to set aside money, \"even small amounts of savings will help provide some sort of buffer for when these events occur,\" Chen said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

For example, about 45% of households with less than $50,000 in income face a rainy day or health-care shock in a given year, compared with 80% of those with $100,000 or more in income.\"This finding highlights the fact that households have some control over when and how much they spend,\" the report notes.Think in terms of 'access to cash for surprises'So how much should you have set aside? Depending on a retiree's individual situation, financial advisors may recommend anywhere from three or six months' worth of expenses to a couple of years — or a variation of those parameters. Much of it will depend on your individual situation.\"What we usually tell clients is to think less in terms of months of expenses and more in terms of access to cash for surprises — health-care costs, home repairs or family needs,\" said certified financial planner Joon Um, a tax advisor with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California.\"For many retirees, that ends up being one year of core expenses, adjusted for guaranteed income like Social Security or pensions,\" Um said.The right amount depends on health, housing, income stability and how flexible other assets are, Um said.\"Retirees with steady income and liquid portfolios may need less cash, while those with higher medical risk or less flexibility need more,\" Um said. \"The goal isn't to maximize cash. It's to have enough on hand to avoid selling long-term investments at the wrong time.\"In other words, if you don't have enough cash set aside, you could be put in a position of selling investments when the market is down.Avoid having too much in cashHowever, having too much in cash comes with its own risks, said Peter Lazaroff, a chartered financial analyst and CFP, and the chief investment officer at Plancorp in St. Louis.\"Any time a retiree has more than two years of expenses in cash, it's too much,\" Lazaroff said. \"From purely a mathematical standpoint, you're giving up too much of a return.\"The biggest risk to your cash is inflation, he said. The latest reading of the consumer price index showed an annual inflation rate of 2.7% in December. \"Your cash just becomes less valuable every year,\" he said. \"You're putting your purchasing power at risk.\"He recommends stashing your cash in a high-yield savings account — which right now generally earns more than 3% in interest, according to Bankrate — to help minimize the impact of inflation.",

She became Uber's first chief branding officer tasked with rehabbing the rideshare company's image. And she made headlines in 2016 when she shook up the stage at Apple's annual conference despite not looking like a typical \"Apple fan boy,\" she says.Saint John's career moves are as as bold as her personal style. And she has what she considers some well-meaning but misguided advice to thank for that.\"An early manager told me never to wear red lipstick or red nail polish,\" Saint John tells CNBC Make It when asked about the best career advice she's ever gotten.\"She did it with good intention, like, 'You walk into a room and you don't want to be too bold. You don't want people to make opinions of you before you even open your mouth,'\" Saint John says. But \"that made me question my appearance in rooms. Being a Black woman who's quite tall and bold in her wardrobe, I found that it really shrank me.\"Saint John says she decided to ignore that advice and flip it on its head to \"be the most colorful, the boldest, the sharpest, the wittiest in a room, and feel very confident in it.\"\"I've been able to be successful because I didn't take that advice,\" she says.Saint John continues to go after big changes in her career, becoming a first-time CEO for her own hair and beauty brand, Eve by Boz, and most recently adding \"reality TV star\" to her resume a cast member of Bravo's \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" and as co-host of NBC's \"On Brand with Jimmy Fallon.\"And she wants you to go after your big career swings, too.With people approaching a new year with new work goals, Saint John says it's a good time as any to go after what you really want in your career. \"That the pivot can happen any moment,\" she says.Here, Saint John draws on her own career and experience managing thousands to share the signs it's time to quit a job, how to shape your professional brand, a major red flag when interviewing with companies, and more.When you know it's time to quit a jobMy advice is usually if you get the Sunday scaries, you're definitely in the wrong place. If you are coming back from the holiday and you feel the ache in your stomach that you don't want to go back to your job, or you're dreading it so much so that you can barely sleep, then I think that's a pretty big indication that you've got to go now.The big mistake people when going after a raise, promotion or quittingIf you want a promotion or more experiences within your job, set a timeline by which you can hit that goal or decide it's time to leave. Create a timeline with your boss.A lot of times people approach that promotion or the raise conversation from a very self-centered standpoint. What the company and your manager wants to hear is how it's going to help the company and the wider community of your colleagues.So if you position it as: \"By March 1, I want to be promoted to X position, and this is how I'm going to execute my job to get take on more responsibility or help the company achieve X, Y and Z goal,' that gives you some building blocks and a timeline to get to March 1. When you're mid-career trying to get to the next step, you should absolutely have a plan to make sure that you're talking to your boss with a timeline in mind.It's such a mistake to think that this is all you, that you've got to put in the ideas for how you're going to get ahead. If you don't include your manager in your timeline, they have no idea what what goal you're trying to hit.Lay the groundwork so that by the time you have that conversation, everybody is well aware that either you've hit the goal to get that raise or promotion, and if you do your part and don't have it by March 1, everybody's on the same page: 'I'm quitting.'How to be in control of your own professional brandRegardless of if you're on TV or you're sitting in a cubicle, I believe your personal brand  is important, and to some degree you don't have control. So you have to take as much control as possible. If you're sitting a cubicle in an open floor plan and somebody doesn't appreciate your work, your responsibility is to make sure that the brand narrative about yourself is that you're hardworking or that you're creative or that you're a problem solver. Do as much as you can to communicate that brand the same way that you would in front of a camera.The No. 1 quality she hires forThis is the No. 1 thing: Bring your full self. Don't try to cut down the edges of yourself so that you can fit in better. The way that you make yourself memorable is to actually be memorable. There are so many beautifully unique things about each of us, our experiences, the history that we come with, that weaving that into your answers and into the conversation that you're having is actually what's going to make somebody remember you.We often think that as human beings, we have to have similar interests or similar tastes with somebody so that they get along with us and want to hire us. And I think it's actually quite the opposite. Curiosity, wanting to know somebody because you're like, 'They're from this place, or they've had this experience, and that could add to the job because I don't have that experience' is actually how you want to be perceived in an interview. Her biggest red flag to look for when interviewing with a companyIf you're in an interview, and the person who's talking to you makes it sound as if they're looking for somebody who's just like them, run. Run fast, far and away.You want to be in a place that is going to appreciate and love the unique contribution that you're bringing to the job. And it's not just about your business experience. It's about your cultural experience, your personal experience and your emotional experience. You're one of one, so bring it.This interview has been edited for length and clarity.Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeBessent said Trump's new tariffs on Europe regarding Greenland are a response to an emergency. \"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president ... he is able to use the economic might of the U.S. to avoid a hot war.\" Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland, the Arctic territory of Denmark, and has ratcheted up his pressure campaign for a U.S. takeover of the island in recent weeks. Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.CORRECTION: Vivian Motzfeldt is Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Ro Khanna on Friday reintroduced a bill that would curb institutional investors from buying up housing,  leveraging a similar call made recently by President Donald Trump.Trump said in a Truth Social post on Jan. 7 that he would be \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"Trump's remark was one of a flurry of populist economic moves by the president as he races to address voter concerns about affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.A recent Marist poll found that just 36% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 57% disapproved. That is a significant headwind for Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress as they try to hang onto their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate.In a statement to CNBC, Khanna invoked Trump's recent support for blocking institutional investors from buying up housing. \"If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law,\" Khanna said. \"Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeWhile bill text was not immediately available, Khanna's office told CNBC that the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act would prohibit large institutional investors from taking advantage of home-related tax breaks, including mortgage interest, insurance and depreciation deductions. The bill would also require federal and government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family homes. Large Institutional investors who sell single-family homes more than 18 months after the bill's enactment would be slapped with a real estate transfer tax equal to 100% of the home's sale value. In prior versions of the bill, including one introduced in late 2024, a large institutional investor was defined as a person or firm with assets exceeding $100 million. Khanna has 13 cosponsors on the bill so far, all Democrats. But it's possible that Trump's call for an end to large investors in the single-family home market may prompt some House GOP members to join Khanna's effort.In an interview with CNBC, Khanna said he's willing to work with Trump on legislation \"if it's actually going to help the working class.\" \"If he calls me up, I'll help lead the bill,\" Khanna said. Trump is set to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, where the president said he will address his housing proposal. \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",

    "body": "Signage at the Broadcom Inc. headquarters in San Jose, California, June 2, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInvestors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks.Stock ratings from top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for opportunities in the market. These experts arrive at their recommendations following a thorough analysis of the macro and micro factors affecting a company.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.BroadcomThis week's first pick is Broadcom (AVGO), a semiconductor and infrastructure software provider. The company's custom chips or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are seeing strong demand amid the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $475. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $393.The meeting made Rasgon conclude that investor concerns about the impact of rising competition and customer-owned tooling on Broadcom's AI positioning are \"hugely overblown and that the company is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC space anytime soon.\"While Broadcom acknowledges that Nvidia (NVDA) is innovating faster than anyone else, Rasgon noted that the company is confident about being the only partner that can help XPU customers keep up. With innovation related to 3D chip stacking and 400G SerDes to a massive supply chain and in-house substrate production, Broadcom is progressing in a way that no one can match, the five-star analyst noted.Broadcom is also expected to benefit from the growing demand for Alphabet-owned Google's ($GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, given its partnership with Google in developing these chips. Rasgon highlighted Kawwas' commentary about TPU v7 (ironwood) shipments rising from hundreds of thousands of units in 2025 to \"many many millions\" in 2026. He added that TPU v8 shipments are expected to touch hundreds of thousands of units per month in a few months, and millions by the end of this year. Also, Rasgon noted that the $73 billion order figure given at AVGO's earnings release is substantially higher today.Rasgon ranks No. 120 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 30.7%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks. AirbnbTravel stock Airbnb (ABNB) is next on the list. In his research note on the outlook for the U.S. internet space, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley named Airbnb as one of the top ideas for 2026. The analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $156. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Airbnb stock with a price target of $153.Walmsley expects room nights (a key metric in the hospitality industry) growth to reaccelerate, driven by Airbnb's strategy to add hotels to its supply; book now, pay later expansion; and easier comparisons in the domestic market.\"We see Airbnb's forthcoming AI product as a call option and see better prospects here than with other OTAs [online travel agents] given the product-focused leadership,\" said Walmsley.The five-star analyst contends that investors are underappreciating Airbnb's prospects and its potential to reaccelerate room nights growth. Walmsley believes that the company's strength will become more evident this year when it rolls out its hotel strategy in three test markets and expands into more cities, possibly in late 2026. The analyst also expects Airbnb's decision to add hotel inventory to broaden the company's addressable market beyond traditional short-term rentals.Walmsley expects the hotel expansion, along with the book now, pay later conversion benefits, to reaccelerate growth in the second half of 2026 and lift ABNB stock's valuation multiple.Walmsley ranks No. 158 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Airbnb Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Meta PlatformsWalmsley also named social media giant Meta Platforms (META) as one of his top ideas in the internet space for 2026. The top-rated analyst reiterated a buy rating on META stock with a price target of $815. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on META stock with a price target of $753.Walmsley expects META stock to rise from current levels, given that Wall Street's estimates have already priced in the company's high costs and capital spending. He expects upside in revenue and the company's progress on the AI front to reduce investors' fears about elevated spending.\"We believe Meta shares work on positive revisions and multiple expansion as the company better demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment,\" Walmsley said.The analyst highlighted that his industry contacts indicated better advertising ROIs, or return on investment, on the platform. Moreover, Walmsley is optimistic about Meta Business AI and the monetization of WhatsApp. Also, he sees strength in AI/ML, or machine learning, engagement and ad targeting benefits to bolster revenue growth in 2026.Walmsley expects Meta Platforms to roll out improved quality for large language model and product capability, which he believes will quell investors' concerns about the company's high investments. The analyst is also encouraged by the company's cost management efforts and focus on optimizing Reality Labs expenses.See Meta Platforms Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

Added to this, billionaires' wealth has surged by 81% since 2020, the charity said, describing the past  as \"a good decade for billionaires.\"And while the rich have become richer, poverty reduction has slowed, with levels \"broadly where they were in 2019,\" according to a news release from the charity.Oxfam also said the super-rich often use their wealth to secure political power as well as media ownership, noting billionaire Elon Musk's involvement in the U.S. administration at the start of 2025, Jeff Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post and billionaire Vincent Bollore's acquisition of French news site CNews.\"The outsized influence that the super-rich have over our politicians, economies and media has deepened inequality and led us far off track on tackling poverty,\" said Oxfam's Executive Director Amitabh Behar in the charity's report, titled \"Resisting the Rule of the Rich: Protecting Freedom from Billionaire Power.\"The charity has released inequality reports to coincide with the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, every year since 2014. Last year, Oxfam predicted the world would see at least five trillionaires within a decade and called for global tax policies to ensure the rich pay their fair share.This year, \"Davos,\" which starts on Monday, will host around 65 heads of state and 850 CEOs, with U.S. President Donald Trump set to address delegates on Wednesday.\"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is ... creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable,\" Behar said.\"Governments are making wrong choices to pander to the elite and defend wealth while repressing people's rights and anger at how so many of their lives are becoming unaffordable and unbearable,\" Behar said.  In 2025, Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" introduced several tax breaks for the wealthy, with those earning $1 million-plus seeing about a 3% income boost. Meanwhile, most Americans can no longer afford a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to a 2023 report by the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity. About 10% of Americans lived in poverty in 2024 according to U.S. census data published in September.Oxfam called on governments to make national inequality reduction plans, tax the super-rich to reduce their power and prioritize stronger \"firewalls\" between politics and wealth as well as provide stronger protection for freedom of expression.The report comes as more than 2,500 people have been killed in Iran since protests against a long-running economic crisis began last month. Last year saw more than 140 \"significant\" anti-government protests in 68 countries, Oxfam said, which authorities \"typically met with violence.\" \"Being economically poor creates hunger. Being politically poor creates anger,\" Behar said. Rich nations are \"cutting aid further and faster than before,\" Oxfam's report stated. These cuts, including the closure of USAID, could lead to an additional 14 million deaths by 2030, the charity said.- CNBC's April Roach contributed to this report.",

South Korea is scheduled to announce its gross domestic product (GDP) figures on April 24. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFancy some cheese-flavored spicy noodles? Judging by export sales, the rest of the world can't get enough of South Korea's food exports, also known as \"K-Food.\"Exports of \"K-Food+\" — a category that includes food products and agricultural industries — surged to a record $13.62 billion in 2025, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. That's a 5.1% increase from a year earlier and marked the tenth consecutive year of growth.Instant noodles, or ramyeon, were the standout. Exports jumped nearly 22% to $1.52 billion, making it the first single food category to surpass $1 billion in overseas sales.Cheese-flavored spicy noodles and other new products resonated with consumers in China, the U.S., and emerging markets in Central Asia and the Middle East.\"Global demand for Korean noodles continues to expand, and companies have scaled up production and stabilized supply chains to meet it,\" the ministry noted in a late‑2025 report.Other categories also gained traction overseas, with Korean sauces benefiting from the demand for spicy and sweet flavors, while ice cream and fruit exports rose too.Riding K-pop's coattailsWhat makes the humble pack of South Korean instant noodles so popular? Analysts say culture plays a big role.The massive appeal of K-pop and Korean television dramas has helped fuel demand, with food frequently featured on screen. Characters are often shown eating ramyeon in dramas, variety shows and advertisements.Just as K-pop companies are looking overseas for growth, Korean food makers, especially those selling ramyeon, are doing the same, said Oh Jiwoo, analyst at brokerage CGS International.Nongshim CEO Cho Yong-chul told employees at the start of 2026 that the company's business principle for the year was \"Global Agility & Growth,\" urging staff to expand its overseas footprint.Otoki CEO Hwang Sung-man said at a shareholder meeting in March 2025 that the company, best known for its Jin Ramen, would prioritize \"exploring global markets\" and aim for an overseas sales revenue of 1.1 trillion won ($746 million) by 2030. CGS' Oh said companies are looking beyond South Korea's shores because the domestic market is saturated. For example, Nongshim, best known for its Shin Ramyeon brand, holds over 60% market share in South Korea. \"Their main product was first invented in 1970s and 80s. And those products, [the] same products, is selling every year, [with] no marketing cost,\" she said.South Korea's demographic decline also limits long-term domestic growth, Oh added, pushing companies to look abroad. As a result, noodle makers have leaned into K-pop's global reach, signing popular ambassadors and icons to increase their overseas appeal. Nongshim named SM Entertainment girl group Aespa as global ambassadors in late 2025, following a collaboration with Netflix on a K-pop Demon Hunters-themed noodle line. Otoki has tapped BTS member Jin as its brand model for Jin Ramen.

Beyond a saturated market, South Korea's instant noodle manufacturers face government-imposed limits on price increases, restricting their ability to offset rising costs, Macquarie said.Overseas markets, on the other hand, allow companies to set higher average selling prices, Oh said. She added that in China and other Asian markets, average prices can be 30%-50% higher than in South Korea, while in the U.S., average prices can be roughly double.Macquarie said that the dominant Japanese and Korean brands have benefited from shifting consumption patterns due to their focus on \"product innovation and cultivating a premium brand image.\"Samyang Foods was identified as a key beneficiary, with Macquarie projecting it will be able to increase its U.S. market share to 23.9% by 2028, from the current 11.4%. \"We believe premium instant noodles with strong product innovation will be the key driver for US market,\" Macquarie said.Samyang Foods is known for its Buldak line of spicy instant noodles, which gained popularity in 2014 for the \"fire noodle challenge,\" in which participants tried to eat the noodles without drinking water.The trend led to regulatory scrutiny in 2024 when Danish authorities briefly recalled some Buldak products over high capsaicin levels, which posed a serious health risk. The recall was later reversed.SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - JUNE 17: The Anjum family, on vacation from Pakistan, picks out varieties of the Buldak Samyang instant noodles from the CU \"Ramyun Library\" convenience store, a popular tourist attraction, on Monday, June 17, 2024, in the Hongdae district of Seoul, South Korea.\n(Photo by Jintak Han/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images",

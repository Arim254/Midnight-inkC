    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate markets could get an influx of capital and investors under legislation approved by the House on ThursdayThe package of capital-formation bills, called the INVEST Act, passed the House 302 to 123. Eighty-seven Democrats joined every Republican in the House to support the bill. The wide-ranging package of legislation would allow more investors access to private markets. Lawmakers say the measure will help more companies go public and increase capital formation for startups.Instead of only wealth or income determining who can be an accredited investor, investors could become accredited by taking an exam approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.House Financial Services Chairman French Hill, R-Ark., said the bill was needed in part because of the decrease in the number of public companies in America. \"We make it easier to be a public company in America,\" Hill said on the House floor during debate on the bill. \"\"We make it easier, if you have a great idea, to crowdsource that idea, to raise money from friends and family. And we make it easier, if you're an individual investor, to have other opportunities in which to invest.\"The bill also would lift the cap for how much venture capital firms can raise, and how many people can invest, before they are subject to stricter disclosure and compliance regulations.The bill increases the number of investors to 500 from 250, and increases funds to $50 million from $10 million. It also would become easier for venture capital firms to invest in each other  — a change lawmakers say will help more funds reach companies in places like the Midwest and the South. Rep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., said that unicorn companies  — privately held startups with a valuation of $1 billion or more  — used to be rare. Now, he said there are \"herds of unicorns\" which limit investing opportunities for the public. \"We're trying to make sure that this is open and accessible to folks, and I think that's going to be a healthier approach for both the public markets and the private markets,\" Huizenga said. The bill now heads to the Senate, where making capital formation easier is on Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott's to-do list. It is not clear if the Senate will take up the House package, move individual pieces of it, or try to do its own bill. ",

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesIn the Federal Reserve's battle between fighting inflation and limiting unemployment, the latter side carried the day Wednesday and could also have an edge heading into 2026 if labor market weakness becomes more evident through an apparent overcounting of jobs numbers.In the immediate term, worries over the employment situation meant a vote, albeit divided by a 9-3 margin, to lower the central bank's key interest rate by a quarter percentage point. Down the road, there are indications that policymakers will be more inclined to cut further if the labor market stays soft. At his Wednesday news conference, Chair Jerome Powell mentioned several times that there likely has been negative job growth in recent months, a condition that would argue for easier monetary policy.\"Gradual cooling in the labor market has continued,\" Powell said. \"Surveys of households and businesses both show declining supply and demand for workers. So, I think you can say that the labor market has continued to cool gradually, just a touch more gradually than we thought.\"At issue is a monthly estimate the Bureau of Labor Statistics performs of how the labor market is affected by businesses closing and opening. The estimate, known as the birth-death model, takes a guess at the jobs gained by openings and lost by closings.Powell said the model has probably overstated jobs by about 60,000 per month since April. With job growth averaging just shy of 40,000 in that period, an overstatement that size would equate to payroll losses of about 20,000 per month.Powell urges cautionThe chair called the discrepancy \"something of a systematic overcount\" that likely will see big revisions to job growth numbers.In September, the BLS released a preliminary benchmark estimate that job growth was overstated by 911,000 in the 12-month period preceding March 2025. A final count is scheduled to come out in February.In \"a world where job creation is negative, I just think we need to watch that situation very carefully and be in a position where we're not pushing down job creation with our policy,\" Powell said.Balancing support for the labor market with keeping inflation under control will be central to policymaking as the Fed enters 2026. Officials at this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting expressed a broad divergence of opinion on where rates should head. Six of the 19 participants said they opposed the latest rate cut — two of them were among the 12 who vote — and seven indicated they don't see the need for any reductions next year, according to the \"dot plot\" of individual expectations.On the other side are those who think there is at least some room for further easing. That would point to greater concerns about the labor market, even as inflation holds above the Fed's 2% target. However, Powell said much of the inflation overshoot is coming from President Donald Trump's tariffs, whose impact is expected to wane as the months go on.Market sees more cutsShould the view hold that inflation is subsiding and the labor market is stumbling, the Fed would then be expected to tilt toward an easing bias, particularly with Powell leaving his position as chair in May. \"With the Fed's most influential members keeping a keen eye on the unemployment rate, we think that as long as labor demand wanes and [the] unemployment rate increases, the path will be cleared for additional cuts, despite the vocal opposition from the hawks,\" Natixis economist Christopher Hodge said in a note.\"Because we see the unemployment rate rising through Q1 2026, we think the Fed will continuing cutting to arrest further softening in the labor market,\" Hodge added, noting that \"we think a cut in January is more likely than not.\"Stocks rallied Wednesday and Thursday amid hopes that the rhetoric out of the FOMC was not as hawkish as feared. Still, futures market pricing is indicating the next cut won't come until at least April. Traders also are putting odds on two reductions in 2026, which is more aggressive than the dot-plot indication of one, with even a 41% probability of three moves, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure.",

    "body": "Renovation work continues on the Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Board Building, the main offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on December 9, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Thursday reappointed 11 of its 12 regional bank presidents, ending a mini-drama at the central bank in a move that came a bit earlier than usual.By unanimous vote, the seven governors kept in place a cast of officials that also includes first vice presidents at the branches that extend across the country. The group of presidents did not include the Atlanta Fed, whose president, Raphael Bostic, is retiring in February. Though the regional reserve banks act independently and hire their own presidents, the moves are subject to board approval in Washington, D.C. The presidents serve five-year terms, which in this case will commence March 1, 2026, and can be removed at will by the board.Normally, the Fed waits until closer to the Feb. 28 expiration date of the terms to announce reappointments. The terms historically have ended in years ending in one or six.There had been some speculation about whether President Donald Trump, a fierce Fed critic, would seek to exert more control over the rate-setting process by removing some regional presidents. The Federal Open Market Committee sets the central bank's key interest rate with a voting group that includes the chair, the other six governors, the New York Fed president and a rotating cast of four other regional presidents.However, the unanimous vote included Governor Stephen Miran, a recent Trump appointee whose term expires in January.Moreover, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently complained that New York holds disproportionate sway over the Fed as several presidents are from the city but serving in other areas. They include Lorie Logan, who previously ran the trading desk at the New York Fed and now helms the Dallas distrct, and former Goldman Sachs executive Beth Hammack, who is in Cleveland.Bessent floated a proposal in which regional presidents would be required to be residents of their district for three years.

    "body": "Pedestrians walk past British Union flag designs on advertisements.Simon Dawson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.K. economy unexpectedly contracted 0.1% in the three months to October, according to official figures released Friday. Economists had expected 0% growth over the period. It follows a 0.1% expansion over the three months to September. The Office for Statistics noted that services output stalled, construction output fell 0.3% and production output fell 0.5% \"largely because of a fall in the manufacture of motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers in this period.\"The figures come after the U.K.'s Chancellor Rachel Reeves unveiled a range of tax hikes in her hotly anticipated Budget last month, as she looked to plug a \"black hole\" in the country's finances and spur much-needed economic growth.\"October's GDP underscores just how much difficulty the U.K. economy is going through as the government searches for some sort of growth,\" Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter wealth management company, said in a note.\"This figure also misses what were already low expectations and doesn't bode well for next month's figure either.\"Looking ahead to the central bank's rate decision next week, James added that Friday's figures made it \"increasingly likely the Bank of England will have to lower rates next week when it meets, but with inflation remaining persistently high, the pace at which subsequent cuts can be delivered remains questionable.\"The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Dec. 18 and is widely expected to agree on a quarter-point rate cut to 3.75%, as inflation cools. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said she expected growth to remain weak for the rest of the quarter, \"as activity in November is likely to have been constrained because of continued Budget uncertainty.\"\"Overall, we expect the GDP growth to be flat in the final quarter of this year,\" she added.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on, as he signs an executive order on AI in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. Dec. 11, 2025.Al Drago | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday issuing a single regulation framework for artificial intelligence, undermining the power of individual states. \"To win, United States AI companies must be free to innovate without cumbersome regulation,\" the order says. \"But excessive State regulation thwarts this imperative.\"The Trump administration, with the aid of AI and crypto czar David Sacks, has been pursuing a path that would allow federal rules to preempt state regulations on AI, a move meant to keep big Democratic-led states like California and New York from exerting their control over the growing industry. Sacks and fellow tech investor and podcaster Chamath Palihapitiya stood beside Trump during the signing in the Oval Office. He was also joined by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.The move marks a win for tech companies like OpenAI and Google and venture firm Andreessen Horowitz that have lobbied to limit regulations they view as overly burdensome. AI companies have been opening offices close to the Capitol and launching campaigns through a super PAC with at least $100 million to spend on the midterm elections in 2026. Proponents of a federal rule have argued that different regulations across the country would hinder the U.S. in its effort to compete in the global AI race. A draft version of a proposed executive order surfaced last month, for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in the Republican spending bill but was cut out before Trump signed it in July.Trump's executive order also calls for the attorney general to establish an AI Litigation Task Force, \"whose sole responsibility shall be to challenge State AI laws.\"States that don't adhere to the rules could face funding restrictions. The order says that within 90 days of its signing, the secretary of commerce must specify the conditions under which states may be eligible to receive remaining funding under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment, or BEAD, program, a $42.5 billion effort to expand high-speed access in rural areas.

    "body": "Customers walk in the parking lot outside a Costco store on Dec. 2, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesCostco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street's quarterly expectations and posted year-over-year sales growth of 8.2% as the retailer attracted more digital sales and opened new locations.The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. On the company's earnings call, CFO Gary Millerchip said e-commerce gains were one of the strengths of the quarter. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Traffic on its website increased 24% year over year and traffic on its app shot up 48%. Same-day delivery service offered through Instacart in the U.S. and Uber and DoorDash internationally grew at a faster pace than overall digital sales.Costco had a positive start to the busiest weeks of the holiday season, too. Millerchip said Black Friday was a record-breaking day for the warehouse club's U.S. e-commerce business, generating over $250 million in non-food orders.Here's how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expectedRevenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expectedCostco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers' renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed.In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco's net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter.Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Sales in non-food were led by pharmacy, gold and jewelry, tires, small electrics and apparel, which grew by double-digits year-over-year, Millerchip said.In the first quarter, Costco opened eight new warehouse clubs, including a relocation in Canada, its third location in France, four new locations in the U.S. and two additional Canadian business centers, CEO Ron Vachris said on the company's earnings call. Business centers tend to sell bulk items intended for restaurants and other types of businesses. Those additional locations bring its total store count to 921 around the world.He said the company plans to continue to open 30 or more clubs per year in future years.Read moreAs a warehouse club, Costco relies on membership fees to boost its revenue and help keep the price of its items low. With higher tariffs, however, the retailer has dealt with rising costs. About a third of Costco's U.S. sales come from imported goods.Inflation \"remained relatively consistent with recent quarters,\" Millerchip said. He said in grocery, Costco saw higher inflation in commodities such as beef, seafood and coffee, but that was offset by lower inflation in eggs, cheese, butter and produce. In non-food, he said Costco saw low single-digit inflation for the third consecutive quarter, primarily driven by gold and imported goods. Millerchip said on the earnings call that Costco has looked for ways to reduce the impact of the duties, including sourcing more items from the U.S., consolidating buying across the globe to lower the cost of goods and swapping out categories or items to ones that aren't as exposed to steep tariff costs.Its private label, Kirkland Signature, is another way to offset tariff prices because it has more control over the supply chain, he said.In late November, Costco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs that it has paid so far this year and to block those import duties from being collected from the company as it waits for a Supreme Court ruling on the duties.As of the end of the quarter, Costco had 81.4 million total paid members, up 5.2% year over year and 145.9 million cardholders, up 5.1% year over year, Millerchip said. Its renewal rate in the U.S. and Canada was 92.2% and its worldwide rate was 89.7%, slipping a bit as more customers sign up for memberships online and those members renew at a slightly lower rate.As of Thursday's close, Costco's shares have declined nearly 4% so far this year. That trails the S&P 500's 17% gains during the same period. However, over the past five years, Costco's stock has jumped by 141%. The company's stock closed at $884.48 on Thursday, bringing its market value to $392.67 billion.",

Canberra's ban came into effect on Wednesday and targeted 10 major services, including Alphabet's YouTube, Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok, Reddit, Snapchat and Elon Musk's X. All targeted platforms had agreed to comply with the policy to varying degrees.Australia's Prime Minister's office, Attorney-General's Department and other social media platforms did not immediately reply to requests for comment.Under the law, the targeted platforms will have to take \"reasonable steps\" to prevent underage access, using age-verification methods such as inference from online activity, facial estimation via selfies, uploaded IDs, or linked bank details.Reddit's application to the courts seeks to either declare the law invalid or exclude the platform from the provisions of the law.In a statement to CNBC, Reddit said that while it agrees with the importance of protecting persons under 16, the law could isolate teens \"from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions).\"It also said in its application that the law \"burdens political communication,\" saying \"the political views of children inform the electoral choices of many current electors, including their parents and their teachers, as well as others interested in the views of those soon to reach the age of maturity.\"The platform also argued that it should not be subject to the law, saying it operates more as a forum for adults facilitating \"knowledge sharing\" between users than as a traditional social network, saying that it does not import contact lists or address books.\"Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become \"friends\" with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events,\" the platform said in its application.Reddit further said in its court filing that most content on its platform is accessible without an account, and pointed out a person under the age of 16 \"can be more easily protected from online harm if they have an account, being the very thing that is prohibited.\"\"That is because the account can be subject to settings that limit their access to particular kinds of content that may be harmful to them,\" it adds.Despite its objections, Reddit said that the challenge was not an attempt to avoid complying with the law, nor was it an effort to retain young users for business reasons. \"There are more targeted, privacy-preserving measures to protect young people online without resorting to blanket bans,\" the platform said.— CNBC's Dylan Butts and Stephen Desaulniers contributed to this story.

    "body": "Shoppers purchase groceries at the upscale LuLu Hypermarket located in the Lulu International Shopping Mall in Kerala, India, on May 25, 2022.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIndia's consumer inflation rose to 0.71% in November, accelerating from an all-time low of 0.25% in the prior month.The headline inflation number was in line with estimates of a 0.70% rise in the consumer price index, according to a Reuters poll of economists' median estimates.The rise in consumer inflation was due to rises in the price of vegetables, eggs, meat and fish, spices and fuel, the government said in its Friday release, adding that fuel and light prices rose 2.32% in November compared to 1.98% in October.Inflation also rose in both urban and rural areas. Low inflation environment, coupled with the weakening of some key economic indicators, led India's central bank to cut its policy rates by 25 basis points last week, allowing it to boost the country's already strong economic growth.The Reserve Bank of India expects consumer inflation at 2% for fiscal year ending March 2026, down from 2.6% forecast in October. It estimates CPI at 2.9% in the three months to March, rising to 4.0% in the quarter ending September 2026.\"The growth-inflation balance, especially the benign inflation outlook on both headline and core, continues to provide the policy space to support the growth momentum,\" the central bank said last week after its monetary policy meeting.Low inflation outlook has allowed the central bank \"to remain growth supportive,\" RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra said, adding that the central bank will \"continue to meet productive requirements of the economy in a proactive manner.\"Experts are divided on whether the 25-basis-point cut will be the last in this easing cycle or the RBI could ease further, given Malhotra's \"dovish\" signals.\"We believe weaker growth down the line, low for long inflation, and tight fiscal policy may require growth supportive monetary policy in 2026 as well,\" HSBC Research said in a report last week, post the monetary policy announcement.In August, the U.S. imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising total duties to as high as 50%, among the steepest imposed by Washington on its trading partners, with textiles, gems and jewelry, and marine products being hit the hardest.While exports to the U.S. account for just about 2% of India's GDP, a prolonged weakness in those labor-intensive sectors could lead to job losses and weigh on overall growth.To cushion the blow, New Delhi rationalized its goods and services tax regime, reducing levies on several items on Sept. 22, to spur domestic demand ahead of a month-long festive season. The tax cuts led to reduced prices for consumer goods, vehicles, and farm products, boosting consumption.While consumption picked up, exports to the U.S., one of India's major trading partners, fell for a second straight month in October, sliding 8.5% from a year earlier to $6.3 billion. Overall, outbound shipments in October also dropped 11.8% to $34.38 billion. With no deal between New Delhi and Washington in sight, in the last few days, and a drop in exports, the Indian rupee has been hitting record lows against the dollar, and was trading below the 90-rupee-per-dollar mark on Friday.

Nvidia shed 0.7%, Micron fell 0.9%, and CoreWeave was down 1.3% at 5:16 a.m. ET.  Broadcom, which reported a strong quarter on Thursday, was last seen down 5%.The share price of cloud computing and database software maker Oracle plummeted on Thursday, ending the session around 11% lighter after revenue earnings missed analyst expectations on Wednesday.watch nowIt dragged other AI-related names down with it despite a record-breaking rally elsewhere on Wall Street, suggesting investors are rotating out of tech into other parts of the market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.26% on Thursday, despite the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 hitting fresh records at the end of the session. Despite booming demand for Oracle's artificial intelligence infrastructure, it posted mixed results this week. Revenue came in at $16.06 billion, compared with $16.21 billion expected by analysts, according to data compiled by LSEG.It followed widespread speculation around the long-term health of the company, with investors cautious about its reliance on debt to execute its AI infrastructure build-out. The broader industry's circular dealmaking has also raised eyebrows. \"We think recent investor scrutiny on artificial intelligence's potential and circular GPU deals can be overly punitive to key AI suppliers like Oracle,\" said Morningstar Equity Analyst Luke Yang. \"Oracle remains a respectable cloud provider that enjoys strong switching costs across its database, application, and infrastructure lineup.\"That said, the firm reduced its fair value estimate for wide-moat Oracle to $286 per share, down from $340. Morningstar's moat rating refers to its assessment of a company's durable competitive advantage.\"We lowered our long-term earnings outlook as delivering Oracle's planned capacity on time now proved to be a harder task. However, we continue to view shares as undervalued,\" Yang added. ",

    "body": "Anutin Charnvirakul, Thailand's prime minister, speaks to members of the media on the sidelines of a seminar in Bangkok, Thailand, on Thursday, Nov. 20, 2025. Dario Pignatelli | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThailand's king has approved the dissolution of parliament, deepening political instability in the Southeast Asian nation ahead of an attempt by the U.S. to salvage a fragile ceasefire with Cambodia.In a royal decree published Friday, King Maha Vajiralongkorn endorsed a request by Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul to dissolve parliament after his minority government failed to reach an agreement with the majority opposition People's Party on proposed constitutional changes. Under Thai law, a general election must be held within 45 to 60 days of the decree.  The opposition had reportedly threatened to file a motion of no confidence after Anutin's government pushed to expand the powers of elected lawmakers under a planned constitution overhaul. In a post on Facebook late Thursday, Anutin said he would \"return power to the people.\" The political turmoil came as the Southeast Asian nation has been locked in a large-scale spat with Cambodia over long-disputed border claims. Tensions escalated this week as fierce clashes broke out at several locations along the border, which have reportedly killed at least 20 people and left dozens of civilians injured.  U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to speak with the leaders of the two countries soon, with Anutin saying the call has been scheduled for 9:20 p.m. Thailand time on Friday (8:20 a.m. Eastern). The biggest risk is that the breakdown of the ceasefire irritates the Trump administration as the truce had been one of the regional conflicts he claimed credit for helping to stabilize.Gareth LeatherSenior Asia economist, Capital EconomicsAnutin, who assumed office in September after Paetongtarn Shinawatra was dismissed by Thailand's Constitutional Court for an ethics violation related to the Cambodia dispute, has taken a tougher stance in the border clashes, a move that could fuel nationalist support for his conservative Bhumjaithai party ahead of the election. Dissolving parliament would not affect Thailand's military operations along the frontier, Anutin told local media outlets Friday.Southeast Asia's second-largest economy has grappled with tepid growth this year, expanding just 1.2% in the third quarter as the extended political turmoil, tariff uncertainty with the U.S. and border conflicts weighed on confidence.   Thailand's benchmark SET Index, ranked among the world's worst-performing equity gauges for 2025, has lost around 10% so far this year. The baht has been relatively resilient, strengthening over 7% this year against the greenback amid weakness in the dollar.Border disputesThe latest tensions followed the collapse of a fragile ceasefire brokered in July by Trump, who threatened to halt trade talks with the two countries unless they ended the fight. Thailand's top diplomat, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, told his U.S. counterpart Marco Rubio Friday that the country was committed to finding a peaceful resolution, but sustainable peace must be backed up by actions, according to Reuters.\"We see a risk of the conflict persisting into early 2026 if the Thai government judges that adopting a harder line could bolster its political standing ahead of the likely early-2026 elections,\" said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. A resident sits inside a bunker in Sisaket province, as Cambodia and Thailand each said the other had launched artillery attacks across contested border areas early on Sunday, hours after U.S. President Donald Trump said the leaders of both countries had agreed to work on a ceasefire, Thailand, on July 27, 2025.Athit Perawongmetha | ReutersThe renewed tensions increased the downside risks to Oxford Economics' 1.6% GDP growth forecast for Thailand in 2026, Hermann added, citing a potential loss of the Cambodian export market, labor-force shortages from an outflow of Cambodian workers and higher U.S. tariffs if trade talks stall.Before the conflict, Cambodia was Thailand's 11th-largest export market in 2024, according to data from the Ministry of Commerce, accounting for around 3% of total goods exports. Bilateral trade has collapsed this year, with border crossings shut. The total value of Thailand's exports to Cambodia plummeted 67% in October from a year earlier, Ministry of Commerce data showed.Gareth Leather, senior Asia economist at Capital Economics, however, noted that a third of those exports are petroleum, which could easily find an alternative market, but the key risk would be Trump reintroducing higher tariffs on Thailand for breaking the ceasefire he had helped brokered. \"The biggest risk is that the breakdown of the ceasefire irritates the Trump administration as the truce had been one of the regional conflicts he claimed credit for helping to stabilize,\" Leather added. Meanwhile, a prolonged conflict could risk removing between 500,000 and 1.5 million Cambodian migrant workers from Thailand's domestic labour force of around 40 million, Hermann estimates. ",

Brittany Hosea-small | ReutersBroadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock initially rose in extended trading before declining more than 4% during the earnings call.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimatedRevenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimatedBroadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG.CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies from the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units.On an earnings call with analysts, the company said it had acquired a fifth customer for its custom chips, and revealed that Anthropic was the previously unnamed customer that had placed a $10 billion order for Google's TPUs during the quarter. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on track to buy and deploy custom chips. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer that ordered $10 billion in custom chips and the next month announced a partnership with OpenAI to develop custom chips. Tan said that he didn't expect much revenue from that partnership in 2026. Anthropic is using the latest Google TPU called Ironwood, Tan said on Thursday's earnings call.Tan said Broadcom's other customers \"prefer to control their own destiny by continuing to drive their multi-year journey to create their own custom AI accelerators, or XPUs, as we call them.\"Broadcom has a $73 billion backlog for custom chips, switches, and other data center parts for AI over the next 18 months, Tan said. Total revenue grew 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales. That would equate to $8.2 billion in AI revenue in the fourth quarter.AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump is willing to seize more oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela, a White House official told CNBC on Thursday. The U.S. seized a tanker on Wednesday that had allegedly transported oil from Venezuela to Iran. The action comes as Trump escalates pressure on President Nicolás Maduro. The White House official told CNBC that the Trump administration is always looking to enforce the law. The oil market has been focused on Ukraine peace talks and so far is not indicating a risk of a major supply disruption. U.S. crude oil fell 86 cents, or 1.47%, to close at $57.60 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent settled at $61.28, down 93 cents, or 1.49%. Sources told Reuters earlier that U.S. is expected to target more ships transporting Venezuelan crude in the coming weeks. The Treasury Department updated its Venezuela sanctions list on Thursday to include more than a dozen additional people, companies and tankers. The tanker seized on Wednesday was a Very Large Crude Carrier, or VLCC, identified as the Skipper, Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at energy consulting firm Kpler, told CNBC. It was loaded covertly with 1.1 million barrels in mid-November and appeared on course for Cuba, Smith said.The tanker will be taken to a U.S. port and the oil will be seized, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday. \"However, there is a legal process for the seizure of that oil, and that legal process will be followed,\" Leavitt said. The tanker seizure comes amid a major U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean. The Trump administration has launched a series of deadly strikes in recent months on boats that it says were trafficking drugs to the U.S. Those strikes have been the subject of intense scrutiny in Congress over their legality. Venezuela is a founding member of OPEC and has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. It is exporting about 749,000 barrels per day this year, with at least half that oil going to China, according to data from Kpler.",

    "body": "Skipper port calls in 2025MarineTrafficThe big crude oil tanker that U.S. forces seized Wednesday off the coast of Venezuela since 2024 has  shown a \"clear pattern\" of spoofing its location to hide where it actually was, according to a leading energy consulting firm.And data suggests that the Guyana-flagged tanker identified as Skipper since 2022 has carried sanctioned oil from Iran and Venezuela.The oil industries of both nations are under U.S. sanctions, and Skipper has been under sanction by the Office of Foreign Assets Control since 2022.Matt Smith, head U.S. analyst at the consulting firm Kpler said Skipper was covertly loaded with 1.1 million barrels of oil in mid-November.Smith said the ship appeared to be headed for Cuba, though it has been stopped offshore Venezuela since it was loaded.In the past two years, there have been a total of more than 80 days in which there is evidence of Skipper engaging in so-called AIS spoofing to obscure its location, according to Kpler data. AIS, or automatic identification system, data, provides real-time information about a ship's location and includes the vessel's name, course, speed, classification, call sign and registration number, according to the U.S. Coast Guard's website.During the time that the Skipper's real location was hidden on the AIS network, there were multiple ship-to-ship transfers of cargo, according to Kpler data.The Skipper displayed \"a clear pattern of deceptive operations that went far beyond what its AIS transmissions claimed,\" said Dimitris Ampatzidis, Kpler's manager for risk and compliance.A satellite image shows the very large crude carrier (VLCC) Skipper, which British maritime risk management group Vanguard said was believed to have been seized on December 10, as well as another vessel, off Port Jose, Venezuela, November 18, 2025.Planet Labs | ReutersIn 2024, three AIS spoofings by the Skipper were recorded in Egypt, Iran, the Mediterranean Sea, Ghana and Nigeria, according to Kpler.\"Falisified positions were broadcast, particularly through extended AIS spoofing episodes,\" said Ampatzidis. \"The Skipper engaged in activities entirely inconsistent with its declared voyage, including sanctioned loadings in Iran and Venezuela.\"These behaviours form a coherent picture: a vessel intentionally engineered to operate outside transparency, using digital manipulation and covert logistics to mask sanctioned crude flows under the appearance of normal maritime traffic,\"  Ampatzidis said.Port call data from 2025 shows that Skipper transported oil out of the ports of Jose in Venezuela and Kharg Island in Iran, according to Kpler data.

And in 2023, Skipper visited the Port of Jose in Venezuela.The Skipper is owned by Marshall Islands-based Triton Navigation Corp., and the beneficial cargo owner, vessel manager and operator is Nigeria-based Thomarose Global Ventures Ltd., according to Kpler data.Triton Navigation has been on the OFAC sanctions list since November 2022.\"I believe that the purpose of seizing a sanctioned oil tanker is to make oil buyers and tanker owners operating in the shadow fleet wary of loading Venezuelan crude oil,  reducing the Maduro government's revenues and ultimately hastening his exit,\" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. \"With oil prices hovering below $60 per barrel, it would appear the administration is not too worried about losing Venezuelan oil supplies to the market; there is plenty of oil around,\" Lipow said.\"On the other hand, China would be unhappy losing access to deeply discounted oil supplies.\"The seizure came as President Donald Trump has ramped up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. Trump has said that Maduro's \"days are numbered.\"",

    "body": "Calvin McDonald, CEO of lululemon athletica inc., is interviewed by CNBC on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 29, 2023. Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersLululemon shares jumped more than 9% in pre-market trade on Friday, after the company announced its CEO Calvin McDonald will step down. McDonald's departure, effective Jan. 31, follows more than a year of underperformance at the athleisure company. The athleisure giant's New York-listed shares were last seen trading at around $204.50, a rise of 9.35%. Shares rose about 10% in extended trading on Thursday. Lululemon's board of directors is working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to identify its next CEO, it said in a news release. McDonald will stay on as a senior advisor through March 31. \"The timing is right for a change,\" McDonald said on a call with analysts, \"I've described being CEO of Lululemon as my dream job. It truly has lived up to every expectation and given me the opportunity of a lifetime.\"Lululemon's CFO Meghan Frank and Chief Commercial Officer André Maestrini will serve as interim co-CEOs during the search process. The company's board chair Marti Morfitt will also take on the expanded role of executive chair. In a statement, she said the company has a strong foundation in place but needs a new leader that can guide it through a transition.\"As we look to the future, the Board is focused on identifying a leader with a track record of driving companies through periods of growth and transformation to guide the company's next chapter of success,\" said Morfitt.The leadership change follows more than a year of underperformance at Lululemon and calls for change from its founder and its largest independent shareholder Chip Wilson. Two months ago, he took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal saying the company is \"in a nosedive\" and it needed to \"stop chasing Wall Street at the expense of customers.\" Lululemon announced McDonald's departure on the same day it posted fiscal third-quarter earnings and another round of weak guidance. Here's how the company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.59 vs. $2.25 expectedRevenue: $2.57 billion vs. $2.48 billion expectedThe company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Nov. 2 was $306.84 million, or $2.59 per share, compared with $351.87 million, or $2.87 per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $2.57 billion, up from $2.40 billion a year earlier. For Lululemon's current quarter, McDonald said the company is \"encouraged\" by its early performance so far this holiday season — though guidance fell short of Wall Street estimates. It anticipates sales will be between $3.50 billion and $3.59 billion, largely below expectations of $3.60 billion, according to LSEG. It's expecting earnings per share to be between $4.66 and $4.76, well short of expectations of $5.03, according to LSEG. In the previous two quarters, Lululemon cut its full-year guidance. On Thursday, more than a month into the final quarter of the year, it raised its full-year expectations. It now anticipates sales will be between $10.96 billion and $11.05 billion, in line with expectations at the low end, according to LSEG. It expects earnings per share to be between $12.92 and $13.02, roughly in line with estimates of about $13, according to LSEG. The company saw strong demand during its Thanksgiving weekend, which allowed it to clear through stale inventory at a discount, said McDonald. \"I also want to acknowledge we've seen trends slow a bit since Thanksgiving, which we've taken into account in our Q4 guidance,\" said McDonald. \"However, despite this, we expect revenue trends in the U.S. and Q4 to be modestly improved relative to Q3.\" Lululemon's business has been under pressure over the last year as it navigates the impact of tariffs, a shaky U.S. consumer and a product assortment that's failed to wow shoppers in the same way it once did. It's also facing steep competition in the athleisure space from upstarts like Vuori and Alo Yoga as well as a change in consumer preferences. Instead of yoga pants, these days many shoppers are reaching for denim. To drive growth and reach a wider audience, Lululemon has been working to expand its business internationally and offer shoppers a wider assortment. Instead of just workout gear, Lululemon has expanded into shoes, outerwear like coats and jackets and casual pants that can be worn at work. The company's overall business is growing, but the expansion has largely come from its international business and new store openings. Its largest market, the Americas, has been declining. During the quarter, revenue in the Americas decreased 2%, with comparable sales down 5%, while international sales jumped 33%. Comparable sales abroad increased 18%. Lululemon is also being hit by the end of the de minimis exemption, which allowed low value packages to enter the U.S. duty free, a bit more acutely than its peers. In September, it said it expects tariffs to hit its full year profits by $240 million and most of those costs will come from the de minimis exemption ending. Following progress with vendor negotiations and other mitigation efforts, it now expects tariffs to reduce its profits by $210 million.

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk, center, speaks on a media tour of the Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the US.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, Oracle told investors that it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia. That's not the only way the software giant plans to supply robust computing power to meet soaring demand. It's also ratcheting up leases.As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years, the company disclosed in a quarterly filing on Thursday. That's up 148% from the end of August.Oracle had $10 billion in cloud capacity arrangements at the end of the quarter, according to the filing. Over the past decade, Oracle has diversified into cloud infrastructure, where it now goes up against Amazon, Microsoft and Google to rent out access to servers, storage and Nvidia graphics chips for running artificial intelligence models. OpenAI has become a major Oracle cloud customer, having announced a commitment worth over $300 billion in September. Microsoft, a major OpenAI investor that for years served as the startup's sole cloud provider, has also ramped up leases to augment its in-house data center footprint. Microsoft has struck deals with so-called neoclouds CoreWeave and Lambda. Oracle worked with startup Crusoe to enable the first phase of OpenAI's Stargate data center site in Abilene, Texas.Investors are questioning how Oracle will pay for its AI data center build-outs, RBC analyst Rishi Jaluria, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock, told CNBC earlier this week.In September Oracle raised $18 billion in new debt. By the end of November, the company owed over $124 billion when including operating lease liabilities, according to the filing, up from about $89 billion a year earlier. \"In terms of funding our growth, there are a variety of sources available to us throughout our debt structure in public bond, bank and private debt markets,\" Doug Kehring, Oracle's principal financial officer, told analysts on Wednesday's conference call.Some customers can also bring their own chips, which could lower Oracle's costs, said Clay Magouyrk, one of the company's two recently appointed CEOs.In its earnings release on Wednesday, Oracle reported weaker-than-expected revenue despite booming demand for its AI infrastructure. The stock ended the day down almost 11% on Thursday.WATCH: Trade Tracker: Malcolm Ethridge sells out of Oraclewatch now",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump returns to the White House on Marine One in Washington, D.C., on November 22, 2025.Allison Robbert | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesA judge in Georgia on Wednesday dismissed the historic racketeering case brought against President Donald Trump over his efforts to overturn his loss in the state's 2020 election.The ruling by Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who ordered the case \"dismissed in its entirety,\" draws to a close the final criminal case against Trump that remained unresolved after he won back the White House in 2024.McAfee's ruling came shortly after state prosecutor Peter Skandalakis moved to drop the case against Trump and his remaining co-defendants \"to serve the interests of justice and promote judicial finality.\"\"In my professional judgment, the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years,\" Skandalakis wrote in a court filing.Fulton County Sheriff's OfficeTrump celebrated the ruling later Wednesday, writing in a lengthy Truth Social post that \"LAW and JUSTICE have prevailed.\"\"This case should never have been brought,\" Steve Sadow, Trump's lead attorney in the case, said in a statement. \"A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare.\"The case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis initially charged Trump with 13 criminal counts, including the serious charge of violating Georgia's powerful anti-racketeering law.The indictment, returned by a grand jury in August 2023, alleged that Trump and numerous co-defendants — including his former lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows — illegally tried to reverse Joe Biden's victory in the state's 2020 presidential contest.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis looks on during a hearing in the case of the State of Georgia v. Donald John Trump at the Fulton County Courthouse on March 1, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia.Alex Slitz-Pool | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose efforts included pressuring Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find Trump enough votes for him to overcome his margin of loss to Biden.The case was once seen as one of the biggest threats to the GOP leader, who was already grappling with a torrent of other criminal indictments and civil lawsuits. At least four of Trump's 18 co-defendants pleaded guilty within two months of the indictment being filed.It also produced one of the most striking images in recent U.S. political history: a mugshot of the president, who was forced to travel to Fulton County jail to be booked on the state charges.But the case ran into major problems long before Trump's reelection in 2024 effectively put it on ice.In September 2024, McAfee tossed out two of the criminal counts against Trump and some of his co-defendants, though he kept the top charges intact.By that time, Willis was facing intensifying scrutiny over her romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, one of the top prosecutors in the criminal case. She defended herself in dramatic courtroom testimony against the allegations of impropriety, but was disqualified from the case in December 2024.The Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear Willis' appeal. The case was eventually handed to Skandalakis on Nov. 14, less than two weeks before he asked McAfee to dismiss it.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "Drug pricing has emerged as a key topic to watch for pharmaceutical companies and investors in 2025. As President Donald Trump pushes for lower medicine prices for Americans, the sector is facing additional pricing pressure from a Biden-era law called the Inflation Reduction Act.The IRA, voted into law in 2022, allows the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to negotiate prices for a number of drugs each year for patients in Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. It's now making waves also across the Atlantic. While these changes are taking place firmly in the U.S., pharmaceutical companies across the globe are finding themselves increasingly exposed to the American market. A number of European companies have announced sizeable U.S. investments to placate Trump and his aggressive tariff agenda, while AstraZeneca is moving toward another direct listing on the NYSE to tap into the deeper pockets of U.S. capital markets. Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk has cited a failure to deal with changes in the U.S. market as part of the reason for recent leadership changes.Late Tuesday, the CMS announced newly negotiated prices for 15 blockbuster drugs from 2027, including Novo Nordisk's mega bestseller Ozempic which will see a 71% discount to its list price.Among other European pharma giants, AstraZeneca's cancer drug Calquence will face a 40% discount, while GSK's lung disease medicines Trelegy and Breo with 73% and 83% discount, respectively. Overall, discounts ranged between 38% and 85%, with estimated savings of about $8.5 billion, 36% lower than recent annual spending.watch now\"Whether through the Inflation Reduction Act or President Trump's Most Favored Nation policy, this is what serious, fair, and disciplined negotiation looks like,\" said CMS Deputy Administrator Chris Klomp in a statement. A GSK spokesperson said they were pleased with the agreement. \"We strongly believe in the value of both Trelegy and Breo and remain committed to working with CMS.\"Novo, on the other hand, was critical. \"We continue to have serious concerns about the Inflation Reduction Act's impact on patients and remain opposed to government price setting,\" a spokesperson told CNBC in emailed comments. \"We have seen that government price setting has not translated to lower out-of-pocket costs for patients and can lead to a loss of coverage for medications and higher insurance premiums,\" they added.A key marketThe U.S. is a key market for most large-cap pharma companies, mostly due to the significantly higher prices for branded medicines. In the first nine months of 2025, 56% of Novo's total sales originated in the U.S. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca logged 42% of product sales in the U.S. and GSK some 52%, over the same period.Prescription drug prices are about three times higher in the U.S. compared to other wealthy countries, a 2024 report by RAND found.\"The [IRA price] cuts were a little higher than last year, which I think people were expecting,\" Barclays analyst Emily Field told CNBC. \"It doesn't seem like there was any surprises at all,\" she added. Muted shares also indicated that the outcome of the negotiations was largely expected. AstraZeneca and GSK rose less than 1% each in afternoon trading. Novo shares however, ended the day 4.7% higher. Semaglutide, sold as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, will from 2027 be priced at $274 for Medicare patients, down from a previous list price of $959. That said, Medicare plans already get large discounts on companies' list prices, but those rates aren't typically disclosed. CMS is due to publish its list of 15 drugs selected for negotiations for 2028 by February 1, 2026.A Trump priorityThe IRA price negotiations are, however, not the main concern for companies, Field said, noting how it's becoming a better-understood and predictable process. \"What people are much more worried about is further directions that MFN could go… if they decide to do something different,\" she said. Trump has made it a priority to rein in U.S. drug costs and in May, signed an executive order to implement so-called Most Favored Nation pricing, meaning U.S. prices would be tied to lower ones paid abroad. Lower prices in the U.S. could have a dramatic effect on companies' top and bottom lines, but companies are finding ways to mitigate the impact by making deals with the Trump administration to voluntarily lower certain prices, as well as pledge investments in U.S. manufacturing to avoid tariffs. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNovo, AstraZeneca and GSK shares year to date.Earlier this month, Trump announced deals with Novo and rival Eli Lilly to slash prices of weight loss drugs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries in 2026, as well as offering them directly to consumers at a discount through the TrumpRx.gov website. Under the agreement, starting doses of Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's Zepbound will be $350 per month and trend down to $245 per month over a two years.While reduced pricing will hit sales, volume gains from opening up broad access for obesity drugs could offset that headwind, BMO analysts noted. Last week, Novo also announced it is lowering prices of Ozempic and Wegovy to $349 per month from $499 for patients paying out-of-pocket, following pressure from Trump. Other companies including AstraZeneca and U.S.-based Pfizer have also announced deals with the Trump administration to cut drug prices. ",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump and his administration will begin imposing new limits for federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.Undergraduate borrowers will have the same current limit of up to $7,500 a year for dependent students, depending on their class year. But graduate and professional students will see new limits of up to $20,500 per year ($100,000 total) for graduate studies and $50,000 a year ($200,000 total) for professional programs. Graduate PLUS loans, which previously allowed students to borrow up to their total cost of attendance, will be eliminated.According to the proposed regulation, a professional degree \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"The Department of Education has named 11 degree fields that meet the requirements to be considered professional, and thus eligible for higher loan limits under the new rules: Pharmacy (Pharm. D.)Dentistry doctorate (D.D.S. or D.M.S.)Veterinary medicine (D.V.M.)Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.)Law (L.L.B. or J.D.)Medicine (M.D.)Optometry (O.D.)Osteopathic medicine (D.O.)Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.)Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.)Clinical psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.)The addition of clinical psychology came out of the department's recent negotiated rulemaking session where stakeholders debated the loan limit rule and how it should be applied.The department also said programs in at least 44 other fields could qualify if they meet certain criteria, including giving students a \"level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree,\" generally resulting in a doctoral level degree and requiring professional licensure to begin practice. Potentially eligible programs include a number of other pharmacy degrees, clinical counseling and theological studies. Institutions are responsible for determining whether a program meets the requirements to be considered a professional degree or not, says Sarah Austin, a policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.Professional organizations respondSome professional organizations have expressed concern over the list of degrees eligible for the $200,000 aggregate federal loan limit and the Department of Education's definition of professional programs.\"Despite broad recognition of the complexity, rigor, and necessity of post-baccalaureate nursing education, the Department's proposal defines professional programs so narrowly that nursing, the nation's largest healthcare profession, remains excluded,\" The American Association of Colleges of Nursing said in a press release on Nov. 7. \"Should this proposal be finalized, the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.\"\"Declassifying the [Master of Social Work] and [Doctorate of Social Work] degrees will reduce access to affordable social work education, thereby increasing reliance on high-interest private loans,\" the National Association of Social Workers' Florida chapter said in a press release on Nov. 20.In a fact sheet released on Nov. 24, the Department of Education said, \"The definition of a 'professional degree' is an internal definition used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.\"The intention behind the loan limits is to discourage borrowers from taking on more debt than they will be able to handle and to encourage institutions to rein in tuition costs, the department said. The loan limit regulation is not final, however. The Department of Education will publish the regulation in its current form in the federal register in the coming months where the public will have the opportunity to give feedback before it becomes final.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "QINGDAO, CHINA - FEBRUARY 05 2025: Workers assemble cars at a car plant of SAIC-GM-Wuling in Qingdao city in east China's Shandong province Wednesday, Feb. 05, 2025. ZHANG JINGANG | Future Publishing | Getty Images Chinese industrial firms saw their earnings take a hit in October as trade tensions with the U.S. flared that month while broader growth momentum in the economy faltered. Industrial profits dropped 5.5% from a year earlier in October, the biggest decline since June, the National Bureau of Statistics data showed, reversing the double-digit growth seen in August and September. For the first ten months of the year, profits at major industrial firms grew 1.9% from a year ago, the official data showed, decelerating from a 3.2% rise in the January to September period.   Trade tensions between China and the U.S. had escalated that month over export controls, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening additional 100% tariffs on imports from China, before the two economic superpowers reached a deal in South Korea at the month's end. The mining sector saw profits plunge 27.8% in the January to October period, while profits for the manufacturing and utilities sectors, comprising suppliers for electricity, heat, fuel and water, rose 7.7% and 9.5% respectively.    Profits for carmakers gained 4.4% in the first ten months of the year, compared to a 3.4% climb in the first nine months. Profits at state-owned enterprises were flat, compared with gains of 3.5% for industrial firms with foreign investment, including those with investment from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and 1.9% for private companies. Yu Weining, chief statistician at NBS, attributed the drop in October to high-base effects from last year and rapid expansion in corporate spending. China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in October, with the official manufacturing purchasing managers' index slumping to a six-month low of 49.0. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates growth, while one below that suggests contraction.Tepid consumer demandwatch nowChina's consumer prices unexpectedly returned to growth in October, rising 0.2% from a year ago, after staying in negative territory for most of the year. Core inflation, stripping out food and energy prices, jumped 1.2%, the highest since February 2024. The reality, however, was less rosy than the core inflation reading suggested, according to Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura Bank, who estimated that about a quarter of the 1.2% core inflation readings had \"almost nothing to do with local consumption\" but were mainly caused by surging gold prices.  The \"underestimated decline of rents also contributed to the overstatement of headline inflation data,\" Lu said, suggesting that the country has been mired in a \"moderate recession\" since late 2022.    \"It will take more time for China to truly escape the deflationary conundrum it currently faces, especially as economic growth has stumbled since mid-2025,\" Lu added. Growth faltersThe economy has slowed significantly, expanding just 4.8% in the third quarter, and recent indicators suggest it has lost further momentum at the start of the fourth quarter.  Retail sales grew 2.9% in October, slowing for a fifth straight month and marking the weakest growth in over a year. Fixed-asset investment shrank 1.7% for the first ten months of the year, unseen since 2020 during the pandemic. Industrial output also expanded by a smaller-than-expected 4.9%. Meanwhile, the urban unemployment rate remained elevated at 5.1% in October. Chinese policymakers have signaled a shift towards boosting consumption over the next five years, but have yet to roll out new meaningful stimulus. Economists widely expect Beijing to hold off large-scale stimulus as the economy is on track to hit its growth target of \"around 5%\" this year. \"Policymakers don't want to miss or over-achieve the target,\" said Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, expecting China's economy may continue to grow 5% in 2026 on robust export growth.  That said, \"deflationary pressure\" will likely continue to weigh on the economy as strong external demand reduces the urgency for domestic stimulus, Hu added. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Enrique Lores, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP Inc. speaks at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. Ann Wang | ReutersPC and printer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday it'll lower its headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 people, representing a cut of up to 10%. HP also issued a lower-than-expected earnings projection for the new fiscal year. Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.Here's how HP did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: 93 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expectedRevenue: $14.64 billion vs. $14.48 billion expectedHP's revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income of $795 million, or 84 cents per share, was up from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.For the first quarter of HP's fiscal 2026, the company called for 73 cents to 81 cents in adjusted net earnings per share, while the LSEG consensus was 79 cents. For all of fiscal 2026, HP sees $2.90 to $3.20 in adjusted per share, below the LSEG consensus of $3.33.\"HP's outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. trade-related regulations in place, and associated mitigations,\" the company said in the statement.The company's personal systems unit that includes desktop and laptop computers contributed $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above StreetAccount's $10.15 billion consensus.HP said it expects to complete the headcount reduction by the end of fiscal 2028. The company said the restructuring will result in savings of at least $1 billion in annualized gross run rate by the end of fiscal 2028. HP said it expects to incur about $650 million in charges, of which $250 million will happen in fiscal 2026.\"As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said on a conference call with analysts. Corporate executives across industries are hoping to draw on generative artificial intelligence products to speed up software developers and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to a rise in the cost per gigabyte of RAM this year. HP, whose headcount stood at 58,000 as of December, announced a similarly sized round of layoffs in 2022. Several other technology companies have announced layoffs in recent months as U.S. consumers face higher prices and interest rates.\"Memory costs are currently 15 to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,\" Lores said.The company does expect to benefit after Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows 10 operating system in October, which will lead people to buy new machines, Lores said. Around 60% of HP's installed base has moved to Windows 11, he said.HP's printing business did $4.3 billion in revenue, down 4%. The pricing environment is competitive, and customers are putting off purchases of new models, said Karen Parkhill, the company's finance chief.As of Tuesday's close, HP shares were down 25% for the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 15% in the same period.WATCH: HP CEO: Tariffs are mostly nonmaterialwatch now",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyMoviegoers have plenty to feast on at the box office this Thanksgiving.Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" snared $10.2 million in Tuesday previews, the second-highest haul for a Disney Animation Studios film ever, behind only last year's \"Moana 2,\" which took in $13.8 million. It's the eighth-highest preview for an animated movie of all time. Box office analysts expect the film to generate between $135 million and $150 million during the five-day Thanksgiving period. Although that will be significantly below the $225.4 million that \"Moana 2\" took in during the same period last year, it is a welcome jolt for a box office that has struggled in the last few months to drum up ticket sales.Also in the mix is Universal's \"Wicked: For Good,\" which tallied $147 million during its opening last week and is expected to bring in between $80 million and $100 million over the five-day holiday. That figure could be higher considering last year's \"Wicked\" tallied $118 million during the Thanksgiving frame after debuting to $112.5 million during the same pre-Thanksgiving weekend.\"The Thanksgiving holiday frame is one of the most important moviegoing periods of the year and is off to a running start with the overperforming 'Wicked: For Good' powering an impressive five days of box office revenue for movie theaters in the $300 million range,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Zootopia 2' has a perfect release date and built-in brand recognition and a revenue enhancing PG rating so that's a huge plus.\"Thanksgiving this year is facing tough comparisons after the 2024 holiday saw \"Moana 2,\" \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiater II\" fuel a record-breaking $424.9 million domestic five-day score. Previously, the highest-grossing Thanksgiving haul was $315.6 million, which was captured in 2018, according to data from Comscore.\"While that record is in no jeopardy of being broken, this year will nonetheless prove to be a solid Thanksgiving holiday corridor for movie theaters that will likely rank in the top five performing frames historically of all time,\" said Dergarabedian.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

This year, Workday has announced the launch of several AI agents and expanded its offerings through startup acquisitions. Earlier this month, Workday completed the $1.1 billion purchase of AI and learning software company Sana.Despite those moves, Workday's third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress Wall Street. The company called for $8.83 billion in subscription revenue for the fiscal year that will end in January 2026, implying 14.4% growth, but the figure was up just $13 million from the company's guidance in August. The new number includes contributions from Sana and a contract with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Workday finance chief Zane Rowe told analysts on a conference call.\"Investors were likely looking for more of a beat-and-raise quarter,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Matt VanVliet and Mason Marion wrote in a note to clients. They have the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday stock. The new number, they wrote, \"borders on a slight guide down.\" The analysts held their 12-month price target on Workday stock at $280.Stifel, with a hold rating on the stock, lowered its Workday target to $235 from $255.\"It does not appear that the underlying momentum of the business is showing any signs of stabilization,\" Stifel's Brad Reback and Robert Galvin wrote in a note. Reback and Galvin said Workday implied that growth from its 12-month subscription revenue backlog will continue to slow when removing impact from acquisitions. They expect the trend to continue even as customers sign up for Workday's AI products, they wrote.The outcome was \"like turkey without the gravy,\" Evercore analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, wrote in the title of their note. Analysts at RBC, which also has the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday shares, lowered their price target to $320 from $340. Despite the mixed guidance, they wrote in a note to clients, results for the fiscal third quarter did exceed consensus. Plus, AI products contributed over 1.5 percentage points of annualized revenue growth, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said on Tuesday's conference call.

Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin during a meeting on development of 'new regions', annexed from Ukraine, at the Kremlin, June 30, 2025, in Moscow, Russia.Contributor | Getty ImagesAll eyes are now on Russia's response to a fledgling peace plan to end the war in Ukraine after Kyiv appeared willing to move forward with a U.S.-backed framework.U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to travel to Moscow next week to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters Wednesday that \"the content [of the U.S. plan] will be discussed,\" at the meeting, and claimed Russian officials had not discussed a U.S.-backed plan when talks were held with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. \"We, the Russian side, have not yet discussed any documents with anyone specifically ... We've agreed to a meeting with Mr. Witkoff. I hope he won't be alone. Other representatives of the U.S. team working on the Ukrainian dossier will be there,\" he said in comments translated by NBC News and reported by state news agency TASS. Ushakov said Russia had not yet officially received the U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine but had seen an unofficial version. Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" in comments reported by Reuters on Wednesday.Earlier today, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentatively Multiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.Reports from ABC News and CBS News both cited an unnamed U.S. official who said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while noting that some points still need to be ironed out. It was not clear if the same U.S. official was quoted in both stories.watch nowUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"Flurry of talksTrump's post came several days after U.S. officials met with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva last weekend for talks that resulted in significant revisions to Washington's initially proffered 28-point peace plan.That plan — which was widely seen as being highly favorable to Russia, the invading force — \"has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides,\" Trump acknowledged in Tuesday's post.\"Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,\" Ukraine National Security Secretary Rustem Umerov said in an X post.It's far from certain the Russia will assent to the revised peace plan, which has reportedly been narrowed to 19 points.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said any agreement must reflect the understandings reached by Trump and Putin during their August summit in Alaska.On Tuesday, officials from Kyiv and Moscow reportedly met with Driscoll in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.The Kremlin was tight-lipped about the discussions taking place there, with Dmitry Peskov telling reporters Tuesday that \"we still have nothing to say\" and that the Kremlin was \"monitoring media reports.\"Read more\"We understand that negotiations between the Americans and the Ukrainians are ongoing. We understand that some adjustments are being made to the text that was published; we understand that the text that we unofficially received earlier has already undergone changes, but at some point, the time will probably come when we will also establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information,\" Peskov said. \"For now, we have no new information.\"The initial, 28-point plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial terms, such as Ukraine making territorial concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region that is partially occupied by Russian forces.The original deal also demanded that Ukraine reduce its army by 50%, along with other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"Trump had pushed Ukraine to accept that deal by the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 27, prompting Zelenskyy to declare on Friday that Ukraine faced the difficult choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.That deadline appears to have been scrapped. It was unclear how many of the original deal's points remained in the latest version of a potential peace agreement.",

Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWorkday shares slid more than 5% in extended trading Tuesday after the finance and human resources software maker issued quarterly margin guidance that came in below Wall Street projections.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.32 adjusted vs. $2.18 expectedRevenue: $2.43 billion vs. $2.42 billion expectedThe company forecast a fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin of at least 28.5% and $2.355 billion in subscription revenue, according to a statement. The StreetAccount consensus was a 28.7% margin and $2.35 billion in subscription revenue.Workday's revenue grew about 13% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Net income of $252 million, or 94 cents per share, was up from $193 million, or 72 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.Subscription revenue in the third quarter totaled $2.24 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 28.5%. Analysts polled by StreetAccount had anticipated $2.24 billion in subscription revenue and a 28.1% margin.During the fiscal third quarter, Workday announced artificial intelligence agents for analyzing employee performance testing financial health, and the company revealed plans to buy AI and learning software startup Sana for $1.1 billion. Also, activist investor Elliott Management said it had built a Workday stake worth over $2 billion.Workday encountered some turbulence with higher education institutions that rely on U.S. funding, CEO Carl Eschenbach said on a conference call with analysts. Workday has seen its stock decline this year as pundits discuss the risk of generative AI tools threatening the growth prospects for cloud software incumbents. Company shares have fallen 9% so far in 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite index has gained 19%.\"The narrative we've been hearing in the last couple of quarters is changing, and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise already providing value and are deeply trusted by our customers,\" Eschenbach said. Despite rounds of layoffs that companies have been carrying out in recent months, the headcount in Workday's customer base is up year over year, he said.WATCH: Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach: There's a narrative that AI is eating into software, that is falsewatch now",

    "body": "At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. \"There's some trickery happening,\" says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. \"Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago.\"That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. \"The consumer has to be proactive,\" says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. \"Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale.\" Track price historiesIdeally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, \"it's definitely not too late\" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. \"Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark,\" says Woroch. Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. \"Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price,\" Woroch says. \"Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need.\"Beware of other Black Friday pitfallsAlthough Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. \"You may be able to find good deals on mattresses,\" says Lupo. \"But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday.\"And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls \"spaving\" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive \"bundle\" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. \"Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free,\" Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, \"you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

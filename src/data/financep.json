Alexander Drago | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and champagne after French President Emmanuel Macron was reported to be unwilling to join his \"Board of Peace\" on Gaza.When asked for a response by a reporter in Miami about Macron's stance, Trump dismissed the French leader's influence and said he would use trade penalties as leverage.\"Well, nobody wants him because he's going to be out of office very soon,\" Trump said. \"So you know, that's all right. What I'll do is, if they feel like [being] hostile, I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join. But he doesn't have to join.\"Macron's five-year presidential term is due to end in May 2027, and under French law, he cannot run again for a third term.The Board of Peace is a global body endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November last year, established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire.Invites to various world leaders to be on the board have been sent, including to Russian President Vladimir Putin, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Trump also reiterated his plans to control Greenland, downplaying the likelihood of resistance from Europe.\"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" he said. \"We have to have it ...They can't protect it.\"Referring to Denmark's historical claims over Greenland, Trump said the Danish leaders were \"very good people,\" but argued that a centuries-old presence did not confer ownership.\"[Just] because the boat went there 500 years ago and then left, that doesn't give you title to property.\" It was not clear what \"boat\" Trump was referring to. Denmark has held colonies in Greenland since 1721, and the island was made part of Denmark in 1953. In 2009, Denmark granted Greenland self-government, giving the territory control over all its affairs except foreign policy and defence.Trump on Friday threatened to take control of Greenland \"whether they [European lawmakers] like it or not,\" claiming that it was needed for \"world security.\"On Saturday, he also warned that the U.S. would impose tariffs of up to 25% on eight European countries, including the UK, until the U.S. controls Greenland. Trump has not ruled out the use of military force to seize the territory, though Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly said on Jan. 6 that Trump would prefer to buy Greenland.In response, European states are weighing retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has taken aim at another NATO ally on the eve of his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, this time lambasting the U.K.The so-called \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and U.K., and President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was left looking bruised on Tuesday after Trump posted a tirade against London's decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.The islands include Diego Garcia where a joint U.K.-U.S. military base is stationed. The deal, which was agreed in May 2025, saw the British government agree to hand sovereignty to Mauritius, but to lease the military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year. The White House voiced its support for the deal last year but, on Tuesday, Trump said it was \"an act of great stupidity.\"\"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social early Tuesday.The president said China and Russia would view this act as one of \"total weakness,\" and that they were international powers that only recognized strength. \"The U.K. giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"He added that Denmark and its European allies, who oppose Trump's takeover bid, had to \"do the right thing.\"Rift among alliesTrump's comments come amid a growing rift between the U.S. and its European NATO allies, including the U.K. and France, over the president's incessant pursuit of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.Greenland, Denmark, and European leaders have said the island is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out using military force to seize the territory if necessary. He has also threatened eight European NATO allies with escalating tariffs if they continue to block his takeover bid.The U.K. is the second NATO ally to be lambasted by Trump in as many days, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly turned down a seat on Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.The U.K. has tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and Europe, calling for cool heads and further discussions over Greenland.In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,\" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he added.Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to \"buy\" Greenland.Starmer and Trump have always seemed to enjoy a warm and respectful relationship, despite their political differences.The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.",

    "body": "Stellantis North America COO and Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during the Stellantis press conference at the Automobility LA 2024 car show at Los Angeles Convention Center in Los Angeles, California, November 21, 2024. Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

    "body": "Bird's-eye view of central Tokyo including Tokyo Tower at sunrise hours.Vladimir Zakharov | Moment | Getty ImagesJapan's 40-year government bond yield hit a record high on Tuesday amid a broad selloff in government bonds, as investors worried that proposed cuts to the food sales tax could worsen the country's fiscal position.The long-dated yield rose more than 5 basis points to 4%, the highest level since the 40-year maturity was introduced.Yields on shorter maturities climbed sharply as well. The 10-year Japan government bond yield rose by over 6 basis points to 2.3%, the highest level since 1999, while yields on the 20-year tenor jumped by around 9 basis points to 3.35%.The selloff came a day after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she plans to dissolve parliament on Friday and call a snap election on Feb. 8, setting the stage for a campaign that is expected to focus heavily on economic policy.\"Ultra‑long JGB yields are being pushed higher not only by the structural supply–demand imbalance but also by a fresh re-pricing of term and risk premium as markets absorb a more expansionary fiscal stance and persistent inflation,\" said Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management. That repricing has revived a familiar market pattern, he added. \"This has revived the classic 'Takaichi trade' dynamic of stronger Nikkei, weaker JGBs and yen,\" Loo told CNBC.It was a repeat of the volatility seen in October last year, when Japanese markets reacted to comments and policy signals from Takaichi that pointed toward looser fiscal policy, which later stabilized, he added.He added that the current move has strong technical and sentiment echoes rather than signaling structural distress.Loo said the yield curve is likely to remain steep through the first half of this year before stabilizing as bond issuance patterns adjust and domestic banks return as buyers.Similarly, analysts at Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank said markets are increasingly pricing in a durable shift toward aggressive fiscal policy under Takaichi. They said that stance, which aims to move away from what Takaichi described as the \"shackles of excessive austerity,\" could translate into larger deficits.",

Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during the Hoover Institution's George P. Shultz Memorial Lecture Series in Stanford, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 1, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday.Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans.For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual.But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences.Powell, in an extraordinary public statement on Jan. 11, revealed that he was under criminal investigation, and called its purported grounds a pretext for its real reason: the refusal of the Fed's Board of Governors, which includes him and Cook as members, to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump demanded last year. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

    "body": "BEIJING, CHINA - JANUARY 06: The People's Bank of China (PBOC) building is seen on January 6, 2025 in Beijing, China. Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's central bank kept its loan prime rates unchanged on Tuesday as the authorities focus on targeted support for specific sectors to bolster a slowing economy instead of broad policy easing.  The People's Bank of China held its 1-year and 5-year loan prime rates at 3% and 3.5%, respectively, keeping them unchanged for an eighth straight month.  The 1-year rate influences most new and outstanding loans, while the 5-year benchmark affects mortgages.The decision came as the world's second largest economy lost its momentum in the final quarter of 2025, growing 4.5% year on year, the slowest pace since the reopening from stringent Covid curbs in late 2022. The nominal GDP, a barometer to gauge corporate profitability and household salaries, has remained below 4% for the third consecutive year, coming in at 3.8% in the fourth quarter, according to economists at Barclays. That marked the lowest level in 50 years, excluding 2020 when the economy was upended by the pandemic outbreak.  The GDP deflator — a metric that highlights changes in the prices of goods and services — has stayed negative for the 11th quarter, the bank said, expecting the deflation to persist throughout this year. Retail sales growth fell to a 3-year low of 0.9% in December, as household confidence continued to be battered by a years-long housing slump, a bleak job market and entrenched deflation.  In a press conference Tuesday, China's state planner said policymakers will continue to implement \"more proactive fiscal policies\" and \"moderately loose monetary policy\" with the goal of supporting a recovery in prices.   \"Beijing has become increasingly concerned about one of the worst domestic demand slowdowns in this century,\" a team of economists at Nomura said in a note Monday. Last week, the central bank lowered the interest rates on its structural monetary policy tools by 0.25 percentage point, reducing the 1-year rate on relending facilities for agricultural and small businesses to 1.25%, effective Monday. Rather than cutting policy rates directly, it reduced the interest charged on central bank's funding to financial institutions, reducing banks' borrowing costs and encouraging them to extend credit to targeted sectors at more favorable rates.The PBOC also plans to set up a dedicated relending program for private firms and increase quotas for tech innovation loans, support for small and medium-sized private companies. In addition, the minimum down-payment ratio for commercial property mortgages will be lowered to 30% to help reduce inventory in the real estate market. New bank loans shrank to a 7-year low of 16.27 trillion yuan ($2.33 trillion) in 2025, according to official data compiled by financial service provider Wind Information, underscoring sluggish borrowing demand and piling pressure on the government to provide more stimulus. More easing ahead? Deputy Governor Zou Lan told reporters last week that was \"still room\" to reduce both the reserve requirement ratio and policy rates this year, while acknowledging that conditions have improved for further monetary easing. Banks' net interest margins, or NIMs, have showed signs of stabilizing, Zou said, after years of contraction weighed on lenders' profitability. The NIM has remained at 1.42% for a second straight quarter through September, but was 11 basis points lower compared to a year earlier. The yuan's recent appreciation has also helped create space for policy rate cuts, Zou noted. Chinese offshore yuan has gained over 1% against the dollar in the past month, breaching the key threshold of 7 per dollar last month for the first time since May 2023. The offshore yuan was little changed on Monday, trading at 6.9571 against the greenback, according to LSEG, while the onshore yuan was 6.9612 per dollar. China's 10-year government bond yield dipped modestly to 1.834%.  Policymakers have attributed the recent appreciation in yuan to a weakening dollar and easing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, rather than a shift in monetary policy. The PBOC remains committed to prevent \"overshooting\" and keeping the yuan in a \"reasonable and balanced equilibrium,\" Zou said.  Economists at Goldman Sachs expected the PBOC to cut the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points and the policy rate by 10 basis points in the first quarter.China's manufacturing and exports have held up well as businesses navigated growing trade barriers around the world, with industrial production rising 5.9% for the entire year of 2025 and exports climbing 5.5%, taking its trade surplus to record of early $1.2 trillion.      Fixed-asset investment in urban areas declined 3.8% last year, the first annual decline in decades, dragged by the deepening slump in property investment and Beijing's campaign to curb local debt risks and rein in excess capacity in some industries.  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Shipping containers and gantry cranes beyond a fishing boat near the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai, China, on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's stock market rally is drawing closer regulatory scrutiny after trading activity surged to unprecedented levels, prompting officials to move to curb leverage even as many investors argue the bull run is still in its early stages.Daily turnover across the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing stock exchanges climbed to successive record highs Monday through Wednesday last week, according to Wind Information, a financial data service focused on China. Trading volume peaked at 3.99 trillion yuan ($556 billion) on Wednesday, surpassing the previous record of 3.48 trillion yuan set in October 2024.Earlier this year, the benchmark CSI 300 hit a four-year high. This comes after the index posted its best yearly gain since 2020.The surge has revived memories of past market excesses, particularly the boom-and-bust cycle of 2015, market veterans told CNBC.China's regulators have responded by tightening margin financing rules, including raising collateral requirements on new margin trades.Under the updated rules, which took effect on Monday, the margin requirement for credit purchases was lifted to 100% from 80% across the three bourses. This means that investors must now pay the entire cost of shares upfront, while keeping the trades under existing margin financing rules, effectively eliminating borrowing on new margin trades.The regulatory tightening suggests an \"overheating\" of activity and sentiment in onshore markets, said Morgan Stanley, referring to stocks traded in mainland China, or A-shares, in yuan and by domestic and approved foreign investors.The investment bank's weighted A-share Market Sentiment Activity Index surged to 91% in recent days, the first reading above the 90% threshold since September 2024, driven largely by the spike in trading volumes. Recently, the trading volume in the mainland has been exploding to an all-time high. Margin financing has reached a high level as well.Hao HongGrow Investment Group\"Regulatory tightening took place as our sentiment indicator surged to an overheated level with record high turnover,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. However, they expect added liquidity support for both A-shares and Hong Kong equities to persist through the first quarter.Foreign investors have stepped up their activity, with net inflows exceeding $50 billion in recent months, a sharp increase from previous years, according to data provided by Skybound Capital. Still, foreign participation remains small relative to the overall size and turnover of the A-share market. Domestic investors continue to drive the rally, said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.Retail investors account for about 90% of daily turnover in China's onshore stock markets, according to data from HSBC. That contrasts sharply with major overseas markets, where institutions dominate trading and retail investors make up only around 20% to 25% of volumes on the New York Stock Exchange.Engineering a slower bull?The dominance of onshore capital has shaped regulators' approach to leverage. In China's equity market, leverage primarily comes from margin financing, in which investors borrow from brokers to buy shares, amplifying both gains and losses. When leverage builds in such an environment, rallies can accelerate quickly but are also more vulnerable to abrupt reversals if sentiment shifts.\"Recently, the trading volume in the mainland has been exploding to an all-time high. Margin financing has reached a high level as well,\" said Hao Hong, chief economist at Grow Investment Group. \"So the regulators have attempted to tweak the leverage so that they could engineer a 'slow bull'.\"Other market veterans said the latest margin-financing adjustments appear to be calibrated to temper speculative excess and promote this \"slow bull\" market, rather than signaling concern about systemic risk.\"The situation is better described as 'structural overheating,' concentrated in specific sectors such as AI-related and technology stocks, many of which are recent listings that have attracted intense speculative interest.\"Shou also pointed to the growing divergence across China's exchanges as evidence that enthusiasm remains selective. The ChiNext board has surged nearly 50% over the past six months, far outpacing the more modest gains in the Shanghai Composite Index.",

    "body": "Atlantide Phototravel | Corbis Documentary | Getty ImagesAsia-Pacific markets were mostly lower on Tuesday as investors assessed renewed U.S. tariff threats tied to Greenland, raising concerns about escalating trade tensions with Europe.European states are reportedly discussing counter-tariffs and broader punitive economic measures in response to fresh tariff threats from President Donald Trump, further straining relations over Greenland.Trump on Saturday announced that exports from eight European nations would start at 10% on Feb. 1 and climb to 25% by June 1 if talks fail to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a mineral-rich, semi-autonomous island under Danish control.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose 0.1%, while mainland China's CSI 300 slid 0.26% after heightened regulatory scrutiny following a surge in trading activity.Authorities have moved to rein in leverage after onshore market turnover hit record levels, driven in part by a rise in margin trading balances to an all-time high.Despite the tightening, Standard Chartered's Raymond Cheng said the bank remains positive on China A shares, citing a stabilizing economy and expected fiscal policy support at China's upcoming policy meetings in March 2026.\"We view the strength of China equities as sustainable, given policy stimulus to add further upside to our projected mid-teen earnings growth for the forward 12 months,\" the bank's regional chief investment officer for Greater China said.Investors are closely watching developments in Japanese markets after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said on Monday that she plans to dissolve parliament and call a snap election on Feb. 8.Japan's Nikkei 225 slid 0.96%, while the Topix declined 0.69%. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.52% to a record high for a second straight day, while the small-cap Kosdaq jumped 1.78%.Yields on Japan's 40-year government bond rose to 4% for the first time. Japan's ruling coalition holds a one-seat Lower House majority following its formation in October, when Takaichi became prime minister after her predecessor resigned. While the snap election would raise near-term political uncertainty, it could bring greater policy clarity if a government emerges with a stronger mandate, Fitch Group said in a note.Fitch expects government debt to remain elevated over the medium term, but to gradually decline as stronger nominal GDP growth offsets wider fiscal deficits and higher borrowing costs. Consolidated general government debt is projected to ease to the mid-190% range of GDP by fiscal 2029, from an estimated 199.5% in fiscal 2025 and a peak of 222% in fiscal 2020. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.46%.U.S. stock futures pointed to a downbeat session on Wall Street as Trump intensifies his rhetoric on Greenland.Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Asia-Pacific markets were mostly lower on Tuesday.

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote. The blog comes after OpenAI last week said that it planned to begin testing ads for some ChatGPT users in the U.S. That move comes as OpenAI gears up for a potential public debut this year. \"Monetization should feel native to the experience,\" Friar wrote. \"If it does not add value, it does not belong.\"WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures 'continue to produce all-time highs'watch now",

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Wall Street, Manhattan, New York.Andrey Denisyuk | Moment | Getty ImagesInvestor appetite for private credit remains undeterred even as warnings mount over looser loan approval and risk-assessment practices, as well as rising pockets of borrower stress.The troubles at First Brands Group last September became a flashpoint for critics of private credit after the heavily leveraged auto-parts maker ran into distress, highlighting how aggressive debt structures had built up quietly during years of easy financing. The episode heightened fears that similar risks could be lurking across the market, prompting JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to warn that private credit risks were \"hiding in plain sight,\" warning that \"cockroaches\" will likely emerge once economic conditions deteriorate.Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio has also cautioned of mounting stress in venture capital and private credit markets due to higher rates squeezing leveraged private assets, as part of broader private market strain.watch nowWhile private credit investors reportedly withdrew over $7 billion from the likes of Apollo, Ares and Blackstone amongst other big Wall Street names in the final months of last year, capital has continued to flow into private credit funds. KKR just last week announced it completed a $2.5 billion fundraise for its Asia Credit Opportunities Fund II. TPG, one of the industry's largest players, in December closed more than $6 billion for its third flagship Credit Solutions fund, far surpassing its $4.5 billion target and double the size of its predecessor. In November, Neuberger Berman announced the final close of its fifth flagship private debt fund at $7.3 billion, exceeding its original target as demand from global institutional investors remained strong. Granite Asia in December announced the first close of its first dedicated pan-Asia private credit strategy, raising over $350 million with backing from Temasek, Khazanah Nasional and the Indonesia Investment Authority, underscoring solid investor demand in the region. A first close is when a fund accepts initial investor commitments and begins investing, even though fundraising continues.Why investors keep coming backWhile Dimon had raised the alarm on private credit, JPMorgan appears to have reassessed the market. Though underwriting standards have loosened in pockets of the market, demand for private credit continues to be underpinned by structural forces, including persistent financing needs among middle-market companies, infrastructure developers and asset-backed borrowers, JPMorgan said in its Alternative Investments Outlook 2026.According to Goldman Sachs, private credit has grown into a multi-trillion-dollar market and has become a core allocation for many institutional investors. Pension funds, insurers and endowments that once treated the asset class as a niche alternative now see it as a long-term fixture of their portfolios. \"Concerns about a potential bubble in private credit resurfaced in September 2025 when a handful of U.S. borrowers defaulted on large debts, particularly in the auto sector,\" the investment bank said. \"While alarming, drawing commentary from investors and other interested parties outside the domestic U.S. market – these defaults appear to be issuer-specific rather than systemic,\" JPM said, adding that demand for yield continues to outpace supply, in particular for private equity transactions. There is also a structural element at play, according to private credit industry experts. As traditional banks pull back from lending due to regulatory constraints, private credit funds have become the primary providers of capital to middle-market companies. Reforms following the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 such as higher capital requirements and stricter risk-weighting rules have made it more costly for banks to hold riskier corporate loans on their books, encouraging many lenders to retreat from certain leveraged or bespoke financing areas and opening a gap that private credit firms are stepping into.That dynamic has reinforced the perception that private credit is no longer a niche strategy but an essential component of the financial system.Don't ignore the signs of strainEven as fundraising stays robust, signs of strain are becoming harder to ignore.High interest rates have pushed up borrowing costs, leaving a growing share of companies struggling to cover their private credit debt payments, warned Goldman Sachs. Around 15% of the borrowers are no longer generating enough cash to fully service interest, and many others are operating with little margin for error, data provided by the bank showed. While rate cuts could offer some relief, the investment bank said they would only modestly ease the pressure rather than fix underlying weaknesses. Morningstar has also warned about worsening credit profiles among both high- and low-quality borrowers in 2026 as higher interest rates, especially relative to the ultra-low levels between 2010 to 2021, filter through balance sheets.We don't see the same kind of leverage or covenant erosion that people are worried about in the U.S.Ming EngGranite AsiaThe concerns about leverage and borrower stress though are not evenly distributed across markets, with industry executives pointing to stark differences between the U.S., Europe and Asia.In Asia, private credit markets are far less saturated than in the U.S. or Europe, said Ming Eng, managing director at Granite Asia. \"We don't see the same kind of leverage or covenant erosion that people are worried about in the U.S.,\" Eng said. \"Asia is at a very different stage of development.\"While U.S. and European private credit markets have become crowded with intense competition driving looser structures and higher leverage, Asia's market remains comparatively nascent, she explained. Many borrowers are founder-led companies or family-owned businesses that still rely heavily on banks or equity financing, allowing room for private credit to grow. \"Most of what we see in Asia is still very conservative,\" Eng said. \"There's less leverage, stronger covenants, and often a real operating story behind the capital, not financial engineering.\"That difference matters at a time when concerns are growing over the quality of underwriting in developed markets.

    "body": "HSINCHU, TAIWAN - APRIL 16: The entrance to a factory of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which is a Taiwanese multinational semiconductor contract manufacturing and design company, in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on April 16, 2025.  Daniel Ceng | Anadolu | Getty ImagesThe U.S.-Taiwan deal aimed at expanding chip production capacity in the U.S. is unlikely to fully wean Washington off the island's most advanced semiconductors anytime soon, several analysts told CNBC, leaving the so-called \"silicon shield\" largely intact for now.Taiwan dominates global chip production, with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company producing most of the world's advanced chips. Nearly one-third of global demand for new computing power is estimated to be fabricated in Taiwan.   The island's central role in the global semiconductor supply chain has made preserving its de facto autonomy — and deterring any Chinese attack — a strategic priority for the U.S. and its allies, an idea referred to as the \"Silicon Shield.\" Beijing claims territorial control over the democratically-governed island. As part of a trade deal struck Thursday, the Taiwanese government promised to guarantee $250 billion in credit to its chip and technology companies to expand their production capacity in the U.S. Taiwanese companies will also enjoy higher quotas for tariff-free imports of their chips into the U.S. In return, Washington would lower its levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, and waive tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically.The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S., Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday. But experts doubt the plan would be easy, given Taipei's hard line on keeping its most advanced technology at home.Taiwan's \"silicon shield\" will remain strong through the end of the decade, with the world's most critical advanced capacity concentrated on the island, said Sravan Kundojjala, an analyst at SemiAnalysis.Taiwanese authorities restricted TSMC's overseas fabrication plants from operating technologies at least two generations behind those developed domestically, known as the N-2 rule.The semiconductor ecosystem cannot be relocated overnight, so the silicon shield may weaken but still exist in the near term.Dennis Lu-Chung WengAssociate professor of political science, Sam Houston State UniversityWhile TSMC produces its most advanced chips using 2-nanometer technology, or nodes, at home, its Arizona plant has only recently begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips for U.S. customers, with plans to scale up to 2-nanometer and A16 nodes by 2030. In semiconductor manufacturing, smaller nanometer sizes mean denser transistors, which boost processing speed and improve energy efficiency.That four- to- five-year lag ensures Taiwan retains its advantage, said Kundojjala, adding that the global economy would face a \"depression-level event if Taiwan were invaded tomorrow.\" A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said at a news conference Friday that Beijing \"firmly opposed any agreements signed between Taiwan and countries that have diplomatic relations with China,\" urging the U.S. to stick to the \"one-China principle.\"  Wendell Huang, CFO of TSMC, told CNBC on Thursday that the company will continue developing its most advanced technologies in Taiwan due to the need for \"very intensive collaboration\" between its domestic research and development teams and manufacturing operations. \"We'll be sending hundreds of engineers back and forth [between] different sites in Taiwan. Therefore, it will stay in Taiwan when we ramp [up] the most leading-edge technology,\" Huang said. Still, the world's largest contract chipmaker has already pledged to invest $165 billion into chip fabrication and processing facilities in the U.S., along with a research and development lab, supplying customers such as Nvidia and Apple. Wu Cheng-wen, who oversees Taiwan's National Science and Technology Council, told the Financial Times last year that it was crucial for Taiwan to keep its cutting-edge research and development at home and ensure that the domestic industry would not be \"hollowed out.\"\"If we move our R&D overseas, it'll be dangerous for us,\" Wu said in the interview. Hurdles with U.S. onshoring Shifting chip production away from Taiwan will be difficult, analysts said. Taiwan's engineering talent pipeline and production capabilities in the semiconductor supply chain, especially in advanced fabrication, are \"not replicable at scale anywhere else,\" said William Reinsch, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The lack of trained workers and higher production costs have led to delays in TSMC's U.S. plant openings, Reinsch said, adding that the new trade deal does little to address these constraints. He expects fulfilment of the pledged investment commitments to take longer than expected and is unlikely to reach the promised level. \"The semiconductor ecosystem cannot be relocated overnight, so the silicon shield may weaken but still exist in the near term,\" said Dennis Lu-Chung Weng, an associate professor of political science at Sam Houston State University. \"The bigger question is what happens after Trump: if future U.S. administrations keep pushing for large-scale relocation, Taiwan losing its exclusive advantage becomes less a question of if and more a question of when,\" Weng cautioned.watch nowTaiwanese officials have stressed the need to diversify its economic model, encourage more industries to grow, and bolster its defense capabilities to counter China's military pressure. A Chinese invasion of Taiwan remains a low-possibility event, and the trade deal is unlikely to change Beijing's calculus, said Ava Shen, a Taiwan and Chinese foreign policy expert at Eurasia Group. The mainland authorities would focus more on their military balance vis-à-vis the U.S. and the level of American defense support for Taipei, Shen said.",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeBessent said Trump's new tariffs on Europe regarding Greenland are a response to an emergency. \"The national emergency is avoiding a national emergency,\" Bessent said. \"It is a strategic decision by the president ... he is able to use the economic might of the U.S. to avoid a hot war.\" Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland, the Arctic territory of Denmark, and has ratcheted up his pressure campaign for a U.S. takeover of the island in recent weeks. Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.CORRECTION: Vivian Motzfeldt is Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty Images China's slowdown worsened in October, dragged by soft consumer demand and a deepening property downturn, with the long holiday period further denting factory activity.Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, contracted 1.7% for the first ten months of the year, steepening from a 0.5% decline in the January-to-September period, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed Friday. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.8% drop.The last time China recorded a contraction in fixed-asset investment was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information, a private database focused on the country.On a single-month basis, fixed-asset investment fell 11.4% from a year earlier, the weakest reading since early 2020 when the first Covid lockdowns hit, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates. The bank attributed the drop to Beijing's efforts in reining in industrial overcapacity and the housing downturn.Within that segment, property investment continued to decline, shrinking 14.7% in the year through October, compared with a 13.9% contraction in the first nine months.Manufacturing investment rose 2.7% and utilities spending, which includes electricity, fuel and water supplies, climbed 12.5%.Industrial output expanded 4.9% in October, slowing from a 6.5% the prior month and missing expectations for a 5.5% jump.China's manufacturing activity contracted more than expected in October, falling to the lowest level in six months, as a weeklong holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to Oct. 8 shuttered most factories across the country.Retail sales climbed 2.9% in October from a year earlier. While beating the 2.8% growth forecast in a Reuters poll, the consumption gauge fell for a fifth straight month to its lowest level this year, according to LSEG data.The survey-based urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.1% last month from 5.2% in September. The sharp drop in fixed-asset investment was largely dragged down by lackluster investment in the property sector and infrastructure, according to Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management.Manufacturing investment has seen \"modest and uneven growth,\" with state-owned enterprises increasing spending on infrastructure, such as electricity, heat and gas supply, while foreign investment contracted sharply, Yuhan Zhang, principal economist of the Conference Board's China Center, said in a note.\"We will continue to see policy-directed investment in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, and industrial upgrading,\" he added.In a sign of persistently weak demand in the beleaguered housing sector, separate official data released on Friday showed China's new home prices dipped 0.5% in October from the previous month, the steepest month-on-month decline since October last year. Home prices fell 2.2% in October on an annual basis.Consumer prices rose 0.2% from a year earlier in October, the strongest inflation reading since January this year and the first positive growth since June, according to LSEG data.The core CPI, which strips out food and energy, rose 1.2% from a year earlier, the highest since February 2024, according to data provider Wind Information.China's exports in October unexpectedly contracted for the first time in nearly two years as tensions with Washington over trade escalated before a deal was reached at the month's end.U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping agreed last month to trim their tit-for-tat tariffs and suspend a raft of restrictive measures for one year.Economists widely expect the  as businesses' front-loading activity tapers off, and global demand may not fully offset a deepening decline in U.S.-bound shipments, putting Beijing under greater pressure to stimulate domestic demand.\"I don't expect stimulus to happen in the rest of this year,\" said Zhang, noting the economy appears to remain on track to achieve its 5% growth target, although fiscal policy may turn more supportive at the start of next year.China's economic growth slowed to 4.8% in the third quarter, following expansions of 5.2% in the second quarter and 5.4% in the first quarter.",

    "body": "fstop123 | E+ | Getty ImagesForeclosure filings climbed again in October, after sitting at historic lows in recent years, according to new data released Thursday.While the numbers are still small, the persistent rise in foreclosures may be a sign of cracks in the housing market.There were 36,766 U.S. properties with some type of foreclosure filing in October — such as default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions, according to Attom, a property data and analytics firm. That was 3% higher than September and a 19% jump from October 2024, and marked the eighth straight month of annual increases, Attom said.Foreclosure starts, which are the initial phase of the process, rose 6% for the month and were 20% higher than the year before. Competed foreclosures, the final phase, jumped 32% year over year.\"Even with these increases, activity remains well below historic highs. The current trend appears to reflect a gradual normalization in foreclosure volumes as market conditions adjust and some homeowners continue to navigate higher housing and borrowing costs,\" said Attom CEO Rob Barber in a release.Florida, South Carolina and Illinois led the nation in state foreclosure filings. On a metropolitan area level, Florida's Tampa, Jacksonville and Orlando had the most filings, with Riverside, California, and Cleveland rounding out the top five.Looking specifically at completed foreclosures, Texas, California and Florida had the most, suggesting those states will see more inventory coming on the market at distressed prices. There is still very strong demand for homes, especially in lower price ranges, so it is likely those foreclosed properties will find buyers quickly.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.At the peak of the Great Recession, more than 4% of mortgages were in foreclosure, according to Rick Sharga, CEO of CJ Patrick Co., a real estate market intelligence firm. Today, less than 0.5% are in foreclosure, well below the historic average of between 1% and 1.5%. In addition, 4% of mortgages are delinquent; at the peak of the financial crisis, almost 12% were.\"So, no foreclosure tsunami to worry about,\" said Sharga. \"That said, there are a few areas of concern. [Federal Housing Administration] delinquencies are over 11%, and account for 52% of all seriously delinquent loans; we're likely to see more FHA loans in foreclosure in 2026.\"He also noted that states where home prices have been falling while insurance premiums have been soaring — Florida and Texas, in particular — are seeing an uptick in defaults. While home prices nationally are easing, they remain stubbornly high. Meanwhile, mortgage rates, which were expected to fall more sharply after the Federal Reserve started to cut rates, are still within a percentage point of their recent highs. Some recent buyers who thought they might have been able to refinance to lower rates by now may be feeling pressure, especially with still stubborn inflation.Consumer debt is at an all-time high, delinquencies are rising in other types of consumer credit and the job market appears to be weakening — all of which could contribute to cracks in the housing market.\"None of these issues have impacted mortgage performance - yet, but it would be unrealistic to assume that these trends, along with slow home sales and declining home price appreciation, won't lead to at least a slight increase in delinquencies and defaults in the months ahead,\" added Sharga.",

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the Federal Reserve on Oct. 29, 2025 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell wasn't kidding a couple weeks ago when he said a December rate cut wasn't in the bag.Recent remarks from Powell's colleagues point to plenty of apprehension over whether the central bank should deliver its third consecutive easing of policy when it meets Dec. 9-10.As a result, markets have recalibrated their expectations. Whereas traders as recently as a few days ago were pricing in at least a 2-to-1 probability of a quarter percentage point cut, that's now flipped to a coin toss, according to futures markets readings tabulated by the CME Group in its FedWatch tool.\"These developments chip away at our confidence the Fed will cut in [December] without giving us any more confidence a skip to [January] is a better bet,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a note. \"This leaves us still seeing a [December] cut more likely than not but only 55-60 per cent.\"As of Thursday afternoon, the implied probability of a rate cut was at 49.4%, according to the CME gauge that uses prices on 30-day fed funds futures contracts to interpolate probabilities for rate moves. Futures prices pointed to a funds rate of 3.775% by the end of 2025, compared to the current level of 3.87%.A month ago, the market was assigning a 95% probability of a reduction.So what changed? Primarily, uncertainty at a time when the official data flow came to a halt due to the now-resolved government shutdown. Some Fed officials worry about flying blind on data at a time when the most recent readings point to a softening labor market but inflation that, while ebbing slightly, is still considerably above the Fed's 2% target. Moreover, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that some of the data, particularly for October, may never come out.An unexpected voiceThose reservations showed up in an uncharacteristically blunt assessment Wednesday from Boston Fed President Susan Collins.During her time with the Fed, Collins has used cautious language to express her opinion on policy. But a speech she delivered in her home district left little doubt regarding her misgivings about inflation and the importance of the Fed to hold steady, at least for now, until there's greater economic clarity.\"Given my baseline outlook, it will likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment,\" Collins said. \"I see several reasons to have a relatively high bar for additional easing in the near term.\"watch nowA central part of her case is that the economy generally looks solid even with the slowdown in hiring. Cutting rates more, Collins reasoned, risks pushing inflation higher at a time when the impact from tariffs is still uncertain.\"The current level of policy rates, in my view, leaves policy well positioned to address a range of potential outcomes and balance risks on both sides of our mandate,\" she said, referring to the Fed's dual mandate to maximize employment and keep prices stable. Collins' position puts her in a hawkish group that includes regional presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City who, unlike Collins, voted against the October cut, along with Beth Hammack of Cleveland and possibly Alberto Musalem of St. Louis and Lorie Logan in Dallas.On the opposite side of the rate fence are Governors Stephen Miran who, in his two meetings, has voted against quarter-point cuts in favor of half-point reductions, as well as Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.Chair Powell, then, is left to build consensus following his comments after the October rate cut that \"a further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion—far from it.\" There is no Fed policy meeting in November.Taking sidesAs markets grew less confident about a December cut, stocks slumped Thursday while Treasury yields moved higher.Powell's dilemma at a time of uncharacteristic dissent on the Federal Open Market Committee is intensifying.\"We do not think Powell wants the Committee to break apart deeply and publicly with mass hawkishdissents at this institutionally perilous moment,\" Guha said. \"This in our view is why he and his top deputies [FOMC Vice Chair Philip] Jefferson and [New York Fed President John] Williams have adopted a conciliatory posture, respecting hawks' arguments and insisting the market view [December] as a 50-50 call.\"One middle ground for the Powell would be a \"hawkish cut,\" in which the committee would agree to one more reduction while the chair communicates that further moves lower are unlikely. The FOMC's makeup changes in January when a new crop of regional presidents will move into voting roles, and as Powell's term as chair nears its end in May. Gone will be hawks like Collins and Schmid, though both Hammack and Logan will move into voting roles.\"With all this in mind, we think that it is possible that Powell is forced into a compromise by which the Fed either (1) stays on hold in December, or (2) if it does cut, is obligated subsequently to signal that the rate cutting cycle may be over,\" wrote Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group.Traders are anticipating the committee softens its stance come January. Futures pricing indicates about a 70% probability of a cut to kick off the new year should the FOMC decide to skip December.watch now",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBritish government bond yields rose sharply on Friday following reports Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is no longer planning to raise income tax rates in the Autumn Budget later this month.The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt initially rose around 13 basis points in early trade, but was last around 7 basis points higher at 4.51%. Yields on the long term 20- and 30-year gilts were last seen 8.5 and 9 basis points higher, respectively. Yields and prices move inversely to one another.The moves came as investors reacted to a report from the Financial Times of an income tax U-turn. The Treasury was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday morning.U.K. stocks were also lower. The FTSE 100 index shed over 1% in morning trade, with Lloyds, Natwest, and Barclays banks occupying the bottom of the index, each losing more than 2.7%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe U.K.'s FTSE 100 indexReeves had spent the past week apparently laying the groundwork for a manifesto-breaking rise in income tax, which split Labour party lawmakers and led to further turmoil in the already embattled party, whose leader Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismal approval ratings. A proposed 2p national income increase was to be offset by a 2p reduction in national insurance, designed to hit passive income streams rather than working people. There are now expectations, however, that the £30 billion ($39.5 billion) hole in the government's budget will be filled by a patchwork of smaller rises.  It could be a \"fiscal reckoning\" as a patchwork approach will put pressure on the gilt market, Wren Sterling's investment chief Rory McPherson told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Friday.  \"Within the U.K., if we have more of the smaller taxes being targeted as part of the programme from Rachel Reeves, I think that's going to put more pressure on the government, more pressure on them to go back to the bond markets and ask for more money, which in turn puts more pressure up on yields,\" McPherson said.He added that there has been a \"big march down\" in yields but now \"we're pulling away that that.\" Volatility this year has left long-term borrowing costs hovering at their highest level since the late 1990s, with U.K. debt having the heftiest price tag in the G7. For Toni Meadows, head of investment at BRI Wealth Management, the government has found itself \"between a rock and a hard place with regard to this budget.\"watch now\"They inherited a bad fiscal position but then made the situation worse with public sector pay awards. The reason that there has been so much speculation regarding this budget, more than any statement in recent history, is because everything they need to do is going to be unpopular. How can this statement simultaneously promote growth whilst having to cut spending and increase the tax burden to keep bond investors happy?\" he said, noting that outstanding debt and service costs add pressure.While the market is pessimistic, \"the uncertainty of not knowing the exact detail is more damaging in the short term,\" Meadows said, adding that detailed plans are required for investors to be able to move beyond speculation.Julian Howard, chief multi-asset investment strategist at GAM Investments, suggested that \"onerous restrictions\" on pensions savings, ISAs, an expatriation exit charge, and capital gains and council tax changes could be on the cards.Read more\"The Chancellor will doubtless inflict enough misery later this month to fix the immediate problem but the emerging challenge the markets are hinting at may now be one of more general economic credibility,\" he said.Wren Sterling's McPherson added that the Bank of England will still be able to make an interest rate cut after the budget, if it wants to. Other investors appear to have curbed their optimism, with bets on cuts shedding six basis points compared with Thursday, according to data compiled by LSEG.The Autumn Budget is expected on Nov. 26.— CNBC's Chloe Taylor and Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk speaks at a Q&amp;A following a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. Shelby Tauber | ReutersTwo months ago, Oracle's stock had its best day since 1992, soaring 36% to a record after the company blew away investors with its forecast for cloud infrastructure revenue.Since then, the company has lost one-third of its value, more than wiping out those gains. Midway through November, the stock is on pace for its worst month since 2011.The hype was sparked by Oracle's strengthening ties to OpenAI. But the mood of late has turned, with investors questioning whether the AI market ran too far, too fast and whether OpenAI can live up to its $300 billion commitment to Oracle over five years.\"AI sentiment is waning,\" said Jackson Ader, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, in an interview.Ader said that of the big cloud companies in the GPU business, Oracle is expected to generate the least amount of free cash flow. To fund the capex required for Oracle's business, Ader expects Oracle to turn to more creative financing tools.Oracle is looking to raise $38 billion in debt sales to help fund its AI buildout, according to sources with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the information is confidential. Bloomberg reported on the planned debt raise last month.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’The company needs a massive pool of capital as it works with partners to develop and lease data centers across Texas, New Mexico and Wisconsin, while also buying hundreds of thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to run AI models.At Oracle's big annual conference in October, called AI World, tech enthusiasts cheered the company's cloud infrastructure design as being easily scalable. Investors remained largely enthusiastic at the time, thanks to Oracle's over $450 billion in signed contracts that hadn't yet been recognized as revenue.Skepticism started to hit shortly after the conference. Oracle shares fell 7% on Oct. 17, as investors questioned the company's ability to reach its lofty outlook announced at its investor day. Oracle said it expected to reach $166 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue in the 2030 fiscal year, up from $18 billion in fiscal 2026. Oracle's next quarterly earnings report is expected in mid-December.Andrew Keches, an analyst at Barclays, said off-balance sheet debt facilities and vendor financing are two options for Oracle. Keches recently downgraded Oracle's debt, citing the company's \"significant funding needs.\"\"We struggle to see an avenue for ORCL's credit trajectory to improve,\" Keches wrote in a note to clients this week.Oracle Corp Chief Executive Larry Ellison during a launch event at the company's headquarters in Redwood Shores, California June 10, 2014.Noah Berger | ReutersOracle bulls point to founder Larry Ellison's long and storied track record. A hedge fund manager who asked to remain anonymous told CNBC that Ellison is \"someone you don't want to bet against.\"And Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in an interview that Oracle could rebuild its momentum in the market with more AI deals. However, Jaluria currently has a hold rating on the stock. As more investors look to hedge their bets, Oracle's 5-year credit default swaps have climbed to a 2-year high, a level that's not alarming but worth watching, credit analysts told CNBC. Credit default swaps are like insurance for investors, with buyers paying for protection in case the borrower can't repay its debt.Barclays recommended clients buy Oracle's 5-year credit default swaps.Oracle didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Last month, CNBC's David Faber asked Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two CEOs, whether OpenAI will be able to pay Oracle $60 billion a year. Magouyrk responded, \"of course,\" while also pointing to OpenAI's growth prospects and rapid rise in users.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a post on X last week that the company will top $20 billion in annualized revenue this year and reach hundreds of billions of dollars by 2030. Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, told CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Wednesday that Oracle represents the \"bad behavior in the AI buildout.\" He contrasted Oracle with Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which he said all have the available cash and customer demand to justify their rapid expansions.For Oracle, however, there's an overreliance on OpenAI, a cash-burning startup, Luria said. Additionally, he said that gross margins for renting out GPUs are dramatically lower than the roughly 80% margin in the company's core business. Luria has a hold rating on the stock. In terms of the $100 of stock appreciation that initially followed the last earnings report, \"it makes a lot of sense that that's completely gone away,\" Luria said.

This includes using Apple software to register a user's purchase history, verify user ages and to process in-app purchases.A \"mini app\" is a lightweight piece of software inside a third-party app store, like that of Discord's. These apps uses are built using web technology like HTML or Javascript.Most notably, China's WeChat offers offers millions of mini-apps built by other developers to let users track packages, look up transit directions and shop online. Artificial intelligence companies like OpenAI are increasingly integrating mini apps inside their chatbots.The move is Apple's latest effort to evolve its App Store. The company has been under pressure from regulators in Europe and court decisions in the U.S. to give up control over its App Store and reduce its fees. In most countries, the Apple App Store is the only way to install software on an iPhone.In recent years, the company has offered several similar programs for video apps, news apps and small app developers that cut the iPhone maker's fees in exchange for developers choosing deeper integration and participation in Apple's ecosystem.Apple has argued that both developers and users are better off when using its technology and rules, instead of eschewing them to try to avoid fees.\"This program is designed to help developers who host mini apps grow their business and further the availability of mini apps on the App Store — all while providing a great customer experience,\" the company said in its announcement.Although Apple has banned others from offering their own app stores on its platform, it has been embracing mini apps in recent years. Last year, it allowed mini-apps to start charging for in-app purchases using Apple's software for digital goods like in-game currency or lives in a video game.All iPhone developers submit their apps to Apple, which reviews the submission using humans before making the software available for download on the App Store.Participants in the new program will still have to provide Apple with information for each specific mini-app experience they offer.WATCH: Investors view Apple's capital discipline as a strategic advantage, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

    "body": "Eakarat Buanoi | Istock | Getty ImagesLISBON, Portugal — Top tech executives told CNBC they're concerned about a bubble forming in the artificial intelligence sector, underscoring growing unease within the industry over soaring valuation.In recent weeks, markets have been reckoning with the notion that too much capital is pouring into the AI boom, clouding the outlook on revenue and actual profit and putting high valuations into question.Up to now, warnings around overstretched valuations have mostly come from investors and leaders in the world of finance. Goldman Sachs' David Solomon and Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick have warned of potential corrections as valuations of some major tech firms reached historic highs.The concerns have been crystallized by famed 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry, who this week accused major AI infrastructure and cloud providers, or 'hyperscalers' of understating depreciation expenses on chips. Burry warned that profits at the likes of Oracle and Meta may be vastly overstated. He recently disclosed put options that bet against Nvidia and Palantir.However, CEOs of companies who are themselves developing AI, expressed their concerns this week during interviews with CNBC at the Web Summit tech conference in Lisbon.\"I think the evaluations are pretty exaggerated here and there, and I think there is signs of a bubble on the horizon,\" Jarek Kutylowski, CEO of German AI firm DeepL, told CNBC on Tuesday.watch nowThe sentiment was echoed by Picsart CEO Hovhannes Avoyan.\"We see lots of AI companies raising ... tremendous valuations ... without any revenue,\" Avoyan told CNBC on Tuesday, adding that it is a \"concern.\"The market values smaller startups with \"just some noise and vibe revenue,\" he said, referring to companies being backed even though they have minimal sales.Vibe revenue is a play on \"vibe coding,\" a term that refers to using AI to code without needing deep technical expertise.AI demand growingEven with concerns over valuations, the technology industry remains bullish on the long term potential of AI.Lyft CEO David Risher said there are reasons to be optimistic given the potential impact of AI but acknowledged the risks.\"Let's be clear, we are absolutely in a financial bubble. There is no question, right? Because this is incredible, transformational technology. No one wants to be left behind.\"Risher went on to argue that there is a difference between the financial bubble and the industrial outlook.\"The data centers and all the model creation, all of that is going to have a long, long life, because it's transformational. It makes people's lives easier. It makes people's lives better… On the other hand, you know, the financial side, it's a little risky right now.\"The tech CEOs also addressed their outlook on AI demand for 2026 from businesses, as investors look for any clues as to what this will look like.\"I think there's a lot of demand, and there's a lot of interest. I think everybody understands that AI can do magical things to businesses, and... we can all operate on another level when it comes to efficiency,\" Kutylowski said.Still, businesses are \"strugging in adopting\" AI. \"We're going to get further, but I don't think we're that we're going to be in a place where we can say, like every enterprise, every organization, has it figured out totally,\" Kutylowski said.watch nowDeepL's core product is an AI translation tool but it recently launched a more general purpose \"agent\" designed to be able to carry out tasks on behalf of employees.Francois Chadwick, the chief financial officer of Cohere, a company that is also focused on enterprise AI, told CNBC on Tuesday that \"demand is definitely there.\"$4 trillion capex outlookDespite the concerns over overstretched valuations and huge capex spend, the investment into artificial intelligence doesn't appear to be slowing down. A report from venture capital group Accel released this week showed that the buildout of new AI data center capacity is forecast to reach 117 gigawatts by 2030 which translates into about $4 trillion worth of capital expenditure over the next 5 years.About $3.1 trillion worth of revenue is required to pay back that capex, according to the Accel report.Already this year, there have been a slew of deals worth billions announced by the likes of Nvidia and OpenAI as they look to develop data center capacity around the world in a bid to keep up with demand.Philippe Botteri, a partner at Accel, said that three major factors will drive that revenue — more powerful AI models that require capacity to be trained, the use of new AI services and the \"agentic revolution in the enterprise.\"\"Agentic\" is often a term used to describe a type of AI tool that can automatically carry out tasks on behalf of users.watch nowBut not everyone believes that the large amount of spending is necessary.Ben Harburg, managing partner at Novo Capital says the figures being discussed by large tech firms for future investment may be overblown.\"We hear these crazy headline numbers about how much energy is going to be needed, how many chips are going to be needed, although, again, I think that there is probably more of a bubble brewing there than on kind of the front end, the actual product front,\" Harburg told CNBC on Tuesday.\"I think we're starting to realize that there's been probably over exuberance around data centers. Even Sam [Altman], I think, would privately admit that they need fewer chips than they originally set out, they need less capital than they originally set out. They need less energy than they originally set out.\"",

Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market.

Since then Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after the earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader selloff reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips, and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and the founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

(Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesA leadership shakeup at what was once Europe's most valuable company is likely to be cemented Friday as Novo Nordisk's controlling shareholder tightens it's grip on the weight-loss drugmaker, even as minority shareholders express discontent.Novo has found itself in an increasingly chaotic situation as of late, with shares plunging and investor confidence waning, as its role as the leading player in the highly lucrative weight-loss space is being called into question.The maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs last month announced an Extraordinary General Meeting for Nov. 14 to replace its independent board members, including Chair Helge Lund, after it became impossible to reach an agreement between the views of the current board and the Novo Nordisk foundation board — the company's majority shareholder.Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), one of the larger minority shareholders, said earlier this week it would abstain from voting at Friday's EGM, indicating discontent. Other shareholders, such as California State Teachers' Retirement System, have also said they'll vote against the proposal. NBIM and CalSTRS both declined to comment further.Lund will be replaced by company veteran Lars Rebien Sørensen, already chair of the Foundation board. The 71-year-old also served as Novo Nordisk CEO between 2000 and 2016.The foundation also proposed Cees de Jong to become vice chair and Mikael Dolsten, Britt Meelby Jensen and Stephan Engels to become members.Early Friday, Novo said Dolsten, formerly head of R&D at Pfizer, had decided to withdraw his candidacy to the board due to personal circumstances. Novo shares were down 1.8% to $312.90 in morning trading.\"It is rare that a company of that scale to make that degree of change that quickly,\" Andrew Pettigrew, Emeritus professor at University of Oxford, and an expert of theories of change, told CNBC.watch now\"It's usually precipitated by some awful crisis, which is throwing them off a cliff, but probably also a period when they were blind to what was going on underneath them. In other words, they were surprised by a sudden change, and it usually takes that to overthrow an existing power group in a company, especially if they've been in power for a long time,\" Pettigrew added.The current board was \"too slow in recognizing the significance of the market changes in the United States,\" Sørensen told analysts at a call following the announcement, adding that two more members would be announced in due course.Novo is broadly viewed as having fallen behind U.S. peer Eli Lilly which has rapidly taken market share from Novo, as its rival drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound have shown more pronounced weight loss at the highest dose.\"It's a matter of urgency and scope,\" Sørensen said in October about the proposed changes to the board, however also saying the foundation is \"fully aligned\" behind Novo's current strategy under new CEO Mike Doustdar.A challenging U.S. marketAnother rationale for the board cull is that a new configuration would bring in more people with direct experience from a U.S. consumer perspective to help navigate the challenging market. It comes amid increasing competition both from Eli Lilly and so-called compounding pharmacies that make cheaper copycat version of the drugs, and a shift towards direct-to-consumer sales.  Like for many pharmaceutical companies, the U.S. is Novo's largest market. In the first nine months of 2025, the U.S. market accounted for 56% of total sales, measured in Danish kroner.Analysts, however, have expressed scepticism that the new board will bring in the intended experience. \"On balance, it might seem the new board actually possesses less rather than more commercial, large pharma expertise,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Papadakis said.Novo shares have fallen 12% since the board shakeup was announced and have lost 58% since the start of this year. Last week, the company reported third-quarter results that missed estimates, and lowered the upper range of its full-year guidance citing slower growth expectations for Ozempic and Wegovy.It's but one of many dramatic happenings taking place at the Danish pharma giant lately.Read more\"There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company,\" noted Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. \"With such a new direct-to-patient market emerging as a critical piece of future obesity drug sales growth, and compounders remaining a real competitor in the market, it's not hard to imagine that the boards and management might not have the same vision for how Novo should respond,\" she added.Over the weekend, Novo pulled out from a dramatic bidding war against U.S. giant Pfizer over an experimental weight-loss drug by clinical-stage biotech Metsera, stepping away from a deal analysts have described as unusual.The board changes come just months after Novo appointed Doustdar as chief executive, booting former CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, in part blaming him for the current trajectory of the company and its shares. Doustdar has since announced a reorganisation, including laying off over 10% of employees globally.",

    "body": "Tan Su Shan, chief executive officer of DBS Group Holdings Ltd., speaking at the Singapore Fintech Festival in Singapore, on Nov. 12, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSINGAPORE - Amid fears of an artificial intelligence bubble, much has been made of recent reports suggesting that AI has yet to generate returns for companies investing billions into adopting the tech. But that's not what the chief executive of Southeast Asia's largest bank is seeing — she says her firm is already reaping the rewards of its AI initiatives, and it's only just the beginning. \"It's not hope. It's now. It's already happening. And it will get even better,\" DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC  on the sidelines of Singapore Fintech Week, when asked about the promise of AI adoption.  DBS has been working to implement artificial intelligence across its bank for over a decade, which helped prepare its internal data analytics for recent waves of generative and agentic AI. Agentic AI is a type of artificial intelligence that relies on data to proactively make independent decisions, plan and execute tasks autonomously, with minimal human oversight.Tan expects AI adoption to bring DBS an overall revenue bump of more than 1 billion Singapore dollars (about $768 million) this year, compared to SG$750 million in 2024. That assessment is based on about 370 AI use cases powered by over 1,500 models throughout its business. \"The proliferation of generative AI has been transformative for us,\" Tan said, adding that the company was experiencing a \"snowballing effect\" of benefits thanks to machine learning. A major area in which DBS has applied AI is in its financial services to institutional clients, with AI used to collect and leverage data for clients in order to better contextualize and personalize offerings. According to Tan, this has resulted in \"faster and more resilient\" teams. The CEO believes that these uses of AI have contributed to a recent uptick in the bank's deposit growth as compared to competitors'.The company also recently launched a newly enhanced AI-powered assistant for corporate clients known as \"DBS Joy,\" which assists clients with unique corporate banking queries around the clock. ROI concerns Despite Tan's strong convictions about AI, recent evidence suggests that many companies are struggling to turn their AI investments into tangible profits. MIT released a report in July that found 95% of 300 publicly disclosed AI initiatives, encompassing generative AI investments of $30–$40 billion, had failed to achieve real returns. However, at least in the banking sector, there are signs that the tides are turning. While DBS doesn't differentiate spending in generative AI from other in-house investments, other major banks have recently offered this comparison. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon stated in an interview with Bloomberg TV last month that the bank is already breaking even on its approximately $2 billion of annual investments in AI adoption. That represents \"just the tip of the iceberg,\" he added.Those expectations are shared by DBS, which plans to continue to accelerate its AI development to become an AI-powered bank.The ultimate goal, according to Tan, is for its generative AI to develop into a trusted financial advisor for clients, including retail users who are expected to interact with personalized AI agents through the DBS banking app. The bank already has over 100 AI algorithms that analyze users' data to provide them with personalized \"nudges,\" such as alerts on incoming shortfalls, product recommendations, and other insights. Continued AI investments While DBS may already be reaping rewards from its AI adoption, Tan acknowledged that it will require continued investments, not only in capital, but in the time needed to reskill employees. The company has launched several AI reskilling initiatives across departments this year and has even deployed a generative AI-powered coaching tool to support these efforts. This will help the company automate mundane work and refocus its staff on building and maintaining human-to-human relationships with customers, rather than reducing headcount, Tan said. \"We're not freezing hiring, but it does mean reskilling. And that's a journey. It's a never-ending journey ... a constant evolution.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump is blaming the meat packers and U.S. cattlemen for rising beef prices, but the tariffs on beef from Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, feed, farm equipment and machinery are all adding to the price surge.The United States is a big buyer of Australian, Brazilian, and New Zealand beef exports.Brazil is the second-largest beef-producing country and the largest beef-exporting country in the world.Brazilian beef exports tracked by Panjiva plummeted in July and August after multiple tariffs resulted in a layered 76.4% total rate being implemented for Brazilian beef. Trump imposed a 50% tariff rate for many Brazilian goods in July. Beef exports have found a new home, being diverted to other markets like China.Exports of beef from Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay to the U.S. have also decreased as a result of tariffs.The pullback in exports has reduced supply and is adding to pressures in an already tight U.S. beef supply chain.\"When you impose an extra 50% tariff on a major supplier like Brazil, importers may keep buying and pass costs along, or they may stop buying, but that means less supply to meet the demand,\" said Dan Anthony, president of economic research firm Trade Partnership Worldwide. \"Either way, you expect prices to go up, especially when imports from Australia, New Zealand, Uruguay, and other key suppliers face new tariffs too,\" he added.The most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of September showed prices for a variety of uncooked beef products rising year over year between 12% and 18%.The compounding effect of tariffs comes at a time when the U.S. cattle herd is at near a 75-year low, and consumer demand for beef has grown.Beef cattle in a pasture at a ranch in Sonoita, Arizona, US, on Tuesday, Nov. 11, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCattle ranchers have had difficulties increasing the herd because of drought, which has diminished the amount of grasslands to feed their herds, and the higher costs in buying feed. Some imported fertilizers have faced double-digit tariffs, which have raised the cost of growing the crops (corn, soybeans) that are used in animal feed.Tariffs on essential items like steel and aluminum have also increased the cost of farm equipment (tractors, grain bins) and repairs.All of these added expenses carve out money from the coffers of ranchers and farmers that would be used for investing back into their operations.\"We're in one of the toughest cattle cycles in history,\" said sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III. \"We have the smallest pipeline of future cattle and even with today's prices, ranchers can't speed up the process to rebuild the national herd, which will take time, grass, and rain,\" he said.Replacement heifers are down to a 20-year low.Ranchers say it takes years to see a return on buying heifers.\"The fundamentals are tight, the runway is long, and the slightest shock makes an already fragile rebuild even harder,\" Clement said. \"This is a foreign concept to many other industries where production can be ramped up or down in weeks,\" he added.One of the biggest headwinds curtailing investment is the current political environment.\"Producers start second-guessing whether to hold back heifers or take the money today because uncertainty adds risk to ranchers wanting to retain or purchase heifers to rebuild their herds,\" Clement said.President Trump added to frustration among ranchers when he announced as part of a deal with Argentina in October having the country export beef into the United States to help lower beef prices, which the National Cattlemen's Beef Association said would harm rural America, comments that helped to sink the price of cattle futures.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconLive cattle futures trading chart year-to-date 2025 through November 13.\"We don't need Argentine beef because the U.S. already produces more high-quality beef than ever before,\" Clement said. \"The expanded Argentine quota entering our market, it would amount to less than half of one percent, about one extra hamburger per person, nowhere near enough to move the needle,\" he said.The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently acknowledged the dwindling herd numbers and announced a series of initiatives it hopes will encourage people to become cattlemen.The White House has become more focused on its affordability messaging in recent days after key GOP election losses around the country and Trump administration officials have said policies are coming to lower prices on some grocery staples not grown in the U.S. A group of coffee and banana-producing countries including Ecuador and Guatemala were included in a tariff removal plan the government said it had reached on Thursday.\"It's politically easy to slap tariffs on foreign competitors to defend domestic producers but the consumer usually ends up paying the cost,\" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer of OnePoint BFG Wealth Partners. \"Demand then shrinks, they eat chicken instead and the domestic producers end up no better off,\" he said.While there are many ranchers sitting on the sidelines waiting for better economic conditions and incentives to grow their herds, Clement is investing in his ranch and is continuing to buy heifers to grow his operation.\"Cattle are a great long-term investment and ranching is a great life,\" he said.In addition to climate and feed costs, U.S. cattle ranchers are concerned about the possible return of the New World Screwworm. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins led the largest USDA trade mission to Mexico to discuss measures for combating NWS.The parasitic fly lays eggs in the open wounds of warm-blooded animals. The larvae then hatches from the eggs and burrows into tissue of animals to feed on them. If caught early, the sick animal can be treated and survive. Human cases are rare but can be painful and require medical attention. This parasite was successfully eradicated from the United States in 1966, but some cattle in Mexico have been found infected with the parasite and all Mexican beef imports have been shuttered.All of these supply chain challenges have added to the pressure on beef prices.\"We will adapt to market changes and New World Screwworm as ranchers have always done, by staying steady and calm in the face of all of the challenges that ranchers have always faced,\" Clement said.",

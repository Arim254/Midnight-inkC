Yasser Al-zayyat | Afp | Getty ImagesGold and silver extended their sell-off Monday, deepening losses from last Friday's rout as a firmer dollar and profit-taking drains momentum from a rally that had propelled the precious metals to record highs just days earlier.Spot gold lost 5% on Monday before paring losses to trade down 1.8% to $4,777 per ounce, after having crashed nearly 10% on Friday, when prices plunged below $5,000 an ounce. Silver, which had surged alongside gold on safe haven demand and speculative inflows, also remained under pressure after last Friday's 30% nosedive that saw the metal log its worst day since March 1980.Spot prices of the white metal were down more than 12%, before paring losses to $83.4 per ounce as of 6:40 a.m. ET.The CME Group increased margin requirements following the steep sell-off last week, effective Monday after market close. Margins on COMEX gold futures have been raised to 8% from 6%, while those on the COMEX 5,000-ounce silver futures were lifted to 15% from 11%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold and silver extend sell-off after historic plungeAccording to analysts, the pullback follows from the violent reversal on Friday, when optimism around U.S. interest-rate cuts collided with a sudden reassessment of Federal Reserve leadership after President Donald Trump nominated former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh to succeed Chair Jerome Powell after his term ends in May.\"The 'Buy America' trade is back as a result, and the independence bid that drove gold and silver to nosebleed record heights right below $5,600 and $122 per ounce early Thursday morning is unraveling,\" José Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a note on Monday.Christopher Forbes, head of Asia and the Middle East at CMC Markets, said gold's sharp retreat reflects a classic correction after an extraordinary rally rather than a breakdown in the longer-term bullish thesis.Gold's retreat is a \"classic air-pocket after an extraordinary run,\" Forbes said. \"Profit-taking, a firmer dollar, and fresh geopolitical headlines from Washington have knocked froth off a crowded trade.\"The dollar index, which measures the strength of the greenback against a basket of currencies, has strengthened about 0.8% since Thursday.A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced gold less attractive for foreign buyers, while higher rates raise the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-paying yellow metal by making Treasurys more attractive as a safe haven.   Warsh has been an advocate of a tighter monetary policy, and his announcement as Fed chair has strengthened the dollar. At the same time, Trump's statements indicating a possible deal with Iran appear to have eased geopolitical concerns — WTI crude futures were down about 4% on Monday.In the near term, gold prices will remain elevated but volatile as markets await further clarity on Warsh's policy direction, Forbes said.Silver prices are still up around 16% since the start of the year, while gold prices are also about 8% higher year to date. Gold and silver both saw record-smashing rallies last year, surging about 65% and 145%, respectively.\"Renewed dollar weakness or confirmation of a dovish Warsh would bring dip-buyers back,\" said Forbes, who still maintains a bullish case for bullion in the longer 12 month horizon, adding that the metal can revisit recent highs, if the Fed continues easing while growth and inflation stay uneven.",

    "body": "India's government plans a modest improvement in its fiscal picture in the coming financial year, with reductions in the fiscal deficit and debt, while boosting manufacturing in sectors ranging from textiles to chips.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her ninth consecutive budget speech, said on Sunday that the government sees its fiscal deficit falling to 4.3% of GDP in the 2026-27 financial year, down from 4.4% in 2025-26.Sitharaman said the government expects India's debt-to-GDP ratio to fall to 55.6% in the coming financial year from 56.1% in 2025-26.The finance minister pointed to the wider uncertainties facing India.\"Today, we face an external environment in which trade and multilateralism are imperilled and access to resources and supply chains are disrupted,\" Sitharaman said. \"New technologies are transforming production systems while sharply increasing demands on water, energy and critical minerals.\"The government plans to encourage manufacturing in seven key sectors, including semiconductors, rare-earth magnets, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, capital goods, textiles and sports goods.India's benchmark Nifty 50 stock index was down about 1.7% shortly after Sitharaman's speech to parliament and closed 1.96% lower.In its economic survey for the financial year 2026 released on Thursday, India said it sees its economy growing between 6.8% to 7.2% in the fiscal year 2027, outpacing most other major economies.\"As a growing economy with expanding trade and capital needs, India must also remain deeply integrated with global markets, exporting more and attracting stable long-term investment,\" Sitharaman said.Consultancy firm PwC India said the budget places the country \"at a crossroads to push the nation into its next phase of transformation\".\"The Union Budget 2026-27 holds opportunities to set India's role towards financial stability, while boosting businesses to be future ready — especially as they navigate the opportunities of AI adoption alongside challenges around talent, infrastructure, governance and trust,\" PwC India said in an online commentary.",

    "body": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with Union Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary and other officials outside the Finance Ministry prior to the presentation of the Union Budget 2026-27 at Kartavya Bhavan on Feb. 1, 2026 in New Delhi, India.Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesIndia has announced a 20-year tax exemption for hyperscalers that use data centers in the country to service global clients, in a move that could shift artificial intelligence-driven businesses to the South Asian country.According to experts, cost of data center infrastructure is already low in India and coupled with the tax holiday it will make using data centers in India for global delivery more attractive for hyperscalers, compared to competing hubs including Singapore, UAE and Ireland.Hyperscalers refer to cloud computing giants such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud that are investing heavily in data center infrastructure that power AI models. \"This proposal will significantly increase the hyperscaler demand and major foreign firms will now find India a significantly cheaper base for global workloads,\" Riaz Thingna, partner, tax, regulatory and finance consulting at Grant Thornton Bharat, told CNBC. This move positions India not just as a \"consumption market\" for data center demand but as a \"global cloud computing and AI computing hub,\" Thingna said, adding that currently hyperscalers face \"corporate income tax exposure\" if they have \"significant economic presence\" in India. Currently, data center operations of foreign hyperscalers in India are considered permanent establishment and the profits arising from these operations are taxed at 35% plus surcharge and cess, explained Kumarmanglam Vijay, partner and head of practice-direct tax at legal firm JSA Advocates and Solicitors. Now, cloud services provided by global hyperscalers using data centers owned and operated by a local developer will be exempt from tax until 2047, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said during her budget speech on Sunday, adding that it will \"boost investment in data centers.\"India's role in the global AI race has been limited so far as it lacks strong local foundational models, chip manufacturing abilities and large data center capacities as compared to the U.S. and China.The proposed tax holiday and the investment it is likely to bring could accentuate India's role in global AI race at a time when the country is seeing increasing interest from tech behemoths that have announced billions in AI-related infrastructure investments.  India's Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the recently concluded World Economic Forum that India was \"making very good progress\" in all the five layers of AI architecture — applications, models, chip, infra and energy.Apart from attracting hyperscalers, India has been doubling down on its AI ambitions by incentivizing semiconductor design and production companies to set up in the country. Tax holidayThe tax exemption is likely to benefit Indian IT and cloud service firms such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL Tech and Jio, according to experts, as well as local data center developers.The tax holiday is \"a positive sign for sustained, cost-effective capacity creation,\" said Raju Vegesna, chairman at Indian data center developer Sify Technologies. Google, which has entered into a partnership with AdaniConneX, to build a $15 billion data center at a new artificial intelligence hub in southern India, is likely to be among the big beneficiaries of the proposed tax holiday.Last December, in under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure — details on local partners have not been shared by them.  Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comments, while Amazon Web Services declined to comment.Data center demand globally has surged in recent years, largely driven by the explosion in AI workloads, which require vast computing power, electrical power, cooling and networking infrastructure. More than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market so far in 2025.A server room at a data center in India.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia opportunityIndia's current data center capacity is around 1.2 gigawatts but the market is set to more than double, crossing 3 gigawatts within the next five years. According to a January report by real estate consultancy JLL, global data center capacity was 103 GW and is expected to double to 200GW by 2030 due to the AI boom.The tax holiday for foreign cloud companies will remove \"the single biggest friction point for global hyperscalers entering India,\" said Anshuman Magazine, CEO of India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa at real estate consultancy CBRE.Global capital inflows in India's data center space will \"increase substantially\" he said, as the tax incentive gives a 20-year runway to earn return on investment.As markets such as Japan, Australia, China and Singapore in the Asia Pacific region have matured, with, Singapore, one of the oldest data center hubs in the region, having limited room to deploy large-scale data centers due to land availability issues, India stands to gain, experts said.The country has abundant space for large-scale data center developments. When compared with data center hubs in Europe, power costs in India are relatively low. Coupled with India's growing renewable energy capacity — critical for power-hungry data centers — and the economics begin to look compelling.The tax holiday for foreign cloud service firms could do for India's cloud and data center ecosystem what the IT services incentives did in the early 2000s said S. Anjani Kumar, partner Deloitte India, adding that it will \"catalyze large-scale global investment, expand export revenues, and lead to long-term job and capability creation.\"",

    "body": "Walt Disney Co. signage on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Sept. 29, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDisney reported quarterly revenue and earnings on Monday that topped analyst expectations, lifted by its theme parks, resorts and cruises segment. The experiences unit reported more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, CFO Hugh Johnston told CNBC. Disney's domestic theme parks recorded $6.91 billion in revenue, while its international parks reported $1.75 billion in revenue, each up 7% compared to the prior-year period. In particular, Disney saw attendance rise at its domestic theme parks, while \"international visitation was softer,\" Johnston said. Here's how Disney performed in its fiscal first quarter, ended Dec. 27, compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.63 adjusted vs. $1.57 expectedRevenue: $25.98 billion vs. $25.74 billion expectedNet income for the quarter was $2.48 billion, or $1.34 per share, down from $2.64 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including tax charges related to a deal with Fubo, Disney reported $1.63 earnings per share. Overall revenue for Disney's fiscal first quarter was roughly $26 billion, up 5% year over year. In Disney's outlook for fiscal year 2026 the company said it's on track to repurchase $7 billion stock. It also expects double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share and $19 billion in cash provided by operations. For its fiscal second quarter, Disney said it expects its streaming unit – which consists of Disney+ and Hulu – to notch about $500 million in operating income, or an increase of roughly $200 million compared to the same period last year. Its experiences unit, however, is expected to see \"modest\" growth in operating income due to international visitation headwinds at domestic parks, as well as pre-launch costs for a new Disney Cruise line and pre-opening costs for \"World of Frozen\" at Disneyland Paris. Successor signs In the background of Disney's earnings report on Monday is the question of who will be named the successor to CEO Bob Iger. It's the second time Disney is choosing a replacement for Iger after naming Bob Chapek as CEO in 2020 and then swiftly firing him in 2022, bringing Iger back into the top spot. By that point, Disney's stock had declined as the company and Iger were faced with improving Disney's position in the theatrical landscape, as well as uplifting the parks. \"Turbocharging the parks, bringing streaming to profitability and double-digit margins, and improving the theatrical business, bodes well for a new CEO,\" said Johnston. Johnston declined to comment on speculation about who will replace Iger.Disney's board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on a successor to Iger, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The company has previously said it would announce a successor in the first quarter of this year. Two of Iger's deputies — Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney Experiences; and Dana Walden, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment — are seen as frontrunners in the succession race. D'Amaro, however, is running the profit driver for the company. Employees celebrate Disneyland Resort's 70th Anniversary. NYSEDuring Disney's fiscal first quarter the experiences division reported three times the operating income as the entertainment division. Experiences accounted for $3.31 billion in profit, 6% higher than the year-earlier period. In contrast, the entertainment division has long highlighted the declining business of Disney's traditional TV networks and recorded operating income of $1.1 billion, down 35% from the prior year. Streaming strength, sports pressureThe entertainment segment also includes streaming and theatrical releases. Overall revenue for the unit was $11.61 billion during the period, up 7% year over year. The company attributed the unit's revenue increase to higher subscription and affiliate fees, as well the inclusion of the Fubo transaction into Disney's earnings. Disney acquired a 70% stake in the internet TV bundle provider in a deal that closed in October. Disney has also seen an uptick in its theatrical unit, especially after dominating the box office in 2025. The company noted \"Zootopia 2\" as well as the new installments in the \"Avatar\" and \"Predator\" franchises during the quarter. This marked the first quarter that Disney stopped reporting some details for the entertainment segment, such as breaking down revenue and operating income for its linear TV networks, streaming and theatrical businesses. Disney also stopped reporting streaming subscriber numbers this quarter, following Netflix's lead last year. Disney said revenue in its streaming business was up 11% to $5.35 billion during the fiscal first quarter. Disney has made various changes on the streaming front recently. Last year, ESPN launched its direct-to-consumer streaming platform, and Disney began its integration of Hulu into Disney+. Investors will be keen for updates on ESPN's streaming service and any effects of price hikes and changes on Disney+ when executives hold an earnings call at 8:30 a.m. ET.Disney now breaks out ESPN into the sports segment, separate from its other linear TV networks, movie business and Disney+ and Hulu. Revenue for the sports segment was up 1% to $4.91 billion, while operating income decreased 23% to $191 million. The sports segment was weighed down by an increase in programming and production costs for new sports rights agreements, as well as the decline in subscription and affiliate fees due to the loss of traditional bundle subscribers. Advertising revenue grew, however, due to higher rates. The unit was also affected by the temporary blackout of Disney's networks on YouTube TV during the fall, which led to an impact of about $110 million to its operating income. ",

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

Bitcoin fell as low as $74,876 but later pared some of the losses.

Bitcoin fell below $80,000 over the weekend.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe price of bitcoin over the last year. Dessislava Ianeva, research analyst at crypto exchange Nexo, told CNBC that bitcoin's drawdown \"coincided with a broader risk-off shift across global markets\" and \"was amplified by structurally thin weekend liquidity, rather than by crypto-specific developments or signs of fundamental stress.\"Bitcoin often correlates with risk assets like stocks and may fall and rise with them.  U.S. stocks fell on Friday, led by tech names such as Microsoft, which fell 10% after its earnings disappointed investors.That negativity filtered through to European and Asian stock markets on Monday.Gold and silver extended losses on Monday. On Friday, silver fell 30%, its worst day since March 1980.Bitcoin's plunge was worsened by forced liquidations, when traders' positions are automatically sold as it hits a certain price. More than $2 billion of bitcoin long and short positions have been liquidated since Thursday, according to data from Coinglass.Liquidations can have a cascading effect on crypto markets, where the price can move quickly to the downside as traders' positions are closed out.Investors are also assessing the potential impact of Kevin Warsh, who will succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.Last week, digital asset investment products recorded a second consecutive week of outflows totaling $1.7 billion, according to CoinShares. Year-to-date outflows now total $1 billion, \"signalling a marked deterioration in investor sentiment towards the asset class,\" James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, said in a note on Monday.Yuya Hasegawa, an analyst at Japanese crypto firm Bitbank, told CNBC that the recent Bitcoin selloff \"appears to have been driven by a combination of rising geopolitical risk, a decline in tech equities triggered by Microsoft, and a breakdown in precious metals— one of the few remaining safe-haven outlets for investor capital in recent weeks.\"While Bitcoin has sometimes been touted as an asset to invest in during market volatility, it is down around 22% over the last year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe price of gold versus bitcoin over the last year. Other cryptocurrencies were also lower on Monday after a sell-off over the last few days, including ether and XRP.On Saturday, liquidations across cryptocurrencies were worth $2.56 billion, making it the tenth-biggest single-day event, according to Coinglass data.Could Bitcoin fall further?Crypto market participants told CNBC last month that bitcoin volatility was to be expected this year, with forecasts for the price veering from $75,000 to above $200,000.Bitbank's Hasegawa said that a \"short-term bottom\" in bitcoin may be approaching at around $70,000, which could be a \"key reference point.\"\"A sustained move materially below that level would likely require a meaningful reset in market conditions,\" Hasegawa added.However, some think bitcoin could fall significantly further. John Blank, chief equity strategist at Zacks, said bitcoin could hit $40,000 this year.\"We can get there very quickly, or more likely, we are going to get there over the next six to eight months,\" Blank told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday.Blank said he reached that figure by looking at the lows and highs of previous cycles. Bitcoin has previously fallen between 70% and 80% from all-time highs during past \"crypto winters.\" Its record high stands at $126,000, which it hit in October. $40,000 would mark a roughly 70% plunge from that level.

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

On Saturday, he told reporters that Iran was \"seriously talking\" with the U.S.His comments came after Iran's top security official Ali Larijani said on X that preparations for negotiations were under way.Oil prices rose to a six-month high recently amid fears the United States could carry out a military strike against Iran. Washington last week deployed a \"massive Armada\" toward Iran, a move that raised fears of a confrontation with the Middle Eastern country.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices in the past yearGlobal benchmark Brent fell 4.96% to $65.88 a barrel as of 3.22 a.m. ET. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were about 5% lower at $61.76 per barrel.Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, said the renewed slide in prices follows reports that Washington and Tehran have been communicating through intermediaries, raising hopes that tensions could ease rather than spiral.\"The talks are happening at the same time Iran is threatening a regional war should they be attacked, which could lead to substantially higher oil prices, an outcome that the Trump Administration would like to avoid,\" he told CNBC.Marko Papic, BCA Research macro and geopolitical strategist, added that the U.S. administration's sensitivity to oil prices could act as a brake on further escalation. \"I do think that President Trump is concerned that if oil prices go up to, you know, $70-$80, he's going to get even further into a hole ahead of the midterms.\"The U.S. faces midterm elections later this year, and fuel prices have traditionally been a sensitive political issue for voters.Diplomatic feelers also come at a time when additional supply is quietly entering the market. Venezuelan crude, much of it drawn from offshore and onshore inventories rather than new production, is adding to available barrels, even as global oil production continues to exceed demand.Both experts said those flows are helping cap prices even as OPEC+ continues to manage output carefully.\"While additional quantities of Venezuelan oil are coming to market as offshore and on shore inventories are liquidated and sold, the oil market will also continue to be supported by OPEC+ decision to hold steady its current production levels,\" said Lipow.The oil cartel on Sunday decided to leave production levels unchanged for March, extending a three-month supply freeze.

The funding will be raised in debt and equity.On Jan. 26, an analyst note from TD Cowen said that their \"channel checks\" indicated that Oracle was considering laying off 20,000 to 30,000 employees which could drive around $8 billion to $10 billion of incremental free cash flow.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOracle stock over the past year.Oracle had not responded to a request for comment from CNBC when this article went live.The note added that layoffs were one of the \"multiple paths forward\" the company was considering. The others included asset divestures to reduce its debt load and vendor financing. Oracle has made huge bets on the AI infrastructure rollout in recent times. In September, it raised $18 billion in a bond sale and inked a $300 billion deal with OpenAI. Investors have flagged concerns over Oracle's aggressive AI buildout plans and debt raising. Oracle's stock has dropped 50% since its peak in September.

He added that the likely binary outcome of this massive investment is forcing investors to either back stocks or sell them.\"The problem for Oracle,\" Field added, is that it's \"diluting the holding of existing shareholders and taking more debt to fuel this investment, hence the dismay by investors.\"AI data buildout is a flashpoint this earnings seasonOn Thursday, Microsoft shares tumbled 10% after investors latched onto the growth of its cloud computing platform Azure and other cloud services falling slightly below expectations, though many analysts remained bullish.

    "body": "Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market.According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a \"structural shift in consumer attention\", with such content thriving in Latin America.Globally, the number of downloads of short-drama platforms surged by 186% year-on-year, to 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, surpassing those of video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, at 658 million, according to the report.Short dramas, also known as \"micro\", or \"mini\" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long.\"The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity\", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department.First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others.Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC.Such content is often \"easier to digest\" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower.Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is \"emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement\" with these videos.Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah.Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia.Dramatic growthShort drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah.While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China.ReelShort is owned by Crazy Maple Studio, a content creation and distribution enterprise founded in 2017 in San Francisco. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate.Micro drama custom thumb for digital video.ReelShort | GoodShort | DramaBox | Getty ImagesSimilarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025.ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market.Omdia estimates that the total revenue generated by the Latin American market grew by 9.1% between 2024 to 2025 - more than triple the revenue growth in the U.S. over the same period. That growth is projected to accelerate to 10.7% in 2026.Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah.Short-drama platforms aren't the only beneficiaries of the growing Latin American market. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report.While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix.\"Not now, and it is not their targets either. They are aiming for different audiences, and their profit manners are different,\" Tang told CNBC.While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete.Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. In comparison, Netflix reported $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2025.Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market.\"I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars,\" says Sensor Tower's Shah.",

    "body": "Movie posters for the documentary \"Melania\" featuring U.S. first lady Melania Trump are displayed in a New York City subway station, in New York, U.S., Jan. 14, 2026. Jeenah Moon | ReutersAmazon's \"Melania\" earned $7 million at the domestic box office during its debut this weekend, the highest opening for a non-music documentary in more than a decade.Documentaries are not typically major ticket sales drivers, with the majority of releases over the last 10 years opening under $5 million and grossing $10 million to $20 million worldwide, according to data from Comscore. Documentaries and concert films by popular musical artists often outperform these numbers because of their built-in fan bases.Notably, Michael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" retains the record for the highest-opening political documentary with $23.9 million. The film, which opened in 2004, also holds the record for the highest domestic haul for a political documentary with $119 million.\"We're very encouraged by the strong start and positive audience response, with early box office for 'Melania' exceeding our expectations,\" said Kevin Wilson, head of domestic theatrical distribution at Amazon MGM Studios. \"This momentum is an important first step in what we see as a long-tail lifecycle for both the film and the forthcoming docu-series, extending well beyond the theatrical window and into what we believe will be a significant run for both on our service.\"The Melania Trump documentary was acquired by the tech giant, which operates the streaming service Prime Video, for an estimated $40 million, and reports suggest the company spent nearly the same price tag on marketing for the film.Ticket sales were driven by women and moviegoers over 55, with both demographics accounting for 70% or more of receipts. Additionally, rural theaters represented 46% of total box office grosses, according to EntTelligence data. Typically, these theaters, which operate in areas with populations of fewer than 500,000 people, account for around 30% of movie ticket sales.EntTelligence estimates that 600,000 moviegoers saw the film over the weekend.While review sites have been flooded with strong audience reviews — Rotten Tomatoes' \"Popcornmeter\" stands at 99% from more than 500 users — critical responses were more scathing. \"Melania\" holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 19 reviews, with many critics calling the documentary \"propaganda.\"Disclosure: Versant Media is the parent company of Rotten Tomatoes and CNBC.",

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks to the media as he arrives for a meeting with the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill on December 3, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesNvidia's stock fell in premarket trading Monday after reports emerged that the chipmaker's plans to invest $100 billion into OpenAI were stalled. The semiconductor giant's shares was down 1.8% as of 6:30 a.m. ET. Company insiders said there was uncertainty about a deal between Nvidia and OpenAI, according to a Wall Street Journal on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.Nvidia announced an agreement with OpenAI in September to build at least 10 gigawatts of computing power for OpenAI, as well as an investment of up to $100 billion. However, Huang had said to industry associates late last year that the $100 billion investment was non-binding and not finalized. The longtime CEO also criticized a lack of discipline in OpenAI's business strategy and shared concerns about competition from firms like Alphabet's Google and Anthropic, according to WSJ's report. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia shares year-to-dateOver the weekend, Huang denied any claims he was unhappy with OpenAI, calling it \"nonsense,\" but reiterated that the investment won't be over $100 billion. \"We are going to make a huge investment in OpenAI. I believe in OpenAI, the work that they do is incredible, they are one of the most consequential companies of our time, and I really love working with Sam,\" he said regarding OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman.\"Sam is closing the round (of investment), and we will absolutely be involved,\" Huang added in comments reported by Bloomberg. \"We will invest ‍a great deal of money, probably the largest investment we've ever made.\"Why the stock droppedSarah Kunst, managing director at Cleo Capital, told CNBC's \"Worldwide Exchange\" on Monday that a cause for concern was uncertainty over the exact amount that would be invested in OpenAI.\"One of the things I did notice about Jensen Huang is that there wasn't a strong 'It will be $100 billion. It was, 'It will be big. It will be our biggest investment ever.' And so I do think there are some question marks there... that kind of back and forth isn't normal between an investor and a startup to play out in the media,\" Kunst added. ",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

Aaron Schwartz | ReutersHouse Speaker Mike Johnson on Sunday said he believes he has the votes to end the partial government shutdown by Tuesday, with the House set to take up a Senate-approved spending package this week. \"Let's say I'm confident that we'll do it at least by Tuesday,\" the Louisiana Republican said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" The U.S. government partially shut down on Saturday morning after Congress failed to approve a spending package and send it to President Donald Trump by the Jan. 30 deadline. Senate Democrats demanded changes to the package that the House originally passed after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota. Democrats ultimately had the Department of Homeland Security funding stripped from the package and replaced with two-week stopgap funding for the agency. Now, the amended package has to be reapproved by the House.The House is set to begin taking up the bill on Monday. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, the first step in that process.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

House Democrats are demanding assurances that changes to DHS's immigration operations will be finalized before voting on the spending package. \"Well, we're going to have that conversation later on today and as we return to Washington. But the one thing that we've said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on ABC's \"This Week\" when asked how he and Democrats will vote. \"The administration can't just talk the talk. They need to walk the walk. That should begin today. Not in two weeks, today,\" he said.Sources familiar with the matter told MS NOW over the weekend that Jeffries spoke with Johnson and said Democrats will not provide the votes to fast-track the spending package, potentially jeopardizing the end of the shutdown this week.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he will vote against the package when it comes to the floor. \"I'm not just a no, I'm a firm no, and I'm going to advocate with colleagues that they vote no,\" Khanna said. \"I just in good conscience cannot vote to give more money to ICE agents as they're violating our constitutional rights.\"Democratic resistance to the package makes Johnson's job of pushing the package through significantly harder. He has a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House, set to dwindle further after Democrat Christian Menefee won a special election in Texas. \"I have a one-vote margin, yes, for the rest of 2026,\" Johnson said. \"But we're going to demonstrate once again that this is the party that takes governing seriously.\"In addition to the stopgap for DHS, the package includes bills to fully fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through the remainder of the fiscal year.This story is developing.

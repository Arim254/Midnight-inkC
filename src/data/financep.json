    "body": "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president, arrives for a hearing at the Constitutional Court of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's special prosecutor has requested the death penalty for former President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived martial law declaration in 2024. The request came as Yoon's trial wrapped up late Tuesday. The court is expected to deliver its ruling on Feb. 19. Yoon has been charged with leading an insurrection, a crime that is not shielded by presidential immunity and carries the maximum penalty of death. If carried out, it would be South Korea's first execution in almost 30 years.Amnesty International has classified the country as \"abolitionist in practice,\" noting that while South Korea still retains the death penalty, it has not executed anyone since 1997.During the final hearing, special counsel Cho Eun-suk's team said that Yoon declared martial law \"with the purpose of remaining in power for a long time by seizing the judiciary and legislature,\" according to South Korean media reports. Yoon reportedly maintained his innocence, saying the declaration was within his constitutional authority and was intended to \"safeguard freedom and sovereignty.\"At the time, Yoon accused the then-opposition Democratic Party of Korea of engaging in \"anti-state activities\" and colluding with \"North Korean communists.\"On Dec 3, 2024, Yoon ordered troops to the country's National Assembly after declaring martial law in a late-night address. Soldiers blocked access and clashed with protesters and lawmakers as special forces attempted to enter the chamber.But within three hours, the martial law order was overturned after 190 of the 300 National Assembly lawmakers managed to gather in the chamber and unanimously voted to overturn the decree. Yoon eventually lifted martial law about six hours after announcing it.The last military coup in South Korea occurred in 1979, when the then-army general Chun Doo-hwan seized control following the assassination of President Park Chung-hee.Chun later expanded martial law nationwide in 1980, a move that led to the 1980 Gwangju uprising, during which troops violently suppressed protests in the southwestern city of Gwangju that left anywhere between 200 and 2,000 civilians killed. At the time, Chun's government accused the uprising of being instigated by \"North Korean communists and gangsters.\"In 1996, Chun was handed the death penalty for his role in the 1979 coup, though his sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment.",

    "description": "Wages have largely kept up with inflation since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 — but for many workers, it hasn't felt like much of a win.Price ",
    "body": "Wages have largely kept up with inflation since the Covid-19 pandemic started in 2020 — but for many workers, it hasn't felt like much of a win.Price increases and pay gains have seesawed over the past five years, leaving inflation-adjusted wages roughly flat overall since 2020.Meanwhile, inflation reached a post-pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but has since cooled. New inflation data released Tuesday shows consumer prices rose by a year-over-year rate of 2.7% in December, according to the Consumer Price Index, which tracks the prices of things people buy regularly, from groceries and rent to gasoline and medical care. That brings it closer to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, but even so, inflation has remained above that level since February 2021, and many households are feeling the squeeze.Slower inflation doesn't mean prices are falling — it means they're rising more slowly. Since early 2020, cumulative CPI inflation is up by roughly 25%, marking one of the fastest increases in decades. Those higher prices are now part of everyday household budgets, especially for essentials like food and housing.\"Even though inflation has moderated, prices continue to rise, keeping it a persistent source of frustration,\" Stephen Kates, a financial analyst at Bankrate, tells CNBC Make It.Wages have caught up — but only barelyAfter falling behind during the inflation surge, wage growth has outpaced inflation over the past two years, allowing pay to catch up by most measures. Even so, over the full period since the pandemic began, inflation-adjusted wages show little net improvement overall.Since the first quarter of 2020, wages adjusted for CPI have been largely flat across several common measures, according to analysis from the Hamilton Project, a nonpartisan economic research group.Those measures include the closely watched Employment Cost Index, which tracks pay changes for the same set of jobs over time, making it a useful way to see how wages are rising relative to inflation, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. ECI, along with other common measures, show the total inflation-adjusted change since early 2020:Employment Cost Index: –0.19%Median weekly earnings: +0.41%Average hourly earnings: +0.44%Total compensation, including benefits: +1.25%Taken together, the data show that inflation-adjusted wage growth since 2020 has been close to zero.But for many workers, \"flat\" wages don't feel flat — they feel lagging. Take median weekly earnings, for instance: Inflation-adjusted pay is only slightly higher than it was five years ago, amounting to gains for some workers and little or none for many others.Kates says those uneven outcomes become clearer when wages are broken down by income level. Wage growth for lower-paid workers has slowed more sharply than for higher earners in recent years, based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. For households with less room in their budgets, slower wage growth makes it harder to absorb higher prices for everyday necessities.\"Median wage data masks various outcomes across the total population of workers. When wages are broken out by quartile, the lowest-income earners are seeing little to no inflation-adjusted growth,\" says Kates.For many workers, \"it feels like stagnation because it is,\" he says.The combination of modest wage gains and higher price levels may help explain why sentiment around household finances remains weak. In a November poll of 1,114 Americans from YouGov, 53% said their household income is just keeping up with expenses, while 32% said they are falling behind.Similarly, 62% of employed Americans say their income hasn't kept up with household expenses, according to a December Bankrate survey. Among those who don't expect their finances to improve in 2026, 65% cited inflation as the main reason, compared with about 30% who pointed to factors like government policies or stagnant income.For many Americans, flat real wages mean they're no longer losing ground as quickly — but they're not getting ahead either.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged that disconnect. Speaking in December, he said many households are still grappling with \"embedded higher cost due to higher inflation in 2022 and '23,\" even as inflation slows.\"We're going to need to have some years where real compensation is higher, significantly positive ... for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" Powell said.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks at the Detroit Economic Club in Detroit, Jan. 13, 2026.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersAs the Justice Department continues its investigation into the Federal Reserve, the next front in the central bank's quest to maintain political independence shifts to the Supreme Court. On Jan. 21, the high court will hear arguments related to President Donald Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.Administration officials last year accused Cook of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting which property was her primary residence on mortgage applications. Trump tried to remove Cook from her position but thus far has been prevented by courts. Should the White House win the case, it could set an important precedent for the president's ongoing attempt to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\"If the Court rules against Cook, that would significantly raise the probability that Powell could also be removed based on the DoJ investigation,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a note. \"We have been arguing that the Cook case is more important for the policy trajectory than the identity of the next Fed Chair. We think that's even more true now.\"The stakes were raised in the Fed saga when Powell announced Sunday that he'd been served with Justice Department subpoenas regarding a controversial multimillion-dollar renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in Washington. The probe reportedly focuses on whether Powell lied about the project during congressional testimony last year.Trump has been a fierce Powell critic and toyed last year with the idea of firing him. Powell has insisted that Trump can't remove him, but if the president can establish cause, that could change. On the surface, the effort to remove Powell seems academic: His term as chair expires in May and Trump then is free to submit a new nominee. However, Powell's term on the Board of Governors runs into 2028, meaning he could stay on and be an obstacle to Trump's efforts to get the Fed to lower rates \"MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" as he stated in a social media post Tuesday.However, it also could provide further incentive for Powell to serve out his term on the board as a bulwark against Trump's efforts to thwart the Fed's independence from political manipulation. For his part, Powell has mostly resisted commenting on Trump's criticism, which has been intensely personal and biting at times. While other presidents have tried to coerce the Fed into easing policy, Trump stands alone in how public and aggressive he has been. Moreover, this is the first time the Justice Department ever has gone after a sitting Fed chair.Longer-term consequencesThe circumstances could add up to a prolonged battle in which Powell decides to stay on, several analysts say.Deutsche Bank drew parallels between Powell and former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles — whose name is now on a Fed building — who decided to stay on as governor after President Harry Truman removed him in 1948. Eccles stayed on as governor until 1951 and was a voice in favor of central bank independence.Moreover, a revolt within the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates for the Fed, even could see Powell maintained as chair though Trump could name a separate chair to run the central bank itself.\"While this was never a base case, and indeed it seemed like a relatively remote possibility, this weekend's events likely increase the probability that Powell could choose to remain at the Fed,\" Deutsche Bank chief U.S. economist Matthew Luzzetti said in a client note. \"Indeed, if the administration insists on following through with a criminal prosecution of Chair Powell, and Senate Republicans stand firm in not advancing nominees to the Federal Reserve Board, it is likely the FOMC would choose Powell to remain on as chair.\"That circles back to the Cook hearing. Should Trump prevail, he could use it as justification to remove Powell. Should Cook win, it sets up a protracted battle of wills between the Fed and White House that could have important policy implications.Markets are watching for clues about the Fed's moves, with traders betting heavily against any action at the policy meeting later this month. Instead, they see the next cut not coming until June, according to CME Group data.The Cook decision \"will carry immense weight when it comes to any president's ability to shape the structure of the Fed,\" wrote Kevin Gordon, head of macro research and strategy at Charles Schwab. \"Make no mistake, though: Even though the magnitude of various markets' moves in response to the Powell news has been limited, the direction (dollar down, stocks down, bonds down) is indicative of how these shocks are to be digested if they persist over the long term.\"",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBCIn the final stretch of his tenure atop Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett was still pursuing that elusive elephant.The 95-year-old legendary investor, who handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel at the start of 2026, made it clear that deal size was not the constraint, it was lack of opportunities.\"It's external circumstances. Believe me if after we get finished talking you say, 'I've got a great $100 billion new idea.' I would say, 'Let's talk,'\" Buffett told Becky Quick in a special interview in May after he said he was stepping down at the end of the year. The never-before-seen interview is part of the \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" special airing Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET. on CNBC. The remarks underscore a central paradox at Berkshire today. The company is awash in liquidity, with its cash hoard swelling to a record $381.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, but Buffett found no opportunities in 2025 large enough to move the needle at prices he considers sensible.\"It means that when I look at the stock market, when I look at companies of a size that would make any difference to our total, I don't see anything. Well, we're buying one or two things, but it's peanuts. But I'm willing to spend $100 billion this afternoon, you know,\" Buffett, now chairman, told CNBC.In October, Berkshire closed a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's chemical business, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash, marking its largest purchase since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Berkshire's cash has grown significantly after Buffett aggressively dumped enormous pieces of his two largest holdings, Apple and Bank of America. Buffett doesn't want to be sitting on this much cash. He has long warned that cash is a poor long-term asset, even as he insists on holding ample reserves to weather unforeseen shocks.\"I'd rather have $100 billion and a really good business at a sensible price than have $100 billion in cash,\" he said. \"At certain levels, cash is necessary, but cash is not a good asset.\"He likened liquidity to oxygen, cheap to maintain and catastrophic to run out of at the wrong moment.\"You always want to have enough,\" Buffett said. \"You don't have to pay a lot for it. But you do need oxygen. And cash is that way. You always need to have it available because you do not know what will happen. I do not know what the stock market will do, and I do not know what business will do.\"Abel has been a longtime lieutenant who played a central role in several of Berkshire's acquisitions particularly in energy, and helped transform Berkshire Hathaway Energy into a powerhouse.While Abel's deal-making credentials are established, Berkshire shareholders may not extend him the same patience they have long afforded Buffett. With the conglomerate sitting on a mountain of cash and shares underperforming the market, pressure to deploy capital could quickly become a defining challenge for the new CEO.",

    "body": "When it comes to identifying great ideas, billionaire Barry Diller has a simple piece of advice: Don't be a cynic.Diller is a big fan of \"creative conflict\" group brainstorming sessions, he said in an interview for an episode of CNBC's \"Leaders Playbook,\" set to air on Wednesday. In a creative conflict setting, team members passionately argue about an idea, weighing differing opinions for however long it takes to reach a decision. It can be \"loud and argumentative ... and somewhat brutal,\" but \"I think it's a great environment,\" he said.For group brainstorming to work effectively, resulting in top-tier ideas, you'll need to genuinely consider other people's opinions, said Diller, chairman and senior executive of holding company IAC and travel technology company Expedia Group.\"You have to try and be naive,\" said Diller, 83, who also co-founded the Fox Broadcasting Company. \"You cannot be cynical. Cynicism kills everything. You have to force naivete.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsIf you're cynical, you may think your team member is pitching an idea that only benefits them — or that since you've been at your organization the longest, you naturally know more than the next person.Instead of being dismissive, go into these ideation sessions with a beginner's attitude, said Diller, who has an estimated net worth of $5.5 billion, according to Forbes. That doesn't mean being foolish, ignorant or easily steamrolled — rather, you're open to fresh perspectives, learning something new and being challenged.\"I've always held on to being a dopey naive as much as I can,\" said Diller. \"You know, as you go through life, you just get more sophisticated and the natural tendencies get more cynical. If you want to use your instincts, you have to brush that clean every day practically.\"How listening can help you make difficult decisionsThe value of considering your colleagues' unconventional ideas can go beyond brainstorming.In the interview, Diller discussed IAC's purchase of a majority stake in Expedia. In July 2001, Diller made a deal to buy a 75% stake in Expedia for about $1 billion. Two months later, before the deal was completed, the September 11 terrorist attacks halted U.S. travel almost entirely.Expedia had \"zero revenue for a while, and it came back relatively quickly, but at that critical moment, when we had to make the decision, there was no business,\" said Diller. \"Several people said, 'This is not the time to pay over a billion dollars for something that, right now, is so completely unpredictable' ... But someone in the room, when we were talking about this, at the height of the argument, said, 'If there's life, there's travel.'\"\"As soon as I heard it, I said, 'Close [the deal]. I'm betting on that if there's life, there's travel ... and if there isn't life, then who cares anyway?' And that was it. It was very binary.\"Diller's IAC finally acquired Expedia in August 2003, and Diller helped steer the company through the Great Recession and the Covid-19 pandemic.

Juliette Pavy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLONDON — European stocks opened in broadly positive territory on Wednesday as investors in the region focus on an upcoming meeting between U.S., Greenlandic and Danish officials to discuss the Arctic island's future.Shortly after the opening bell, the pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.3% higher, with most sectors and major regional bourses moving upward. All eyes will be on a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Greenlandic and Danish officials on Wednesday, with talks set to focus on President Donald Trump's repeated advances toward \"acquiring\" the semi-autonomous Danish territory.Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly said the Arctic island is not for sale, but Trump has mooted the possibility of using military force to seize the mineral-rich island. Read moreIn corporate news, oil giant BP warned on Wednesday that it expects to take impairment charges of between $4 billion and $5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2025. The company said those charges were related to its gas and low carbon energy units, and would be excluded from underlying replacement cost profit. It also warned that it expects its oil trading result to be weaker in the period, compared to the third quarter.BP's London-listed shares were last seen trading 0.8% lower. Elsewhere, European ammunition maker Czechoslovak Group said Wednesday morning that it plans to list in Amsterdam in the coming weeks, at a potential valuation of around 30 billion euros ($34.94 billion). The company expects to benefit from a regional defense spending super cycle amid rising geopolitical uncertainty. Early commitments from funds including Artisan Partners, BlackRock and Al-Rayyan already total 900 million euros, as firms race to gain exposure to what could become one of Europe's most valuable defense businesses.Defense stocks inched higher on Wednesday, with the regional Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense index gaining 0.2% in early trade amid rising tensions related to Greenland, widespread and violent protests in Iran — and the promise of intervention from the U.S. if protesters are executed — and the fallout from Washington's ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last week. Overnight, Japanese indexes hit record highs on expectations that Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi could call for a snap election, likely in February. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures were little changed Tuesday night after the S&P 500 pulled back from record levels seen earlier in the week.There are no major earnings or data releases in Europe on Wednesday.— CNBC's Michael Considine and Olivia Levieux contributed to this article.

    "body": "Big Tech has been on an energy hiring spree.Technology companies investing heavily in artificial intelligence are bolstering their workforce with energy experts as they look to overcome the biggest bottleneck in scaling AI: access to power.Energy-related hiring jumped 34% year-on-year in 2024, according to data compiled by Workforce.ai for CNBC. Last year's hiring almost matched this pace and remained 30% higher than pre-AI levels of 2022, when ChatGPT was released late in the year.Energy is increasingly important to Big Tech companies whose AI ambitions hinge on securing power for insatiable data centers. Data centers accounted for around 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024 – representing a 12% year-on-year rise over the last five years, per the International Energy Agency. Demand is widely anticipated to increase further in line with the build-out of infrastructure.Meeting that demand is one of Big Tech's biggest hurdles, leading companies to bring energy knowledge in-house and build their own supply — and, in some cases, gobbling up whole companies along the way.It marks a step-change from traditional sustainability roles, which boomed in the Inflation Reduction Act era but lost steam amid broader ESG backlash that intensified as U.S. President Donald Trump's second term got underway. Instead, operational roles have been in demand: energy procurement, markets, grid interface and strategy, according to energy recruiters who spoke with CNBC.Microsoft is a quiet winner of the talent war, with over 570 additions since 2022, including Betsy Beck who joined in January last year as director of energy markets. She previously held an energy markets and policy role at Google. Microsoft also snapped up General Electric's former CFO Carolina Dybeck Happe back in 2024 to be the firm's chief operating officer — perhaps an early indication of the mega-cap's playbook. It is second only to Amazon, which has notched 605 energy-related hires, though this data includes its subsidiary AWS.Google has played catch-up to its Silicon Valley neighbors when it comes to AI – and it appears to be paying off as shares in its parent company, Alphabet, have been on a tear. Its market capitalization surpassed Apple's for the first time since 2019 on last week. The technology giant's energy strategy — which has seen the addition of 340 hires since 2022 — has also garnered attention. Eric Schubert, an energy regulatory affairs advisor who previously worked with BP for nearly 14 years, joined Google in January, per his LinkedIn profile. Google brought Duke University researcher Tyler Norris on board in November to head up energy market innovation, and is still growing its energy market and policy team. Targeting energy and data center know-howAs well as individual talent grabs, Big Tech has snapped up energy-related companies while simultaneously scaling work with contractors. Notably, Alphabet is set to acquire data center company Intersect in a $4.75 billion cash deal that includes the assumption of debt.Project and construction managers and people with land acquisition roles are increasingly in demand but are being serviced with temporary contracts to oversee the initial build-out of infrastructure for these tech giants, rather than via permanent employees, according to Daniel Smart, group CEO of The Green Recruitment Company. \"There are tech companies that are turning into energy companies,\"Daniel Smartgroup CEO of The Green Recruitment CompanySuch companies are comfortable owning, funding, and running energy projects, \"but they've never built one before, it's not really their core business,\" Smart said. \"So they'll outsource the construction of it, and possibly even outsource the running of it and just buy the energy. So there's different models and different ways in which they do it.\" \"Phase two\" will be to try to improve the energy efficiency of data centers — perhaps leading to more permanent roles — he added, but it's not a current priority as \"there's such a scramble for just getting the energy.\" It could spell trouble for utilities and other energy companies now battling Big Tech's deep pockets for acquiring talent. watch nowJeff Anderson, business development director of a renewable energy recruitment consultancy Taylor Hopkinsons, said his team is \"talking to senior candidates from the energy infrastructure space who are becoming aware of the opportunities in data centres and the higher salaries on offer in tech, and are making enquiries and plans to move across long-term.\"\"In the short-term, the talent market is going to be tight. The skillsets the tech companies are hiring — energy strategy, PPAs, grid connection — are already in demand across renewables and utilities. The talent is there, but it's a finite pool and that means competition for specialists that have tangible project experience is going to increase,\" he added. For Travis Miller, senior equities energy and utilities analyst at Morningstar, increased energy demand actually offers \"big opportunities\" for utilities and their workforce as tech companies turn to them for support rather than seeing them as acquisition targets. \"That's the most efficient way to do it from a workforce perspective and from an infrastructure perspective,\" Miller told CNBC.Read more\"It's such a large amount of energy that they can't do it themselves,\" he added. Big Tech has secured power purchase agreements with a range of companies, including those working on nuclear energy. On Friday, Meta announced that it has signed deals with small modular reactor company Oklo — which was taken public via Sam Altman's special purpose acquisition company in 2024 — and Vistra and Terrapower. Oklo and Vistra saw their share prices pop over 17% on the news. That said, Meta also filed an application to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission back in November to become an electricity trader. Amazon, Google and Microsoft already have approval to do so, meaning they can sell excess power from their own supply back to the grid.\"There are tech companies that are turning into energy companies,\" Smart said, though he added that this is only for their own use right now. \"But, then, they can also then sell any additional energy that they're making to neighbors or to the grid – if they can get connectivity.\"",

Forty-four of those deliveries were 737 Maxes, Boeing said Tuesday.Airbus still delivered more aircraft last year than Boeing, with 793, though that sum is below the record 863 airplanes the European manufacturer handed over in 2019. Airbus had 889 net orders for 2025.Engine and other supply chain issues continue to hold up aircraft deliveries. Deliveries are key for airplane manufacturers because airlines pay the bulk of a jet's price when they receive the plane.Boeing's net orders last month totaled 174 planes, including more than 100 737 Maxes for Alaska Airlines, which the Seattle carrier announced last week. Delta Air Lines earlier Tuesday said it ordered at least 30 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, its first for the wide-body plane.

    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrates an Oculus Rift virtual reality (VR) headset and Oculus Touch controllers during the Oculus Connect 3 event in San Jose, California, U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 6, 2016.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA little over four years after Mark Zuckerberg changed Facebook's name to Meta, reflecting his view that the future of work, play and socializing was going virtual, the company is making a major course correction. Meta this week began laying off employees focused on virtual reality within its Reality Labs division and is shutting down a number of studios that were working on VR titles, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named due to confidentiality. CNBC confirmed a report from the New York Times that layoffs, amounting to more than 1,000 jobs, will impact about 10% of the hardware division, which makes Quest VR headsets, and the Horizon Worlds virtual social network. Andrew Bosworth, Meta's chief technology officer, is slated to hold an all-hands meeting with Reality Labs on Wednesday, some of the people said.Meta is scaling back its metaverse ambitions as the company continues ramping up its investments in artificial intelligence, Zuckerberg's more recent obsession and the technology that's consumed Silicon Valley and the broader industry. Zuckerberg has been paying big bucks for top AI talent, most notably shelling out $14.3 billion in June to hire Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang, who's now leading AI strategy, along with other engineers and researchers from the startup.In October, Vishal Shah, who spent four years leading the company's metaverse efforts, was named vice president of AI products. That month Meta lifted the range of its 2025 capital expenditures to between $70 billion and $72 billion and said dollar growth would be \"notably larger\" in 2026. watch nowThe studios that are closing as part of the latest changes include Armature Studio, Twisted Pixel, and Sanzaru, as well as a technical unit called Oculus Studios Central Technology, sources told CNBC. Jobs are also being cut at other studios including Ouro Interactive, which Meta debuted in 2023 to build first-party content for Horizon Worlds.  Supernatural, a VR fitness app that Meta purchased for $400 million in 2023, was moved into maintenance mode, meaning it will be run by a skeleton crew and no longer receive new content, said people with knowledge of the matter.Meta laid the groundwork for this week's announcement in December, when the company said it would be shifting resources within Reality Labs' budget away from its VR initiatives toward its endeavors with AI glasses and wearable devices. \"This is part of that effort, and we plan to reinvest the savings to support the growth of wearables this year,\" a Meta spokesperson said, without commenting specifically on the layoffs.  While Meta's VR projects have never taken off, the company has had better success in AI-powered wearables, particularly through a partnership with EssilorLuxottica to make Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.In September, the two companies unveiled the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, which cost $799 and contain a single, built-in display that shows users small messages and previews of photos. Meta said last week that it would delay the global debut of the display glasses, citing \"limited\" inventories amid \"unprecedented\" U.S. demand.Luxottica CFO Stefano Grassi said in October that his company will be able to reach the 10 million unit capacity for the glasses that it had originally planned to hit by the end of 2026 earlier than anticipated.More like RobloxDespite the downsizing, Meta isn't abandoning VR. The company is courting developers who build games for Roblox, a virtual world gaming platform popular with kids, to build experiences for Horizon Worlds, sources said. Roblox says it has more than 150 million daily users, while Horizon, which Zuckerberg showcased at the time of the company name change, has never drawn more than a couple hundred thousand active users a month. By taking cues from the likes of Roblox and Minecraft, which Microsoft acquired in 2014, Horizon Worlds could serve as a funnel for Meta to attract a younger audience to its services. Last year Bosworth directed the company to turn Horizon Worlds into a hit smartphone app, after beginning a test of a mobile version in 2023, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Meta moved employees from other parts of Reality Labs onto the Horizon Worlds team in 2025, ex-employees said.Ben Hatton, an analyst for CCS Insight who covers connected devices, said the underperformance of VR headsets and the continuing growth of mobile forced Meta's hand. \"It kind of follows that Meta will be moving it towards mobile as mobile gaming has become very popular over the last five years or so,\" Hatton said.Ouro is one of the studios that will be working on mobile content for Horizon Worlds, people said. Andrew Bosworth, chief technology officer of Meta Platforms Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview on the sidelines of the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 25, 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's decision to scale back its VR efforts comes 12 years after Facebook entered the market with the $2 billion purchase of Oculus VR. Since late 2020, Meta's Reality Labs division has logged over $70 billion in cumulative losses. In its latest quarterly earnings in October, Meta said Reality Labs recorded a $4.4 billion loss on $470 million in sales.Meanwhile, the company is wrestling with a scattershot AI strategy as it tries to keep pace with OpenAI and Google, whose large language models and AI features are soaring in popularity. Meta plans to release its next frontier model, codenamed Avocado, in the first quarter of this year, CNBC reported last month. Meta's stock price badly trailed Alphabet's last year and came up short of the Nasdaq, a trend that's continued in the early days of 2026, with the shares down more than 4% since the calendar changed. Horizon Worlds has been a struggle from the start. In August 2022, 10 months after Zuckerberg announced plans to go all-in on the metaverse, he posted a photo to his Facebook profile showing his avatar in front of animated versions of the Eiffel Tower and Spain's Basílica de la Sagrada Família. The picture was lambasted on social media for its low-quality graphics. Zuckerberg posted a new image days later of an improved version of his avatar, promising users that \"major updates to Horizon and avatar graphics\" were coming soon.But inside Horizon Worlds, the photo fiasco was a defining moment, according to people familiar with the matter. Zuckerberg called a meeting with the team responsible for VR avatars demanding improvements, one of the people said.Multiple VR developers told CNBC that Horizon Worlds usage remains low based on their observations, adding that the company doesn't share specific stats. The developers said they're frustrated because they don't have accurate information that could help them create more compelling games and experiences.Rather, in Meta's refocusing toward a more Roblox-like experience, the company last year began instructing existing third-party Horizon Worlds developers to build kid-friendly, simplistic games.Deepak Nair, a developer advocate at Meta, discussed the strategy in August with an audience of developers in Berlin, encouraging them to mimic Roblox and Minecraft in building games that let kids create stories they can share with their friends. Nair said a key issue for developers is identifying the right demographic. \"Generally 13 to 24, right?\" Nair said. \"And even on other ecosystems, it's even younger than that.\" In February, Meta launched a $50 million Creator Fund intended to entice developers to create more in-game experiences inside Horizon Worlds, with a focus on mobile. The company is planning to make it easy for Facebook and Instagram users to seamlessly access Horizon Worlds, sources said. -- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.

    "body": "A grocery store in the Manhattan borough of New York on Dec. 13, 2025.Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesProgress in the fight to throttle back inflation appeared to stall in December amid price pressures from groceries, dining out, utility gas, clothing and other categories of consumer spending. The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 2.7% in December from 12 months earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. That was unchanged from the previous month and in line with estimates.\"The bottom line is, I think inflation is still uncomfortably high,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. \"Inflation for staples, necessities, remains elevated.\"Tariffs are pushing up inflationThe Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, targets an annual inflation rate that averages roughly 2% over the long term. Tariffs levied by President Donald Trump have put upward pressure on the inflation rate, Zandi said. Tariffs are a tax on imports, paid by the U.S.-based importer. Economists have expected that businesses would pass along at least some of that tax to consumers via higher prices.  \"I think were it not for the tariffs, we would have been back to target already,\" Zandi said. \"But tariffs have pushed up inflation a little over half a [percentage] point.\"That said, the pass-through to consumers has been more muted than expected, likely because businesses have chosen to erode their profit margins rather than risk alienating consumers via higher prices, economists said. Companies with inventory imported to the U.S. before tariffs were implemented were also able to sell those products to consumers at typical prices. The Supreme Court is poised to deliver a ruling in the coming days or weeks that could strike down a legal pathway the Trump administration has leveraged to impose universal tariffs on a broad swath of trading partners. Even without such a ruling, economists said they expect inflation has peaked and that it will likely throttle back in the second half of 2026. \"Short of any new tariffs coming online, we think the direction of inflation is lower,\" said Tom Porcelli, chief economist at Wells Fargo.Good news for the Federal ReserveOverall, the headline inflation rate is higher than it appears on paper, Zandi said. The record-long government shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12, prevented federal statisticians from collecting typical inflation data in October. Without that data, the BLS assumed that no price increases had taken place during the month for most categories of goods and services, Zandi said. Moody's estimates the annual CPI inflation rate would be around 3% if that data were included, he said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageAs enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, millions poised to drop health insuranceBigger tax refunds are coming for 2026 — what it could mean for the economyHere's the inflation breakdown for December 2025 — in one chartMore drivers have $1,000-plus car loan payments.

Consumer staples spur affordability concernsAffordability has emerged as a key financial focus for consumers and a talking point for politicians. Inflation for certain household necessities increased in December. For example, food prices for groceries and at restaurants each increased 0.7% on a monthly basis, from November to December, according to the CPI report. For inflation to get back to target, the monthly inflation rate generally needs to be around 0.2%.Certain categories like coffee and beef have seen high inflation rates over the past year — about 20% and 16%, respectively — due to supply constraints. Clothing prices were also up about 0.6% on a monthly basis. However, some increases may appear larger than in reality due to data distortions caused by the government shutdown, according to economists. \"Goods inflation appeared firmer than underlying trends would suggest, largely because holiday discounts were over-represented in November's CPI report due to how data was gathered during the government shutdown,\" Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, chief investment and portfolio strategist for the Americas at BlackRock, wrote in a note Tuesday. \"Those deeper-than-normal discounts pulled prices down in November, setting up an artificial jump when prices normalized later in December.\"watch nowUtility piped gas service increased 4.4% on the month, and is up 11% for the year. Electricity prices declined by 0.1% for the month but were up about 7% for the year. On a positive note, housing is likely to act as a counterweight pulling down overall inflation in 2026 and into 2027, Zandi said. \"Rent growth remains very weak,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowCore U.S. consumer prices rose less than predicted in December, reinforcing hopes that inflation is tempering as the Federal Reserve contemplates its next move on interest rates.Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the consumer price index showed a seasonally adjusted 0.2% gain on a monthly basis and 2.6% annually, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. Both were 0.1 percentage point below expectations. Though they look at both measures, Fed officials consider core inflation a better long-run gauge of where inflation is heading.On a headline basis, the CPI posted an increase of 0.3% for the month, putting the all-items annual rate at 2.7%. Both were exactly in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate.The Fed targets inflation at 2% annually, so the report provides some evidence that the pace of price increases is moving back to target but remains elevated.Stock market futures briefly rose following the report while Treasury yields were lower. Traders kept bets intact that the Fed would stand pat at its meeting later this month and likely won't be considering another cut until June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.President Donald Trump used the CPI report to renew his calls on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues to ease monetary policy.\"Great (LOW!) Inflation numbers for the USA. That means that Jerome 'Too Late' Powell should cut interest rates, MEANINGFULLY!!!,\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"If he doesn't he will just continue to be 'TOO LATE!'\"Shelter, a key element of stickiness, increased 0.4%, which was the biggest item for the monthly increase, according to the BLS. The category accounts for more than one-third of the CPI weighting and was up 3.2% on an annual basis.Other parts of the report also showed inflation persisting.Food prices jumped 0.7% for the month, though egg prices tumbled 8.2% and fell nearly 21% from a year ago after soaring previously. Other areas seeing increases included recreation, airfares and medical care. Energy prices rose 0.3% on the month and were up 2.3% from a year ago, though gasoline declined 0.5% and 3.4%, respectively.Some tariff-sensitive categories including apparel, also posted gains. However, household furnishings saw a 0.5% decrease as President Donald Trump backed off on threatened tariff increases for imports in that sector.The 1.2% increase for recreation was the largest monthly gain ever for the index in data going back to 1993, the BLS said.The report likely keeps the central bank on hold at least for the moment. Policymakers cut their benchmark rate three times in the latter part of 2025, and markets expect them to stay on hold through the first half of the new year as they assess the impact of the cuts on general economic conditions.\"We've seen this movie before — inflation isn't reheating, but it remains above target,\" wrote Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"There's still only modest pass-through from tariffs, but housing affordability isn't thawing. Today's inflation report doesn't give the Fed what it needs to cut interest rates later this month.\"Fed officials currently are weighing risks to the labor market against the potential for inflation to linger. Trump's tariffs have added another wrinkle to the equation, though most policymakers see the impact on inflation as temporary.Some areas of the report, particularly in goods, showed signs of deflation. Used cars and trucks declined 1.1% and the communication index slipped 1.9%. New vehicle prices were flat.Tuesday's release brings the BLS current on inflation and employment after the government shutdown last year caused a suspension of data collection and reports. Figuring in the December price increase, real wages were flat for the month and up 1.1% from a year ago, the BLS said in a separate report.",

    "body": "Milorad Kravic | E+ | Getty ImagesFor many consumers, buying a car increasingly comes with a hefty monthly bill. The share of new-car buyers who pay $1,000 or more per month for their auto loans rose to a record 20.3% of all new vehicle purchases financed in the fourth quarter of 2025, according to new data from car website Edmunds. That's up from 19.1% in the third quarter of 2025 and 18.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024.Used-car buyers aren't exempt, either, with 6.3% facing monthly auto loan payments of $1,000-plus as of the fourth quarter. That's up from 6.1% in the third quarter of 2025 and 5.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024.Even car purchasers who avoid four-figure monthly payments are paying more, Edmunds found. The average monthly payment on a new vehicle climbed to an all-time high of $772 per month in the fourth quarter of 2025, up from $754 in the third quarter.

Wealthy investors, who have benefited from rising stock values and home prices, are more likely to spend, while low-income consumers have been harder hit by prolonged cost-of-living increases affecting the prices for groceries and other essentials.\"For the haves, things are perfectly fine; for the have-nots, it's a struggle from one payment to the next,\" Drury said. As car prices rise, borrowers opt for longer loan termsAs cars get more expensive, buyers have been borrowing larger amounts. The average amount financed for a new vehicle rose to $43,759 in the fourth quarter, up from $42,647 in the third quarter and $42,113 for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Edmunds.The average price paid for a new vehicle topped $50,000 for the first time in September, Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book reported in October.Some consumers have reacted to those higher costs by opting for longer loan terms, which can reduce monthly payments. In the last quarter of 2025, loans of 84 months or longer made up 20.8% of new-car purchases, up from 17.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and down from 22% in the third quarter, according to Edmunds.watch nowInterest rates on auto loans are still historically high, though, which contributes to higher auto loan payments. The average annual percentage rate dropped to 6.7% in the fourth quarter, down from 7% in the third quarter and 6.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to Edmunds.Just 3.1% of loans for new vehicles had a 0% rate, down from 3.3% in the third quarter and up from 2.4% in the fourth quarter.When automakers still offer 0% rates, consumers must have good credit to qualify for those deals, Drury said. The term lengths are often very short, which limits the potential savings, he said.\"For a lot of consumers, if you have money, it's easy to save money,\" Drury said. \"If you don't, it's very difficult.\"How 2026 changes may affect car costs In the last four months of 2025, the Federal Reserve initiated three interest rate cuts. Though experts expect the pace of reductions to slow in 2026, the Trump administration has been pushing for sharply lower interest rates. Falling rates will benefit auto shoppers. More favorable borrowing terms may help bring buyers back to the market, Drury said. Automakers may put more incentives in place in 2026 to help encourage sales, he said. In 2025, an estimated 16.3 million units were sold, according to S&P Global. That is projected to decline to 16 million in 2026, Drury said. However, automakers never want sales to decrease from one year to the next, he said.A new auto loan interest deduction of up to $10,000 per year is in place for vehicles purchased between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028. However, experts say consumers should read the fine print on the terms of that tax break to best understand whether it may help defray their costs.Qualifying vehicles must be new, used for personal use and assembled in the United States.The deduction will also depend on a taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income, according to an analysis by consulting and research firm Anderson Economic Group. Individuals with more than $149,000 in income, or married couples with more than $249,000, will not receive the deduction.Taxpayers below those thresholds may stand to save $300 to $900 per year on their tax bills, or more than $1,000 annually if they borrow more, according to Anderson Economic Group. Borrowers are likely to see the biggest deductions in the first year of their loans, since interest payments are front-loaded, the analysis notes. As borrowers pay off their loans, the annual deductions will be smaller.How to break the cycle of high car paymentsIf you do take on a car loan, it's important to keep monthly payments within a reasonable range for your budget, experts say.\"If your goal is to not have a $1,000 monthly payment on a car, then you've got to either buy a less expensive car, or save and have a nice down payment toward a vehicle,\" said Crystal Cox, a certified financial planner and senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors in Madison, Wisconsin. Data suggests that people are holding on to their cars longer before making a new vehicle purchase. The average age of vehicle trade-ins rose to 7.6 years in the first quarter of 2025, the oldest since 2019, according to Edmunds.Stretching the time between new car purchases can make it easier to accumulate savings that can go either toward a down payment or even fully paying for your next car, Cox said. Here's what that could look like, she said: After paying off a car, keep driving that car and bank your previous auto loan payment in a high-yield savings account. That helps avoid lifestyle creep while also building a down payment for your next car purchase.A long-term strategy of keeping cars longer, saving consistently and avoiding unnecessary upgrades can help car buyers limit interest on those big-ticket purchases, Cox said.To help gauge the affordability of an auto loan, one rule of thumb is to limit your total debt to 36% of your gross income, said Jake Martin, a CFP at Keeler & Nadler Family Wealth in Dublin, Ohio. After subtracting payments for other debts, like mortgage, credit cards and student loans, the remaining portion can give you an idea of how much you may comfortably be able to pay. While exceeding 36% is still feasible, that will affect your ability to spend on other necessities and discretionary purchases, he said.",

    "body": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff delivers the keynote address at the start of the Dreamforce conference in San Francisco on Oct. 14, 2025.Jessica Christian | San Francisco Chronicle | Getty ImagesSalesforce is bolstering its Slack app with generative artificial intelligence to help users find relevant information and sort through the mountains of communication chaos. After announcing plans in October to bring generative AI to Slackbot, its virtual assistant, Salesforce said on Tuesday that it will become available to Business+ and Enterprise+ Slack subscribers.\"Because it lives inside Slack, Slackbot understands your conversations, files, channels, and the people you work with,\" the company said in a blog post. \"It only sees what you can see, always respecting your permissions and access controls.\"Slackbot can find data in Slack, Salesforce, Google Drive, Box, Atlassian's Confluence and other services. It's using Anthropic's Claude model, though Salesforce is testing alternatives, co-founder and technology chief Parker Harris told CNBC. While the artificial intelligence boom has lifted the fortunes of tech companies ranging from chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom to internet giant Google, Wall Street has remained skeptical of how Salesforce and other enterprise software companies will fare, and whether some of them will ultimately be displaced. Salesforce's stock price is down 18% in the past year, compared with the the Nasdaq's 24% gain over that stretch. Harris said that large language models, and the many popular coding agents that are now running atop them, are not disrupting cloud software. And services like OpenAI's ChatGPT aren't hooked into corporate systems. \"People who say, 'oh I could vibe code up Slack and Salesforce now, and my AI is just going to do it all for me' are crazy,\" said Harris, who's been focusing on Slack in recent years. Salesforce bought Slack for $27.1 billion in 2021, by far its largest purchase on record. watch nowSince around the time Slack launched in 2014, the Slackbot digital assistant has been able to send people automated messages, including updates from third-party services. But with all the chatbots popping up in the past three years since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022, Slack has been a relative laggard. Google and Microsoft already offer AI add-ons inside their work productivity bundles.Across the software industry, companies have been incorporating models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic with hopes of fueling growth by increasing productivity for clients. Aside from Slackbot, Salesforce has been selling Agentforce services for automating customer service and other business functions. Harris said the new Slackbot helps him prepare for meetings and research topics. \"I'm finding I'm using search less,\" he said, referring to the app's search function.Slackbot was developed after two Slack engineers considered how CEO Marc Benioff might use an in-house tool instead of instinctively opening ChatGPT and uploading internal documents such as earnings scripts.\"Now he's doing everything with Slackbot,\" Harris said. Slack is now used by millions of people in thousands of organizations, a spokesperson said, and is one of the company's fastest-growing cloud offerings. Slackbot is the most quickly adopted feature in Salesforce's 27-year history, Harris said, adding that he expects people to switch to Slack from Microsoft Teams and that companies might now start getting rid of ChatGPT subscriptions when they see what it can do. But talent has headed in the other direction. In December, OpenAI hired Slack CEO Denise Dresser to be the startup's chief revenue officer. Rob Seaman, who had been Slack's product chief, became the unit's interim CEO.Demetri Salvaggio, vice president of customer experience and operations at business travel software company Engine, has been testing Slackbot's new capabilities and said he uses the feature to \"sanity check\" himself at the end of the workday and make sure he hasn't failed to respond to any important messages. Engine has licenses for Google's Gemini assistant and Anthropic's Claude, but they're not embedded in the company's Slack environment, Salvaggio said.He said Slackbot probably saves him 45 minutes to an hour per week.WATCH: Oakmark’s Bill Nygren on value investors looking at Salesforcewatch now",

    "body": "The start of 2026 means many employees are seeing their PTO balances refreshed for the year. With some strategic planning, and travel know-how, you can make your vacation days go the extra mile.One popular strategy, sometimes called \"PTO-maxxing\" on social media, involves tacking vacation days onto holidays and weekends to maximize your time off. By doing so, you can get around 40 days off by using just 10 to 15 days of PTO this year, some estimates say.Of course, PTO-maxxing may not work within everyone's schedules, team needs and employer policies. But every day you can place strategically adds up.The U.S. has 11 federal holidays this year, several of which fall on Mondays. If you request off the Friday prior or the Tuesday after, you suddenly have a 4-day getaway using just one day of PTO. Likewise, for holidays that fall on Fridays, requesting the Thursday before or the Monday after creates a 4-day vacation.The extra day can also save you some money if you're planning on traveling.\"If you can build in one vacation day on a 3-day weekend, that gives you a little bit of an advantage because you're not flying on the exact day when everybody else is flying,\" says Tom Carpenter, co-owner of travel agency Huckleberry Travel.For bigger holidays like Thanksgiving, where many people travel to be with family, you might request off Monday through Wednesday, and Friday if your employer does not already designate that a company holiday. With the two weekends on either side of Thanksgiving week, you'd have off 9 days for using 4 days of PTO.And for those who travel frequently for work, consider adding PTO onto a business trip where possible, since your company has already covered your travel and you're at that destination already, Carpenter says.Travel tipsWhen maximizing your PTO, you'll also want to bear in mind some tips to stretch your dollar too.Pay attention to events happening where and when you'll be traveling that could affect hotel and home rental availability, pricing and crowds. (If you're not expressly going to the Winter Olympics, February might be a bad time to visit Milan.)The best window to book a flight is 1.5 to 4 months out as any earlier doesn't yield any real advantages, and any later will start to see prices increase, Carpenter says. As for flying, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays tend to be cheaper than other days, he adds.For shorter getaways, look at direct flights from your airport so you can minimize your time in transit and spend more time on the ground at your destination. Wherever you're going, plan ahead.\"If you're looking at a holiday weekend when a lot of people are going to be traveling, that inventory is going to go sooner than on a random midweek trip,\" Carpenter says. \"There's no such thing as a last-minute deal.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Candidates often worry about making a good impression during the hiring process, but they should be equally attuned to how the company presents itself.Don't ignore your intuition if something seems off during a job interview, says Amanda Augustine, a career coach and resident career expert at Resume.ai.\"The candidate experience is oftentimes a reflection of how they treat their employees and the respect they give,\" Augustine says. No matter how great a job looks on paper, \"if it's not a great experience interviewing with them and going through their vetting process, then chances are it's probably not going to be a wonderful experience once you get in the door,\" she says.These are the top three red flags from hirers that job seekers should watch out for in interviews, according to Augustine.The hiring team doesn't have a clear idea of what the role entailsIt's a major red flag if each person you speak to during the interview process \"seems to have a different idea in mind as to what they expect you to do\" in the role, Augustine says.From the company's side, everyone involved in the hiring process should have similar responses to questions like \"What does success look like in this role?\" or \"What are the top three qualifications someone needs to do this job?\" If the hiring team is unclear on what your exact job duties will be, which team members you'll work with or what your role will be within the company, you're likely to face unrealistic or unclear expectations as an employee, according to Augustine.These inconsistencies can also point to larger issues in the company's culture, she says.It could indicate that there's \"conflict within the organization\" as to what they're looking for, Augustine says — and \"if you take the job, you're going to be stuck in the middle of that.\"They avoid answering hard questionsJob interviews are a two-way street, Augustine says: candidates are evaluating whether they want to work at a company just as much as employers are evaluating whether to hire them.If there are any areas of concern, candidates can — and should — ask probing questions like \"It seems like there was a large layoff in the past year. How has the team recovered from that, and how has that changed your goals?\"Pay attention to the way your interviewer responds, Augustine says.\"If they shy away from that, refuse to answer or they don't want to get into it, it's either because they don't know the answer or they think the answer will scare you away,\" she says. \"I would be wary of that.\"It can also be a red flag if your interviewer is reluctant to let you speak with current team members, she says: they may be trying to hide a toxic work environment.The work environment seems tenseIf you're visiting the company for an in-person interview, it's crucial to \"take stock of your surroundings,\" Augustine says.\"Keep your eyes and ears peeled for what's going on around you,\" she says.She recommends taking note of details like \"Where are they having you wait? What's the vibe around you? Do people seem stressed out? Is it silent? Is it happy?\"Even something as simple as what workers keep on their desks could give you valuable insights into the company culture, she says: \"Do they have plants and pictures of their families and that sort of thing, or is it very sterile?\"Another clue to look out for is whether other employees seem to collaborate or keep to themselves.These factors don't necessarily indicate that a workplace is toxic, Augustine says, but they can help candidates determine whether the company culture is a good fit. If not, \"you'll want to run for the door,\" she says.How candidates can respondIf you've decided that you're no longer interested in pursuing the role, it's best to let the company know promptly.It can feel awkward to tell a company you're withdrawing your candidacy, but Augustine recommends sending a follow-up email with a simple script:\"Thank you so much for your time today. I enjoyed learning more about your organization. Upon further consideration, I do not believe that this role would be a good fit for me. I wish you the best of luck in your candidate search.\"Regardless of how the interview went, \"you're always going to maintain your dignity, your honor, your professionalism,\" Augustine says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire.A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live.In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. By comparison, Oklahoma has the lowest estimated total, at $735,284, to cover the same basic costs.The analysis is based on the average living costs for retirees 65 or older in each state, drawn from the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs.Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Utilities and health-care costs can range by as much as $5,000 annually, the study finds.Here's a look the minimum amount of savings needed to retire at 65 in each state, in alphabetical order.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037AlaskaAnnual cost of living: $78,449Savings you need to retire: $1,400,286ArizonaAnnual cost of living: $66,838Savings you need to retire: $1,110,019ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538CaliforniaAnnual cost of living: $83,978Savings you need to retire: $1,538,508ColoradoAnnual cost of living: $63,091Savings you need to retire: $1,016,336ConnecticutAnnual cost of living: $70,094Savings you need to retire: $1,191,417DelawareAnnual cost of living: $63,152Savings you need to retire: $1,017,871FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933HawaiiAnnual cost of living: $110,393Savings you need to retire: $2,198,902IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MaineAnnual cost of living: $70,155Savings you need to retire: $1,192,953MarylandAnnual cost of living: $73,043Savings you need to retire: $1,265,135MassachusettsAnnual cost of living: $92,639Savings you need to retire: $1,755,055MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931MontanaAnnual cost of living: $67,452Savings you need to retire: $1,125,377NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New HampshireAnnual cost of living: $67,084Savings you need to retire: $1,116,163New JerseyAnnual cost of living: $70,401Savings you need to retire: $1,199,096New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684New YorkAnnual cost of living: $77,773Savings you need to retire: $1,383,392North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284OregonAnnual cost of living: $68,681Savings you need to retire: $1,156,093PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331Rhode IslandAnnual cost of living: $69,664Savings you need to retire: $1,180,666South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VermontAnnual cost of living: $69,848Savings you need to retire: $1,185,274VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405WashingtonAnnual cost of living: $69,971Savings you need to retire: $1,188,345West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "One thing many workers are keen to leave behind heading into 2026? The 9-to-5 schedule. In its place, many are interested in adopting a practice called \"microshifting.\"In Owl Labs' 2025 State of Hybrid Work report, 65% of workers reported being interested in microshifting, defined as working in \"short, non-linear blocks based on personal energy, responsibilities, or productivity patterns.\"\"Microshifting appeals to employees not just as a scheduling preference, but as a way to reclaim control over their increasingly fragmented work lives,\" Owl Labs CEO Frank Weishaupt tells CNBC Make It. \"Employees are improvising solutions to reconcile the demands of their jobs with the realities of their lives.\"During the pandemic remote work boom, many workers had greater control over their time during their workdays. The interest in microshifting could represent interest in keeping that flexibility, particularly among those with some degree of remote or self-directed work, as it may be more difficult for office workers in traditional 9-to-5 jobs.But microshifting isn't an entirely new practice. Doug Gregory of Grand Rapids, Michigan, says he's been doing it as a remote worker for decades, before it had that name, and even more so since the Covid-19 pandemic.\"We kind of got used to the idea of being present or available for loved ones,\" he says of broader sentiment in the workforce stemming from the pandemic remote work era. \"We got used to taking better care of our health.\"While Gregory acknowledges that \"not everybody has control over their calendar,\" he finds \"the day is more fluid\" when he's microshifting.\"If I need to take an hour off during the day to go do something with the grandkid or to go see a doctor or whatever, it's okay, I make up for it in the evening, I make up for it early in the morning,\" he says. \"It really comes back to what am I responsible for getting done, how do I do it, and how do I organize my life to do it.\"Gregory previously held sales roles but today is self-employed working in audiovisual integration.\"I earn a living based on outcomes,\" he says. \"Nobody sends me a check for how many hours I work in a week.\"Microshifting could be particularly useful for parents and caregivers; Owl Labs' report found caregivers were roughly three times as likely to try microshifting as non-caregivers.Theresa Robertson of Elkridge, Maryland, is one of them. Robertson says she juggled her work, including a former role as a project manager, with caregiving for her late husband, who had chronic health issues, for 25 years.\"To me, it was just making sure I didn't lose my job,\" she says. \"I had to take care of my husband, and I had to work, so I had to figure it out.\"That meant scheduling meetings around his doctors' appointments and starting some days early or ending others late to take him to those appointments, manage his medications and handle other caregiving responsibilities.\"We had a routine; after I got him settled, made sure he was dressed and he had his medicine and he had his food, then I could relax and focus on work,\" she says. \"I had more control over my day where I could stop and decide, okay I need to check his blood pressure and then go back to work.\"Some of her jobs during this period, like in project management, were more outcome-based so she was trusted to manage her time as long as she handled her work, she notes.\"As long as I got the job done on time and on budget, they weren't really looking at did I punch a clock to see was I in the building at 7 a.m.\" she says. \"I've had so many Zoom meetings in hospital rooms because wherever I go I take my laptop and when I can work, I can work.\"Today, Robertson runs a virtual assistant agency, which she says helps her continue to microshift. She sets her hours such that she's mostly free on Friday afternoons, for example, to tend to personal matters.\"I microshift all the time,\" she says. \"That's the only way I'm able to have a life and produce an income.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump welcomes Russian President Vladimir Putin to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson on August 15, 2025 in Anchorage, Alaska. Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The \"Board of Peace\" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.\"President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,\" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. \"We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,\" he added.Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a \"founding Executive Board\" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.Israel is unhappy with how the \"Board of Peace\" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, \"the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.\"— CNBC'S Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.",

    "body": "The Tether (USDT) stablecoin logo.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAmid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. \"Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation,\" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  \"Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door.\"Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. Not so stable? Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using \"virtually worthless\" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an \"escape valve\" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  \"This was a violent repricing driven by fear,\" Li said. \"As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight.\"He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, \"they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible,\" in an emergency situation, Li said. \"That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack,\" he added.The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.\"If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse,\" said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of \"put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug,\" Campbell said.And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. \"When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option,\" Campbell said.

    "body": "US President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the United Nations General Assembly at the UN headquarters in New York City on September 23, 2025. Timothy A. Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the Board of Peace, Bloomberg first reported on Saturday night, citing a draft charter for the proposed group. The Board of Peace is an international body that was endorsed by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025. The board was established to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to serve as the group's inaugural chairman, and he will choose which members to invite, according to the draft seen by Bloomberg. While a majority vote would make decisions, the chairman would have final approval. Member states would serve a three-year term on the board, but could secure a permanent seat by paying $1 billion cash within the first year of the charter's start, according to the draft.A U.S. official told CNBC there is no cost to join the Board of Peace, but the $1 billion contribution would secure permanent membership. The group's mandate is to \"rebuild all of Gaza,\" and \"virtually every dollar\" raised would be spent on that mandate. The group will operate without \"exorbitant salaries and massive administrative bloat,\" the official said. It's unclear where the funds collected from Board of Peace members would be held.Trump has invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday. Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday. Turkey, Egypt, Paraguay and Albania had previously been invited. The full list could be announced by the U.S. in the coming days, the Associated Press reported. Under Trump's leadership, the group has also created a founding executive board to \"oversee a defined portfolio critical to Gaza's stabilization and long-term success,\" the White House said in a statement on Friday. Executive board appointees include U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair, Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and U.S. deputy national security advisor Robert Gabriel. ",

South Korea is scheduled to announce its gross domestic product (GDP) figures on April 24. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFancy some cheese-flavored spicy noodles? Judging by export sales, the rest of the world can't get enough of South Korea's food exports, also known as \"K-Food.\"Exports of \"K-Food+\" — a category that includes food products and agricultural industries — surged to a record $13.62 billion in 2025, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs. That's a 5.1% increase from a year earlier and marked the tenth consecutive year of growth.Instant noodles, or ramyeon, were the standout. Exports jumped nearly 22% to $1.52 billion, making it the first single food category to surpass $1 billion in overseas sales.Cheese-flavored spicy noodles and other new products resonated with consumers in China, the U.S., and emerging markets in Central Asia and the Middle East.\"Global demand for Korean noodles continues to expand, and companies have scaled up production and stabilized supply chains to meet it,\" the ministry noted in a late‑2025 report.Other categories also gained traction overseas, with Korean sauces benefiting from the demand for spicy and sweet flavors, while ice cream and fruit exports rose too.Riding K-pop's coattailsWhat makes the humble pack of South Korean instant noodles so popular? Analysts say culture plays a big role.The massive appeal of K-pop and Korean television dramas has helped fuel demand, with food frequently featured on screen. Characters are often shown eating ramyeon in dramas, variety shows and advertisements.Just as K-pop companies are looking overseas for growth, Korean food makers, especially those selling ramyeon, are doing the same, said Oh Jiwoo, analyst at brokerage CGS International.Nongshim CEO Cho Yong-chul told employees at the start of 2026 that the company's business principle for the year was \"Global Agility & Growth,\" urging staff to expand its overseas footprint.Otoki CEO Hwang Sung-man said at a shareholder meeting in March 2025 that the company, best known for its Jin Ramen, would prioritize \"exploring global markets\" and aim for an overseas sales revenue of 1.1 trillion won ($746 million) by 2030. CGS' Oh said companies are looking beyond South Korea's shores because the domestic market is saturated. For example, Nongshim, best known for its Shin Ramyeon brand, holds over 60% market share in South Korea. \"Their main product was first invented in 1970s and 80s. And those products, [the] same products, is selling every year, [with] no marketing cost,\" she said.South Korea's demographic decline also limits long-term domestic growth, Oh added, pushing companies to look abroad. As a result, noodle makers have leaned into K-pop's global reach, signing popular ambassadors and icons to increase their overseas appeal. Nongshim named SM Entertainment girl group Aespa as global ambassadors in late 2025, following a collaboration with Netflix on a K-pop Demon Hunters-themed noodle line. Otoki has tapped BTS member Jin as its brand model for Jin Ramen.

Beyond a saturated market, South Korea's instant noodle manufacturers face government-imposed limits on price increases, restricting their ability to offset rising costs, Macquarie said.Overseas markets, on the other hand, allow companies to set higher average selling prices, Oh said. She added that in China and other Asian markets, average prices can be 30%-50% higher than in South Korea, while in the U.S., average prices can be roughly double.Macquarie said that the dominant Japanese and Korean brands have benefited from shifting consumption patterns due to their focus on \"product innovation and cultivating a premium brand image.\"Samyang Foods was identified as a key beneficiary, with Macquarie projecting it will be able to increase its U.S. market share to 23.9% by 2028, from the current 11.4%. \"We believe premium instant noodles with strong product innovation will be the key driver for US market,\" Macquarie said.Samyang Foods is known for its Buldak line of spicy instant noodles, which gained popularity in 2014 for the \"fire noodle challenge,\" in which participants tried to eat the noodles without drinking water.The trend led to regulatory scrutiny in 2024 when Danish authorities briefly recalled some Buldak products over high capsaicin levels, which posed a serious health risk. The recall was later reversed.SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - JUNE 17: The Anjum family, on vacation from Pakistan, picks out varieties of the Buldak Samyang instant noodles from the CU \"Ramyun Library\" convenience store, a popular tourist attraction, on Monday, June 17, 2024, in the Hongdae district of Seoul, South Korea.\n(Photo by Jintak Han/The Washington Post via Getty Images)The Washington Post | The Washington Post | Getty Images",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"\"While we won't get specific about a client, we don't close accounts because of political beliefs,\" said JPMorgan spokesperson Trish Wexler. \"We appreciate that this Administration has moved to address political debanking and we support those efforts.\"In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed without evidence in an August CNBC interview that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"JPMorgan's Wexler said the \"offer\" reported by the Journal was a miscommunication. \"I should have been more vigilant in correcting that word while attempting to dispute the WSJ's anonymous sources,\" she said.The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

Moonshot AI had not responded to a request for comment as this article went live.The sources added that the company could be valued even higher in subsequent rounds that could follow, due to a surge of interest in Chinese AI IPO candidates.Chinese AI companies have particularly boomed as U.S. AI chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, aren't officially available in mainland China.Beijing restricts access to many U.S.-based internet services, while American companies have faced growing restrictions from the White House on doing business with China.The previous funding round was announced on Dec. 31. IDG, Alibaba and Tencent participated in it, according to Chinese financial news outlet LatePost.Moonshot AI has not commented on any plans for an IPO.Zhipu, listed under the name Knowledge Atlas, had a market value of $13 billion as of Monday's close, according to Wind Information data.

Ro Khanna on Friday reintroduced a bill that would curb institutional investors from buying up housing,  leveraging a similar call made recently by President Donald Trump.Trump said in a Truth Social post on Jan. 7 that he would be \"immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes.\"Trump's remark was one of a flurry of populist economic moves by the president as he races to address voter concerns about affordability ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.A recent Marist poll found that just 36% of Americans approved of Trump's handling of the economy, while 57% disapproved. That is a significant headwind for Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress as they try to hang onto their razor-thin majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate.In a statement to CNBC, Khanna invoked Trump's recent support for blocking institutional investors from buying up housing. \"If President Trump is serious about taking on Wall Street landlords, Congress should pass my bill and he should sign it into law,\" Khanna said. \"Homes should be owned by people, not wealthy corporate landlords who are buying up single-family homes and pushing the dream of homeownership out of reach for too many Americans.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeWhile bill text was not immediately available, Khanna's office told CNBC that the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act would prohibit large institutional investors from taking advantage of home-related tax breaks, including mortgage interest, insurance and depreciation deductions. The bill would also require federal and government-backed agencies such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prohibit large institutional investors from purchasing mortgages on single-family homes. Large Institutional investors who sell single-family homes more than 18 months after the bill's enactment would be slapped with a real estate transfer tax equal to 100% of the home's sale value. In prior versions of the bill, including one introduced in late 2024, a large institutional investor was defined as a person or firm with assets exceeding $100 million. Khanna has 13 cosponsors on the bill so far, all Democrats. But it's possible that Trump's call for an end to large investors in the single-family home market may prompt some House GOP members to join Khanna's effort.In an interview with CNBC, Khanna said he's willing to work with Trump on legislation \"if it's actually going to help the working class.\" \"If he calls me up, I'll help lead the bill,\" Khanna said. Trump is set to speak at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, where the president said he will address his housing proposal. \"I will discuss this topic, including further Housing and Affordability proposals, and more, at my speech in Davos,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",

    "body": "People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesEuropean leaders have hit back at U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on them if they oppose his attempt to buy Greenland, describing the ultimatum as \"completely wrong\" and \"unacceptable.\"Trump announced on Saturday that eight European allies would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb.1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached so Washington can \"buy\" the Arctic territory, which is semi-autonomous and part of the Kingdom of Denmark.Eight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" Trump stated on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday.The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland, Trump said.European leaders were quick to react to the latest threat with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that \"applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as \"unacceptable.\"\"Europeans will respond in a united and coordinated manner should they be confirmed. We will ensure that European sovereignty is upheld,\" Macron stated on social media platform X on Saturday.Reuters quoted a source close to Macron as saying he was pushing for the activation of the Anti-Coercion Instrument, which could limit access to public tenders in the EU or restrict trade in services in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President of the European Council Antonio Costa issued a statement Saturday in which they said the EU \"stands in full solidarity with Denmark and the people of Greenland.\" It added that it was committed to further dialogue following talks between Denmark, Greenland and top U.S. officials last week, which ended without a diplomatic breakthrough. Nonetheless, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump's tariffs threat had come \"as a surprise\" following the \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The European Union has called an emergency meeting which will take place at 16:00 p.m. London time on Sunday, Reuters reported.Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who, like British PM Keir Starmer is known to have a good relationship with Donald Trump, called for cool heads and further talks.He warned further tariffs — which would come on top of the 15% tariff on EU exports to the U.S., and the 10% levied on U.K. exports -- would be damaging, however.\"Among allies, issues are best resolved through discussion, not through pressure,\" he said on X. \"European countries stand united. We emphasize the principles of territorial integrity and sovereignty. We support Denmark and Greenland. Dialogue with the United States continues. Tariffs would undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"'A moderately significant economic problem'Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August.Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank said: \"Trump wants to force Denmark and its European backers to sell Greenland to the U.S. by imposing tariffs. For Europe, this is a bad geopolitical headache and a moderately significant economic problem.\"He estimated that an additional 10% levy on goods from affected countries could raise U.S. consumer prices by up to 0.15%. But \"in the unlikely case\" that the EU-U.S. trade deal is not implemented, \"the damage to US consumers could then be almost three times as bad in the end,\" Schmieding told CNBC in a note.Denmark and its European neighbors have made repeated efforts to dissuade Trump from looking to acquire Greenland, particularly after the president said earlier this month that he would consider all options to obtain the mineral-rich island, including using military force.Trump says acquiring Greenland is critical for U.S. national security. He has also said that U.S. ownership would prevent Russia and China from gaining a foothold in the territory. Beijing and Moscow have lambasted Trump's claims and his coveting of Greenland, calling them a \"pretext ...for selfish gains\" and \"extraordinary.\" Young people with placards reading \"Greenland is not for sale!\" take part in a demonstration that gathered almost a third of the city population to protest against the US President's plans to take Greenland, on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, near the US Consulate to Greenland. Alessandro Rampazzo | Afp | Getty ImagesGreenland itself has repeatedly rejected Trump's advances and while a majority of its population would like independence from Denmark, according to opinion polls, most Greenlanders would not like to become a part of the U.S., either.Protests were held in Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, on Saturday, with demonstrators holding placards reiterating the position of the island's leadership, and that of Denmark, that \"Greenland is not for sale.\"— Spriha Srivastava contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland.

Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

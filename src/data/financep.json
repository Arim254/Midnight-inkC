    "body": "When I think back on my childhood, my happiest memories aren't tied to things I owned. They're about the freedom of growing up in a small Ohio town where everyone knew your name and kids ran in packs.The neighborhood park was our meeting place. A few bikes tossed in a friend's front yard signaled the game was on. There were no texts or group chats. But childhood today often looks different. Connection revolves around gaming consoles, phones, sneakers, and the next must-have gadget. If you can't afford it, you risk being left out.That contrast led me to talk to my 79-year-old dad, a man who wears thriftiness the way others wear luxury. He genuinely enjoys finding new ways to save money. He never tried to keep up with anyone. While others rushed to buy the newest car or gadget, he was content with what he had. That mindset made him the quintessential millionaire next door.He helped shaped my relationship with money. I don't feel compelled to chase status or possessions. Here are eight lessons from my frugal dad that have stood the test of time — and how they still apply today.1. Let your values guide your financial decisionsEvery dollar you spend is a vote for the life you want to build. When your spending aligns with what matters most, money feels less like sacrifice and more like purpose. For couples especially, shared values turn financial decisions into a source of clarity instead of conflict.2. You can always earn more money, but not timeImagine you could swap places with legendary investor Warren Buffett, now 95. Would you? Time is scarce and unrecoverable, unlike money. Remember this when deciding whether to take a promotion just for a bigger paycheck, even if it means less time with family; or working longer hours for a fancier car when your current one works fine; or buying a bigger house when your kids already attend a great school in a safe neighborhood.3. The best investment you can make is in yourselfThe returns on personal growth compound for decades. Education, learning a new skill, reading widely, or even investing in therapy can strengthen both your earning potential and your resilience. In a partnership, personal growth benefits everyone — stronger individuals make stronger teams.4. Debt steals tomorrow’s optionsEvery borrowed dollar limits future freedom. A loan may feel manageable today, but it quietly shapes your choices tomorrow, from the jobs you can take to where you can live. Prioritizing flexibility over financing buys peace of mind and the ability to pivot when life changes.5. Turn off the lights when you leave the roomTurning the lights off is a metaphor for the small things we do. It’s more than about saving a few cents on electricity; it’s a mindfulness practice. Every small act of frugality adds up, and it builds awareness of how we use our resources. 6. Celebrate simplicityA quiet life is often an intentional one. Choosing simplicity means choosing time over things, presence over pressure, and meaning over noise. Less clutter often leads to less stress — and more room for what actually matters.7. New cars destroy wealthThe average new car now sells for over $50,000, and when you factor in financing, fuel, and insurance, monthly costs can exceed $1,200. Vehicles that are about three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability. Investing the difference between new and used can significantly boost long-term net worth.8. Being cheap and being frugal aren’t the same thingCheapness cuts corners at all costs. Frugality focuses on getting value for your money. A frugal person maintains what they own, spends intentionally, and is generous where it counts. Understanding that difference can prevent endless money conflicts because frugality builds a meaningful life, while cheapness slowly erodes joy.Brian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

    "body": "After years of steep increases, renters are finally seeing sustained price relief, a trend that appears to be carrying into early 2026.In November, the median asking rent across the 50 largest U.S. metro areas was $1,693, down about 1% from a year earlier and marking the 28th consecutive month of year-over-year declines, according to Realtor.com listings data. Nationally, the median rent fell to $1,367, down 1.1% from a year earlier, according to Apartment List's data.November is typically the slowest month for rentals, but rents fell more from October to November this year than they did over the same period last year, according to Apartment List.With new apartment supply still hitting the market, rents are expected to remain lower into 2026.\"Barring a major economic shock, 2026 is shaping up to be one of the more renter-friendly periods we've seen in a decade,\" says Michelle Griffith, a luxury real estate broker at Douglas Elliman.Why rents are coolingRent relief comes after a sharp run-up in prices earlier in the decade. Prices for one- and two-bedroom rentals were rising at an annual pace above 12% in mid-2021 and mid-2022 amid high demand, according to Realtor.com data. Since early 2023, rent growth has turned negative as a surge of new apartment supply entered the market.In 2024, more than 600,000 new multifamily apartment units — typically large, managed apartment buildings — were completed nationwide, the most in a single year since the 1980s, according to Apartment List.The biggest rent cuts have shown up in these buildings, where the surge of supply has forced landlords to compete for tenants.\"We're seeing price wars within buildings, longer days on market, and the need for multiple price reductions just to generate foot traffic,\" says Jaclyn Bild, a real estate broker associate at Douglas Elliman. Prices for detached homes and higher-end rentals have held more steady, with demand remaining relatively strong, she says.Where rents are falling the mostRent relief hasn't been uniform, as conditions vary widely by market. The sharpest declines have occurred in fast-growing Sun Belt and interior Western metros with a surge in new housing supply in recent years—especially Austin.These 10 cities recorded some of the steepest year-over-year drops in median asking rent in November, using data for the 50 largest U.S. metro areas, according to Realtor.com.Austin–Round Rock–San Marcos, Texas: −6.6%Denver–Aurora–Centennial, Colorado: −4.8%Birmingham, Alabama: −4.6%Jacksonville, Florida: −4.2%Phoenix–Mesa–Chandler, Arizona: −4.0%San Diego–Chula Vista–Carlsbad, California: −3.5%Las Vegas–Henderson–North Las Vegas, Nevada: −3.0%Houston–Pasadena–The Woodlands, Texas: −2.7%Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach, Florida: −2.7%San Antonio–New Braunfels, Texas: −2.7%While rents remain well above pre-pandemic levels, the momentum has shifted in many markets.High vacancies and a wave of new apartments still coming onto the market are expected to keep rent growth limited into early 2026, with prices leveling off later in the year rather than rebounding quickly, according to Apartment List.\"This is a good time to negotiate rather than assume the asking rent is fixed,\" says Griffith. \"Landlords are far more open to concessions, flexible lease terms, or modest rent reductions than they were even a year ago. Locking in a lease during periods of elevated supply, especially in late winter or early spring, can provide cost certainty before demand picks up again.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "With any credit card, there's typically a limit to how much you can spend. And experts say choosing the right limit can play an important role in maintaining good credit health.Set based on factors like your income, credit history and ability to repay, your credit limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow on a credit card or account. \"Generally speaking, more credit is better, as long as you don't use it as a crutch to overspend and take on too much debt,\" says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. Experts often recommend seeking out a limit that's well above how much you'll spend in a month to maximize your credit score. Your \"ideal\" credit limit will depend on your personal spending habits and preferences, Rossman says.The best limit for your credit scoreToo keep your credit score high, it's best to use only 10% to 30% of your available credit and pay your statements off in full every month, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.The percentage of your available credit that you're using is a metric known as credit utilization. Keeping utilization low shows lenders you manage credit responsibly, which helps improve your credit score, while hitting that limit every month signals to lenders that you may be over-reliant on credit and a higher lending risk, thus lowering your score, says Rossman.Working backward from the an ideal credit utilization of 10% to 30%, if you typically spend around $5,000 a month on your card, you should have a limit of $50,000, Tsantes says. By the same metric, if you typically spend around $2,500 on your card, $25,000 could be a good limit, he adds. \"The idea is that you'll never be close to hitting that limit,\" Tsantes says. Having a seemingly high limit is there not as money available to use, but as a buffer to keep your balance well below your maximum and your credit utilization low.It may also be smart to consult a trusted financial professional who can help you determine the amount of credit that makes sense for you.It's OK to stick to a more practical limitCredit card debt can be costly and hard to pay off. So, if you know you're likely to view your credit limit as the amount you can spend each month, it may be wiser to stick to a limit that covers just the essentials with a small buffer, Rossman says.\"You definitely don't want to be hitting or approaching that limit or spending more than you can afford to pay back,\" he says. \"Even though it's good for your credit score to have more credit, if you're going to use that as a way to overspend, that could be a danger.\"However, even with a lower limit, it's still possible to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, Rossman says. If your line of credit is just enough to cover your essentials and you're getting close to your limit every month, there are \"workarounds\" to lower your utilization, like making extra payments throughout the month to keep your usage under 30%.How to increase your credit limitTo increase your credit limit, you can either request a credit limit increase for an existing card or open a new card with a new line of credit, Rossman says. Start by checking with your existing credit card issuer to see if requesting a credit limit increase will trigger a hard or soft credit inquiry, he says. Hard inquiries can cause a small, temporary dip in your credit score, while a soft inquiry is a routine or informational check that does not affect your credit score. If your issuer will use a soft inquiry, increasing the limit on an existing card can boost available credit and lower your credit utilization without hurting your score, Rossman says.If your issuer is going to run a hard inquiry, it may be more strategic to open a new credit card with a different set of rewards and benefits, Rossman says. That way, you can have more options to maximize benefits across your cards, he says.Although increasing your credit limit can raise your spending power, avoid treating that extra credit as more money or an emergency fund for \"desperate times,\" Rossman says. Spending more than you can afford on a credit card can lead to high-interest debt that becomes difficult to repay, he says, especially if your financial situation is already strained.\"Having a credit card with a $5,000 limit — yes, that could help you in a pinch — but that's not the same as having $5,000 in the bank,\" Rossman says. \"This is debt. It can be very expensive debt.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

Resume Genius's latest report identified the jobs that offer the highest pay without requiring a four-year college degree, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.The report demonstrates that \"there's no one way to get a high-paying job,\" according to Resume Genius career expert Eva Chan. \"All of the jobs do have some degree of training, some have schooling, but they're all very attainable without a degree,\" she says.Blue-collar jobs like electrical power-line installer and repairer are becoming increasingly popular, according to Chan.\"Maybe 10 to 15 years ago, they weren't seen as lucrative,\" Chan says, but more people are realizing that blue-collar roles and skilled trades can offer \"high pay\" and plenty of growth opportunities.Management and sales roles like insurance sales agent are ideal for people who have strong interpersonal skills, according to Chan.\"Your pay can increase pretty quickly if you're consistent and you're good with building relationships,\" she says.

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled plans for a new \"Trump-class\" battleship, declaring it would be \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built.\" He hailed the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" promising they would \"help maintain American military supremacy [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"But there is one glaring problem: battleships have been obsolete for decades. The last was built more than 80 years ago, and the U.S. Navy retired the last Iowa-class ships nearly 30 years ago. Once symbols of naval might with their massive guns, battleships have long since been eclipsed by aircraft carriers and modern destroyers armed with long-range missiles.While labeling the new surface combatants as \"battleships\" could be a misnomer, defense experts say that there remain several gaps between Trump's vision and modern naval warfare.Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, dismissed the idea, writing in a Dec. 23 commentary that \"there is little need for said discussion because this ship will never sail.\" He contended the program would take too long to design, cost far too much and run counter to the Navy's current strategy of distributed firepower.\"A future administration will cancel the program before the first ship hits the water,\" Cancian said.Bernard Loo, senior fellow at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, described the proposal as \"a prestige project more than anything else.\" He compared it to Japan's World War II super-battleships Yamato and Musashi — the largest ever built — which were sunk by carrier-borne aircraft before playing a significant role in combat.Photograph of the IJN Yamato, the lead ship of the Yamato class of battleships that served with the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II.

[and] in a very layman's perspective of strategy, size matters,\" Loo said. He added that the size of the proposed battleship — displacing more than 35,000 tons and measuring more than 840 feet, or a little over two football fields long — would make it a \"bomb magnet.\"\"The size and the prestige value of it all make it an even more tempting target, potentially for your adversary,\" Loo said.Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, suggested Trump may be drawn to the symbolic power of battleships, which were the most visible icons of naval firepower for much of the 20th century.The USS Missouri, completed in 1944 and the last U.S. battleship built, famously hosted Japan's surrender in 1945.Japanese surrender signatories arrive aboard the USS Missouri to participate in surrender ceremonies, Tokyo Bay, Japan, U.S. Army Signal Corps, September 2, 1945. (Photo by: Circa Images/GHI/Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Universal History Archive | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesClark noted that the U.S. Navy recommissioned four World War II battleships in the 1980s as part of its 600-ship fleet expansion strategy during the Cold War to counter the Soviet Union. \"This may be an era in which the president believes the U.S. last had naval supremacy.\"Battleships last saw combat in 1991, when retrofitted Iowa-class battleships provided shore bombardment fire support to coalition forces in the first Gulf War.The battleship USS Wisconsin (BB-64) launches a BGM-109 Tomahawk missile against a target in Iraq during Operation Desert Storm. (Photo by © CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images)Historical | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesWhat's in a name?Clark noted that the classification matters less than the weapons a ship carries.According to the U.S. Navy, the Trump-class battleship — part of a new \"golden fleet\" of warships — will be equipped with weapons such as conventional guns and missiles, as well as electronic rail guns and laser-based weaponry. It will also be able to carry nuclear and hypersonic missiles.Such a vessel would essentially function like a large destroyer, regardless of whether it is called a battleship.However, CSIS' Cancian countered that such a design runs against the Navy's distributed operations model, which seeks to reduce vulnerability by spreading firepower across many assets. \"This proposal would go in the other direction, building a small number of large, expensive, and potentially vulnerable assets,\" he wrote.Even if the Trump-class battleship proves technically feasible, analysts said cost would be the decisive obstacle.Loo said U.S. weapons programs routinely exceed timelines and budgets.The Navy's Zumwalt‑class destroyers — the largest surface combatants currently at 15,000 tons — were reduced from 32 to three ships due to spiraling costs. More recently, the Constellation‑class frigate was canceled due to design and workforce challenges.Clark estimated the Trump‑class would cost two to three times more than today's destroyers. With Arleigh Burke destroyers priced at about $2.7 billion each, that implies a single battleship could cost upward of $8 billion.The cost of crewing and maintaining them will put more pressure on an already strained Navy budget, he added.RSIS' Loo was more critical in his assessment, calling the decision a strategic mistake. \"At the very least, as far as I'm concerned, it's strategic hubris.\"",

    "body": "Waymo autonomous taxis turns onto Post Street in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo temporarily paused its robotaxi service in the San Francisco Bay Area on Thursday, ahead of expected storms in the area, according to a customer notification in the company's driverless ride-hailing app.\"Service temporarily paused due to National Weather Service flash flood warning,\" the notification read.Earlier this week the Alphabet-owned company said it will update its fleet so its robotaxi service is better able to perform during power outages.On Dec. 20, Waymo paused service during a blackout in San Francisco that left tens of thousands of people in the area without power and caused some of its autonomous vehicles to halt in mid-traffic, contributing to or causing gridlock.The National Weather Service extended a flood watch for the entire San Francisco Bay Area through Friday 10 p.m. local time.Waymo didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, or say whether regulators required its service pause on Thursday given the flash flood warnings.The California Public Utilities Commission — which regulates driverless ride-hailing services in the state — did not immediately respond to requests for information during the Christmas holiday on Thursday.Waymo currently operates a commercial, driverless service in five U.S. markets, up from three at the end of 2024. Waymo's robotaxi service has been operating in Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles this year. The company intends to significantly expand its service area across and beyond the U.S. in 2026, CNBC previously reported.Waymo is facing increased public scrutiny and safety concerns as it attempts to expand its robotaxi service.The former CEO of San Francisco's Municipal Transit Authority, Jeffrey Tumlin, told CNBC that regulators and robotaxi companies can take valuable lessons away from the chaos that arose with Waymo vehicles during the PG&E power outages last week.\"I think we need to be asking 'what is a reasonable number of [autonomous vehicles] to have on city streets, by time of day, by geography and weather?'\" Tumlin said. He also suggested regulators may want to set up a staged system that will allow autonomous vehicle companies to rapidly scale their operations, provided they meet specific tests.One of those tests, he said, would be how quickly a company can get their autonomous vehicles safely out of the way of traffic if they encounter something that is confusing like a four-way intersection with no functioning traffic lights.Cities and regulators should also seek more data from robotaxi companies about the planned or actual performance of their vehicles during expected emergencies such as blackouts, floods or earthquakes, Tumlin said.",

Kennedy International Airport, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. More than 200 were also scrubbed at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey, and more than 100 were canceled at Philadelphia International Airport.American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets and said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said. Flying as early as possible is likely the best bet with few seats available during the busy Christmas week.Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, expects carriers to fly a record 52.6 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 5, with this Friday and Sunday among the busiest days.Airlines generally cancel flights ahead of time for major weather events in the forecast, like blizzards or hurricanes, to avoid planes, connecting travelers and crews from getting stranded and worsening disruptions.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport lounges",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "The internet was becoming mainstream in the late 90s, but Miro Mitev was head-down exploring something that wouldn't become popular for decades: AI.Now an asset manager, Mitev was an early adopter of AI in finance after discovering the capabilities of neural networks in 1997 while studying at the Vienna University of Economics and Business.He told CNBC he saw the potential of neural networks for financial forecasts. \"I fell in love with these kinds of possibilities,\" he said.Mitev spent his 25-year career forecasting for banks and tech firms like Siemens. He founded SmartWealth Asset Management, whose decisions are made entirely by a network of AI systems. Its latest fund, IVAC, is eyeing $2 billion in assets under management and has an annualized returns target of 14-15%.Despite no human involvement in the AI's decisions, Mitev said that \"humans are the most important part of the equation\" as they're the ones selecting training data, inputting variables, building the parameters, and consistently tweaking the model. Once a model is created, \"it's very dangerous to start intervening,\" Mitev said. Indeed, trusting the model is his golden rule, he added.watch nowInstead, humans should ensure that there are no errors in the data or calculations, and introduce new data so that the model is up to date.\"The worst is to overrule the results, and this is what happens very often,\" Mitev said, adding that people \"don't trust\" AI at first. \"Even if we, as humans, don't see the result now, if we look back after two months, three months, we say, 'Oh, actually, we were wrong,'\" he added.The forces driving the market — optimism, pessimism, speculation — are very human. Even the European Central Bank has warned that the current AI bull run may be driven not by detailed technical analysis but by fear-of-missing-out. Mitev said that taking the emotion out of investing proves better results; SmartWealth Asset Management has seen gains of 407.63% across a 10-year period to Nov. 1 2025, compared with an industry benchmark of 145.34% over the same period, according to a graph a representative for the firm shared with CNBC. It's \"not possible\" to know what will happen in one year, Mitev said, but he can see up to one month ahead with his model. \"Evaluating this information and making informed decisions based on this consistently proves to be providing better results than the human.\"Read moreThe constant monitoring and introduction of new data are important points, given that AI systems do \"hallucinate\": generating false information. Mitev said models' mistakes were down to \"overfitting,\" data issues or model misspecification.Overfitting is where the algorithm pays too much attention to what Mitev called \"noise.\" He said this was data \"which is not meaningful\" because it doesn't reveal a true cause-and-effect relationship with stock performance. Rigorous design, validation, and live environment testing, serve as an antidote to this, Mitev added. It means that, although his fund strategy is executed entirely by a series of algorithms, humans still play a crucial role in making sure it's effective.\"It's actually a process that evolves over years ... and this is the reason why in-house development of these kind of technologies is very important,\" he added – especially for anyone looking to differentiate their AI play.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms that include FAST channels like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Annealed neodymium iron boron magnets sit in a barrel at a Neo Material Technologies Inc. factory in Tianjin, China on June 11, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRare earth magnet makers are having a moment as Western nations scramble to build domestic \"mine-to-magnet\" supply chains and reduce their dependence on China.A turbulent year of supply restrictions and tariff threats has thrust the strategic importance of magnet manufacturers firmly into the spotlight, with rare earths surging toward the top of the agenda amid the U.S. and China's ongoing geopolitical rivalry. Magnets made from rare earths are vital components for everything from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones to medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications, and precision weaponry.It's in this context that the U.S., European Union and Australia, among others, have sought to break China's mineral dominance by taking a series of strategic measures to support magnet makers, including heavily investing in factories, supporting the buildout of new plants, and boosting processing capacity.The U.S. and Europe, in particular, are expected to emerge as key growth markets for rare earth magnet production over the next decade. Analysts, however, remain skeptical that Western nations will be able to escape China's mineral orbit anytime soon.\"Frankly, we were the solution to the problem that the world didn't know it had,\" Rahim Suleman, CEO of Canadian group Neo Performance Materials, told CNBC by video call. Photo taken on Sept. 19, 2025 shows rare-earth magnetic bars at NEO magnetic plant in Narva, a city in northeastern Estonia. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\"The end-market is growing from the point of physics, not software, so therefore it has to grow in this way,\" he continued. \"And it's not dependent on any single end market, so it's not dependent on automotive or battery electric vehicles or drones or wind farms. It's any energy-efficient motor across the spectrum,\" Suleman said, referring to the demand for magnets from fast-growing industries such as robotics. His comments came around three months after Neo launched the grand opening of its rare earth magnet factory in Narva, Estonia. Situated directly on Russia's doorstep, the facility is widely expected to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China. European Union industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, for example, lauded the plant's strategic importance, saying at an event in early December that the project marked \"a high point of Europe's sovereignty.\" watch nowNeo's Suleman said the Estonian facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond.\"Globally, the market is 250,000 tons and going to 600,000 tons, so more than doubling in ten years,\" Suleman said. \"And more importantly, our concentration is 93% in a single jurisdiction, so when you put those two factors together, I think you'll find an enormously quick growing market.\"'Skyrocketing demand'To be sure, the global supply of rare earths has long been dominated by Beijing. China is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency.A recent report from consultancy IDTechEx estimated that rare earth magnet capacity in the U.S. is on track to grow nearly six times by 2036, with the expansion driven by strategic support and funding from the Department of Defense, as well as increasing midstream activity. Magnet production in Europe, meanwhile, was forecast to grow 3.1 times over the same time period, bolstered by the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's demand by 2030.  Regional composition of rare earths and permanent magnet production in 2024, according to data compiled by the International Energy Agency.IEAJohn Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based rare earth magnet producer, told CNBC that the company is seeking to scale up as fast as possible \"so that this fundamental supply chain doesn't hold America back.\" Vulcan Elements is one of the companies to have received direct funding from the Trump administration. The magnet maker received a $620 million direct federal loan last month from the Department of Defense to support domestic magnet production.\"Rare earth magnets convert electricity into motion, which means that virtually all advanced machines and technologies—the innovations that shape our daily lives and keep us safe—require them in order to be operational,\" Maslin told CNBC by email. \"The need for high-performance magnets is accelerating exponentially amid a surge in demand and production of advanced technologies, including hard disk drives, semiconductor fabrication equipment, hybrid/electric motors, satellites, aircraft, drones, and almost every military capability,\" he added. Read moreSeparately, Wade Senti, president of Florida-based magnet maker Advanced Magnet Lab, said the only way to deliver on alternative supply chains is to be innovative.\"The demand for non-China sourced rare earth permanent magnets is skyrocketing,\" Senti told CNBC by email. \"The challenge is can United States magnet producers create a fully domestic (non-China) supply chain for these magnets. This requires the magnet manufacturer to take the lead and bring the supply chain together – from mine to magnet to customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "People gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a rare blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting his bid to overrule a lower court order and allow the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of local and state leaders.The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case in October after a District Court judge blocked the president's plans to send troops to aid in an immigration crackdown. The court on Tuesday declined Trump's request.\"Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a post on X.\"This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump's march toward authoritarianism,\" Pritzker continued.U.S. presidents can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, but guardsmen are typically not permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. Trump's attempts to send troops to mostly blue cities to fight crime have tested the bounds of presidential authority and led to a series of lawsuits. Citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by the Constitution or Congress, the court found Trump lacked the authority to deploy troops to Illinois in this case.\"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,\" the unsigned order states.The order is not final, but for now bars the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Chicago.Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch offered dissenting opinions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion.Trump has sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Portland in recent months, despite objections from local leaders. Those deployments have resulted in several lawsuits, including a legal challenge from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and Trump foil, and local officials in D.C.\"The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday.\"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,\" Jackson continued. \"Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The Administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",

    "body": "As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect.You want to be excited about someone new and feel a deep connection to them. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag.1. The relationship makes you feel on edgeIn your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay.Mixed signals, hot and cold affection, and inconsistency can then feel intimate rather than anxiety-inducing. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry.What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. Does your nervous system settle when you are around them or are you always on edge? If it's the latter, that may be a signal that the feeling you have isn't chemistry, and that this person makes you feel unsafe.2. The highs and lows feel addictiveThe emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves.What to do: Your body needs to learn how to slow down and feel safe again. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload.3. You keep going back to themBeing drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. You believe that you can make it right this time. You might also recreate painful dynamics that mirror your past because you can predict what happens, and this gives you a false sense of control.What to do: Self-reflection is important here. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. 4. Jealousy feels excitingIf it feels exciting when your partner is jealous, this isn't chemistry — it is your insecurity rearing its head. You might even do something on purpose to trigger their jealousy in order to feel closer to them or make them prove to you that you are wanted. In your mind, this might sound like, \"If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough,\" or, \"If they chase me, it means they love me enough.\"What to do: Work on yourself so your validation comes from within, not from other people. Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. 5. Things are never calmSteady connection should feel grounding and safe. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, \"If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt.\"The lack of spark doesn't mean there isn't chemistry. It might just mean there isn't anxiety. What to do: Teach your body that it's okay to feel calm. When you feel like you want to create conflict or chase a thrill, stop and notice that. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass.Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like.Dr. Amy Tran is a clinical psychologist.

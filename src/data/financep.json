    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he speaks during a press briefing at the White House, following the Supreme Court's ruling that Trump had exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 20, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Supreme Court's decision Friday to throw out a large number of tariffs that President Donald Trump imposed on imports was widely expected. What's far less certain is the longer-run impacts as the economy and markets again adjust to a changed landscape.Trump and other White House officials have promised to employ other authorities to implement the tariffs, with the president already announcing a 10% levy under a section of the Trade Act of 1974. However, other questions remain: What will be the impact on prices? Will companies that paid the tariffs covered in the high court's decision seek refunds? How will the Federal Reserve react?Here are five takeaways from the ruling and the associated fallout.1. The economic impactIn a word, the macro reverberations are expected to be limited, especially pending Trump's next moves and what happens with the refunds issue.RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas characterized the likely economic fallout as \"narrow,\" though there are \"enormous potential winners from this ruling,\" particularly in the tariff-sensitive retail and manufacturing sectors.Growth slowed substantially in the fourth quarter, with GDP accelerating at just a 1.4% annualized rate. But that was largely due to the government shutdown, with faster growth likely in the first quarter of 2026. \"Fiscal conditions already point to a sizable positive impulse in 2026, driven by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and an easing monetary policy backdrop,\" said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede. \"The tariff ruling may incrementally enhance this stimulus, reinforcing expectations for above-trend economic growth.\"Pride warned that there could be a temporary drag on exports if companies rush to import products ahead of Trump's next tariff moves, as they did in early 2025.2. Some help for inflationThe court decision came the same day that the Commerce Department reported core inflation ran at a 3% annual rate in December, according to the Fed's primary forecasting gauge. Central bank officials have estimated that tariffs are worth about half a percentage point to inflation, an impact that will be only temporary at least as it figures into the way inflation is calculated.So losing the tariffs reduces, for now, a potential economic headwind that could figure into the Fed's decisions on interest rates this year. watch nowInterestingly, markets on Friday rolled back their bets on rate cuts a bit, now placing a higher likelihood of the next reduction coming in July rather than June, as previously indicated, according to CME Group data. Traders still largely expect two cuts this year, with about 40% odds of a third — little changed from before the decision.\"We think that the Supreme Court's decision to strike down IEEPA tariffs will not have major macro implications for the U.S. economy or the Fed,\" Evercore ISI analysts said in a note.3. Relief for the marketFor much of the past year, Trump's more severe tariff declarations have periodically sent financial markets reeling — then spinning back higher after he ultimately backed off many of the most aggressive measures.True to form, stocks rallied Friday, glossing over worries about the pace of growth and inflation, and raising hopes for corporate earnings. Treasury yields drifted higher but the move was contained as investors debated the merits of growth versus inflation.\"More broadly, the decision underscores a shift toward slower, more procedurally constrained trade policy, reducing headline volatility, but increasing the importance of fiscal mechanics and supply considerations for fixed‑income markets,\" said Dan Siluk, head of global short duration and liquidity and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson.4. What about those refunds?Wall Street reaction was mixed on the prospect for tariff refunds.Morgan Stanley estimated that the U.S. probably would pay back about $85 billion to affected parties. RSM's Brusuelas pegged the number at between $100 billion and $130 billion, while analyst Ed Mills at Raymond James put the outlay still higher, at about $175 billion, in line with a University of Pennsylvania model.One question is process. The Supreme Court's decision did not address the issue specifically, likely leaving it to lower jurisdictions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted the likelihood of a \"mess\" sorting out the issue. Brian Gardner, chief Washington policy strategist at Stifel, speculated that refunds won't happen retroactively at all after the issue makes its way through lower courts.\"We remain skeptical that the government will refund/pay a large sum, but, again, this issue remains unresolved,\" Gardner said in a note.5. What now?The path from here will be complicated, but Trump in a news conference Friday indicated no willingness to back down in the effort to impose tariffs, which he has repeatedly called \"the most beautiful word\" in the dictionary.One important point is that it's not as if tariffs are going away. Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to cover about 60% of the tariffs he has implemented, so the rest stand. From there, the administration can cite a number of provisions in the trade law to levy the duties.However, he will need to go to Congress for approval on many of them, and there are also time limits attached to some of those measures. \"Given Trump's public ire against previous court rulings and tariff criticisms, we would not be surprised to see a meaningful tariff escalation/response from the White House sooner rather than later,\" wrote Chris Krueger, managing director at TD Cowen Washington Research Group. Krueger expects the 2026 tariff effort to be \"all gas, some [temporary[ brakes ... stay tuned.\"watch now",

    "body": "Engineering majors earn some of the highest salaries right after college — and they're still near the top years later.That's according to the latest findings from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, based on 2024 U.S. Census data, the most recent available.The analysis breaks down annual earnings for college graduates by major and reflects the income of full-time workers whose highest degree is a bachelor's, excluding currently enrolled students. Various engineering degrees have consistently ranked among the top-paying fields in recent years.The highest-paying majors for workers ages 22 to 27 are computer engineering, computer science and chemical engineering, with recent graduates earning median early-career salaries of $85,000 or more. That's well above the U.S  median personal income of just over $45,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. However, engineering accounts for about 6% of bachelor's degrees awarded nationwide, representing a relatively small share of all college graduates, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Education Statistics.Here are the 18 majors that lead to the highest salaries for workers ages 22 to 27:Computer engineering: $90,000Computer science: $87,000Chemical engineering: $85,000Aerospace engineering: $85,000Industrial engineering: $83,000Electrical engineering: $82,000Mechanical engineering: $80,000Construction services: $75,000Civil engineering: $75,000General engineering: $75,000Miscellaneous engineering: $75,000Economics: $72,000Business analytics: $72,000Finance: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Nursing: $70,000Mathematics: $70,000Finance: $70,000Engineering graduates remain in strong demand for their mix of mathematical skills and technical expertise, which are valuable across a wide range of industries, data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers shows.While artificial intelligence is reshaping how the technical work is done, employment in many engineering fields is still projected to grow over the next decade, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Engineering also tends to pay well over time. Among graduates ages 35 to 45, every engineering major reports median pay of at least $100,000. Here are all of the majors with mid-career median earnings of $100,000 or more, according to the New York Fed.Chemical engineering: $135,000Computer engineering: $131,000Aerospace engineering: $130,000Electrical engineering: $123,000Computer science: $120,000Mechanical engineering: $120,000Construction services: $120,000Civil engineering: $115,000Economics: $115,000Finance: $112,000Business analytics: $109,000General engineering: $105,000Miscellaneous engineering: $105,000Physics: $105,000Engineering technologies: $104,000Industrial engineering: $100,000Mathematics: $100,000Information systems: $100,000Marketing: $100,000Biochemistry: $100,000Political science: $100,000In contrast, education and arts majors tend to earn significantly less overall. By ages 35 to 45, six fields of education majors report median earnings below $60,000, placing them among the lower-paid fields in the study.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

Photo: Yolande CheeYolande CheeIndia hosted one of the world's biggest AI events this week, but it was marred by chaos and confusion, apparently not the message it's trying to send as it strives to become a leading artificial intelligence player.Despite the drama, U.S. tech firms in particular couldn't resist the temptation of the Indian market, talking up the country's AI potential and making a number of announcements.I have been on the ground in New Delhi since Monday and I can honestly say that the AI Impact Summit has been one of the most challenging reporting assignments of my career.Traffic has been a nightmare more than usual in the Indian capital. There were times it didn't move at all. On Wednesday, I had events and interviews at three different hotels and getting the team around to these appointments on time was a real challenge.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalAt one point on Thursday, were weren't even sure if we'd be able to enter the Bharat Mandapam, the venue where the summit took place. That's because instructions were not clear on when media would be allowed in on Thursday when Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the event.We eventually found out we could enter at 6 a.m. local time. When we turned up, security did not let us in until later, not before a crowd of media had gathered at the gates. Inside, security were giving out conflicting instructions. Several delegates expressed to me their frustrations over the organization of the summit. The event itself was marred by other controversies. Bill Gates, who was named in the Epstein files, was scheduled to give a keynote address. There was then uncertainty if he would even turn up. The Gates Foundation had said earlier in the week that he would give the speech, but then on Thursday said the billionaire had pulled out.Meanwhile, a university was reportedly kicked out of the summit for suggesting a robot dog they were showcasing was its own creation. A professor at Galgotias University told state-run broadcaster DD News that the robot, which was actually made by Chinese firm Unitree, was \"developed\" by the academic institution.India hosted one of the biggest AI events in the world that was marred by some chaos and confusion. Photo: AI Impact Summit 2026Arjun KharpalOnline users called out the university, highlighting that the robot was made by a Chinese firm. The university denied claiming it had built the robot.\"We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavor to make students learn AI programming and develop and deploy real-world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing AI talent is [the] need of the hour,\" the university said, according to media reports.Indian IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw apologized on Tuesday for the \"problems\" on day one.

Modi had delegates on stage with everyone holding hands. But OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei didn't do as they they'd been instructed, in a moment that instantly got scrutinized across social media. Altman later explained that he was \"confused\" and wasn't sure what he should be doing.Days earlier, Anthropic ran a Super Bowl ad taking digs at OpenAI's decision to test advertisements in ChatGPT. India's lureDespite all of these moments, the event pulled in a who's who of tech names from Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai to Altman, all of whom talked up India's advantages from a huge talent pool to a large consumer market. \"The excitement here, it's just been incredible to watch,\" Altman told me. These tech firms used the week to make announcements and form partnerships around India. OpenAI said it would be the first customer of Tata Consultancy Services' data center business. Google announced partnerships with researchers and education institutions for its Gemini artificial intelligence feature.Read moreEvery CEO I spoke to praised India's tech development and focus. The government used the opportunity to tout India's potential as an AI hub saying the country was aiming to attract $200 billion in AI investment over the next two years.Even the blaring horns of the cars of New Delhi and the chaos of the Summit weren't enough to dampen the enthusiasm from big tech for India which continues to grow as a critical and attractive market for some of the world's largest firms.",

    "body": "Blue Owl BDC's CEO Craig Packer speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersThe latest tremor in the private credit world involved a deal that should've been reassuring to markets. Blue Owl, a direct lender specializing in loans to the software industry, said Wednesday it had sold $1.4 billion of its loans to institutional investors at 99.7% of par value. That means sophisticated players scrutinized the loans and the companies involved and felt comfortable paying nearly full price for the debt, a message that Blue Owl co-President Craig Packer sought to convey in interviews several times this week.But instead of calming markets, it sent shares of Blue Owl and other alternative asset managers diving on fears of what could follow. That's because as part of the asset sale, Blue Owl announced it was replacing voluntary quarterly redemptions with mandated \"capital distributions\" funded by future asset sales, earnings or other transactions.\"The optics are bad, even if the loan book is fine,\" Brian Finneran of Truist Securities wrote in commentary circulated Thursday. \"Most investors are interpreting the sales to mean that redemptions accelerated and led to forced sales of higher quality assets to meet requests.\"Blue Owl's move was widely interpreted as the firm halting redemptions from a fund under pressure, even as Packer pointed out investors would get about 30% of their money back by March 31, far more than the 5% allowed under its previous quarterly schedule.\"We're not halting redemptions, we're just changing the form,\" Packer told CNBC on Friday. \"If anything, we're accelerating redemptions.\"watch nowComing amid a broad tech and software selloff fueled by fears of AI disruption, the episode shows that even apparently strong loan books aren't immune to market jitters. This in turn forces alternative lenders to scramble to satisfy shareholders' sudden demands for the return of their money.It also exposed a central tension in private credit: What happens when illiquid assets collide with demands for liquidity?Against a backdrop that was already fragile for private credit since the collapse of auto firms Tricolor and First Brands, the fear that this could be an early sign of credit markets cracking took off. Shares of Blue Owl fell Thursday and Friday. They are down more than 50% in the past year. Early Thursday, the economist and former Pimco CEO Mohamed El-Erian wondered in social media posts whether Blue Owl was a \"canary in the coal mine\" for a future crisis, like the failure of a pair of Bear Stearns credit funds in 2007. On Friday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that he was \"concerned\" about the possibility that risks from Blue Owl had migrated to the regulated financial system because one of the institutional buyers was an insurance company.Mostly softwareWith skepticism over loans to software firms running high, one question from investors was whether the loans they sold were a representative slice of the total funds, or whether Blue Owl cherry-picked the best loans to sell.The underlying loans were to 128 companies across 27 industries, the largest being software, the firm said.Blue Owl indicated it was a broad swath of overall loans in the funds: \"Each investment to be sold represents a partial amount of each Blue Owl BDC's exposure to the respective portfolio company.\"Despite its efforts to calm markets, Blue Owl finds itself at the nexus of concerns around private credit loans made to software firms.Most of the 200-plus companies Blue Owl lends to are in software; more than 70% of its loans are to that category, executives said Wednesday in a fourth-quarter earnings call. \"We remain enthusiastic proponents of software,\" Packer said on that call. \"Software is an enabling technology that can serve every sector and market and company in the world. It's not a monolith.\"The company makes loans to firms \"with durable moats\" and is protected by the seniority of its loans, meaning that private equity owners would need to be wiped out before Blue Owl saw losses.But, for now at least, the problem Blue Owl faces is one of perception bleeding into reality.\"The market is reacting, and it becomes this self-fulfilling idea, where they get more redemptions, so they have to sell more loans, and that drives the stock down further,\" said Ben Emmons, founder of FedWatch Advisors.",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

    "body": "Julia Holden can relate to the struggle of getting your baby to fall asleep.In February 2024, she and her husband noticed that their newborn son Maxime fell asleep more quickly when his eyes were gently covered with a burp cloth or small towel, she says. As a new mom \"in survival mode,\" Holden quickly looked for a purchasable product — a comfortable eye covering that'd stay on his tiny face if he moved — but couldn't find one she liked, she says.As a younger adult, Holden had dreamed of entrepreneurship, so her near-instant thought was to make this product herself and sell it, she says. She designed a baby hat with an attached eye covering, named her side hustle Sleepy Hat and, over the course of the next year, spent nearly $16,000 from her personal savings to bootstrap the business, she says.Since June 2025, the business has brought in five figures in revenue each month, including over $90,000 in December and more than $69,000 in January, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. The company is profitable, says Holden, who initially launched it while working full-time as a senior relationship manager for an advertising company and taking care of her baby.She found time for Sleepy Hat in 20-minute windows between breast-feedings at her home in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, she says. \"I had no outside funding, no team and no child care beyond family help,\" says Holden, 34.DON'T MISS: How to read people and master your body language to be more influential at workHolden quit her job — which paid her $95,000 a year, she says — in October to focus on Sleepy Hat full-time. Most of its profits have been reinvested back into the business, including payroll for two-part-time contractors who help with inventory and running ads on Google and Amazon, she says. \"I also recently took on an advisor, [who has] a little bit of equity,\" Holden says.Holden paid herself $2,500 from the business in 2025, and has been living off her remaining personal savings and her husband's income as an assistant director at Princeton University. She works anywhere from 30 to 60 hours per week, including weekends, she says. Doing all of that while being a mom to a now-2-year-old is taxing, but since she sets her own schedule, she can at least take more time during daylight hours for herself and her family than she did at a 9-to-5, she says.\"I'm still stressed, but for a more meaningful reason,\" says Holden. \"It feels more important. It's much more satisfying.\"'My first sale from a stranger was life-changing'Holden didn't have \"proof of market fit\" when she decided to launch Sleepy Hat, she says. Rather, she brought the idea to other moms in her circle, who she says all called it \"genius.\"She intended to spend about $10,000 launching the business, and surpassed her budget on \"product development, creating patterns, creating prototypes and samples ... and then all the tiny little things that add up, like purchasing a domain, a trademark [and] building a website,\" she says.She didn't have a design background, so the first pattern she and her mom created together resulted in a hat that was \"completely the wrong size,\" she says. An entrepreneur friend referred her to a factory in China, which sent her prototypes. But her \"tech pack\" — a garment blueprint for manufacturers, essentially — initially wasn't detailed enough, resulting in about $1,500 worth of defective products, she says.Before creating the \"Sleepy Hat,\" Holden would use a cloth to limit visual distractions during nap time for her son, Maxime.Julia HoldenAfter finalizing the product's design and ordering 1,500 units, Holden \"splurged\" on a photographer to fill a website for Sleepy Hat with professional-looking images, she says. The website launched in September 2024, and didn't receive many sales until around December, when Holden posted her product and website on online marketplace Grommet, she says.Sleepy Hat ended the year with just under $2,000 in total sales. \"My first sale from a stranger was life-changing,\" says Holden. \"I was so excited but also terrified to actually ship the product.\"Holden joined Amazon as a third-party seller in August 2025. Roughly around then, her posts on Sleepy Hat's TikTok account started gaining traction, with some garnering hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of likes. Moms bonded in the comments over their \"FOMO babies\" who fought sleep while on walks, car rides or in restaurants, saying they \"needed\" the hat for their kids.The road to 'six-figures plus'Most of Holden's sales now come from paid online advertising, she says. She's designing Sleepy Hats with new patterns and materials, improving her social media strategy and updating her packaging, she adds.\"The goal is to increase my own salary on a quarterly basis this year,\" says Holden. \"I hope to double what I pay myself in Q2 in April ... I hope next year to be able to pay myself actually more than what I was making at my full-time job, so six-figures plus.\"Holden isn't technically a first-time entrepreneur — she previously started a short-lived T-shirt brand and website for women runners — but she's still working on her financial acumen and organizational skills, she says. She's worked with an accountant, alongside her advisor, to help her cover that weakness, she says.The original Sleepy Hat sketch Holden came up with in 2024.Julia Holden\"You need to understand every dollar that's coming out and every dollar that's coming in,\" she says. \"And I'm not particularly finite. I just don't gravitate towards spreadsheets ... So it's definitely been a learning curve to force myself to take the time and understand the balance sheet and where every dollar is going, and it's still a work in progress.\"Holden has also learned the value of trusting her gut, she says. She recalls a moment when her sister, who owns a PowerPoint tutorial business, advised against launching a startup as a new mom.\"She was like, 'I would not start a business right now. You're [freshly] postpartum,'\" Holden says. \"And I was like, 'OK, I hear you. I'm going to do it anyway.'\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

The artificial intelligence company is providing a lower number and more defined timeline for its planned spending, sources told CNBC, as broader concerns mounted that expansion ambitions were too great for the potential revenue that would follow.OpenAI is projecting that its total revenue for 2030 will be more than $280 billion, with nearly equal contributions from its consumer and enterprise businesses, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the information is private. The spending plan the company is offering is meant to more directly tie to its expected revenue growth, the people said. In the back half of last year, OpenAI announced a flurry of multibillion-dollar infrastructure deals, partnering with leading chipmakers and cloud companies. OpenAI is finalizing a massive funding round that could total more than $100 billion, with about 90% coming from strategic investors, one person said. Nvidia is in discussions to invest up to $30 billion in OpenAI as part of the round that could value the company at a $730 billion pre-money valuation, CNBC has confirmed.In addition to Nvidia, strategic investors in the funding include SoftBank and Amazon. OpenAI generated $13.1 billion in revenue in 2025, the sources said, up from its $10 billion target. The company burned through $8 billion, lower than its $9 billion target, they said. The startup was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, and it rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. ChatGPT now supports more than 900 million weekly active users, the people said, up from 800 million as of October. OpenAI declared a \"code red\" in December to focus on improving the chatbot in the face of competition from rivals Google and Anthropic. ChatGPT had a dip in growth in the fall, but is back to record highs in both weekly active and daily active users, the people said.The company's coding product, Codex, has surpassed more than 1.5 million weekly active users, the people said. Codex competes directly with Anthropic's Claude Code, which has seen a wave of adoption over the last year.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanwatch now",

US CENTCOM | Anadolu | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he is considering limited military strikes to pressure Iran over its nuclear program. \"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors. Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 4 cents to close at $66.39 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent rose 10 cents to settle at $71.76 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.watch now",

Both companies, which provide customer service solutions like voice integration, said accelerating AI adoption has boosted demand.New AI tools, capable of building apps and websites in a matter of minutes, have spooked investors in recent weeks, leading to a massive selloff across the software sector.The worry is that these products, emerging from the likes of Anthropic and OpenAI, will displace the software-as-a-service industry's longstanding business models as firms lean on quicker and more efficient AI tools.So far this year, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF tracking the sector has plunged about 23%, led to the downside by Atlassian, Unity Software and Rapid7, which have shed more than half their value.

    "body": "Phil Spencer, CEO of Microsoft Gaming, appears at the Political Opening of the Gamescom conference in Cologne, Germany, on Aug. 23, 2023.Franziska Krug | German Select | Getty ImagesMicrosoft's head of gaming, Phil Spencer, is leaving the software maker following a 38-year tenure, as the company's Xbox business faces increased challenges.\"Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we've been talking about succession planning,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that was published on Friday. \"I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership.\" Spencer's exit follows the departures of business development chief Chris Young and GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke in 2025. Charlie Bell, who had been Microsoft's most high-ranking security leader, switched to an individual contributor role earlier this month.Revenue from video games at Microsoft declined about 10% in the December quarter from a year earlier, a steeper drop than the company expected, while total revenue grew nearly 17%. Microsoft announced an unspecified impairment charge in its gaming business in January.The company made a $75 billion bet to expand its games business with the 2023 acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and it released Call of Duty titles as a cloud service. But current generation Xbox consoles haven't been as popular as Sony's PlayStation or Nintendo's Switch, and Microsoft has shuttered studios working on new games.Nadella said in the memo that Spencer, who took charge of Xbox in 2014 after running the company's gaming studios, nearly tripled Microsoft's gaming business, in part through acquisitions like Activision Blizzard. Spencer also pushed for Microsoft to take over Minecraft developer Mojang. \"Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it,\" Nadella wrote.After Nadella became CEO in 2014, Sony was selling more consoles than Microsoft, and investors had floated the idea of spinning out consumer assets such as Xbox. Analyst Rick Sherlund of Nomura estimated that the division could lose more than $1 billion for the year.\"The question is, do we go forward with Xbox?\" Spencer said in a 2020 interview with gaming website Shacknews. Spencer said he persuaded Nadella to bring hardware, software and game-development groups into one organization.Asha Sharma, who joined Microsoft in 2024 from Instacart, will take over for Spencer, becoming CEO of gaming and reporting to Nadella. Until now, she has been president of product in Microsoft's Core AI business, which former Meta executive Jay Parikh runs. Before arriving at Instacart in 2021 and serving as operating chief, Sharma spent four years as a vice president of product and engineering at Meta and two years in marketing at Microsoft. \"We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,\" Sharma wrote in a message to Microsoft's gaming employees.She has worked on artificial intelligence products such as the Foundry for incorporating AI models into third-party applications. \"As monetization and AI evolve and influence this future, we will not chase short-term efficiency or flood our ecosystem with soulless AI slop,\" Sharma wrote. \"Games are and always will be art, crafted by humans, and created with the most innovative technology provided by us.\" Sharma said Microsoft will renew its commitment to console gaming. Microsoft's original Xbox came out in 2001.Matt Booty, head of Microsoft's gaming studios, will report to Sharma as executive vice president and chief content officer.\"Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward,\" Nadella wrote.Sarah Bond, president and operating chief of the Xbox unit, will leave Microsoft.\"I've had the privilege of spending time with Asha over the last few weeks as we've planned for this transition, and I've seen firsthand her deep commitment to our players, developers, and brand,\" Bond told Xbox employees in a message she also posted to LinkedIn. \"She brings deep technology and commerce experience, along with a strong track record of building and scaling platforms that the world uses. Xbox deserves this.\"Bond and Spencer both said they will advise Sharma on the transition.WATCH: Microsoft is still a buy for the longer term investor, says CFRA's Sam Stovall",

That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post at 7:50 a.m. ET.At 8:30 a.m., the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4% in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Trump's Friday morning post referred to last year's record-length government shutdown, which began Oct. 1 — the start of the fourth quarter — and lasted 43 days.The federal funding lapse was expected to take a toll on GDP. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimated that, depending on its length, the shutdown would shrink annualized real GDP growth in Q4 by up to 2 percentage points.But economists from Dow Jones were still estimating a 2.5% gain for the period.Trump has previously revealed economic data before its official release, raising questions about possible policy violations and concerns that traders may be getting a heads-up from the president, who can be briefed on the data before it comes out. The Office of Management and Budget not only prohibits executive branch officials from commenting early on such releases, but forbids public statements about them until 30 minutes after they have come out.A White House official defended Trump's post, telling CNBC on condition of anonymity that the president has consistently pointed out how the shutdown has been a drag on the economy, including by sharing GDP percentage figures \"consistent with his 2% Truth this morning.\"In a Truth Social post in January, Trump indirectly revealed forthcoming nonfarm payrolls data.The White House at the time admitted that there was an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data\" while attacking the media for \"grasping at straws to foment another fake controversy.\"During his first presidential term, Trump signaled optimism about a blowout jobs report shortly before its release.Trump's post Friday morning also reiterated his long-running criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as sharply or quickly as the president wants.\"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\" Trump wrote.He has previously branded Powell with the derisive nickname \"Too Late\"; it was unclear if the president meant to misspell the nickname in Friday's post.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's social media post.watch now",

The social media giant is facing trials in both California and New Mexico that accuse Meta of misleading the public about the safety of apps like Instagram.CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified this week in Los Angeles Superior Court in a trial involving a plaintiff dubbed KGM, who alleges that she became addicted to apps like Instagram and YouTube due to certain design features, thus suffering great mental anguish.Meta is also involved in a separate, ongoing trial in New Mexico where the state's attorney general has alleged that Meta failed to safeguard its apps from online predators.The company has denied the allegations in both of those cases.Meta declined to comment. CNBC has reached out to the National PTA for any additional comment.The National PTA and Meta \"have had a funding relationship since 2017,\" Johnson wrote, saying that the previous agreement ended on Dec. 31, 2025.Read more CNBC tech newsTesla loses bid to toss $243 million verdict in fatal Autopilot crash suitMeta and Apple face serious questions about child safety and privacyFrom 'vanlords' to safe parking sites: How RVs became Silicon Valley's housing safety netWho's laughing now?

    "body": "watch nowThe gap is widening between rival toy makers Hasbro and Mattel — thanks in part to a 30-year-old trading card game. The toy giants have flip-flopped dominance in the space for decades, jockeying for the most coveted master licenses to put new fan favorites — Disney princesses and \"Star Wars\" characters among them — on store shelves. But as the industry recovers from a period of declining sales, Hasbro is the one winning over Wall Street.For the fiscal year 2025, Hasbro reported revenue gains of 14%, reaching $4.7 billion, while Mattel saw its net sales drop 1% to $5.3 billion.Though Mattel's revenue is larger than Hasbro's, its growth has been stagnating, according to Eric Handler, managing director and senior research analyst at Roth Capital Partners.\"[Mattel's] revenue has been in a very tight range for five years now, and 2026, on an organic basis, is the same,\" he told CNBC.Mattel shares are down more than 20% in the last 12 months, trading at around $17. Meanwhile, Hasbro's stock is up roughly 46% over the same period, with shares trading at around $100.Of course, Hasbro's journey post-pandemic has not been without its own headwinds. The company's revenue took a hit when it divested its film and TV business, eOne. Also, its entertainment segment, which includes film and TV licenses, was deeply impacted by Hollywood's dual labor strikes in 2023.\"Despite market volatility and a shifting consumer environment, we returned this company to growth in a meaningful way,\" Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks told investors during an earnings call earlier this month.Throughout these changes, one key piece of Hasbro's business has been steadily growing — Wizards of the Coast.A dash of MagicThe Hasbro division includes Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering and the company's portfolio of digital and video games. In 2025, Wizards' revenue grew 45% to $2.1 billion, fueled by sales of sets tied to Magic's Universe Beyond and smaller, limited-edition Secret Lair packs — some that sell for close to $200. While the segment accounts for less than half of the company's revenue, it represents 88% of its adjusted profits.Magic: The Gathering playing cards form a light fixture at the Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton, Washington, Sept. 11, 2025. With traditional toy and game sales lagging, Hasbro has found a growth engine in role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, trading card games like Magic: The Gathering and a growing portfolio of digital and video games.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe strategic trading card game Magic, which was created in 1993, typically features two players going head-to-head using custom decks of collectible cards to cast spells, unleash creatures or use artifacts to defeat their opponent.In the last five years, Hasbro has expanded beyond the lore of the initial game to launch card sets based on intellectual property from third parties, including \"Avatar: The Last Airbender,\" Marvel's \"Spider-Man\" and \"Lord of the Rings.\"These sets are not only popular with long-standing Magic fans, but act as a gateway for consumers from other fanbases into the world of Magic. In mid-2025, Hasbro released a \"Final Fantasy\" set that became the fastest-selling expansion pack in Magic: The Gathering history, generating $200 million in sales in a single day.  \"They have done a fantastic job of widening the funnel in the last couple years, and it's become a multigenerational type of product,\" Handler said. \"The player base is growing. It's a sticky player base that is showing eagerness with new products and new ways to play.\"Through the end of 2025, more than 1 million unique players participated in organized play — meaning sanctioned tournaments — according to Cocks. That's a 22% year-over-year increase, he said.Additionally, the number of game stores that host events, called the Wizards Play Network, has grown to more than 10,000, a 20% increase from 2024.\"Taken together, this reinforces our confidence in Magic's long-term growth,\" Cocks said on the company's earnings call. \"We are building a system of play with multiple entry points, product types, and engagement paths, and that system is positioned to continue driving growth into 2026 and beyond.\"In 2026, Hasbro plans to launch new Magic sets based on \"The Hobbit,\" \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and \"Star Trek.\"The company has forecast mid-single-digit growth for its Wizards business in 2026, but Keegan Cox, associate vice president and research analyst at D.A. Davidson, in a research note published shortly after the company's earnings, called that estimate \"conservative.\" The digital frontierHasbro's Wizards unit also includes the digital and licensed gaming space, which saw revenues jump 6% in 2025, fueled by the success of \"Monopoly Go!\" Cocks has previously noted that modern consumers and modern play is increasingly moving into online forums, and the company has launched new games and an in-person video game studio in Montreal to boost play. While Hasbro's digital gaming division is growing, Mattel is just getting its own digital unit off the ground. Earlier this month, Mattel announced it would buy out partner NetEase from its 50% stake in their Mattel163 joint venture, taking full ownership of the business. Mattel163 develops digital games based on the toy company's brands and since 2018 has launched four digital games: Uno, Uno Wonder, Phase 10 and Skip-Bo. \"In our view, [Mattel] is in the early stages of an investment similar to Hasbro's investment in gaming over 7 years ago,\" D.A. Davidson's Cox wrote. \"While we do not think [Mattel] will be chasing to compete with Hasbro ... we do believe [Mattel] can make successful mobile games tied to their IP and should add to profit margins over time.\"An industry in fluxMattel's push into digital comes as two of its flagship brands struggle to make sales. \"Barbie's been on a meaningful decline, as has Fisher-Price,\" Handler noted. \"That's sort of been negating a lot of the good news that's been happening with Hot Wheels.\" The vehicles division saw gross billings jump 11% in 2025, while the dolls segment fell 7% and the infant, toddler and preschool space slipped 17%.That segment for the youngest consumers has been in decline for over a decade, the result of shrinking population growth and the fact that children are being introduced to electronics earlier in their development. Shifting play habits have meant toy makers have to adapt, and fast. But there's hope for Mattel and the toy industry as a whole. In 2025, total annual dollar sales were up 6% in the U.S., according to data from Circana. And, perhaps more importantly, the number of units sold increased 3%, quelling fears that price-conscious consumers are pulling back on toy purchases.\"Unit sales being up, I think, is the most important metric we can look at,\" said James Zahn, senior editor of The Toy Insider and The Toy Book. \"If unit sales were down, that's when you know people are really buying less, and that didn't happen.\"Mattel and Hasbro, alongside other toy companies, are also expected to get a boost from a robust theatrical calendar this year.Mattel has two of its own brands being represented at the box office with \"Masters of the Universe\" coming in June and \"Matchbox\" arriving in October. While Mattel won't see a major bump from ticket sales, its toy sales could get a boost. After all, the 2023 release of \"Barbie\" helped fuel a 16% increase in gross billings of the doll in the quarter after it hit cinemas.Mattel also holds the master toy licenses for \"Toy Story\" and Disney princesses, meaning it'll handle the bulk of the product for \"Toy Story 5\" and the live-action \"Moana.\"Hasbro will have toy lines for \"The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" \"Spider-Man: Brand New Day\" and \"Avengers: Doomsday.\"Together, Mattel and Hasbro have also collaborated on the much anticipated product line for Netflix's hit animated film \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" promising dolls, foam roleplay items, games and plush items.\"'KPop Demon Hunters' is gonna do big business for both Hasbro and Mattel,\" Zahn said.",

    "body": "watch nowParked along industrial streets, tucked behind warehouses and clustered in residential neighborhoods, thousands of Bay Area residents are living in one of the only forms of housing they can afford: RVs.Across California, the number of people living in vehicles has surged in recent years, as soaring rents and a chronic housing shortage have pushed even full-time workers out of traditional homes and into makeshift ones on wheels. Booming tech wealth, soaring homelessnessIn Santa Clara County — home to Apple, Google and eight of America's 50 most expensive ZIP codes — the number of people living in recreational vehicles full time has surged. County data shows that the portion of homeless individuals sleeping in vehicles has more than doubled since the pandemic, from 18% in 2019 to 37% in 2025. California accounts for nearly a quarter of the nation's homeless residents, despite being home to 12% of its total population, according to federal housing data. Experts say the state faces a massive housing shortage, with one estimate by McKinsey suggesting California needs as many as 3.5 million more homes to meet demand. And even as officials have expanded shelter capacity, federal data shows far fewer shelter beds available than people experiencing homelessness, leaving a significant share of unhoused residents without adequate access to shelter.\"In California, you're more likely to become homeless than almost any other state,\" said Adrian Covert, senior vice president of public policy for the Bay Area Council, a nonpartisan think tank. \"And when you do, you're more likely to become homeless on the streets rather than in the shelter than almost any other state.\"Why RVs?Advocates say many people turn to RVs because they offer a degree of autonomy that shelters and the street do not.\"The RV was a lot better,\" said Salena Alvarez, who has lived in an RV with her boyfriend for a year and a half. Before living in their RV, the couple lived in a car. \"The car is smaller … you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.\"Salena Alvarez is a resident at the Berryessa Supportive Parking site in San Jose, California. She's lived in an RV for a year and a half.CNBCThe RV was a lot better. The car is smaller ... you can't cook, you can't wash your dishes, you can't take a shower, you can't go to the bathroom. You've got to go somewhere.Salena AlvarezRV residentThe rise of 'vanlords'As housing options narrow, a new tier of the crisis has emerged — one where even vehicles have become rental properties.A shadow rental market has taken hold across the Bay Area, where individuals rent out aging RVs to people with few other options. Some call them \"vanlords.\"Renters pay hundreds of dollars per month to sleep in a vehicle parked on a public street. The arrangements typically come without written leases or tenant protections.CNBC spoke with one vanlord and several tenants. Some tenants were immigrants, newly arrived in the U.S., including one woman and her two children from Mexico, while others said the option was simply more affordable than traditional apartment housing in the Bay Area. One individual told CNBC he'd been living in an RV on the street in San Francisco for about a year, splitting it with a friend for a total of $500 a month. They rent from the owner of a stretch of vehicles on the same block, calling it \"safe and comfortable,\" adding that $1,000 to rent a room in an apartment was too expensive.But lawmakers see the arrangements as exploitative.\"These are folks who are using our public streets for revenue, to make money without any kind of permitting or process to make sure that they're following any rules about what conditions the RVs have to be in, or what rights the person has who rents has,\" said David Cohen, a city councilmember in San Jose, who sponsored legislation to ban the practice. \"We're trying to protect our community as well as protect the people who are unhoused.\"But cracking down on vanlords has been difficult, and the underground market persists.Meanwhile, cities across the Bay Area have ramped up parking enforcement, issuing citations and towing vehicles as RV encampments have become more visible.Yet neither approach — banning vanlords nor cracking down on parking — has reversed the growth of vehicle homelessness.That's left officials searching for alternatives.A different approachIn an industrial corner of San Jose, just off the freeway and nestled between a recycling plant and a concrete distributor, the city of San Jose has converted an empty parking lot into what it calls a \"safe parking site.\"Operated by a local nonprofit and funded by a grant from the city, the Berryessa Safe Parking Site has space for 86 RVs, making it one of the largest sites of its kind in California, according to WeHope, the homelessness organization that operates it. The park opened in 2025, and organizers say it consistently has a full waiting list. Alvarez, a full-time in-home care worker, is one of its residents.In the center of the 6-acre lot sits a bank of showers, laundry machines and an office, where case workers meet with residents to help them find housing. Engaging with the system – working to move out of RVs and into traditional housing – is a requirement to live at the park. The city expects the site will cost $24 million over a five-year period, including the cost of the services it provides.The site's manager, Victoria Garibaldi, said she and her team have placed upward of 40 people in housing since the site opened. Victoria Garibaldi, a program manager with WeHOPE, oversees the city’s safe-parking site. She says the program has helped more than 40 residents secure permanent housing.CNBC\"We want them to have their own places. This isn't a permanent solution to the housing problem,\" she said. The park is San Jose's second safe parking site. Despite its success, the need far outweighs the supply. San Jose has 128 spots like these across two safe parking sites, but estimates that nearly 1,000 people live in vehicles within its city limits.Other cities in the Bay Area have tried similar ideas, but experienced more friction. San Francisco established a safe parking site in 2022, originally designed to accommodate up to 150 vehicles. But the program never reached that scale.At its peak, the site housed roughly 35 vehicles, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Infrastructure challenges — including a lack of on-site electricity — forced the city to rely on diesel generators, drawing complaints from neighbors and sparking a lawsuit. The city ultimately shut the site down, citing cost and operational challenges.Today, what may be the only designated RV parking site in San Francisco is privately operated. Once a low-cost option for tourists, Candlestick RV Park, in the city's industrial southeast corner, has increasingly become home to long-term residents, many of whom work but lack the savings or credit to secure a more traditional lease.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic,\" said Tsin Fung, the park's manager, who has worked there since 1993.The price for a spot — which includes water, electricity, sewage hookups and bathrooms — is $2,500 per month. The park recently raised the rate for new tenants from $2,000 per month. \"They're hard-working people, and they're sort of middle-, lower-middle class, working class,\" Fung said. \"They work hard, they pay their bills.\" He also noted that he's become aware of some tenants renting their RVs from individuals outside the park, in so-called vanlording situations.\"We've transitioned from basically a tourist park to a long-term park, mainly due to the effects of the pandemic.\" Tsin FungRV park manager in San FranciscoRethinking RV parksBut housing construction alone may not close the gap quickly enough, said Covert of the Bay Area Council.\"We're coming off of 30- or 40-year trends of hostility from local governments across the state — really, across the country — toward mobile home parks and RV parks,\" Covert said. \"They've been seen as a blight. But what we're seeing now is that doesn't just make low-income people go away.\"Instead, he contends, well-managed RV parks should be reconsidered as part of the region's housing strategy.\"We aren't likely, in the near term, to have enough transitional or interim housing to move everybody indoors,\" he said.San Jose has set aside 128 RV spaces across two lots, offering residents a rent-free place to stay while they work with case managers to secure permanent housing.CNBCUntil more permanent housing comes online, Covert said, cities may have little choice but to treat RVs not as an anomaly, but as part of the housing landscape.For Alvarez, the safe parking site provides stability while she continues searching for an apartment she and her boyfriend can afford — a place she's willing to move into if they can find one.\"I'm hoping I can,\" she said.",

The \"Section 122\" tariffs will take effect \"almost immediately,\" Trump said. At a White House press briefing Friday afternoon, Trump railed against the \"deeply disappointing\" 6-3 ruling.Trump's tariff regime impacted a swathe of countries from the U.K. to India and the European Union. Some governments, like Vietnam and Brazil are still in negotiations.Taiwan, home to the the world's leading contract chipmaker and producer of the most advanced semiconductors, said the 10% flat tariff rate would, according to an initial assessment, have a \"limited impact\" on its economy.The island will continue to \"closely monitor\" developments and maintain close communication with the U.S. to understand the specific measures and respond in a timely manner, the Taiwanese cabinet said in a statement on Saturday.French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly said the Supreme Court's ruling proved the benefit of having an effective counterweight to power.\"It is not bad to have a Supreme Court and, therefore, the rule of law,\" Reuters quoted him as saying at an event in Paris on Saturday.A U.K. government spokesperson said the country would continue to work with the White House administration to understand how the ruling will affect tariffs for the U.K. and the rest of the world\"This is a matter for the U.S. to determine but we will continue to support U.K. businesses as further details are announced,\" the spokesperson said.\"The U.K. enjoys the lowest reciprocal tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect our privileged trading position with the U.S. to continue.\" The U.K. agreed a wide-ranging trade deal with the U.S. in May last year, which imposed a broad 10% levy on many goods, but also included certain carve-outs on steel, aluminum, cars and pharmaceuticals.The Supreme Court case focused mainly on reciprocal tariffs, and the ruling leaves much of the U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. — including preferential sectoral tariffs on steel, pharmaceuticals and autos — unaffected.However, the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) trade body said the U.S. Supreme Court decision adds to the ongoing uncertainty around levies.watch nowWilliam Bain, head of trade policy at the BCC, said the move \"does little to clear the murky waters\" for British businesses, warning that the President still has \"other options at his disposal\" to retain his current regime on steel and aluminum tariffs.  \"The court's decision also raises questions on how U.S. importers can reclaim levies already paid and whether U.K. exporters can also receive a share of any rebate depending on commercial trading terms,\" Bain said in a statement. \"For the U.K., the priority remains bringing tariffs down wherever possible.\"Olof Gill, European Commission spokesperson for trade and economic security, said businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on \"stability and predictability.\" \"We remain in close contact with the U.S. Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling,\" Gill said. \"We therefore continue to advocate for low tariffs and to work towards reducing them.\"Meanwhile, Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for U.S.-Canadian trade relations, said the decision \"reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.\"No trade 'win' yetElsewhere, Swissmem, Switzerland's technology industry association, welcomed the ruling — but warned that the Trump administration could invoke other laws to \"legitimize tariffs,\" and called on Swiss policymakers to strengthen the competitiveness of the country with new free trade agreements.\"From the perspective of the Swiss export industry, this is a good decision. The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry. However, today's ruling doesn't win anything yet,\" Swissmem said.\"The high tariffs have severely damaged the tech industry,\" Swissmem wrote on X. \"The crucial thing now is to quickly secure relations with the U.S. through a binding trade agreement.\"The International Chamber of Commerce noted that many businesses will welcome the ruling given the \"significant strain\" that has been placed on balance sheets in recent months.\"But companies should not expect a simple process: the structure of U.S. import procedures means claims are likely to be administratively complex. Today's ruling is worrying silent on this issue and clear guidance from the Court of International Trade and the relevant U.S. authorities will be essential to minimise avoidable costs and prevent litigation risks,\" the ICC said.— CNBC's Jackson Peck and Greg Kennedy helped contribute to this story.",

    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Stephanie Kramer was just a few years into her career when she landed at one of her dream companies: In 2007, she joined L'Oreal to manage global marketing efforts for Ralph Lauren's fragrances division.In the nearly 20 years since, Kramer, 43, has worked with iconic fragrance and skincare brands at L'Oreal, then Chanel, and now back at L'Oreal with a recent career change to become the chief HR officer for the company's North America operations.She says some of the best career advice she's gotten came from ex-boss Maureen Chiquet, the former Chanel CEO, who gave her a three-question framework to figure out if she was ready for a new job or career change.\"I often ask people three questions when you're making a career decision,\" Kramer tells CNBC Make It:What do you want to learn or what do you want to teach? Where do you get your energy?What do you need for your life right now?Kramer was working as a global marketing director at L'Oreal in 2011, fresh off earning a master's degree from the Fashion Institute of Technology and curious about taking her career in a new direction, when the opportunity to work for Chanel came up. Kramer says she was drawn to how it represented something different — a private company, a luxury brand and a company with categories beyond beauty.\"It was something new to learn,\" Kramer says. Meanwhile, having worked on the Ralph Lauren fragrance business, she felt she could bring that knowledge to working on Chanel's fragrances including Chanel No. 5 and Coco Mademoiselle. This gave her something she could teach while in a new role, she says.As far as what energized her, Kramer says she was eager to try something she hadn't done before, with new colleagues, and in a different environment.Finally, Kramer says she had to take stock of her personal life. At the time, she had just graduated with her master's, she was getting married, \"and I think that sometimes in those mega-life moments, you also think about how you want to stretch professionally,\" she says.Kramer recommends using this framework when looking for a new job and narrowing what opportunities you want to pursue. She also says it can be used to evaluate the job you're already in when paired with a \"traffic light\" method.\"When you're feeling stuck, or at a 'red light,' ask these questions to help you get unstuck with a clearer head and better sense of what you want\" in your current role or with your employer, she says.When a career change means boomeranging back to an old companyKramer spent nearly five years at Chanel, first as a director of fragrance marketing and later as an executive director of skin-care marketing.In 2016, she says she had yet another moment of wanting something different and revisited her three-question approach.A role opened up back at L'Oreal and offered Kramer the chance to return to working on a global scale for a business — something she missed when she left to work for Chanel.It was an opportunity to work with new markets leading global marketing for Kiehl's. \"I was able to work a lot with our our teams that were in South Korea, that were in China, that were in travel retail in Asia,\" Kramer says. \"So there was this big acceleration at Kiehl's I got to be part of, and it expanded me and got me closer to the consumer in a different way, and I loved it.\"And on a personal level, Kramer says it was a good time to return to a former employer she loved: She had just given birth to her first son and was ready for something different professionally but with a company where she felt supported.\"Now at L'Oreal I've gotten to take it in a totally another direction,\" Kramer says of her transition into HR, \"which has also been cool and actually happened after I had my second son.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "Haivivi Bubblepal, an AI toy.Courtesy: HaiviviIt seems everyone is talking about artificial intelligence these days — even Ultraman. When asked if investors should be worried about an AI bubble, the new second-generation CocoMate AI-powered plush toy by Chinese company Haivivi warned about the dangers of speculation in AI stocks.\"The AI market has been on a wild ride lately,\" the toy based on the Ultraman character cautioned. \"If investors pour too much money into unproven ideas without solid fundamentals, it could lead to a bubble burst!\"China has long been a dominant manufacturer in the global toy industry. So pushing into AI playthings is a natural step, analysts say. The Xi Jinping administration, on a campaign to turn China into an AI powerhouse, has been directing companies and consumers to integrate AI into their businesses and lives. Haivivi is one of 1,500 companies in China's $4 billion dollar AI toy industry. Another is Chengdu-based startup Chongker, which invented an AI cat as a comfort animal. The artificial feline uses voice recognition and banked memories in the cloud to adjust its behavior to its owner's needs.\"Some people like the cat to be more, maybe noisy or naughty, right? And some people just need the quiet one. So it will learn what kind of thing you like,\" Sean Xu, director of AI products with Chongker, told CNBC. Xu said the company added a special feature it believes will help the pet build a strong bond with its owner— a simulated heartbeat.The electronic pulse is triggered after holding the AI pet tightly for 10 seconds. Xu says the feeling makes one \"calm down.\"If a potential shopper prefers a high-energy toy, Loona the AI puppy by Keyi Tech uses cameras and lasers to zip around its new home.The AI helps Loona figure out the layout of its owner's pad. The robot pet can also recognize up to five family members and respond to each one individually.Despite the fascination with the intelligent toys, the gadgets come with risks, especially when it comes to impressionable young minds. The AI pet robot plush toy Ropet showcased at the Global AI Player Carnival & West Bund International Tech Consumer Carnival in Shanghai, Oct. 27, 2025.CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesNew research by U.S. consumer safety-focused non-profit Public Interest Research Group suggests the effects of AI toys on young children are still far from understood. PIRG's studies found some toys shared inappropriate and dangerous information with users, and the group raised concerns about privacy. \"A lot of these toys are using large language models,\" Beijing-based tech consultant Tom van Dillen said. \"Sometimes the models can hallucinate. Now toy manufacturers are doing a lot to create guardrails.\"For Haivivi's CocoMate plush toys, including Ultraman, parents can access a transcript of their children's conversations with the AI toy on their phone. When asked by CNBC if succumbing to pressure by other students at school to do drugs is a good idea, Ultraman played parent.\"Oh no … it's a TERRIBLE idea!\" the toy responded. \"If they keep bothering you, tell your teachers or parents.\"",

    "body": "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president, arrives for a hearing at the Constitutional Court of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTo justify a case for martial law, former President Yoon Suk Yeol tried to provoke neighboring North Korea into taking military action, South Korean prosecutors alleged Monday, according to domestic media. Speaking to reporters, special counsel Cho Eun-suk said that Yoon and his military commanders tried to lure North Korea into mounting an armed aggression against the South, but this failed as Pyongyang did not resort to military force. Cho and his team have indicted 24 people, including Yoon and five cabinet members, on insurrection charges following a six-month investigation.Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung had said on the 1-year anniversary of Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration that North Korea sending of trash balloons over to South Korea might have been provoked by Seoul's actions, although he did not elaborate at that time.Lee had also vowed \"strict accountability\" for the perpetrators behind the failed martial law attempt, with investigations and trials still underway.In July, Reuters reported that the special counsel had sought to detain the head of a military drone unit, over accusations that Yoon had ordered a covert drone operation into North Korea to raise tensions between the two countries.Cho also said that Yoon had masterminded a plan in October 2023 to suspend the powers of South Korea's parliament and replace it with an emergency legislative body. South Korean media outlet Yonhap also reported that Yoon also sought to portray the April 2024 general election results, lost by his ruling party, as electoral fraud led by anti-state forces.The 2024 election saw the then-opposition Democratic Party, led by Lee, hold on to its majority in the National Assembly. After being removed from office in April, Yoon has been charged with insurrection, which carries the maximum penalty of death.South Korean prosecutors have also reportedly sought a 15-year prison term for former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Other senior officials, including Yoon's defense minister and the former head of the National Intelligence Service, have also been arrested in connection with the attempt to impose military rule.On Dec. 3 last year, Yoon had abruptly declared martial law in a late night address, before lawmakers — including members of Yoon's own party — rushed to overturn his order. Yoon withdrew his decree six hours after his announcement. Imposing martial law led to impeachment motions against Yoon, which resulted in him being impeached on Dec. 14 last year and removal from office on April 4. ",

The IPO markets remain choppy and many startups are choosing to remain private for longer instead of risking a muted debut on the public markets. Founded in 2016, Armis said in August it had surpassed $300 million in annual recurring revenues, a milestone it achieved less than a year after reaching $200 million in ARR.Its latest funding round was led by Goldman Sachs Alternatives' growth equity fund, with participation from CapitalG, a venture arm of Alphabet.

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meets with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz at 10 Downing Street, in London, Britain, December 8, 2025. Toby Melville | ReutersUkraine has said it's willing to give up its aspirations to join NATO in return for security guarantees, as part of a peace deal to end the almost four-year war with Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered to drop Kyiv's NATO dreams during five hours of talks with U.S. officials Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin over the weekend. Witkoff said \"a lot of progress was made\" during the talks, which are set to continue on Monday.Ukraine's offer marks a major policy shift. It has long coveted membership of the Western military alliance, whose members are obliged to consider an attack on one as an attack on all under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the offer to drop NATO membership in return for security guarantees was a compromise, amid resistance among some of its Western allies to its NATO bid.\"From the very beginning, Ukraine's conditions – or perhaps more accurately, our ambition – was NATO membership. And that would have provided real security guarantees. Some partners from the United States and Europe did not support this direction,\" he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat on Sunday.\"That is why today the bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the United States, specifically Article 5–like guarantees from the United States for us, and the security guarantees from our European colleagues for us, as well as from other countries such as Canada and Japan – these security guarantees for us provide an opportunity to prevent another outbreak of Russian aggression,\" Zelenskyy commented.\"And this already is a compromise on our part,\" he said.Despite Ukraine publicly abandoning its NATO bid, the chances of it joining the alliance were vanishingly thin. Several members were resistant to the idea, including Moscow-friendly Slovakia and Hungary. Even Ukraine's allies within NATO worried about poking the Russian bear beyond Ukraine's borders.Moscow vehemently opposes Ukraine joining NATO, and Russia has claimed the alliance's expansion in Eastern Europe was one of the reasons it launched its so-called \"special military operation\" against Ukraine in 2022.Kyiv insists that security guarantees must be a part of a peace deal instead of NATO membership, and this remains a sticking point in negotiations with Moscow, which is refusing to allow Ukraine's allies to be part of any peacekeeping force in the country.Talks about a draft peace agreement are continuing on Monday. Zelenskyy aide Dmytro Lytvyn said that the president would comment on the talks once they were completed, Reuters reported.The Kremlin said Monday that it expected to be briefed later on the outcome of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. on Monday.When asked to comment on Kyiv relinquishing its NATO ambitions, and what security guarantees Russia could accept in a potential peace deal, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said:\"This issue is one of the cornerstones. And, of course, it requires special discussion against the background of all the others. But that is precisely what the negotiation process consists of, which I would like to emphasize once again - we do not want to engage in megaphone diplomacy.\"",

    "body": "Hoda Kotb knows what it's like to completely overhaul a career and start fresh in a brand-new industry.The longtime journalist left NBC's \"TODAY\" in January after 26 years with the organization, and launched her own company — a wellness brand called Joy 101 — in May. Becoming a first-time CEO at age 60 felt somewhat impossible to her, which is exactly why she decided to do it, she said on a Dec. 8 episode of \"The Mel Robbins Podcast.\"Whether you're \"20 or 40 or 60 or 80,\" you can determine whether such a drastic career change is right for you by asking yourself one important question, said Kotb, now 61: Is this job giving me what I deserve?In Kotb's case, she was ready for a new challenge, and realized during an on-air 60th birthday celebration that continuing her journalism career probably wouldn't fulfill that need, she said. \"I was almost having an out of body [experience],\" she said. \"I kept thinking ... This is the top of the wave. I could feel it ... This is the best it's ever going to be.\"Other people may come to a similar conclusion through more a frustrating process: Maybe you've worked a job where you didn't receive enough positive feedback, or the company lacked opportunities for you to learn and grow.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyIf you feel like you're hitting a professional roadblock, you should sit down and figure out what it is that you feel like you deserve, said Kotb. That self-audit shouldn't come from a place of envy or \"FOMO\" around what someone else has, she noted. And it won't always prompt a total career reset — maybe you'll seek a raise or promotion at work instead, for example.\"Look at your life, just look at it from 35,000 feet and then decide, do I want to change it?\" she said. \"And I'm here to tell you, I feel like I'm living, breathing proof that you can change it at any time. Things you thought were impossible are not impossible.\"Kotb has previously said that her decision to leave \"TODAY\" was also influenced by a desire to spend more time with her family. This was made difficult by her daily 3:15 a.m. wakeup to get to work on time, she told People in May.Entrepreneurship now presents Kotb with a different kind of challenge, she's said. \"Being an entrepreneur is hard,\" Kotb told Variety in May. \"I didn't realize how many hats you wear as an entrepreneur ... I'm learning how to be a boss.\"To make building a new career from scratch feel less intimidating, you can start small, Kotb recommended: Spend 30 minutes per day doing something that'll help you make progress, from working on your resume to creating a business plan or learning a new skill. After a month, for example, you'll have 900 minutes of groundwork, rather than making a spur-of-the-moment decision to quit your job without a plan.\"Baby steps toward the jump,\" said Kotb. \"Sometimes we think we want it and you're like, 'I'm going to run and jump off the cliff' ... Don't do that. We're not idiots. We need our paychecks. We need our insurance. We need these things, but we can explore possibilities at the same time.\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Digital Ltd., exits a Correctional Services Department vehicle as he arrives at the Court of Final Appeal for the verdict of his bail hearing in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. Prosecutors in Hong Kong charged Lai, a prominent critic of Beijing and local authorities, last year under the national security law imposed by Beijing, saying he had colluded with foreigners by calling for sanctions against China. Photographer: Chan Long Hei/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHong Kong pro-democracy activist and media baron Jimmy Lai on Monday was found guilty of sedition and collusion with foreign countries by a Hong Kong court.The 78-year-old was charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law, enacted by Beijing in 2020 after pro-democracy protests swept the region in 2019. The court said Lai was guilty of a \"conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.\" It also said that Lai and his tabloid Apple Daily, requested a foreign country or entity outside of China \"to impose sanctions or blockade, or engage in other hostile activities\" against Hong Kong or China. The court, in its 850-page judgement, said that the businessman \"harbored his resentment and hatred of the PRC [People's Republic of China] for many of his adult years.\"  Lai, one of the CCP's most vocal critics, had pleaded not guilty to two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials. He has been under arrest since 2020, with his trial starting in December 2023. Lai's sentencing is expected to be on Jan. 12.Speaking just after the judgment, Andrew Collier, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the verdict was \"not very good\" from a foreign investor perspective, adding \"people want an independent court system that's going to protect the rights of citizens and the financial community.\"He said the verdict on Lai was expected, but the question for Hong Kong is around investor confidence. While the city has seen a growing number of IPOs in 2025, \"if investors are not comfortable with the court system, with cases like Jimmy Lai's, that's not good for the future of Hong Kong,\" Collier said. Lai, who founded Asian clothing brand Giordano, newspaper Apple Daily and digital media company Next Digital, was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea back in October. Trump pressed Xi to release Lai during the meeting, according to Reuters. The court said that Lai's \"only intent\" was to seek the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party, adding \"even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the PRC and the HKSAR [Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China]. This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications.\" Speaking to CNBC before the verdict, veteran investor David Roche suggested that a lenient approach could be good for Hong Kong's business climate. \"That, I think, would help to give the overriding impression and therefore conviction to people in the money business that Hong Kong had returned to its normal, business driven, dynamic self.\" Lai acquired British citizenship before Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. The trial verdict is the latest development in Hong Kong's political scene, which has seen the erosion of democratic opposition in one of Asia's financial hubs since the enactment of the national security law. Under changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in 2021, the number of directly elected members in the city's legislature was drastically slashed, with only \"patriots\" reviewed by an election committee allowed to stand for elections.  Monday's verdict comes on the heels of the dissolution of Hong Kong's last pro-democracy party on Sunday after 31 years, as well as a \"patriots-only\" legislative election that saw the second lowest turnout in the region's history. In a response to CNBC, Kenneth Roth, visiting professor at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and a former director at Human Rights Watch, said that the decision \"underscores the utter demise of the political freedoms that had once made the city so great.\"",

    "body": "watch nowKevin Hassett's candidacy for the Federal Reserve chair, once seen by the market as almost a sure thing, has received some pushback by high-level people who have the ear of President Donald Trump, according to sources familiar with the matter.There's concern that the National Economic Council director is too close to the president, the sources said, something that ironically made him the frontrunner to replace current chair Jerome Powell in the first place. The pushback could help explain why interviews with candidates were cancelled in early December and then, at least for Warsh, rescheduled for last week.After telling reporters that he knew who he was going to pick for Fed chair, Trump surprised investors Friday when he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh had moved to the top of the Fed candidates list alongside Hassett. The comments sent Hassett's odds diving on the Kalshi prediction markets.\"I think the two Kevins are great,\" said Trump.Hassett remains the favorite on Kalshi Monday with a 51% chance, although that's down from a high above 80% earlier this month. Warsh's odds are currently 44%, up from around 11% to start December.The pushback has taken more of the form of promoting Warsh, rather than criticizing Hassett. On Thursday at a JPMorgan event, CEO Jamie Dimon spoke favorably of both Hassett and Warsh, but made some comments that made those in the audience believe that Dimon favored the former Fed governor.Bloomberg News reported at the end of November that Hassett had emerged as the frontrunner to replace Powell, whose term ends in May. But as December wore on, according to several sources, Hassett's candidacy received some resistance, with worries growing that the bond market could revolt over time if it sees him as too much in the pocket of Trump. That view could end up having the opposite effect Trump wants, with long-term yields eventually rising on concern Hassett wouldn't do enough to contain inflation should it ever rebound down the road. Perhaps in response to some of this criticism, Hassett was more firm on the question of Fed independence in an interview with CBS News this past weekend. Trump \"has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be,\" said Hassett on \"Face the Nation,\" according to a transcript.When asked if the president's view would carry the same weight as a voting central bank member, Hassett said: \"No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data.\"",

John Lamparski | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump slammed Rob Reiner on Monday morning, a day after the famed Hollywood director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found brutally slain in their Los Angeles home.Trump's social-media screed against Reiner, who was a staunch critic of the president, came as the Reiners' 32-year-old son, Nick, was arrested and held on $4 million bond, according to LA County Sheriff's Department jail records. That online record for Nick Reiner did not show any charges.Trump suggested that the couple was killed because of \"the anger\" Rob Reiner caused in other people due to his opposition to the president.

    "body": "Garry Ridge had already been a CEO for two years when he enrolled at the University of San Diego in 1999 for a master's degree in executive leadership.Ridge, who helmed the multi-use product company WD-40 from 1997 until he retired in 2022, thought at the time that he needed to change himself to make the company and its workforce more successful, he told Simon Sinek's \"A Bit Of Optimism\" podcast in a Nov. 25 episode.Ridge had recently moved from Australia and wanted to expand WD-40 around the world, he said. Prior to going back to school, he was a \"be brief, be bright, be gone\" type of leader, he added: \"I really thought that I had to be command and control. And I pretty soon learned [in school] that my job was not to command and control.\"Instead of running his company with an iron fist, Ridge took a more personable approach to leadership — which he credited to guidance from a professor at the time, Ken Blanchard — aiming to help employees feel more belonging and empowerment, he said.\"Our purpose was to create positive lasting memories ...  So what changed in my mind was I couldn't do this alone,\" said Ridge, now a Poway, California-based leadership coach for other CEOs. \"If we were going to expand to 176 countries around the world, which we did, and if the sun was never going to set on the people in the organization, I had to make sure that in an environment where they felt safe enough to make decisions and be brave.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyAs a coach, he's seen other CEOs struggle with the same control-forward leadership style he once had, he said. \"They're looking at successful people who have huge egos, little empathy, want to micromanage, think they have all the answers, don't really value learning. And they think that's the way to go,\" said Ridge.To build his capacity for so-called \"servant leadership,\" Ridge tried to constantly remind himself to challenge his own thinking and put other people first, he said. He walked around with \"praise somebody\" written on his hand for \"months\" as a reminder that his job wasn't about him, and opted against a private parking space and an office \"four times bigger\" than his employees' workspaces, he said.\"The will of the people times the strategy equals the outcome,\" said Ridge. \"If you spend a good time on people, purpose, values and learning ... you have more people enthusiastically, passionately, getting up every day, executing your strategic plan ... It's that freaking simple.\"For workers, a boss who supports their employees and leads with empathy, flexibility, transparency and accountability is a green flag, Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry, told CNBC Make It in October 2024.To determine during a job interview if your prospective boss has these traits, Vyas said, you can ask them: \"How would your current team describe you and your leadership style?\" A response like, \"I give them enough leash to let them run with an idea, and I help them when they are actually in need,\" instead of something like, \"People do what I say,\" can show that they're flexible and trusting, she said.\"Managers that master the balance of emotional intelligence and not being so rigid — that's a good boss,\" said Vyas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

But our real moment was when we put on 'Stranger Things,'\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles last month.\"'House of Cards' was great. It kind of told the world that we're going to make some really good TV shows,\" he continued. \"But with 'Stranger Things,' this was a lot closer to a 'Star Wars' moment. This is a show, characters that move the culture, that spawned live events and consumer products and spinoffs and sequels.\"The final bowReleased in 2016, \"Stranger Things\" is set in the '80s and centers on a group of middle schoolers in a fictional rural town in Indiana who must navigate paranormal and supernatural occurrences following the disappearance of their friend. In the mix is a young girl with psychokinetic powers who has escaped from a secret research lab, an alcoholic police chief who is trying to find the missing boy and a frantic mother.Now, almost a decade later, the fifth and final season is making its staggered debut on Netflix.An advertisement for \"Stranger Things\" on one of Netflix's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, Dec. 2, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersVolume 1, which consists of the first four episodes, debuted over the Thanksgiving holiday and amassed 59.6 million views in the first five days, the biggest premiere week for an English-language series on Netflix. It ranks third overall behind Season 2 and Season 3 of the Korean series \"Squid Game.\"In its second week on the platform, Volume 1 generated another 23.6 million views, topping the streamer's weekly charts, and each of the previous four seasons saw week-over-week viewership bumps, as fans rewatched prior episodes, Netflix reported.Volume 2 of \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which contains three episodes, arrives on Christmas, and the finale episode, which has a run time of a little over two hours, is set for New Year's Eve. The finale will be available for viewing in select theaters New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In a break with tradition, Netflix will not be selling tickets for these screenings. Instead, more than 500 domestic cinemas will sell concession vouchers that will guarantee seating for the showings. These vouchers can be used toward purchases of food and beverages at the venues. Furthermore, theater owners will keep all revenue from these purchases.Netflix and exhibitors have tangled in the past over release terms, as the streamer does not commit to a prolonged run in theaters for movies that it wants to be eligible for awards contention. \"Nothing would make us happier than to play Netflix theatrical movies in our theaters,\" AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement earlier this month. \"We think that could be beneficial for all involved. But as we need to treat our existing studio partners fairly, there is much that still needs to be sorted out to that end. Even so, there is progress.\"Turning culture upside down\"Stranger Things\" has brought about a renaissance of the 1980s, reviving fashion trends, music and even discontinued food brands for a new generation.When the series debuted, Netflix partnered with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like, but it was predominantly working with licensees. This means it was collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.In 2019, the company launched its own consumer products division and two years later its own officially licensed online shop.Coinciding with the launch of the final season of \"Stranger Things,\" Netflix announced dozens of partnerships and collaborations with brands across the merchandise, retail and restaurant spectrum. The streamer has tapped Lego, Funko, Squishmallows, Hasbro, Jazwares and Care Bears to bring \"Stranger Things\" toys and collectibles to fans of the series. It has apparel and lifestyle deals with Gap, Nike, Crocs, CoverGirl, Zara and Wrangler, among others, and food and beverage collaborations with the likes of Eggo, Doritos, Kellogg, Gatorade and Starbucks.Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the first season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: Netflix\"We are incredibly excited to partner with so many fantastic brands, offering fans — and fellow nerds — the largest collection of products and experiences in 'Stranger Things' history and one of our biggest campaigns yet as we celebrate the fifth and final season of this globally beloved series,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, in a statement earlier this month.Outside the retail space, Netflix has delved into the live event space, bringing \"Stranger Things\" to life through an immersive experience that enables fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will open in Mexico City next month. There is also a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which has been running in the West End in London since 2023 and in New York since this spring.In addition, Netflix has a deal with Epic Games that has brought \"Stranger Things\" items to the popular online video game Fortnite. Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is more than a way for the company to generate revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels, industry experts said.The cast of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" Season 5.Courtesy: NetflixThis playbook is not unique to Netflix, but it showcases the maturation of the streaming service. \"Strangers Things\" is less of a blueprint that can be adopted by every Netflix show or film, but rather a gold standard for what is possible.\"[Netflix] had a few good shows early on ('Orange is the New Black' and 'House of Cards'), but it took a couple of years of whiffs before they came up with 'Stranger Things,'\" Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush, told CNBC via email. \"They have had a ton of success since, with shows like 'Squid Game' and 'Bridgerton,' but it was questionable if they could settle on a formula for coming up with original IP.\"'Stranger Things' has remained a solid IP throughout, and has driven a lot of recognition,\" he added.",

    "body": "Jim Siders speaks at an eventCourtesy: Jim SidersThrive Capital, the tech investment firm known for taking big stakes in companies including OpenAI, Stripe and Databricks, announced on Monday that it's tapped Palantir veteran Jim Siders to serve as CEO of Shield Technology Partners, a newly created business focused on IT services. Siders spent more than 12 years at Palantir, where he most recently served as chief information officer, overseeing global IT operations, business applications and infrastructure. He began his career at the company as an IT helpdesk engineer. Palantir has been one of the best performers on the stock market during the artificial intelligence boom, jumping by almost thirtyfold since the end 2022.Thrive, founded by Josh Kushner, launched Thrive Holdings in April, creating a division to own and operate companies that it believes could benefit from technological transformations. Shield was launched in June by Thrive Holdings and investment firm ZBS Partners, with over $100 million in initial funding. Shield buys ownership stakes in IT services companies and tries to help them grow by giving them access to cutting-edge AI technology and engineering capabilities. \"If we're doing this right, we're going to see a lot of value created all the way up the chain, from end customer all the way through to us here at Shield,\" Siders told CNBC in an interview. \"These are great businesses, and they're going to be rising up even more.\"As of December, Shield works with seven companies and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue this year, Thrive said. Shield primarily works with small and mid-sized businesses, and has ambitions to expand its portfolio going forward.Read more CNBC tech newsOracle shares plummet, dragging down AI stocksOver $50 billion in under 24 hours: Why Big Tech is doubling down on investing in IndiaCisco's stock closes at record for first time since dot-com peak in 2000Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats upIn addition to its work with Shield in IT services, Thrive Holdings also operates in the accounting sector. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it took an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings and will embed engineering, research and product teams within its companies.\"We said, 'The way in which we're going to achieve the best results for our customers is if OpenAI is an owner in Thrive Holdings alongside us,'\" Anuj Mehndiratta, a member of Thrive Holdings' founding team, said in an interview. \"By being an owner, they will be enabled to actually focus on end outcomes in the same way that we are.\"Shield's ownership structure is based on a similar line of thinking. To help align incentives and encourage companies to participate, the IT services organizations that Shield backs also get equity in Shield.Siders kicks off his tenure as Shield CEO on Monday, and he said his initial focus will be on understanding its existing partners and searching for potential targets. He said Shield will be ambitious in the next few quarters.   \"There's a whole industry out there, people who've spent their careers trying to deliver this value for everybody's benefit,\" Siders said. \"This is a unique and special thing to attack that.\"WATCH: Joe Lonsdale on AI regulation: Don’t want the populists to break the whole AI wavewatch now",

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

    "body": "watch nowStock Chart IconStock chart iconTilray Brands, 1-dayPresident Donald Trump is expected to issue an executive order as soon as Monday that would allow for reclassification of marijuana, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The person asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak about the White House's plans.Such a move would allow cannabis companies to fall under different tax regulations and encourage investment.Cannabis stocks took a leg up in Friday's midday trading following CNBC's report.The Washington Post first reported Thursday that Trump was expected to use an executive order to instruct federal agencies to reclassify marijuana as a less-regulated Schedule III drug from a Schedule I. Axios reported that the potential reclassification of marijuana — out of a group that includes heroin and into a lower tier of less dangerous drugs, such as steroids and Tylenol with codeine — would take place early next year.Trump floated a change in marijuana's classification in August.\"Trump rescheduling marijuana was not an if, in our assessment, but a when,\" Ed Groshans of Compass Point, a middle-market investment bank, wrote to clients in a Friday note.More optimismGroshans said the reported change would be \"positive\" for the cannabis industry, allowing banks to serve the sector.He said he expects that if Trump orders cannabis to be rescheduled, the Drug Enforcement Administration would finalize a proposed rule for the reclassification by the summer.Bill Kirk, senior research analyst at Roth, said he's also monitoring whether the Supreme Court decides next week to hear a case on state regulations and federal prohibition of cannabis. A positive ruling for the industry in that case could speed up regulatory timelines.The industry sees the latest moves as a sign of progress to normalize pot under national law.\"I'm a lot more optimistic than I ever have been,\" Tilray CEO Irwin Simon told CNBC. Shawn Hauser, partner at cannabis-focused law firm Vicente LLP, said a reclassification would mark only a \"partial victory,\" as the sector will need to continue fighting for legalization. However, she said the momentum can press Congress to create a regulatory framework that offers broader changes around safety, access and criminal justice reform than what a rescheduling provides.\"This [is] the beginning of a new era of public health policy,\" Hauser said. \"If implemented, it dismantles nearly a century of outdated drug policies that fly in the face of science and medicine.\"Pot stocks have struggled since a brief mania around public growers and dispensaries in the years before Covid, even as cannabis has received broader acceptance and some states have eased their classifications.Tilray shares were recently trading at a little more than $10 after peaking at more than $2,140, adjusted for splits, in September 2018.

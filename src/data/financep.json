    "body": "Former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris attends the 56th NAACP Image Awards at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Pasadena, California, U.S. February 22, 2025.Etienne Laurent | ReutersFormer Vice President Kamala Harris said that during her career, she never took \"no\" for an answer — and attributed much of her success to this attitude.Harris, who served as vice president of the United States under President Joe Biden from 2021 to 2025, shared some candid insights about her early career on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast.When asked what she was like as a 25-year-old prosecutor, Harris responded: \"She was fearless. She didn't hear 'no it can't be done.'\"Harris recalled the first case she had as a young prosecutor: it was a Friday evening, and the person who had been arrested was a young woman with children at home.\"All the courts were shutting down and I went to the courtroom, and I asked the judge: 'Please take the bench again. She has young children. She can't stay in over the weekend,'\" Harris said.\"And the clerk was like: 'no, he's gone for the day. He's leaving for the day.' And I would not leave, and they called the case.\"This persistence has served Harris well throughout her career. She became the first Black, South Asian American, and female vice president after serving as a U.S. senator and attorney general in California.\"Not hearing no, that has probably been a throughline of my life. I don't rest easy with the idea that something is not possible, at least I don't rest easy with the idea without trying to show that it is possible and that's probably not changed,\" she added.In 2024, Harris replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee after he dropped out of the race, but lost to President Donald Trump.Overcoming imposter syndromeHarris admitted that she experienced imposter syndrome in her career, especially when she was first elected district attorney in 2004.\"And there I was, sitting in the office, and I thought: 'Oh my god, I'm now the elected DA of a major city in the United States,'\" the former vice president said on the podcast, adding that she felt a great responsibility in her role.However, she put a positive spin on imposter syndrome, saying there's nothing wrong with having a little humility.\"I think there is a lot that is good with having a certain level of humility, and in particular when the people have vested you with great power, to understand that it's not about you. I think that is part and parcel of what we call imposter syndrome ... I think often it is because they understand how serious the job is on behalf of others, and I applaud a bit of honest humility, not feigned humility, \" she said.At other points in the podcast, Harris recalled walking into meetings and people wondering where her boss was. She said that deprioritizing other people's opinions greatly benefited her.\"When I'm mentoring people, I will often say to them: 'Don't ever limit yourself based on other people's limited ability to see who you are,\" she added.  \"That's their limitation… don't impose those limitations on yourself.\"",

    "body": "With politics among the biggest stressors for Americans, and the political gender gap growing among young people, it can be hard to stay motivated when divisions feel more contentious than ever.Few people understand that like Ella Emhoff, the daughter of former U.S. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and stepdaughter of former Vice President Kamala Harris.Getting offline is a good first step.\"I think what has kept me the most invigorated around politics and just social change is seeing everyone else empowered by it, coming to things like ZCON and being able to talk about it,\" Emhoff recently told CNBC Make It at the Gen Z-focused conference put on by United Talent Agency. \"When we're online, it can feel so insular and feel like everything's happening to us, whether it be with immigration, with wars, with genocide, with the climate.\"With so much happening, Emhoff says she finds power in focusing on small changes within her control, and actions she can take toward them.\"Small changes impact big change,\" she says. \"Even going and volunteering at a shelter or with dogs or feeding the homeless, anything like that is going to create positive impact. The more you engage with that in your day-to-day, bigger things will feel more achievable.\"These small and ongoing projects of purpose are more achievable and enjoyable no matter the result, versus large and intangible goals, Dr. Jordan Grumet, a hospice medical director and author writing about purpose, previously told Make It.On the other hand, scrolling and consuming every bad headline won't do much for your emotions or your feelings of being able to enact small changes. \"Get off your phone, engage in your community,\" Emhoff says. \"It's going to make you feel better. I promise.\"Dealing with setbacksThe 26-year-old says turning to offline creative pursuits, like her work as a textile artist and her recently relaunched Soft Hands Knit Club, helps too.Working in a creative field has its own challenges. But Emhoff says her mother, Kerstin, who works as a film producer and heads a creative entertainment studio, has always given her the best outlook on her career.\"One of the best things she's told me is just don't give up,\" she says. \"When you're in a non-traditional career path like I am, it's really easy to want to give up when the stream of income is lost, or you're feeling like your engagement is down and you want to just quit and get a normal job. I love to threaten her that I'm going to go and just get a corporate job, but she's always been a really big proponent of the message I have in mental health and crafting and community, and it's pushed me a lot farther than I ever thought.\"Emhoff says she's also gotten good advice from her stepmother Harris, especially about recovering from a setback after losing the 2024 presidential election.\"After she gave her concession speech, she sat down with us and said, 'This is not the end. This is just a bump in the road.' And I really do believe that,\" Emhoff says. \"There have been hard times before. We are in an especially hard time. But we have gotten out of hard times, and the only way to get through that is with believing and not letting up.\"\"I think we collectively need to get into that same headspace of just kicking butt,\" she adds.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "When your kid is in the middle of a tantrum, logic and lectures don't work.I've studied over 200 kids and worked with hundreds of families, and one thing is clear: Tantrums aren't about defiance. Research shows that during emotional overwhelm, a child's prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain responsible for reasoning and language) essentially goes offline. It's why \"use your words\" falls flat when they're screaming.What they need in that moment is connection. These seven magic phrases work with your child's nervous system by calming the storm, restoring safety, and teaching emotional regulation — the real skill behind resilience.1. Say nothingWhen your child is mid-meltdown, your instinct is to make it stop... fast. You want the screaming to end, the tears to dry, the chaos to pass. So you start talking: \"Calm down,\" \"Use your words,\" \"Tell me what's wrong.\"But often, the fastest way to end a tantrum is silence. When your child's body is in full distress, every word you add is like oxygen to a fire. Their \"thinking brain\" has shut down. Words simply can't land. But your nervous system can reach them instantly.Sit close. Stay relaxed. Saying nothing essentially communicates an important phrase: \"You're safe, and I can handle this.\" Once their breathing slows and the peak has passed, that's when your spoken words can start to land.2. 'I'm right here.'This short phrase is a lifeline. You're not walking away, threatening consequences, or trying to reason. You're anchoring them back into connection.A tantrum often triggers a primal fear: Am I still loved when I'm out of control? Your calm presence answers that question instantly. Connection regulates the stress response faster than correction ever can. Emotional safety quiets the body's alarm system.3. 'This feeling is really big, huh?'Instead of minimizing their emotions or rushing them through it, this phrase acknowledges the size of the feeling. It helps kids see what's happening inside rather than being consumed by it.Validation activates the brain's calming pathways. When children feel seen, their bodies release tension. And that's the first step toward emotional awareness.4. 'It's okay to feel angry. It's not okay to hit.'Parents often swing between being too permissive or too harsh. This phrase strikes the balance. You're separating the feeling from the behavior, and validating the emotion while holding the boundary.Consistent limits paired with emotional acceptance build impulse control — the foundation of self-discipline.5. 'Let's take a break together.'Sometimes, a \"time-in\" works better than a \"time-out.\" This phrase teaches your child to regulate with you. Invite them to sit, breathe, or just be still until the storm passes. Proximity restores safety faster than isolation ever could.When children are dysregulated, they need your nervous system to co-regulate theirs. Your calm is contagious.6. 'I can see how much you wanted that.'This phrase helps acknowledge the emotion underneath your child's behavior: disappointment, frustration, or longing. When kids feel seen, they don't need to keep screaming to prove their feelings are real.Validation lowers the brain's threat response. Once a child feels understood, their nervous system begins to settle — and the tantrum ends naturally, without punishment or bribes.7. 'You can be mad, and I'll still love you.'Unconditional safety is what every child needs most. Tantrums often test an unspoken question: \"Will you still love me when I'm not lovable?\"This phrase answers it clearly and teaches emotional security for life. It also rewires the shame response. Children learn that love isn't withdrawn for imperfection, and that's the beginning of self-worth.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of FOUNDATIONS, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island also directed that these be paid out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible.\" Boston Judge Indira Talwani gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.The administration was originally set to cut off the aid on Nov. 1.In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Bessent said that the administration would not appeal the court ruling, while adding that finding the funds to pay SNAP benefits by Wednesday \"could be\" done.\"There's a process that has to be followed. So, we've got to figure out what the process is,\" the Treasury secretary said.On Friday, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that the government was exploring its options to restart SNAP.\"I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,\" the president wrote. \"Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"",

    "body": "A person walks down a street with shopping bags in New York City on Nov. 29, 2024.David Dee Delgado | Getty ImagesAmerican consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree.Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad \"liberation day\" tariffs.Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season.The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion.That translates to around $132 per shopper.Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.\"For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst.\"While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,\" Schulz said.\"That's a choice no one wants to have to make.\"Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs.Schultz agreed, calling it an \"unfortunate reality\" that many consumers will have to face.\"That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want,\" Schulz said.\"I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want,\" he said. \"However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice.\"LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper.Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said.Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.",

    "body": "Evolve Bank CEO Bob Hartheimer booking photo.Source: Shelby County JailBob Hartheimer, CEO of Tennessee's Evolve Bank & Trust, was fired after U.S. law enforcement officials caught him propositioning a law enforcement officer posing as a 15-year-old boy on gay dating app Grindr.On Oct. 19, an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation logged onto Grindr while pretending to be a teen boy, and a user called \"Tomm\" wrote a message to that person saying, \"Hey any chance u would hu with an older and chill guy,\" according to an affidavit from a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was unsealed on Tuesday.The two discussed getting together in person later in the week, according to the affidavit. On Snapchat, they talked about the sex acts they might perform. \"Tomm\" asked for a photo of the \"boy\" without shorts on, and he also sent the undercover agent a picture of himself naked. The FBI was able to obtain an IP address for \"Tomm\" from Snapchat, as well as an address from Comcast, the affidavit showed.Hartheimer was arrested in Memphis on Oct. 23 for attempted production of child pornography and transfer of obscene material to a minor, according to a warrant.An Evolve spokesperson and Blake Ballin, a lawyer representing Hartheimer, told CNBC on Saturday that Evolve has fired the CEO.\"Bob's family is aware of the charges,\" Ballin wrote in an email. \"His family loves and supports him and requests privacy during this difficult period in their lives. We have no further comment at this time.\"The Wall Street Journal reported on Hartheimer's firing from Evolve Bank on Friday. Evolve said its finance chief, Mark Mosteller, and its general counsel, Joelle Weltzin, will be in charge of the bank's operations, as they were before the bank hired Hartheimer in August.\"We are in close contact with the U.S. Attorney's office and have been assured that this is a personal matter and does not relate to the Bank or its operations in any way,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.Last year, Evolve was caught up in the bankruptcy of financial technology startup Synapse, which cut off access to a system for handling transactions and account details. Fintech apps such as Yotta worked with Evolve and other banks, with Synapse acting as a middleman.Synapse's method of keeping app users' money in various banks, including Evolve, created accounting problems, and up to $96 million in deposits went missing. Thousands of Americans lost money, CNBC reported.In 2024, Evolve also suffered a cyberattack, during which hackers obtained customer information and demanded a ransom. The bank said it did not pay any ransom and the data was eventually posted online.\"This is a structural change, demonstrating our continued commitment to doing the hard work to earn back the trust of our customers, employees, regulators, and investors,\" Evolve said in an August statement announcing the selection of Hartheimer to replace CEO Scott Stafford, who retired after joining in 2004.The bank touted Hartheimer's experience as director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Resolutions, as well as his years as a regulatory consultant for fintech companies.\"Over the past four decades, I've led, turned around, and advised institutions across the financial landscape,\" Hartheimer wrote on his LinkedIn profile. The 100-year-old bank reported net losses for each of the first three quarters of 2025 after being profitable since 2003, according to data on file with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.— CNBC's Dan Mangan and Hugh Son contributed reporting.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "The Valero Energy refinery in Texas City, Texas.F. Carter Smith | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe focus on dividend stocks is growing, as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced another rate cut. Investors can consider stocks that offer dividends and also have the potential to drive capital appreciation, enhancing the total return.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help us identify stocks that have solid upside and pay attractive dividends. The stock picks of these experts are backed by in-depth analysis of a company's growth opportunities and ability to pay dividends consistently.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Valero EnergyWe start this week with Valero Energy (VLO), a manufacturer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products. In Q3 2025, Valero returned $1.3 billion to stockholders via $351 million in dividends and $931 million in share repurchases. On Oct. 29, Valero declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.52, VLO stock offers a yield of 2.7%.Valero Energy recently reported upbeat Q3 results, backed by strong refining margins. Keeping in view the Q3 performance, strong refining outlook, and the company's attractive capital returns strategy, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on VLO stock and raised his price target to $197 from $180.\"We continue to view VLO as a key beneficiary of our more constructive refining outlook, given the company's balance sheet strength, low-cost operations, and operational execution,\" said Mehta.The 5-star analyst noted that during the third-quarter earnings call, management discussed a constructive refining outlook, driven by limited net capacity additions and widening crude differentials. Mehta also highlighted that Valero's non-refining businesses performed better than Goldman Sachs' expectations. Looking ahead, Mehta believes that low inventories, resilient demand, and limited net refining capacity additions support tighter supply/demand expectations for 2026.In particular, Mehta noted management's continued focus on capital returns and commitment to allocating excess free cash flow to shareholders. The analyst expects a stronger refining backdrop to contribute to meaningful free cash flow generation, which could support about $4.6 billion of capital returns in 2026, implying a 9% capital return yield.Mehta ranks No. 812 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%.AlbertsonsWe move on to the next dividend-paying stock, Albertsons Companies (ACI). The food and drug retailer recently announced upbeat results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by strong pharmacy sales and digital business. On October 14, Albertsons announced a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, payable on November 7. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, ACI stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.Following Albertsons' better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on ACI stock and modestly increased his price target to $29 from $28. The analyst is bullish on Albertsons as the company \"accelerates growth through AI-powered digital sales, expanding loyalty ecosystem, and high-margin retail media platform.\"Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is transforming from a traditional grocery operator into a data‑driven, digitally integrated food and wellness platform. This change is being fueled by the company's e-commerce expansion, loyalty integration, and rapidly expanding Albertsons Media Collective advertising network, which Feinseth believes is well-positioned to become one of its most profitable long-term growth engines.The top-rated analyst pointed out that ACI's For U loyalty program is driving both digital engagement and spending growth. In fact, For U membership increased more than 13% year-over-year in Q2 FY25, reaching over 48 million active participants. The growing member base boosts ACI's business as members transact more frequently, spend more, and are increasingly using cross-channel rewards, noted Feinseth.Additionally, Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is enhancing shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases, including the recently announced additional $750 million accelerated share repurchase authorization. He expects ACI stock to deliver a total return of close to 50%, including dividends.Feinseth ranks No. 296 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.2%.Williams CompaniesFinally, let's look at energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB). On October 28, Williams announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on December 29, 2025, and reflecting a 5.3% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $2 per share, WMB stock offers a 3.5% yield.Ahead of Williams' Q3 results scheduled after the market closes on November 3, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price forecast of $75. In a preview on the Q3 results of the companies in the U.S. midstream space, Scotto stated that Williams and Targa Resources (TRGP) are her favored names into the earnings.Scotto noted that the secular tailwind for natural gas due to rising power demand for electrification and artificial intelligence (AI)/data center growth is driving the need for more energy infrastructure. The 5-star analyst believes that among the stocks within her coverage, \"WMB is best positioned to benefit given its gas transmission asset footprint and its Power Innovation projects.\"Furthermore, Scotto expects WMB to deliver a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of about 10% in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from 2025 through 2030. The analyst looks forward to additional information on WMB's recently announced Power Innovation projects and any new projects. Scotto expects an uptick in Q3 2025 numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis across all business segments, with Transmission, Gulf, and Power driving the biggest absolute increase.Scotto views WMB's February analyst day as the next catalyst for the stock. The analyst expects WMB to increase its EBITDA growth target from the range of 5% to 7% to high single digits or more.Scotto ranks No. 270 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.7%.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.David A. Grogen | CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp rebound in operating profit on Saturday, while its cash pile swelled to a new high with no buybacks.Berkshire's operating profit generated from the conglomerate's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads jumped 34% year over year to $13.485 billion in the third quarter. The gains were driven by a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which rose to $2.37 billion.Buffett once again refrained from repurchasing shares despite a significant pullback in the stock. The company said there were no share buybacks during the first nine months of 2025. Class A and B shares of the conglomerate are up 5% each in 2025, while the S&P 500 is up 16.3%.Without any buybacks, Berkshire's cash hoard swelled to a record $381.6 billion, surpassing the previous high of $347.7 billion set in the first quarter of this year.Berkshire also didn't find other stocks attractive, net selling equities in the third quarter for a taxable gain of $10.4 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire Hathaway class A shares year to dateThe 95-year-old Buffett in May announced he's stepping down as CEO at the year-end after six legendary decades. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as chief executive, while Buffett will remain chairman of the board. Abel will also start writing annual letters in 2026.The Omaha-based conglomerate's shares have tumbled double digits from all-time highs following the announcement. The sell-off partially reflects the so-called Buffett premium, or the extra price investors are willing to pay because of the billionaire's unmatched record and exceptional capital allocation skills.Last month, Berkshire announced a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal marks Berkshire's largest since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Overall earnings, which include gains from Berkshire's investments in other publicly traded companies, rose 17% to $30.8 billion year on year.

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks during an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the company at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on April 4, 2025. Microsoft Corp., determined to hold its ground in artificial intelligence, will soon let consumers tailor the Copilot digital assistant to their own needs.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft will expand its employee base once again, CEO Satya Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on a podcast that aired on Friday.The software maker's workforce didn't budge in the 2025 fiscal year, which ended in June. It stood at 228,000, with multiple rounds of layoffs lowering the total number by at least 6,000. In July, Microsoft let go of another 9,000 workers.\"I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,\" Nadella said on the BG2 podcast. OpenAI, which has a broad partnership with Microsoft, introduced its ChatGPT assistant in 2022. Microsoft's headcount grew by 22% in the 2022 fiscal year.Employees will figure out how to do their jobs differently, Nadella said, adding that the company wants to ensure they can access artificial intelligence features in Microsoft 365 productivity software and the GitHub Copilot AI coding assistant. Those services draw on AI models from Anthropic and OpenAI.\"It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,\" he said.A similar adjustment played out at corporations decades ago, Nadella said. To prepare forecasts, inter-office memos would circulate across multiple sites by fax, and then came email and Excel spreadsheets, he said.\"Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues and what have you,\" Nadella said.This week, Amazon, which is racing against Microsoft to rent out cloud infrastructure for running AI models, cut 14,000 corporate employees.Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, told workers in a memo that \"this generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones).\"On the podcast, Nadella talked about a Microsoft executive who deals with networking fiber. As the company ramped up data center operations to meet rising cloud demand, the executive realized she wouldn't be able to hire all the people she thought she needed, and so she built AI agents to handle maintenance, Nadella said.\"That is an example of you, to your point, a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,\" Nadella told Gerstner, who is founder and CEO of technology investment firm Altimeter Capital.On Wednesday, Microsoft reported 12% year-over-year revenue growth and showed the widest operating margin since 2002.WATCH: Microsoft earnings beat estimates, Azure revenue jumps 40%watch now",

But Musk is again promising that a new one is on the way.In a discussion with podcaster Joe Rogan that was published on Friday, Musk was asked about the long-delayed vehicle. He provided a sense of timing but declined to share updated technical or design details.\"I can't do the unveil before the unveil,\" Musk said. As he's said before, Musk claimed the new Roadster \"has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.\"Tesla is aiming to show off the updated Roadster to fans and investors \"hopefully before the end of the year,\" Musk said.Musk's comments come a day after former close friend Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, posted on X that he tried to cancel his Roadster reservation from 2018 and get his deposit refunded. He shared a screenshot showing that his email to the company had bounced back.\"I really was excited for the car!\" Altman wrote. \"And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.\"Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015, is in a heated legal dispute with Altman and now runs competing artificial intelligence startup xAI.Patrick George, editor-in-chief at InsideEVs and a long-time industry observer, told CNBC on Friday that the Roadster \"has been MIA for years.\"\"The only thing I can think of that would make Musk start talking about this again is that Sam Altman at OpenAI, who is sort of his arch-rival, just said recently that he was trying to cancel his Roadster reservation which he has held since 2018,\" George said.Earlier this year, the popular gadget and autos reviewer Marques Brownlee discussed the arduous process of cancelling his own Roadster reservation in an interview with Waveform Podcast.The Roadster is a high end, low-volume model, something meant to challenge vehicles like BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme, which was recently crowned the world's fastest production car.Musk faces a major Tesla shareholder vote next week, as he and the board are asking investors to approve a massive pay package.The pay plan would net Musk nearly $1 trillion in Tesla stock and would grow his stake to around 25%, depending on the company hitting various market valuations and other growth milestones.WATCH: CNBC's interview with Tesla Chair Robyn Denholmwatch now",

    "body": "Chinese tech company Baidu announced Monday it can sell some robotaxi rides without any human staff in the vehicles.BaiduBEIJING — As Baidu ramps up its robotaxi operations worldwide, fully driverless weekly rides as of Oct. 31 have now surpassed 250,000 orders, according to a spokesperson for the company's driverless car unit Apollo Go.That's on par with what Waymo reported in late April for its weekly paid U.S. rides. When contacted by CNBC, Waymo did not have a new specific figure to share. The Alphabet-backed robotaxi operator primarily operates in San Francisco and Los Angeles in California and Phoenix, Arizona. Waymo partners with Uber in Austin and Atlanta.The ramp up in Baidu's robotaxi capabilities comes as Chinese and U.S. companies have been competing for leadership in advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, electric cars and autonomous driving.It was not clear for how long Apollo Go has been operating 250,000 rides a week. For the quarter ended June 30, the company averaged about 169,000 rides a week based on CNBC calculations of the 2.2 million fully driverless robotaxi rides disclosed for the period.Baidu's Apollo Go primarily operates robotaxis in Wuhan and parts of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in mainland China. The company is also expanding to Hong Kong, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and, most recently, Switzerland. Robotaxis typically must undergo phases of public testing before local regulators allow companies to charge fares.Apollo Go said it has received 17 million robotaxi ride orders to date, and that its cars have driven 240 million kilometers (149 million miles), with 140 million fully driverless rides.watch nowOn safety, Apollo Go disclosed on average there has been one airbag deployment incident for every 10.1 million kilometers driven, but so far there's has not been any major accident involving human injury or death.Baidu is scheduled to next release its quarterly results on Nov. 18 before U.S. market open. The company is set to hold its annual tech conference in Beijing on Nov. 13.Weekly robotaxi figures from Chinese rivals Pony.ai and WeRide were not immediately available. Waymo did not immediately respond to a request for an update to the figures shared in April.",

    "body": "Jasondoiy | E+ | Getty ImagesA recent NBC News poll showed growing frustration among Americans regarding President Donald Trump's handling of the economy less than a year after entering office.In a poll of 1,000 voters taken between Oct. 25-28, 63% said Trump had fallen short of expectations regarding the economy. Separately, 65% said Trump had fallen short of looking out for the middle class, and 66% expressed the same sentiment for the handling of inflation and the cost of living.Trump's overall approval rating in the poll has fallen 4 points to 43% since March, while 55% disapprove of the president's job performance.The negativity appears to be bleeding into voters' feelings of dissatisfaction with Republican lawmakers. With just a year to go before the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats are favored to win control of Congress by an 8-point margin, 50% to 42%, among those polled. Democrats led by just one point, 48% to 47%, in the March survey.The results come as the government shutdown has stretched past a month, affecting critical government programs, including SNAP food benefits. The NBC News poll also indicated that voters are split on which party would have a better handle on the economy.According to the poll, 38% of voters found Republicans would do a better job, while 37% found Democrats would be more effective.This follows a recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey, which showed views on the U.S. economy turned more negative.See the complete NBC News poll here.",

    "body": "Ellen and Edward earn $28,000 a month, or an annual income of around $336,000 a year — more than triple their home state of Hawaii's median household income.But their high income doesn't prevent the couple from having constant financial disagreements, they told money expert, author and self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi on a recent episode of his Money for Couples podcast. Their last names were not used.Edward is terrified of ever returning to a poor financial situation similar to what he grew up in, while Ellen wants the freedom to reasonably spend their money without asking permission, they said.\"We are pretty financially well-off, and my brain does not compute that,\" Edward said on the podcast. \"Everything for me is a fire. A blown tire that's $200, $300 is a huge deal for me.\"It's not just emergencies, either. Edward oversees the all of couple's finances, and Ellen said she has to get his approval to buy virtually anything, even everyday beauty products or essentials like her prenatal vitamins.\"I feel like every time I ask for anything ... I have to over-explain why I need it for him to say yes,\" Ellen said. \"That constant, 'let me ask,' 'let's see what he says,' 'let me go in detail about why I need it,' is not a good feeling.\"Here's why their disagreements keep happening and Sethi's advice for how to manage money together better.How to manage money as a coupleEllen and Edward aren't bad partners, Sethi said. \"More likely, it's [a] bad structure\" for how they manage their money.The couple understands some basics of setting up a financial system that works for both of them, Sethi said, like the idea that they should have money dedicated to discretionary spending. However, Edward has been including items like prenatal vitamins in Ellen's discretionary spending, which Sethi strongly disagreed with.\"You don't just need a better budget. In fact, you probably don't even need a budget at all,\" Sethi said. \"You need a better system that is built together.\"For both partners to start feeling better about money and hopefully have fewer disagreements going forward, Sethi offered three pieces of advice — and anyone in a similar situation can follow them.1. Encourage your partner to engage with your finances In Edward and Ellen's situation, Edward handles all of the money, while Ellen is hands off. But as spouses and co-parents, both parties need to be treated as equals, Sethi said.Sethi suggests the partner who has more experience with managing the household budget — Edward, in this case — encourage the other to get involved. He recommends telling yourself from \"day one,\" \"I am not going to do this on my own. I want my partner to become good with money.\"2. Talk about money regularlyIn the past, Ellen has avoided money conversations because she felt like her needs were dismissed and she didn't understand where Edward was coming from when he worried about their finances. Having regular money conversations could help them clear up miscommunications going forward and allow both partners to feel empowered to make decisions on how the family spends their money, Sethi said. 3. Find a structure that works for both partnersEllen and Edward's current system, in which Edward approves all of the couple's spending, isn't working for both of them. Sethi suggested they adopt a new structure together. One idea: They could each have \"no-questions-asked money\" along with a joint account and work together to decide how much goes in each, Sethi said.Additionally, they should create some general rules for money in their relationship, such as a no-debt policy or a limit on how long to spend flipping a house, which has been a point of contention in the past.The couple needs to make a more concerted effort to work together and create a shared vision for their money or else they'll \"forever feel resentful, behind, insecure, unworthy, misaligned, sometimes even in danger around your finances,\" Sethi said. \"Money is important,\" he added. \"My wish for you is that you give it the attention and respect that it deserves.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "The logo of Chinese-owned semiconductor company Nexperia is displayed at the chipmaker's German facility, after the Dutch government seized control and auto industry bodies sounded the alarm over the possible impact on car production, in Hamburg, Germany, Oct. 23, 2025. Jonas Walzberg | ReutersNetherlands-based chipmaker Nexperia is at the heart of a standoff between the European Union, the U.S. and China that has triggered a near-crisis for global automakers.The Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech, in October, citing national security concerns. The move prompted Beijing to block Nexperia products from leaving China.Meetings are underway in Europe Saturday to attempt to defuse the escalating issue, and Chinese and U.S. authorities appear to be opening up a pathway for Nexperia's China-based operations to resume exporting critical automotive chips.Spokespeople for the White House and Nexperia did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For now, however, the auto industry's supply chain still hangs in the balance.The dispute is threatening vehicle production worldwide as automakers warn of looming shortages of the chipmaker's components, which are critical to basic electrical functions in cars and challenging to replace on short notice.The battle has unfolded amid heightened scrutiny of Chinese-linked tech firms from Western governments, including the U.S., which recently tightened export-control rules to limit technology transfers to Chinese-owned entities.Nexperia's owner, Wingtech, was put on a U.S. blacklist in December 2024 for its alleged role \"in aiding China's government's efforts to acquire entities with sensitive semiconductor manufacturing capability.\"Here's what to know about where the dispute stands, and why it matters. Why are Nexperia chips so important?Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. Around 70% of chips made in the Netherlands are sent to China to be completed and re-exported to other countries.The chips are basic and inexpensive, but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. Nexperia had sales of $2 billion last year.In late October, automakers, such as Volkswagen, Nissan Motor and Mercedes-Benz, sounded the alarm about potential production cuts if Nexperia's chip exports are curtailed for long.While automakers typically have some stockpiles and alternative suppliers, it is difficult to switch supply sources overnight. What happened and where do things stand?In September, the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia, amid concerns that its Chinese owner was planning to shift intellectual property to another company it owned. A Dutch court also suspended Nexperia CEO, Wingtech founder Zhang Xuezhen, citing mismanagement.Beijing retaliated weeks later by imposing export controls on certain Nexperia products made in China, escalating tensions and fueling fears of a broader supply chain shock. That prompted the company to tell carmakers it could no longer guarantee supplies.But signs of a breakthrough have started to emerge.On Friday, reports said the U.S. plans to announce that Nexperia will resume sending chips under a framework agreement reached during talks between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, citing sources familiar with the matter. And on Saturday, China said it will exempt some Nexperia chips from its export ban. Chinese officials did not specify what those exemptions could entail.\"We will comprehensively consider the actual situation of the enterprise and exempt eligible exports,\" The Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a statement. If finalized, the exemptions could ease immediate pressure on automakers. But the broader dispute over ownership, technology control and security oversight remains unresolved.",

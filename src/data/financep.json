    "body": "A cargo ship sits in New York Harbor on Nov. 19, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Plat | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday could rule on the legality of President Donald Trump's tariffs, a decision poised to have far-reaching impacts on not only trade policy, but also the U.S. fiscal situation.Though it's not certain that the high court will make its ruling, it has scheduled Friday as a \"decision day\" for handing down opinions, and there is widespread speculation that the tariff case will come up.At its core, the ruling will address two issues: whether the administration can use provisions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to levy the tariffs, and if it isn't proper, if the U.S. will have to reimburse those importers who already have paid the duties.However, the final decision could also fall somewhere in between.The court has the option to grant limited powers under the IEEPA and require only limited repayment, along with multiple other options for how it handles a touchy matter that is being closely watched on Wall Street.Moreover, even should the White House lose the case, it has other tools in its chest to implement tariffs that don't require the emergency powers cited under the act.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent himself said Thursday he expects a \"mishmash\" ruling.\"What is not in doubt is our ability to continue collecting tariffs at roughly the same level, in terms of overall revenues,\" Bessent said during an appearance in Minneapolis. \"What is in doubt, and it's a real shame for the American people, was the president loses flexibility to use tariffs both for national security, for negotiating leverage.\"Trump used the IEEPA in part as an emergency measure to stop the inflow of fentanyl to the U.S. The impact of losingLosing the tariffs would have multiple ramifications, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"If the court blocks the tariffs, the administration is going to find workarounds,\" Torres said. \"President Trump is very ambitious in getting this agenda through despite potential controversies that could surround such a decision.\"\"Blocking tariffs would be bad for onshoring ambitions. It would be bad for fiscal conditions, rates would go higher,\" he added. \"But it would be good for corporate earnings. Input prices would be lower and trade would be smoother.\"Administration officials have cited a number of options to offset the court's decision should it not go their way. Prediction markets site Kalshi is pointing to just a 28% probability that the court will rule in favor of the tariffs as implemented. Torres said his firm's clients have a similar expectation. Bessent has said that the administration has at least three other options through the 1962 Trade Act that will keep most of the tariffs in place. However, he also has worried that reimbursements could place a strain on the administration and its effort to drive down the fiscal deficit. Tariffs brought in some $195 billion in fiscal 2025 and another $62 billion in 2026, according to Treasury data.Ultimately, Morgan Stanley analysts \"see significant room for nuance\" in the Supreme Court decision. The court \"has wide latitude when it comes to issuing decisions, a range of outcomes is possible, like the Court narrowing the scope of existing tariffs but not mandating their full removal or limiting the future application of tariffs,\" Morgan Stanley analysts Ariana Salvatore and Bradley Tian said in a note.\"We do think there's scope for the administration to take a lighter-touch approach to the overall tariff regime given a recent political focus on affordability,\" they added.The tariff impact thus far has defied analyst projections: There's been a limited impact on inflation, while the trade deficit has plunged, countering expectations in some quarters that the tariffs could make the U.S. a pariah on the global trading stage. The trade imbalance for October hit its lowest level since the end of the financial crisis in 2009, at a time when imports had declined sharply due to the massive recession the crisis generated.",

    "body": "Pedestrians walk past a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Chicago, Dec. 30, 2025.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesBeleaguered retail chain Saks Global is struggling to line up as much as $1 billion in financing to keep its business afloat during a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, CNBC has learned. The luxury chain has been working to secure a \"debtor-in-possession\" loan, which would allow it to fund operations in the event of a potential bankruptcy filing, people familiar with the matter said. But investors have so far shown little interest in lending Saks the money because they're skeptical the company can successfully reorganize and pay them back, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.While DIP lenders get repaid before other creditors during bankruptcy proceedings, they don't always recoup their full investment, and some investors are concerned that could happen if they finance Saks, the people said.The storied 159-year-old department store, which now owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, is both a destination and a symbol for luxury fashion, known for offering top brands like Chanel and Dior alongside up and comers like Good American. Across the entire enterprise, Saks Global has more than 70 full-line luxury stores and about 100 off-price locations. Since Saks missed an interest payment to bondholders late last month, only a \"limited number\" of investors have shown interest in financing the DIP loan, while a number of others have declined to get involved, the people said. Saks declined to comment on investor interest in its fundraising efforts. A wide array of firms invest in companies that could be headed for bankruptcy, including top banks and private equity. However, the only firms likely to be interested in investing in Saks at this point are either liquidators that also have investment vehicles or alternative asset managers that have experience in distressed retail, one source said. Still, even some of those investors have declined to get involved with Saks' DIP loan, the people said. Liquidation is one of several potential outcomes Saks faces. However, if it can't line up a DIP loan, which would be used to pay for essential expenses like payroll, rent and inventory, that scenario would be more likely. The retailer is already struggling to pay those costs.Failure to line up financing would prevent Saks from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would give the company a chance to reorganize and potentially find a buyer willing to take on its business as a going concern. It could then be faced with Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which is reserved for liquidation. That could mean the end for one of the most fabled department stores in history, whose flagship store on Fifth Avenue, considered by some to be its most valuable asset, has become a global destination. In the meantime, Saks has also been in talks with liquidators for a number of stores that are in the process of closing, but not yet the entire chain, the people said.Saks' troubles have been mounting since it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in a $2.7 billion deal in 2024, which was heavily financed with debt.The tie-up between the two rivals was expected to create a luxury retail powerhouse that could better streamline costs and negotiate with vendors.Instead, Saks has struggled to pay its vendors on time, leading to inventory gaps and declining sales. A slowdown in the overall luxury market, which has seen growth stagnate in recent years, has compounded the issues.",

Mathieu Lewis-Rolland | Getty ImagesA U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in a vehicle on Thursday afternoon in  Portland, Oregon, after the driver allegedly tried to run over agents, a senior federal official said.The shooting occurred a day after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Nicole Good as she was driving toward him on a street in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after being ordered to exit her SUV by other ICE agents.McLaughlin and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have accused Good, 37, of engaging in \"domestic terrorism,\" and claimed that she intentionally tried to run over ICE agents after blocking a residential street with her vehicle.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democratic officials have said those claims are false, pointing to videos of the shooting.The shooting in Portland occurred at 2:19 p.m. PT, as Border Patrol agents were \"conducting a targeted vehicle stop,\" Homeland Security Department Deputy Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a post on X.\"The passenger of the vehicle and target is a Venezuelan illegal alien affiliated with the transnational Tren de Aragua prostitution ring and involved in a recent shooting in Portland,\" McLaughlin said.\"The vehicle driver is believed to be a member of the vicious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua,\" she said.\"When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents,\" McLaughlin said. \"Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots,\" she said. \"The driver drove off with the passenger, fleeing the scene.\"Portland Police said the unidentified man and the woman who were shot were taken to a hospital, and that their conditions were unknown. The FBI is leading the investigation of the shooting.Portland Mayor Keith Wilson, whose city has become a focus point for immigration enforcement actions by the Trump administration, in a statement, said, \"Just one day after the horrific violence in Minnesota at the hands of federal agents, our community here in Portland is now grappling with another deeply troubling incident.\"\"We cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts,\" Wilson said.\"Portland is not a 'training ground' for militarized agents, and the 'full force' threatened by the administration has deadly consequences,\" he said. \"As Mayor, I call on ICE to end all operations in Portland until a full investigation can be completed.\"Portland Police Chief Bob Day, in a statement, said, \"We are still in the early stages of this incident.\"\"We understand the heightened emotion and tension many  are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking  the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,\" Day said.Portland Police, in a statement, said they responded to a report of a shooting on Southeast Main Street, in the city's Hazelwood neighborhood.\"Officers confirmed that federal agents had been involved in a shooting,\" the statement said. \"Portland Police were not involved in the incident.\"\"At  2:24 p.m., officers received information that a man who had been shot was calling and requesting help in the area of Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside,\" police said. \"Officers responded and found a male and female with apparent gunshot wounds,\" the statement said.\"Officers applied a tourniquet and  summoned emergency medical personnel. The patients were transported to the hospital. Their conditions are unknown.\"\"Officers have determined the two people were injured in the shooting involving federal agents,\" police said.The FBI's Portland office, in an emailed statement to CNBC, said it was \"investigating an assault on a federal officers that happened at approximately 2:15pm near the 10000 block of Main St. in Portland involving two Customs and Border Patrol agents.\"\"The two assailants fled the scene immediately following the shooting and are currently being treated for their injuries,\" the office said. \"This remains an active and ongoing investigation led by the FBI.\"",

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol in Washington, Dec. 8, 2025. Graeme Sloan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first vetoes of President Donald Trump's second term survived separate override votes by the House of Representatives on Thursday.The outcome was a surprise, since both bills that Trump had vetoed were passed in unanimous voice votes by the House and Senate. The bills supported infrastructure in Colorado and Florida.The override vote on the Colorado bill veto failed 248-177, with one member voting present. The Florida override measure failed 236-188.Overriding a veto requires a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate. By rule, if a vote to override a veto fails in the House, no vote is required in the Senate, and the veto remains in effect.The votes came hours after Trump was rebuked by a vote in the Senate, which advanced a bill to curtail his ability to use the U.S. military in Venezuela. Trump's veto of the Colorado bill infuriated some Republican lawmakers from the state, including the bill's sponsor, Rep. Lauren Boebert, who until the latter half of 2025 had been a close Trump ally. The bill, the Finish the Arkansas Valley Conduit Act, sought to reduce the payments local communities must make for the construction of a pipeline set to provide clean drinking water to rural communities in Colorado.  \"Time after time in that chamber, I am disappointed to see the lack of leadership,\" Boebert told reporters after the override vote.\"This had nothing to do with policy … folks are afraid of getting a mean tweet or attacked,\" she said.Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., arrives to the U.S. Capitol for the last vote of the week on Friday, November 15, 2024.Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesAnother co-sponsor of the bill, Rep. Jeff Hurd, R-Colo., before the vote had said that overriding Trump's veto would reassert the authority of Congress.Trump's veto \"should give every member pause,\" Hurd said. \"My constituents are watching, and your constituents are watching.\"In a message to Congress, Trump said he vetoed the Colorado bill because it would \"continue the failed policies of the past by forcing Federal taxpayers to bear even more of the massive costs of a local water project — a local water project that, as initially conceived, was supposed to be paid for by the localities using it.\"Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

The bill also would have required the Interior Department to help flood-proof structures in the area. Trump said he vetoed the bill in part to prevent \"American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration's policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country.\"Trump was accused of vetoing both bills for political reasons.The Miccosukee Tribe was one of the groups that sued the Trump administration over its construction of \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" a detention center set up to house migrants.The facility has since been shut down.Boebert was one of the few Republicans who bucked Trump and joined Democrats in the successful effort to compel the Department of Justice to release files related to the notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Boebert resisted intense pressure from the White House to back down from that effort.Trump has also vowed retribution against Colorado for its refusal to release Tina Peters, a former county clerk who last year was convicted of crimes related to tampering with voting machines.Rep.

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during a bill signing ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House, in Washington, Dec. 12, 2025.Francis Chung | Politico | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said he is \"instructing my Representatives\" to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, claiming that doing so will drive rates and monthly payments down.Trump, in a Truth Social post, said he was issuing that directive because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage-issuing entities, are flush with cash.It was unclear who Trump is referring to as his representatives. The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for clarity.watch nowFHFA Director Bill Pulte posted on X later Thursday, \"We are on it. Thanks to President Trump, Fannie and Freddie will be executing.\" Hours before Trump's post, Pulte said in a CNBC interview that he expects Trump will make a decision in the next month or two on a possible initial public offering of Fannie and Freddie.Trump claimed that his latest directive would help restore \"affordability,\" a word that has become key to Democrats' political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.Trump heaped criticism on the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, claiming that Biden had \"ignored the Housing Market\" amid a slew of other policy failures.\"Everything was broken, but I, as President of the United States, have already fixed it!\" Trump declared. \"Now, I am giving special attention to the Housing Market.\"\"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount — AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE — and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH,\" he wrote.\"Because of this, I am instructing my Representatives to BUY $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS.\"It was not clear from Trump's post whether it would be Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury Department or another entity doing the buying.The Federal Reserve in the past has purchased mortgage bonds in an effort to lower rates, as part of the monetary policy known as \"quantitative easing.\" But the executive branch cannot order the independent central bank to initiate those transactions.The Treasury has purchased mortgage bonds in the past during times of extreme turmoil, such as the housing crisis of 2008 and 2009.It was also not clear whether this buying would have any impact on mortgage rates. The Fed's quantitative easing typically involves buying multiple types of securities, with larger amounts done in Treasuries in order to lower long-term Treasury rates.Mortgage rates typically follow the lead of long-term Treasury rates, rather than mortgage bond yields.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked slightly lower after hours amid Trump's comments.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump will meet Friday afternoon with oil executives at the White House to discuss plans for investment in Venezuela, less than a week after the U.S. ousted President Nicolas Maduro in a military raid.The CEOs of Exxon, ConocoPhillips, Shell and a representative from Chevron will attend, sources told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. Energy Secretary Chris Wright will also attend, a Department of Energy spokesperson said. The White House called the 2 p.m. ET meeting, an industry source told CNBC. It was not scheduled at the request of the oil companies, the source said.Trump said in the immediate aftermath of Maduro's overthrow that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. But the industry has been mostly silent as the security situation and stability of the government in Caracas remains murky. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But its oil sector is in dire disrepair. Production has declined from a peak of about 3.5 million barrels per day(bpd)  in the 1990s to only around 800,000 bpd today, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. It will cost tens of billions of dollars to return Venezuelan production to its historic levels, Energy Secretary Wright said at a Goldman Sachs' conference in Miami Wednesday. Rystad Energy estimates it will cost more than $180 billion through 2040 for Venezuelan production to reach 3 million bpd. Working with ChevronThe Trump administration has provided few details on how it will encourage oil companies to make large investments in a country with history of nationalizing industry assets. Chevron is the only U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a joint venture with state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Wright told CNBC Wednesday that the U.S. is working closely with Chevron.\"Chevron is on the ground so we're getting daily updates,\" Wright told CNBC. \"They're actually working [under] this regime. So with them, how can we provide incremental tweaks or changes to allow their model to grow even more,\" the energy secretary said.  Venezuelan production could grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the short- to medium term with small capital deployments, Wright said. Exxon, Conoco doubtsBut Exxon and Conoco will need reassurances to return to Venezuela, Wright said. The companies exited the country after former President Hugo Chavez seized their assets in 2007. They have billions of dollars in outstanding claims against the government they won in arbitration cases.Wright said the debts Venezuela owes Exxon and Conoco need to be repaid at some point but are not an immediate priority for the Trump administration. The White House is focused on stabilizing Venezuela's economy through oil sales, the energy secretary said. \"We're trying to engineer a transition of Venezuela to a place that Americans want to do business in, want to invest new capital in, want to grow new partnerships with,\"  Wright said.But it is unclear whether the White House can convince companies like Exxon and Conoco to return to Venezuela without a dramatic change in government in Caracas.\"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\" Leveraging oil salesThe U.S. has taken control of Venezuela's oil exports to pressure the government in Caracas, Wright said. Venezuela will ship tens of millions of barrels to the U.S., which the Trump administration will then sell, holding the proceeds in U.S.-controlled accounts, the energy secretary said. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" Wright said. The energy secretary said the U.S. is not stealing Venezuela's oil. The proceeds from the sales will be used to benefit the nation of 30 million, he said. Trump said Wednesday that the revenue from the oil will be used to purchase U.S.-made products.\"I have just been informed that Venezuela is going to be purchasing ONLY American Made Products, with the money they receive from our new Oil Deal,\" the president wrote on social media Wednesday. Purchases will include agricultural products, medicine, medical devices and equipment to modernize Venezuela's energy sector.\"In other words, Venezuela is committing to doing business with the United States of America as their principal partner,\" Trump said.

    "body": "GM Hummer EV production in Detroit.Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General MotorsDETROIT – General Motors said Thursday it will record $7.1 billion in special charges for the fourth quarter of last year related to its pullback in electric vehicles and restructuring efforts in China.The Detroit automaker said in a public filing that the charges include roughly $6 billion related to changes to its EV plans amid weakening demand and $1.1 billion, including $500 million in cash, largely related to its previously announced overhaul of a Chinese joint venture.The charges will impact GM's net income but not adjusted results. The announcement was broadly anticipated after the Detroit automaker in October said it was reevaluating its EV plans and would initially take a $1.6 billion charge during the third quarter as a result. GM's new writedowns come after crosstown rival Ford Motor said in December it expected to record about $19.5 billion in special charges related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in all-electric vehicle investments.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC in October.watch nowAutomakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.GM said the fourth-quarter EV impairments include non-cash charges of approximately $1.8 billion. The remaining $4.2 billion is related to supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees and other charges, which will have a cash impact when paid.Additional EV charges are expected to hit this year but at a lower amount than 2025's impairments, GM said in the filing Thursday: \"We expect to recognize additional material cash and non-cash charges in 2026 related to continued commercial negotiations with our supply base, which we believe will be significantly less than the EV-related charges incurred in 2025.\"The automaker also said it may incur additional charges related to its emissions credits due to proposed regulatory changes to the greenhouse gas emission standards by the Trump administration.GM was among the first automakers to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that ultimately didn't materialize. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.The U.S. EV segment overall has experienced a sales slump after the Trump administration in September put an early end to a $7,500 federal tax credit previously available for EV buyers.Shares of GM closed Thursday at $85.13, up almost 4% on the day. The stock had a banner year in 2025, gaining more than 50% to lead all major publicly traded automakers.GM is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 27.",

    "body": "A \"Now Hiring\" sign at a Cookout fast-food restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, Nov. 25, 2025.Al Drago | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market likely showed modest improvement in December, providing some encouragement for the year ahead but nothing to get too excited about.Nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 73,000 last month while the unemployment rate edged lower to 4.5%, according to the Dow Jones consensus. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the report Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.If those numbers are near accurate, it would represent a slight step up from the 55,000 average monthly gain during the prior 11 months of 2025 and would be a bit better than the initially reported 64,000 for November. The jobless rate is half a percentage point above where it was at the start of last year.Heading into 2026, most economists see a labor market far from stellar, but at least stable.\"The year is ending stronger than it started,\" said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of business operations at Adecco Staffing. \"We've seen some positivity, both in terms of hiring as well as [a] slow down of layoffs. So [the market is] looking pretty positive going into 2026. I think it'll be the year of stability.\"The labor market moved in a tight range through most of 2025, from a peak gain of 158,000 in April to a loss of 105,000 in October. Three of the last six months saw net losses.watch now\"We're just seeing that it's not too cold, not too hot, it's kind of right in the middle,\" Glaser said. \"I think that's where we'll continue to see 2026 as folks are cautiously optimistic. We'll probably see some ups and downs and add a little bit of bumpiness along the way. It may not be linear, but at the end of the day I think the market has proved resilient.\"Though the outward signs of the labor market show unemployment at a very low rate historically speaking, some Federal Reserve policymakers worry that cracks are showing that could grow more pronounced this year.Policymakers who backed the recent run of three straight interest rate cuts have cited a need to strengthen the jobs outlook as outweighing concerns over inflation reigniting. Fed officials also have cited a \"systematic overcount\" of payroll growth as a reason for their caution.Markets have been pinning their hopes that the Fed will intervene again if needed, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"Confidence has been stronger this year on the expectation that the Fed's going to ease further,\" he said. \"That's really going to bolster the hiring in more cyclically oriented areas.\"Job growth has so far largely been concentrated in areas that benefit from expansionary fiscal policy, particularly health care and government. Glaser expects that trend to continue.Outside of that pattern, Glaser said the other trend to continue watching in 2026 is retention, or the efforts of companies to keep the staff they have, rather than lay off or aggressively hire.\"Employers are really valuing those that have stayed with them and offering increases in salaries, additional bonuses and perks,\" she said. \"The one thing that employers that are getting it right are doing ... is just this investment in upskilling and reskilling.\"Friday's release will be the first on-time report since the end of the government shutdown in mid-November. Questions have arisen over the data gaps from the shutdown, with some economists expecting the first \"clean\" report to come in February.",

    "body": "The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Ólafsson told CNBC in an interview.Deals could involve \"offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,\" Ólafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, mentioning Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, told CNBC: \"The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.\"President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland.\"CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States, or EXIM, for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.Ólafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.watch nowGreenland's critical mineralsThe White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals.Rare-earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the territory.Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about \"critical minerals.\"Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Ólafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.He said that \"one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land,\" but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near \"deep fjords,\" meaning they could be easier to ship. Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.",

    "body": "Europe's best-performing blue-chip stock in 2025 is widely expected to be bought by a larger peer, in a deal analysts say could be worth as much as $23 billion.Abivax, the French clinical-stage biotech company developing a treatment for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, saw shares rocket 1,681% last year, far outpacing the Stoxx 600 index's second-best performing stock, mining company Fresnillo, which rose 453%.Now, the big question for analysts seems to be when, not if, Abivax announces a deal.The stock, listed in 2015, largely ranged between 10 and 20 euros but it wasn't until 10 years later that it really took off. Shares surged 510% in a day after Abivax reported the results of a late-stage trial for an ulcerative colitis medicine in July, beating even the most optimistic expectations. After these kinds of results, it could be a strategic acquisition for any large pharmaceutical company with an immunology and inflammation franchise.Abivax's lead – and only – asset, obefazimod, was first developed as a treatment for HIV, but researchers discovered that its anti-inflammatory effect could affect other conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and began clinical trials.Shares were boosted even more in December as rumors emerged that the world's most valuable pharma company, Eli Lilly, had its eyes set on acquiring Abivax. Both companies have repeatedly declined to comment on business development activities.An imminent deal?Analysts say that a deal could happen any time now.Van Lanschot Kempen analyst Sebastiaan van der Schoot told CNBC that biotechs often \"have a relatively small number of employees and don't have any experience with selling a drug,\" which he called \"a completely different ball game\" to developing them.\"That's why pharma takes them out to actually leverage their infrastructure,\" he said.The analyst added that he expected Abivax to trade between where it is now and where it was when rumors of a takeover first surfaced, until the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference on Monday, where companies often announce large deals.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAbivax shares surged in 2025, far outpacing European peers. It comes as Big Pharma has ramped up dealmaking in recent months, as the sector faces a looming patent cliff where some of the world's best-selling drugs lose exclusivity in the coming years.Another factor making a deal likelier is Abivax CEO Marc de Garidel's reputation as a leader who can make deals happen. He previously led multi-billion dollar buyouts of biotech firms to pharma players like AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk.Asked about a potential acquisition, de Garidel told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" in December that the company was always in \"conversation with Big Pharma\" but that its role was to develop the best possible drug.Abivax is planning to file for regulatory approval in the U.S. by the end of 2026, eyeing a potential launch by the third quarter of 2027, de Garidel said.The company is well-positioned to negotiate a favorable deal with a Big Pharma partner, Stifel analyst Damien Choplain said.\"Given the strength of the Phase III results and the scarcity of comparable assets, we believe a transaction could be executed ahead of the maintenance data readout expected in Q2 2026,\" he said, referring to a second clinical trial of Obefazimod which tests its efficacy over 44 weeks as opposed to only eight weeks.Choplain added that most transactions in the IBD space have historically happened for drug candidates in earlier stages of development. \"Abivax ticks all the boxes for a strategic acquisition,\" he said.watch nowBased on comparable transactions and a peak sales estimate of 3 billion euros, Abivax's valuation could range between 12 billion euros and 20 billion euros ($14 billion to $23 billion), Choplain told CNBC.Recent deals in the IBD space include Merck's acquisition of Prometheus for $10.8 billion; Roche's acquisition of Telavant for $7.1 billion; and Eli Lilly buying Morphic for $3.2 billion. Those deals were all for assets in an earlier stage of development than Abivax's obefazimod.A potential best-in-class treatment​Jefferies analyst Roger Song, who doesn't cover Abivax per se but tracks the IBD space closely from Boston, said that investors' optimism comes both from a multi-billion dollar potential market for IBD treatments, as well as from the drug candidate's novel way of addressing it through multiple pathways.It is even considered to be a potential best-in-class treatment for ulcerative colitis, he told CNBC in December.The July results from the trial of Obefazimod surprised investors because many had not been aware of the novel mechanism it uses, micro-RNA, Song said.A late-stage maintenance trial is expected in the second quarter of 2026.Van der Schoot added that, if Abivax is confident enough in those maintenance results, it can wait to be acquired after the trial is published, \"because then they can ask a higher price.\"",

Those ticket sales marked a more than 40% increase over 2024 and were 13% higher than its previous record set in 2019.Meanwhile, shares of fellow theatrical stocks AMC, Cinemark and Marcus Theatres cratered in 2025. AMC was down more than 60%, Marcus Corporation, which operates theaters and hotel chains, slumped around 28% and Cinemark's stock fell 25%.The sharp declines on Wall Street come as theater operators struggle to grapple with massive changes in the industry.Domestic ticket sales have rebounded from the record lows posted during the Covid pandemic, but remain about 25% below the the record-breaking $11.8 billion collected in 2018. The 2025 box office fell short of the $9 billion analysts had projected heading into the year, signaling to industry watchdogs that post-pandemic hurdles could be more permanent than anticipated.\"In an environment where consumer spending headwinds and economic concerns forced consumers to be choiceful with their entertainment spending, streaming services continue to represent an attractive option,\" Eric Wold, executive director of equity research at Texas Capital Securities, told CNBC.At the same time that consumer habits have shifted toward the home entertainment market, Hollywood is producing fewer films. A combination of Wall Street penny-pinching, studio mergers and lingering production shutdowns from the pandemic and dual labor strikes has led to a significant drop-off in the number of movies hitting theaters. \"I think investors are still struggling with, and frankly, what everyone within the industry is still trying to figure out is, what is the real new normal for box office?\" said Robert Fishman, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson.The winnowing of theatrical has left IMAX ahead of the pack. Move toward premiumWhen the theatrical slate is thin, IMAX benefits, because when moviegoers do decide to leave their couches they are opting more and more for premium large format experiences.In 2025, more than 16% of tickets sold for domestic showtimes were for these types of theaters, according to data from EntTelligence. That's up from 15% in 2024 and 13.8% in 2023. Often called PLFs, premium large format auditoriums are considered an elevated viewing experience, with bigger screens and higher-quality sound systems and seating options — and they come with higher ticket prices. In 2025, general movie tickets averaged $13.29 apiece, while PLF tickets went for around $17.65 each, EntTelligence data showed. For comparison, premium tickets in 2024 averaged around $16.88 apiece. As Hollywood shifts toward producing more big-budget blockbuster features — while medium-to-low budget films are more often sent to streaming — PLF screens will become increasingly important.After all, the films that benefit the most from PLF ticket sales have been Hollywood's biggest releases, as audiences want to see explosive action movies and dazzling spectacles in the most state-of-the-art locations. ScreenX is the world's first multi-projection cinema with an immersive 270 degree field of view.CJ 4DPLEXOn the docket for 2026 is Disney's \"Star Wars: The Mandalorian and Grogu,\" Universal and Christopher Nolan's \"The Odyssey,\" Netflix and Greta Gerwig's \"Narnia\" and Warner Bros. and Denis Villeneuve's \"Dune: Part Three.\" All of these films were shot with IMAX film cameras and will have theatrical releases on IMAX screens. The company has forecast its 2026 global box office haul at a new record of $1.4 billion. \"We see no signs of slowing down given a very promising slate ahead and the consistency of our market share gains, as filmmakers, studios, and audiences worldwide continue to gravitate toward the IMAX experience,\" said Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, in a statement Wednesday.As of the end of September, IMAX had more than 1,700 locations and a backlog of 478 contracts to build IMAX screens. Notably, IMAX screens represent less than 1% of the total movie screens worldwide.Putting up profitsAMC, Cinemark and Marcus all have premium large format movie screens as part of their suite of theaters as well and have invested in creating more of these spaces in their cinemas. But the chains are playing a game of catchup. AMC, in addition to its existing partnership with IMAX, has plans to add more Dolby Cinema theaters to its U.S.-based locations as well as Screen X and 4DX auditoriums globally. Cinemark, too, made investments in the last year to add more Screen X theaters to its portfolio.Of course, these upgrades can be expensive. In the case of AMC, previous renovations prior to the pandemic saddled the company with billions in debt, which was exacerbated during Covid-related shutdowns. The company is still dealing with this debt load.Working in IMAX's favor is the fact that the company is notably asset-light, meaning it has minimized its ownership of physical assets like buildings by leveraging its technology and partnering with other companies. Instead of costly real estate leases, IMAX makes deals with cinema chains to install its equipment into their auditoriums and then takes a share of the box office receipts for films screened in those theaters.AMC, Cinemark, Marcus and other theater operators, on the other hand, have the financial burden of rent and utility payments, which are only partially offset by ticket sales that they split with studios. Concessions — popcorn, soda and specialty food — have become the means for these businesses to drum up enough funds to cover expenses.But, if the production slate isn't strong and cinemas don't have enough content to draw in moviegoers, then profitability is at risk. In the first quarter of 2025, all three cinema stocks posted net losses. Marcus and Cinemark rebounded to profitability in the second and third quarter, as the calendar of films improved, while AMC posted two more periods in the red.IMAX, on the other hand, was profitable in all three quarters. Through the first nine months of 2025, IMAX reported net income of $43 million, up 67% from the same period in 2024. The theater stocks will all report fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks as earnings reports roll out. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Jan. 6, 2026.Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.Wall Street goes shopping in the Sun BeltThose concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. \"While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation,\" analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. \"Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase,\" BTIG said in a note. Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

    "body": "A Rolls-Royce aircraft engine on view during the Hannover Messe industrial trade fair on March 31, 2025.Ronny Hartmann | Afp | Getty ImagesRolls-Royce shares have hit fresh record highs every single trading day so far this year, as the aerospace and defense firm reaps benefits from multiple directions – from its exposure to defense, to its thriving power systems business and a wider FTSE 100 rally.The broad theme for the company has lately been one around defense, and that has swept up the stock, leading to a nearly 1,200% gain over the past five years. Shares rose as much as 1.2% in early trading, building on a 10% rise in 2026, however it is still trailing other European defense stocks such as Rheinmetall, Leonardo, Saab and BAE Systems as geopolitical tensions stir markets.Early 2026 saw the U.S. conducting a large-scale attack on Venezuela, capturing its leader Nicolas Maduro, as well as subsequent talk about President Donald Trump wanting to take control over Greenland, followed by big moves in defense stocks. But Rolls-Royce isn't simply a defense company. Its defense business only accounts for about 25% of underlying revenue, and barely grew year-on-year in its last reported half-year results. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRolls-Royce stock continued it's multi-year rally in 2026.\"Interestingly, in the short term, where we see the impact of [defense] growth show up is not in our defense business, it's actually in our power systems business, which has a governmental cycle, and we've got a leading position in land and naval defense there, and they tend to work in shorter cycles,\" CFO Helen McCabe told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" in July.Its power systems segment, which manufactures engines for ships and submarines, also houses its data centers business, which McCabe said had \"huge potential,\" with order intake increasing by 85% year-on-year.watch nowRolls-Royce's largest business by revenue, the civil aerospace unit which makes jet engines for commercial aircraft like Boeing and Airbus, is a long-term turnaround story, said UBS analyst Ian Douglas-Pennant on Friday, as he hiked his price target on the stock to 1,625p from 1,350p.The price target increase was due to upgraded expectations for growth in power generation sales 2028 to 26% from 20% for 2024-2028, Douglas-Pennant said, citing accretive data center sales. With the upgraded sales outlook, profitability (earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT) in the power business could increase by as much as 60% by 2028, he added.Rolls-Royce has an emerging business of energy generation and in June received government backing to build the U.K.'s first small modular nuclear reactor.One potential concern for investors is that with the spike in share price, the stock's price-to-earnings ratio for the coming 12 months has reached over 36, according to LSEG, a valuation higher than most of its peers.Investors are now looking ahead to full-year results slated for Feb. 26, and will closely monitor news on its upcoming share buyback program, announced in December.— CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report",

    "body": "Members of law enforcement investigate the scene after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, agent fatally shot a woman in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jan. 7, 2026.Stephen Maturen | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA Minnesota law enforcement agency said Thursday that the FBI is blocking the agency from accessing evidence related to the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good on Wednesday by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on a residential street in Minneapolis.The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the FBI's stance came at the behest of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Minnesota and was a reversal of an initial agreement that the BCA would conduct a joint investigation of Good's killing with the FBI. BCA Superintendent Drew Evans also said the agency has \"reluctantly withdrawn\" from the investigation because of the lack of cooperation from federal officials.\"We expect the FBI to conduct a thorough and complete investigation and that the full investigative file will be shared with the appropriate prosecutorial authorities at both the state and federal levels,\" Evans said.Good was shot by an ICE agent who had positioned himself in front of her SUV as she began driving away from another agent who had grabbed her driver's side door and reached inside in an apparent attempt to pull her out of the vehicle. Good seconds earlier had been ordered by an ICE agent to exit the vehicle, which was stopped in the middle of a road that an ICE truck was driving down.The apparent reversal by federal law enforcement authorities came as the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, has accused Good, a 37-year-old mother, of engaging in domestic terrorism and of intentionally trying to run down ICE agents with her SUV.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other Democrats have blasted those claims, saying video of the shooting contradicts the narrative being promoted by DHS, Vice President JD Vance, and others.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, speaking at a press conference Thursday, said the BCA has \"not been cut out\" of the probe.\"They don't have any jurisdiction in this investigation,\" Noem said.Walz said Thursday, \"I think it's clear to everyone, as they saw this, that it feels now that Minnesota has been taken out of the investigation.\"\"It feels very, very difficult that we will get a fair outcome, and I say that only because people in positions of power have already passed judgment, from the president to the vice president to Kristy Noem, have stood and told you things that are verifiably false, verifiably inaccurate,\" Walz said at a press conference.A person visits a makeshift memorial for Renee Nicole Good, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Jan. 8, 2026. Good was shot and killed on Jan. 7 by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent as she apparently tried to drive away from agents who were crowding around her car.Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesIn a statement, Evans said that shortly after Good was shot, the BCA consulted with \"the Hennepin County  Attorney's Office, the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI.\"\"It was decided that the BCA Force Investigations Unit would conduct a joint investigation with the FBI. The BCA responded promptly to the scene and began coordinating investigative work in good faith,\" Evans said.\"Later that afternoon, the FBI informed the BCA that the U.S. Attorney's Office had reversed course: the investigation would now be led solely by the FBI, and the BCA would no longer have access to the case materials, scene evidence or investigative interviews necessary to complete a thorough and independent investigation,\" Evans said.\"Without complete access to the evidence, witnesses and information collected, we cannot meet the investigative standards that Minnesota law and the public demands,\" he said. \"As a result, the BCA has reluctantly withdrawn from the investigation.\"\"If the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI were to reconsider this approach and express a willingness to resume a joint investigation, the BCA is prepared to reengage in support of our shared goal of public safety in Minnesota,\" he said.— CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this story.",

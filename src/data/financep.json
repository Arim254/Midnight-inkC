    "body": "Mateusz Slodkowski | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix announced a 10-for-1 stock split Thursday, a move that changes nothing fundamentally about the company, but could make the pricey individual shares more accessible to the retail investor.Existing shareholders as of Nov. 10 will receive nine additional shares for each one they hold. They'll get that allotment on Nov. 14, and the stock will begin trading at the new post-split price on Monday, Nov. 17.Netflix, the streaming leader whose shares have boomed over the last three years to above $1,000 apiece, said it was making the change to \"reset the market price of the Company's common stock to a range that will be more accessible to employees who participate in the Company's stock option program.\"Netflix shares added more than 2% after hours on the split announcement. The stock closed Thursday at $1,089 a share, up 42% for the year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNetflix, 5 yearsThe stock is currently one of 10 stocks in the S&P 500 with a price above $1,000. It's common practice for companies that reach those levels to split the shares, although the effectiveness of such a move is debatable with the widespread use of fractional trading available on brokerage platforms.A split simply gives each holder more shares at a lower price, while the value of their holding does not change at all. All fundamental measures for the company remain the same. Warren Buffett has famously refused to split the shares of Berkshire Hathaway for this reason, with the stock priced at more than $717,000 a share. Buffett did create a 'B' class of shares that are more modestly priced at $478 each.Netflix has split its shares twice before, in 2015 and 2004.",

This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.\"YouTube added that \"despite our best efforts, we have not been able to reach a fair deal.\"More than 20 channels, including ABC and ESPN, and Disney content recordings will be removed from YouTube TV.The two sides have been engaged in contract negotiations but were unable to reach a new distribution agreement before it expired Oct. 30 at 11:59 p.m. ET.YouTube TV pays broadcasters to stream their channels. The news comes after another dispute YouTube TV had with NBCUniversal last month, which the companies resolved after a temporary extension to avoid a content blackout.\"We know how disruptive it is to lose channels you enjoy, and we're committed to continuing to work with Disney to reach an agreement,\" YouTube said in its statement, adding that if the content is unavailable for an extended period of time, the company will offer members a $20 credit. Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Disney had been the first to warn about the potential removal of its content from YouTube's platform last week.YouTube is America's leading media distributor in terms of audience engagement, capturing over 13% of TV watch-time in July, according to Nielsen.",

    "body": "An aerial view of homes in a neighborhood on Aug.27, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate this week, mortgage rates responded by doing just the opposite.The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped 20 basis points since Chairman Jerome Powell announced the cut on Wednesday and held a news conference, according to Mortgage News Daily.This happened the last time the Fed lowered its rate as well, and the reason is pretty simple: the bond market had already priced in a cut, but it didn't like the commentary from Powell.On Tuesday, the average rate on the 30-year fixed had fallen to 6.13%, matching the recent low on Sept. 16, which was the day before the Fed announced its last cut, and marking the lowest level in a year.Then this week, after the Fed said it would reduce rates and Powell answered questions in a news conference, that rate shot up 14 basis points on Wednesday and rose another 6 basis points on Thursday, to 6.33%, an even 20 basis points higher than where it was Tuesday. The last time around in September, the rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage went even higher, to 6.37%.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The market's enthusiasm for 3 Fed rate cuts in 2025 had grown a bit too large for the Fed's liking,\" said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily, in a client note. \"The market was nearly 100% certain of another cut in December. The Fed was not as certain, and Powell made it a point to say so yesterday. The result is a mild re-set in yields back to levels that are more consistent with a December cut being a solid possibility, but not a full lock.\" The recent drop in rates had caused a run on refinances, with those applications up 111% last week year over year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Lower rates did not, however, move the needle much for potential homebuyers.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025. Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces if not the most difficult challenge of his time in office at least the trickiest in his final months as head of the all-powerful U.S. central bank.Fresh off his surprisingly tough talk Wednesday on the potential for another interest rate cut in December, Powell will have to steer his way through a suddenly contentious atmosphere among policymakers that will make whichever direction the Fed chooses divisive.While it's not the existential economic threat posed by the Covid pandemic in 2020, it nevertheless indicates a level of peril uncommon for the institution.\"December could get messy,\" Bank of America economist Aditya Bhave said in a client note. \"We still think the Fed won't cut rates again under Chair Powell. But barring a clear signal in either direction from the data, the December decision will likely be even more contentious than October.\"The Fed on Wednesday approved a widely anticipated quarter percentage point rate reduction that took its benchmark rate down to 3.75%-4%. However, Powell warned that another cut in December \"is not a foregone conclusion,\" something the market was not expecting.While Wall Street economists and strategists were split over whether the committee will in fact approve another reduction at the Dec. 9-10 meeting, they were in agreement that this is a pivotal moment for Powell and the legacy he ultimately will leave when his term runs out in May.\"Even in a situation without much additional data due to the shutdown, it can actually make sense to push against market pricing to keep optionality going forward,\" wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley. \"A 95% probability assigned to a December cut does not seem consistent with a data-dependent Fed.\"Markets reactFor their part, traders weren't buying the hawkish rhetoric. Fed fund futures pricing Thursday still indicated a 75% probability of a cut in December, though that was down from around 90% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.But Powell went to great lengths in his post-meeting news conference Wednesday to dispel the notion that the reduction, which would be the third since September, is a slam dunk.The thrust of his argument was multi-pronged: What data there is available during the government shutdown blackout has largely showed a stable economy though the labor market is a risk; inflation is still above target; and, in an unusual development, there are \"strongly differing\" views on the FOMC for where policy should move.Markets were clearly caught off guard by the move, with stocks slipping and Treasury yields surging. The 10-year Treasury yield was solidly above 4% Thursday while the policy-sensitive 2-year note climbed over 3.6% to its highest level in about a month.\"The reaction of the bond market should certainly give Fed officials pause,\" wrote Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research and coiner of the term \"bond vigilantes\" to describe buyers' strikes in the fixed income markets. \"The bond market isn't buying the Fed's cover story that interest rates were too restrictive.\"For Powell, the statement regarding December was an unusual step considering markets had been expecting a more neutral tone. Asked whether he was bothered by the strong anticipation of another cut, Powell said markets should take his statement that a reduction \"is not a foregone conclusion\" should be \"taken on board.\"\"You've got get right in front of that, because you don't want to surprise the market a couple weeks down the road. Now is the time to do it,\" said Dan North, senior economist for North America at Allianz Trade. \"He doesn't usually use words quite so forcefully. So that was interesting, and he's clearly trying to squash speculation about December. We feel the same way, December is going to be a pause.\"Political overhangThe developments come at a ticklish time for the Fed.Powell, a favorite target for President Donald Trump's criticism, has only seven months or so left in his term. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has been busy interviewing potential successors — among them current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, both of whom voted in favor of the cut.In addition, Governor Stephen Miran, a hand-picked Trump appointee who will only serve through January, again dissented from the vote in favor of a half-point.At the other end of the spectrum, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" as well, but because he wanted to not cut. Between them run a range of views on the normally consensus-driven FOMC.Whether Powell's tip of the hat to the doves reflects merely a courtesy or deeper misgivings about cuts will be central to Fed analysis in the coming weeks.\"While the press conference played out somewhat differently than we expected, we have not changed our Fed forecast and continue to see a December cut as quite likely,\" Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle wrote. \"We suspect that there is substantial opposition on the FOMC to the risk management cuts and that Powell thought it was important to voice other participants' concerns today in his press conference. But we still think that the arguments for a December cut remain intact.\"",

    "body": "A Chipotle logo is displayed on a sign at a shop on June 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill tumbled as much as 19% in trading Thursday after the company cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third straight quarter.Including Thursday's move, the stock has fallen 45% this year, dragging its market value down to roughly $43 billion. At least five Wall Street analysts have cut their price targets for the stock after the report, anticipating investors' displeasure with the burrito chain's shrinking traffic and gloomy outlook.\"It's difficult to call a bottom for sales given the multitude of factors weighing on demand,\" Citi analyst Jon Tower wrote in a research note, revising his price target from $54 to $44 per share.In the third quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.3%, but the chain's traffic fell. While many restaurant chains have suffered in recent years as diners wracked by inflation eat out less, analysts were unsure if the chain's value perception contributed to Chipotle's issues. While its burritos and bowls average about $10, consumers often assume its average prices are closer to the $15 entrees of its fast-casual peers, executives said on the conference call.\"While we knew that traffic had slowed for Chipotle into the fall, we were surprised by the magnitude that was reported last night and the resulting deleverage this produced,\" BTIG analyst Pete Saleh wrote in a note. \"We're admittedly perplexed by how suddenly this traffic weakness came about, and not convinced affordability concerns are the main driver here.\"watch nowCEO Scott Boatwright said on Wednesday's earnings conference call that diners are visiting less frequently, particularly those between the ages of 25 and 35 years old, a key demographic for the company. Same-store sales have worsened so far in October, and the company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will shrink in the fourth quarter and fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year.\"We are very concerned that the menu and marketing actions taken so far have not sufficiently offset the traffic retraction,\" Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo said.Still, most analysts attributed the slowdown to industrywide challenges, not company-specific issues that Chipotle needs to address. Unemployment, increased student loan repayments and slower real wage growth accounting for inflation are weighing on consumers' spending, according to Boatwright.\"We believe the brand remains fundamentally healthy (stable share of customer restaurant wallet) and expect a return to growth as the macro improves,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a note to clients.Chipotle's weak performance bodes poorly for its fast-casual peers, like Sweetgreen and Cava. Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Harbour called fast-casual restaurants \"This Season's Halloween Scare\" in his research note covering Chipotle's earnings report.Shares of Sweetgreen fell 6% in trading Thursday, while Cava stock was down 8%. Both are slated to report their third-quarter results next week.Correction: The company is now projecting that sales at restaurants open at least a year will fall by a low-single digit percentage for the full year. An earlier version misstated the percentage move.",

Reddit generated international third-quarter sales of $105 million, ahead of the $104 million that StreetAccount projected.Reddit's \"Other revenue\" category, which includes the company's data licensing business, rose 7% year-over-year to $36 million. Google and OpenAI are the some of Reddit's biggest data licensing partners.The company said global daily active uniques for the third quarter grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing analyst estimates of 114 million.Reddit's logged-in DAUq for the U.S., its most lucrative region, rose 7% year-over-year to 23.1 million during the third quarter. That was slower than the 12% year-over-year jump Reddit recorded during the second quarter when logged-in DAUq for the U.S. was 22.9 million. This the fifth quarter in a row in which the company sees its U.S. logged-in user growth slow.The company's third-quarter global logged-in DAUq rose 14% year over year to 50.2 million, while its global logged-out DAUq jumped 24% to 65.8 million.Investors have been watching for any changes to Reddit's user growth amid Google increasingly debuting generative AI features like AI Overview, which provides summaries to search questions. Reddit has seen a wave of users come to its platform from Google, and the social media company makes more advertising-related money from users who create accounts.Reddit CEO Steve Huffman told analysts on Thursday that the company is not currently seeing any major traffic from AI-powered chat apps.\"I'm looking forward to continuing to work on these things with these partners, but they're not a major traffic driver today,\" he said. \"But I think there's plenty of opportunity there as we continue to work together.\"In response to an analyst's question about how Reddit plans to convince more people to create accounts and routinely use its app, Huffman reiterated previous comments about improving the platform's user experience.The company is working on \"making sure there are no barriers\" preventing users from seeing relevant content based on their interests, Huffman said.\"The biggest driver of retention is following subreddits that are relevant to your interests,\" he said. \"It's not rocket science.\"Reddit Chief Operating Officer Jen Wong said that the company is increasingly running performance-marketing campaigns intended to attract more users, particularly those overseas, who may not be aware of the platform. Although the company has not historically relied on marketing to obtain new users, Wong said the promotions will help in countries \"where our awareness and consideration is lower than in the U.S., because we're newer.\"\"We saw an increase in Reddit app installs as a result of a brand campaign, which I think is good,\" Wong said. \"And we saw movement in brand awareness and consideration, which I think was also positive and provides a foundation for performance later.\"Google and Meta both reported their third-quarter earnings on Wednesday in which both tech giants surpassed Wall Street expectations.WATCH: Looking to see if Meta AI can reach consumer scale.watch now",

    "body": "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie speaks during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall on Oct. 23, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSan Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who was recently thrust into a national debate about the safety of big cities, told CNBC on Thursday that he feels \"pressure every day\" to continue improving conditions for residents. Last week, President Donald Trump reversed plans for a \"federal surge\" in San Francisco. The potential National Guard deployment hit the headlines when Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to the city.Benioff's sentiments were supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump administration. Benioff quickly backtracked as criticism mounted. Unlike California Governor Gavin Newsom, Lurie has tried to avoid clashing with Trump since taking office in January. But he has spoken up to say that the city is progressing on business development and crime, often citing data to back up his claims.In Thursday's interview, Lurie's first on television since the Trump incident, the mayor said there's plenty of hard work ahead.\"I felt that pressure in January, I feel it today,\" Lurie said, when asked about support from tech leaders. \"I think they understand... when San Francisco is strong, America is strong.\" watch nowLurie, a moderate Democrat, pointed to an array of data that show the city is making progress on a post-pandemic comeback, largely driven by the boom in investment and usage of artificial intelligence. CBRE data on venture funding show 2025 is expected to surpass the record reached in 2021, thanks in large part to AI investments in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. In addition, crime rates are down 30% from 2024, as event bookings and tourism are up, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is getting hot.\"We have a lot of competition out there in the world, and we are on the rise,\" Lurie said. \"Anything that would have hindered that rise is something that we don't need.\"Lurie is also leveraging philanthropic commitments to work with the city in cleaning up streets and supporting small businesses. He shared on CNBC Thursday that the San Francisco Downtown Development Corporation has now raised $50 million for this effort, up from the $40 million at launch. The goal is to spark a comeback, with the help of the tech boom in the city, but one that paves the way for all businesses to thrive, he said.\"What we're trying to build here is a broad-based recovery at City Hall,\" Lurie said. \"Our job is to create the conditions so that not only these [tech] companies can succeed, but our restaurants and small businesses can succeed. We're stripping away red tape. We're telling everybody that we're open for business. We want you here, and we want you to be part of the community.\" ",

    "body": "Chinese-made automobiles and construction machinery are assembled and shipped for export at Yantai Port in Yantai City, Shandong Province, China, on October 21, 2025.  Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's manufacturing activity in October contracted more than expected, shrinking to the lowest level in six months, an official survey showed on Friday, as trade tensions with Washington reignited during the month.The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 49.0, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed, missing economists' expectations for 49.6 in a Reuters poll. A reading above the 50 benchmark indicates growth while one below that suggests contraction. The latest reading reversed the recovery in recent months, after the PMI rose to a six-month high of 49.8 in September, compared to 49.4 in August and 49.3 in July.The sub-indexes tracking production, new orders, raw material inventory and employment all sunk further into contraction, official data showed, pointing to a deeper manufacturing slowdown and softer demand.The non-manufacturing PMI, covering construction and services, ticked up to 50.1, boosted by the renewed momentum in air and railway transportation, accommodation, cultural and sports-related entertainment activities. October saw an eight-day Golden Week holiday that ran from Oct. 1 to 8.The NBS composite manufacturing and non-manufacturing PMI dipped to 50, its lowest level since December 2022, according to Wind Information.Huo Lihui, NBS chief statistician, attributed the slowdown to the weeklong holiday that shuttered most factories in China, and an \"increasingly complex international environment.\" The country's manufacturing activity has remained in contraction since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump's started his tariff campaign, pressuring Chinese factories.China's economy expanded 4.8% in the third quarter, marking the slowest growth in a year. Adding to the constraint on the economy, fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year — the first such decline since pandemic-hit 2020 — according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.Large industrial firms saw their profits surge the most in nearly two years, rising 21.6% in October from the same period a year earlier, as declines in factory-gate prices eased amid Beijing's campaign to rein in a bruising price war and excess capacity.Domestic demand has remained sluggish, with a protracted property slump and soft labor-market conditions eroding households' spending power.China and the U.S. reached a trade truce on Thursday after months of rising tensions, de-escalating the situation that had threatened to push the world's two largest economies into a full-blown trade war.Trump said the U.S. would immediately cut the 20% fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese goods by half, and in turn, Beijing would resume \"massive\" purchases of American soybeans and other farm products. China also agreed to pause its sweeping rare-earth controls for a year while taking steps to stem the flow of precursor chemicals used in fentanyl production. Both sides agreed to suspend fees for one year on ships that dock at each other's ports.But analysts cautioned that the meeting fell short of a comprehensive pact that addressed matters core to the U.S.-China rivalry and other contentious issues, including Taiwan, making the deal vulnerable to another escalation in the delicate detente.\"As the trade negotiation went successfully yesterday, the macro policy in China will likely stay unchanged for the rest of this year,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, expecting more proactive fiscal policy early next year.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Drone view of damage to coastal homes after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Alligator Pond, Jamaica, Oct. 29, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersHurricane Melissa, the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the year, made landfall this week as a Category 5 storm in Jamaica. The strength of the storm means it will likely trigger a full payout from a catastrophe bond designed to provide funds to the island in the event of catastrophic weather events.The $150 million catastrophe bond, structured by Aon, is intended to help the island's people rebuild after natural disasters by providing Jamaica parametric coverage against losses from named storms. The policy took effect this year and lasts through 2027.The government of Jamaica is the first government in the Caribbean region, and the first of any small island state, to independently sponsor a cat bond, according to Aon. Its likely payout demonstrates the value of a unique type of backstop funded by the private markets.In order to trigger the full payment, the storm has to meet a particular strength criteria. The central pressure of the storm must be at or below 900 millibars as its makes landfall and crosses the island nation.A drone view shows an affected area after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Crane Road, Black River, Jamaica, October 30, 2025. Maria Alejandra Cardona | ReutersEarly data from the National Hurricane Center shows Hurricane Melissa's pressure stayed below 900 millibars in several areas. Those readings are in the process of being verified by an independent calculation agent.\"While the final numbers are still being verified, the early signs suggest the transaction is doing what it was designed to do: getting critical funds to the country quickly after a major disaster,\" Chris Lefferdink, Aon's head of insurance-linked securities for North America, said in a statement.  The review process typically takes 2 to 3 weeks, and the earliest possible payout to Jamaica could come in approximately 1 month, according to a spokesperson from Aon.Previous parametric transactions payouts have taken 3 months or more, but for this event Aon used an innovative data source to enable faster payments.The catastrophe bond was placed using the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's \"capital at risk\" program, which is used to transfer the risks associated with natural catastrophes to the capital markets, allowing the country to access funds quickly after a major event.Damaged furniture and debris after Hurricane Melissa made landfall, in Black River, Jamaica, Oct. 30, 2025. Octavio Jones | Reuters\"What you have is a capital provider putting funds in the pool, an insurer putting the coupon for those funds in the pool [and] if the storm hits that criteria, they get the money in a much quicker fashion,\" Aon CFO Edmund Reese told CNBC's Contessa Brewer in an interview.Catastrophe bond and insurance-linked securities were created in the mid 1990s in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's destruction. They've since grown in popularity, with the cat bond market growing by over 50% since the end of 2022 to nearly $55 billion.\"Public-private partnerships like Jamaica's continue to highlight how parametric insurance can deliver rapid, transparent relief in the wake of severe storms,\" Lefferdink said.Jamaica very narrowly missed the requirements necessary to receive a payout from a separate cat bond when Hurricane Beryl battered the island in 2024, resulting in $995 million in damages to homes, crops and infrastructure, according to the National Hurricane Center.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to greet Chinese President Xi Jinping ahead of a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesAmerican shippers were already unhappy about their business outlook after President Donald Trump imposed steep new tariffs on China in April.And they were not feeling much happier on Thursday, even after Trump announced a new trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping.The consensus among U.S. shippers and logistics managers is that the deal is largely rhetoric and that it does not change the substance of the disagreements on trade between the two nations.The note that tariffs on Chinese imports, even after the 10-percentage-point cut announced, remain high enough to put a serious dent on import volume.The effective rate on Chinese imports is still around a minimum of 47% because tariffs are layered on top of each other depending on the physical characteristics of individual imports.Alan Baer, the CEO of the trucking company OL USA, told CNBC on Thursday, \"Uncertainty remains at the forefront of every client conversation as we look out to 2026.\"watch now\"Risk management of inventory levels combined with avoiding tariff variability is a central theme for the first half of 2026,\" Baer said.Before Trump and Xi met in South Korea, the effect of the American president's on-again, off-again tariff threats was seen in U.S. Customs data on containers arriving in the United States from China.\"Apparel has taken the biggest hit so far, with woven apparel down more than 50% and knitted apparel down over 40%,\" said Ben Tracy, vice president of strategic business development at Vizion, which aggregates trade data for logistics managers.\"Furniture and toys show the steepest drops by total volume, falling between 20 to 25%,\" Tracy said on Thursday.New data from Vizion shows that year-to-date, the number of containers shipped from China is 2.9 million, which is 700,000 fewer containers than shipped during the same period in 2024The same data also shows that there are currently 247,000 containers from China on the water headed to the United States. That is about 50,000 fewer containers on the water during the same month in 2024.Fewer containers to ship means lower profits for trucking companies, warehouse firms, and railroads.The markedly lower container volume is reflected in the Logistics Managers' Index, a key metric that tracks inventory levels, warehouse costs, transportation capacity, and pricing.The LMI over the past two months suggests the freight industry might be headed for a recession.LMI authors have said that a negative index trend would need to continue for at least three months it would indicate an actual recession.Jon Gold, vice president of supply chain and customs policy at the National Retail Federation, said that the deal announced by Trump, which cuts so-called fentanyl tariffs on Chinese imports from 20% to 10%, \"certainly provides relief to companies, especially if it leads to further de-escalation of tariffs between the U.S. and China.\"While the tariff rate is still high with the fentanyl and reciprocal tariffs in place, it is a much better alternative we were facing with an additional 100% tariffs,\" Gold said.But he said the remaining tariffs are \"harmful\" and that \"we encourage the administration to continue negotiations with China, as well as other trading partners\" to remove those duties.",

China will buy 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually over the next three years, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox Business in an interview.Harvested soybeans are moved from a grain truck to a storage silo on a farm near Gregory, Arkansas, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.

Trump did not mention TikTok during his comments to reporters aboard Air Force One or in a Truth Social post about the truce with China.",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon shares jumped more than 13% in extended trading Thursday after the company posted third-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations, along with strong growth in its cloud-computing unit.Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $1.95 vs. $1.57 estimatedRevenue: $180.17 billion vs. $177.8 billion estimatedWall Street was also looking at other key revenue numbers:Amazon Web Services: $33 billion vs. $32.42 billion expected, according to StreetAccountAdvertising: $17.7 billion vs. $17.34 billion expected, according to StreetAccountRevenue in Amazon's cloud unit accelerated 20.2% during the quarter, surpassing analysts' expectations of 18.1%. Cloud growth has been a key area of concern for the company, as it faces intensifying pressure from rivals Google and Microsoft, which also reported quarterly results this week.Google's cloud revenue increased 34% during the third quarter, while Microsoft Azure recorded growth of 40%.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement that AWS is \"growing at a pace we haven't seen since 2022\" and touted robust artificial intelligence demand.\"We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we've been focused on accelerating capacity — adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months,\" Jassy said.While Amazon remains the leading provider of cloud infrastructure technology, it's been battling the perception that it's missing out on a flurry of highly lucrative AI deals for cloud services. That concern has weighed on Amazon's stock, which is up roughly 1.6% year to date, trailing its Magnificent Seven peers.The company on Wednesday opened its $11 billion AI data center called Project Rainier, built exclusively to run models from Claude chatbot creator Anthropic.Amazon raised its forecast for capital expenditures this year, saying it now expects to spend $125 billion in 2025, up from its earlier estimate of $118 billion. CFO Brian Olsavsky said that number will likely increase in 2026.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle expects 'significant increase' in capital expenditure in 2026, execs sayMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg defends AI spending: 'We're seeing the returns'Powell says AI is different from dotcom bubble and is major source of economic growthSnowflake says exec shared unauthorized guidance in Instagram street interviewFor the current quarter, Amazon said it expects sales to be $206 billion to $213 billion. The midpoint of the revenue outlook, $209.5 billion, topped estimates of $208 billion, according to LSEG.Operating income is expected to be between $21 billion and $26 billion, compared with analysts' projected $23.8 billion.AI has become a major area of investment across Amazon, including in its retail, cloud, devices and ads businesses. The company is responding to an explosion of interest around generative AI, particularly after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in 2022.While it continues to invest in AI, Amazon has looked to cut costs in other areas. On Tuesday, Amazon said it will lay off 14,000 corporate employees, as part of a push to make the company leaner and less bureaucratic, so it can move faster.Jassy addressed the layoffs during a conference call with investors, saying the announcement wasn't \"financially driven\" or due to AI, \"right now, at least.\"\"It really it's culture,\" Jassy said. \"If you grow, as fast as we did for several years, you know, the size of the businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers.\"Amazon has in recent years shaved its headcount after going on a hiring spree during the pandemic, which caused its corporate and frontline workforces to balloon. The company finished the quarter with about 1.58 million employees, which was a 2% increase from the year ago period.Operating income was flat year over year in the quarter at $17.4 billion. The company said the number reflects its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, reached in September, over the agency's \"deceptive\" Prime signups lawsuit.It also includes about $1.8 billion in severance costs \"primarily related to planned role eliminations,\" the company said.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAmazon year-to-date stock chart.Amazon has introduced Q, a chatbot for businesses, and Bedrock, a generative AI service for cloud customers. Last February, it rolled out a shopping chatbot called Rufus that can answer questions and suggest products.The company said 250 million shoppers have used Rufus this year, with 60% of users \"more likely to complete a purchase\" after interacting with the chatbot.Sales in Amazon's core online stores unit posted solid growth of 10% during the quarter, which includes the results of its Prime Day discount event in July.The company has been navigating uncertainty around President Donald Trump's shifting trade policies, though Jassy told investors last quarter that the tariff increases haven't dented consumer demand or led to significant price increases.Amazon also cited tariffs and trade policy as factors that could make its guidance subject to change.",

    "body": "A Honda sedan moves down the assembly line on Jan. 28, 2025 at the automaker's assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio. Michael Wayland / CNBCGlobal automakers are once again bracing for production disruptions due to a potential shortage of automotive semiconductor chips, this time sparked by the Dutch government amid geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China.Honda Motor became the first known automaker this week to reduce production due to the problem that involves chips from Netherlands supplier Nexperia, which is owned by Chinese company Wingtech Technology Co.The industry was hopeful that a meeting this week between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Asia would provide some relief, but no resolution on the chips issue has been announced.Volkswagen on Thursday reportedly said it has until at least next week before its supplies impact production, while other major automakers have said they are monitoring the situation around the clock, attempting to mitigate disruptions.\"The chip situation from Nexperia, we have a cross-functional 'war room' in the building where I'm sitting that has this as [a] primary job,\" Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa told investors during a quarterly call Thursday. \"And every day we are pushing actions and projects to extend our period. There is a day-by-day management of what is an industrywide global issue.\"U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping shake hands as they depart following a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSuch \"war rooms\" have become a regular practice in the automotive industry amid supply chain disruptions, which have become more common since the Covid pandemic rattled production and deliveries of many parts, including chips, starting in 2020.Several automotive industry insiders confirmed to CNBC that war rooms have been established in their companies, as they look into alternative purchasing methods. They included working with major suppliers in an attempt to find alternative sources as well as buying on the open market.\"Suppliers across the motor vehicle industry are working to understand the potential effects on production and supply continuity,\" MEMA, the largest vehicle supplier association in the U.S., said in an emailed statement. \"Chips and diodes are foundational to automotive components and systems, from infotainment systems to door handles, to steering and braking. Even the absence of a single diode or chip can disrupt the manufacture of vehicles.\" NexperiaThe situation involving Nexperia began late last month, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that tech from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products, sparking alarm in Europe's auto industry.German automakers are especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as \"Tier 1s,\" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association said this week that carmakers were close to closing production lines because of the chip shortage, which comes four years after a shortage of such parts amid the coronavirus pandemic.A close-up view of the Nexperia plant sign in Newport, Wales on April 1, 2022. Matthew Horwood | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"This means assembly line stoppages might only be days away. We urge all involved to redouble their efforts to find a diplomatic way out of this critical situation,\" ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said in a statement.The chips affected are legacy semiconductors used in basic vehicle functions such as windshield wipers and window controls — parts that lack sufficient alternative sources, according to S&P Global Mobility.A Nexperia spokesman referred to a previous statement from the company, which summarized the ongoing situation and said it is seeking an exemption from the export restrictions and working to mitigate the impacts of the decision.A Wingtech spokesperson on Thursday condemned the Dutch government's actions, saying the company \"will robustly defend its rights and use every legal avenue to do so.\"\"Only by restoring full control and ownership rights to the company's rightful shareholders and management, and by ceasing political interference in corporate governance, can the Dutch government begin to repair the damage to its reputation, de-escalate international tension, and safeguard its own and European economic security,\" the spokesperson said via an emailed statement.Fluid situationHonda's production cuts impacts include all of its main North American plants, including large vehicle assembly and supporting facilities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\"We are currently managing an industrywide semiconductor supply chain issue, making strategic adjustments to production as necessary to carefully manage the available supply of parts and meet the needs of our customers,\" Honda said Thursday in an emailed statement, calling it a \"fluid\" situation.The impacts are expected to continue to spread to other automakers if a resolution is not found.Ford Motor CEO Jim Farley last week said the chip problem was at the forefront of conversations when he made a trip to Washington, D.C, earlier this month. He called it a \"political issue,\" saying the company is working with the U.S. and China administrations to resolve it.\"It's an industrywide issue. A quick breakthrough is really necessary to avoid fourth-quarter production losses for the entire industry,\" said Farley, adding that automakers have gotten \"really good\" at maximizing component purchases such as chips following the crisis in 2021.General Motors CEO Mary Barra made similar comments last week, calling it an \"industry issue\" that will hopefully be resolved soon.\"While this has the potential to impact production, we have teams working around the clock with our supply chain partners to minimize possible disruptions. The situation is very fluid and we will provide updates throughout the quarter as appropriate,\" she said during the company's quarterly earnings call.Other automotive executives from Volvo, Mercedes-Benz and more have also shared similar thoughts with investors and the media.\"This is a politically induced situation ... which means that the solution to this, or the resolution to this, resides in the political space, primarily between the United States and China, in this case, with Europe kind of caught in the middle,\" Mercedes-Benz CEO Ola Källenius said Wednesday during an earnings call.",

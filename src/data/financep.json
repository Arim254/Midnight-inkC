    "body": "Toyota display is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCToyota Motor on Wednesday said it has started production at a new $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina and confirmed plans to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years in the United States.The Japanese automaker did not release details about the increased investment other than Toyota Motor North America CEO Tetsuo Ogawa calling it a \"pivotal moment\" in the company's history along with the new battery plant, according to a release.The facility is Toyota's first in-house battery plant outside of Japan. It was first announced in December 2021 amid the Biden administration's push to onshore production of batteries for hybrids and all-electric vehicles.Since then, market conditions for EVs have soured, while demand for hybrids continues to grow exponentially. Those changes are positive for Toyota, which is the U.S. leader in hybrid sales with a more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.It's unclear how much of the investment was already planned but not made previously public, but the announcement follows President Donald Trump last month saying Toyota would invest $10 billion in the U.S.Toyota and the entire automotive industry have been attempting to navigate production plans amid regulatory changes impacting EVs and Trump's litany of tariffs on new vehicles and parts.Toyota's U.S. sales through the third quarter of this year were up 9.9% to more than 1.3 million vehicles sold.",

    "body": "An aerial view of a housing development on Aug. 8, 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesAs the housing market heads into its traditionally slowest season, homebuyers are making one last gasp, likely due to more supply on the market and softening prices.Mortgage applications to purchase a home rose 6% last week to their strongest pace since September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Volume was 31% higher than the same week one year ago.This came despite the fact that the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, increased to 6.34% from 6.31%, with points rising to 0.62 from 0.58, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That rate is 52 basis points lower than it was one year ago.\"Purchase applications for conventional, FHA, and VA loans increased, as potential homebuyers continue to shop around, particularly in markets where inventory has increased and sales price growth has slowed. Based on the unadjusted purchase index for the week, this was the strongest start to November since 2022,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Demand for refinancing, which had been very strong last month, dropped 3% for the week but was still 147% higher than the same week one year ago, thanks to lower rates.\"Higher mortgage rates did quell some refinance activity, as conventional and VA refinance applications declined over the week, and the average loan size for refinances dropped to its lowest level in over a month,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates haven't moved much this week so far, especially given the bond market's Veterans Day closure. Markets are watching the potential end of the government shutdown this week, which could bring a stronger reaction for interest rates.",

ASEAN will not be part of EU, but it doesn't stop [the] EU and ASEAN [to] come together to discuss areas that we can work together.\"Gan did say however, that this will take time, and the two sides will first discuss a digital economic collaboration, \"how we can set out basic rules, and then consider next steps.\"Southeast Asia's digital economy stands at over $300 billion in 2025 in gross merchandise value, according to the 2025 Google e-Conomy SEA report.He said he hoped that ASEAN will have a digital economy agreement with the EU, as well as for the Southeast Asian bloc to work with the Gulf Cooperation Council and the CPTPP to find ways to facilitate trade investment.The CPTPP refers to the 11-member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership that was formed after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership in his first term.\"So I think there are a lot of opportunities still, despite the headwinds and the uncertainties we are seeing.\"Separately, Gan also said that Singapore would like to work with partners to think about how the World Trade Organisation can be transformed.\"WTO is still [an] important foundation for this rules-based trading system,\" he said.\"We will need to transform because the current design architecture of WTO may no longer be workable, and it's important for us to come together to discuss what is the way forward, what are the areas that require transformation,\" Gan added.",

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the New York premiere of \"The Big Short\" at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on Nov. 23, 2015.Jim Spellman | WireImage | Getty ImagesMichael Burry, the investor made famous by \"The Big Short\" who recently roiled the market with a tech short bet, is accusing some of America's largest technology companies of using aggressive accounting to pad their profits from the artificial intelligence boom.In a post Monday on X, the Scion Asset Management founder alleged that \"hyperscalers\" — the major cloud and AI infrastructure providers — are understating depreciation expenses by estimating that chips will have a longer life cycle than is realistic.\"Understating depreciation by extending useful life of assets artificially boosts earnings - one of the more common frauds of the modern era,\" Burry wrote. \"Massively ramping capex through purchase of Nvidia chips/servers on a 2-3 yr product cycle should not result in the extension of useful lives of compute equipment. Yet this is exactly what all the hyperscalers have done.\"Burry estimated that from 2026 through 2028, the accounting maneuver would understate depreciation by about $176 billion, inflating reported earnings across the industry. He singled out Oracle and Meta Platforms, saying their profits could be overstated by roughly 27% and 21%, respectively, by 2028.CNBC has reached out to Oracle and Meta for comments. Nvidia declined to comment. Burry's accusation is a serious one, but could be hard to prove because of the leeway companies are given in estimating depreciation. CNBC was not independently able to confirm this practice was being done by the companies.When paying for a large asset upfront — like semiconductors, servers, etc — a company is then allowed under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, to spread out the cost of that asset as a yearly expense that is based on the company's estimate of how rapidly that asset depreciates in value. If companies estimate a longer life cycle for the asset, they can then lower the yearly depreciation expense that hits the bottom line.Burry, who famously bet against subprime mortgages before the 2008 financial crisis, has warned this year that AI enthusiasm resembles the late-1990s tech bubble.Burry last week revealed seemingly fresh wagers against AI favorites Nvidia and Palantir Technologies. He disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.The disclosure prompted a sharp reaction from Palantir CEO Alex Karp, who called Burry's wagers \"super weird\" and \"bats--- crazy.\" It's not clear whether he still holds those positions or whether they were just a hedge.Shares of Nvidia rebounded nearly 6% on Monday after dropping 7% last week. Palantir saw its shares pop almost 9% on Monday following a 11% sell-off last week. Nvidia was lower again on Tuesday.Burry said in his X post that \"more detail\" was coming on Nov. 25 and that readers should \"stay tuned.\"",

    "body": "watch nowAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he will be leaving his position when his term expires in February.Bostic has been in his current role since June 2017 and is the first Black and openly gay regional president. His term, which also was marked by issues relating to personal investments he made, runs until Feb. 28.\"I'm proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter,\" Bostic said in a statement.The announcement comes ahead of a pivotal year for the Fed and its rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee.Regional presidents serve five-year terms that generally run in sync and are designed to expire on years that end in either 1 or 6, which will be the case next year. While the local boards vote on the presidents, they are subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Normally a routine process, unusual political dynamics on the board could add a new wrinkle to the procedure.In addition to the reappointments of the regional presidents, Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, though his run as governor goes until 2028.Bostic has been seen as more of a centrist during his run, though he's been more cautious about cutting interest rates this year during a time of elevated inflation and a softening labor market. He is not an FOMC voter this year. Atlanta next will get a vote in 2027.Powell said Bostic's \"perspective has enriched the Federal Open Market Committee's understanding of our dynamic economy. And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service — grounded in analysis, informed by experience, and guided by purpose.\"Until the board names a successor, Cheryl Venable, the first vice president and chief operating officer at the Atlanta Fed, will handle the role of president.Bostic's term has not been without controversy.In October 2022, the Fed announced it was looking at trades Bostic made during blackout periods near policy meetings. An internal report showed there were 154 trades made on his behalf during those times. However, the report also indicated there was no evidence Bostic traded on insider information or had personal conflicts.There also were other issues raised regarding financial disclosure terms and an improper level of Treasury holdings.For his part, Bostic expressed regret over the discrepancies and said the trades were executed by third-party managers over whom he did not have control.The controversy was part of a larger issue with investments from Fed officials that triggered tighter internal controls and rules over what types of securities they are permitted to hold.",

Jean Carroll $5 million in damages after holding him liable for sexually abusing her during an encounter in a New York department store in the 1990s and for defaming her decades later.Trump's request on Monday comes nearly 11 months after the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the verdict issued by a civil jury in Manhattan federal court in May 2023.The petition to the Supreme Court says that Judge Lewis Kaplan, who oversaw the trial, made a \"series of indefensible evidentiary rulings,\" among them \"improperly admitting highly inflammatory propensity evidence against President Trump.\"That evidence included testimony by two other women who alleged that Trump committed sexual misconduct against them at other times.The petition also says that Kaplan erred by allowing Carroll's lawyer to play for jurors the notorious \"Access Hollywood\" tape on which Trump is heard bragging about groping women without their prior consent.There is no automatic right to appeal to the Supreme Court. It is not known when the high court will decide whether to take Trump's appeal.Writer Jean Carroll and Republican presidential nominee and former U.S. President Donald Trump look on as Lawyer John Sauer (not pictured) argues for him, as he is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a $5 million jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of raping her nearly three decades ago, in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 6, 2024, in this court sketch.Jane Rosenberg | ReutersCarroll, in a 2019 New York magazine article, first went public with her allegation that Trump raped her in a dressing room of the Bergdorf Goodman department store in the mid-1990s.She sued him for allegedly defaming her in comments he made while flatly denying that allegation after the article appeared.Carroll later filed a separate lawsuit accusing Trump of rape and of defaming her again in late 2022 when he commented on her allegations.That second lawsuit was the subject of the trial that ended in May 2023. Jurors in that case did not find Trump liable for rape, but did find him liable for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her.It is that verdict that Trump has asked the Supreme Court to overturn with the new petition.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks, during the swearing-in ceremony for Sergio Gor as U.S. Ambassador to India, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 10, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | Reuters\"Carroll waited more than 20 years to falsely accuse Donald Trump, who she politically opposes, until after he became the 45th President, when she could maximize political injury to him and profit for herself,\" the petition says.\"Notably, Carroll's allegations are a story that precisely matches the plotline from an episode of one of admittedly her favorite TV shows, 'Law & Order,' \" the petition says.A spokesman for Trump's legal team, in a statement on the petition, said, \"The American People stand with President Trump as they demand an immediate end to all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded travesty of the Carroll Hoaxes.\"\"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he continues to focus on his mission to Make America Great Again,\" the spokesman said.Carroll's lawyer, Roberta Kaplan, declined to comment on the petition.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsThe first defamation lawsuit that Carroll filed against Trump went to trial after the second lawsuit did.In January 2024, a Manhattan federal court jury found Trump liable for defaming Carroll in statements he made as president in 2019 when he denied her claims of rape.That jury ordered him to pay her $83.3 in damages.Trump appealed that verdict.The 2nd Circuit appeals court in September rejected that appeal.\"As observed by the district court, the conduct here supports a significant punitive damages award — it involved malice and deceit, caused severe emotional injury, and continued over at least a five-year period,\" a three-judge panel of the appeals court said in its decision denying Trump's appeal.\"The record in this case supports the district court's determination that the 'the degree of reprehensibility' of Mr. Trump's conduct was remarkably high, perhaps unprecedented,' \" the panel said.Trump has filed a petition with the 2nd Circuit asking that the appeal be reheard by a panel comprised of all active judges on the circuit.",

Marks also highlighted problems at Zions Bancorp, Western Alliance, Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, and the role played by complex lending arrangements.Following the First Brands and Tricolor collapses, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that \"when you see one cockroach, there are probably more.\"Marks, however, does not view the troubles as evidence of a broader systemic malaise within sub-investment grade debt, or the wider private credit markets.\"If one is an isolated instance, and two hint at a pattern, are six an ominous trend?,\" Marks said in a memo published Nov. 6. \"The truth is that there are always defaults … It shouldn't come as a surprise if there are a few dozen defaults in a normal year.\"Instead, the events offer a reminder that higher-yielding credit spreads simply reflect the greater risk attached to lower-rated debt, according to the 79-year-old value investor.Marks said rising markets typically bring greater risk tolerance, fear of missing out and lapses in due diligence, which help create \"fertile soil\" for potential wrongdoing.When earnings and profits are up, negativity is \"easily brushed aside\" and \"the possibility of loss recedes from consciousness\" as investors look to capitalize on the market upswing. Conversely, during a downturn, \"it's the negatives that are exaggerated and the positives that are ignored\" as the pendulum swings back and risk aversion outweighs risk tolerance.\"The key observation is that good times lead to complacency, risk tolerance, and carelessness, as people bid aggressively for assets and compete to make loans. And then, bad times expose the results of that carelessness, as investments that were entered into without an adequate investigation and margin for error fail to hold up in a hostile environment,\" he wrote.watch nowThe rapid demise of First Brands in September drew in financial services firms on both sides of the Atlantic, including Jefferies subsidiary Leucadia Asset Management and UBS O'Connor, the alternative investment unit of UBS.Marks highlighted several red flags underpinning First Brands' implosion, including extensive litigation history, $5 billion of annual sales in just six years of operating history, and \"byzantine\" funding agreements across a complex network of corporate entities and subsidiaries. Bankruptcy filings show First Brands' total obligations stand at $11.6 billion, nearly double the $5.9 billion disclosed earlier this year, Marks said.\"I don't think today's issues are systemic in the sense that there's something wrong with the lending system, or that they will trigger other defaults and lead to a breakdown of the system,\" he said.\"In simpler words, there's nothing wrong with the plumbing ... people who make investments and loans are highly prone to error in good times.\"",

Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesTwo European pioneers of the modern wind power industry are sounding the alarm on the Trump administration's clean energy cutbacks, warning Washington's anti-climate agenda is part of a broader energy transition challenge.Denmark's Henrik Stiesdal and Britain's Andrew Garrad, often referred to as the \"Godfathers of wind\" for their contributions in advancing the design, manufacture and deployment of wind turbines, said Trump's war on wind appears to be a symptom of more widespread climate apathy.Stiesdal is known for framing the early design principles for wind turbines and led the installation of the world's first offshore wind farm in 1991, while Garrad developed computer models to optimize and certify turbine and farm designs.\"I think Trump's approach is symptomatic of a general shift,\" Garrad said, in comments echoed by Stiesdal, one that is opposed to the transition from fossil fuels to renewable technologies, such as wind and solar.\"We are facing right now, a change of mood. We had a very easy beginning, then quite a big struggle, then general acceptance, and now the worm is turning. And that's something which we all have to address,\" Garrad told CNBC.Read moreSince returning to office at the start of the year, U.S. President Donald Trump has actively sought to disrupt the development of high-profile wind projects. His push to wipe out the offshore wind industry has included stop-work orders and the removal of green incentives under former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.\"Trump is symptomatic. I mean an extreme symptom of that, but you can see it I think in all Western countries certainly, perhaps not elsewhere. And that's a big issue,\" Garrad said.\"This isn't just a wind energy problem,\" Garrad said. \"To do this sort of change is a very dangerous thing. And I think it has shown that this is a political business ... It's a personal decision by a politician, who happens to be a rather powerful one — and it has sent shockwaves around the place.\"'Pathetic' and 'expensive'Trump's onslaught against the wind industry has hit the business models of renewable energy giants particularly hard. Denmark's Ortsed, the world's biggest offshore wind farm group, is one notable example.Last week, Orsted reported a net loss of 1.7 billion Danish kroner ($261.8 million) for the July-September period. The result, which was slightly better than analysts feared, was significantly down from profit of 5.17 billion Danish kroner in the same period last year.Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company, which have fallen more than 80% from a 2021 peak, notched a fresh record low in August after the Trump administration ordered the company to halt work on a near complete windfarm.A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish wind turbine firm Vestas has also been battling industry uncertainty, in part because of the Trump administration's policies. When asked about some of these challenges, Vestas CEO Henrik Andersen said the company has a \"well-established\" supply chain in the U.S.\"For us, we see the U.S., both customers and the buildout in the U.S., as some of our core responsibility to help the U.S. with,\" Andersen told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Nov. 5.\"Then sometimes maybe we have to get a bit of a slap that it is not everyone that likes the nature of a wind turbine. But I think, in general, … energy drives decision making and [the] cost of energy drives decision making,\" he added.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) at the United Nations headquarters on September 23, 2025 in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesTrump has repeatedly criticized the deployment of offshore wind turbines, describing them as \"pathetic\" and \"expensive\" in a recent speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\"I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,\" Trump said on Sept. 23. The U.S. president also said climate change is the \"greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.\"Scientists have since condemned Trump's characterization of climate change, pointing out that the overwhelming consensus is that climate change is already happening, with record-breaking heatwaves, flood events and hurricanes causing substantial economic damages across the globe.Energy securityStiesdal, who refused to comment specifically on Trump's war on wind, said there appears to be \"a fundamental misunderstanding\" from those firmly opposed to the energy transition.\"A lot of people who would be inclined to vote for hard-right parties actually benefit both from the job offerings and the cost of their energy from renewables,\" Stiesdal said.\"It's not an easy thing to fight because a lot of it is kind of visceral or fundamental in the thinking about this tribal approach,\" he continued. \"Whenever I am confronted with that, or with discussions about that, I try to emphasize energy security, the job creation, the local beneficial effects of doing renewables and the assurances you get in society.\"King Charles III (centre) poses for a group photo after presenting the 2024 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering to Andrew Garrad C.B.E.

    "body": "The U.S. Capitol building after the U.S. Senate advances a bill to end the government shutdown in Washington, D.C., U.S.,  November 10, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEconomic data releases that have lagged during the government shutdown likely will take some time to get rolling again once Congress is back in business.The reopening could happen as soon as the end of this week once final votes take place and President Donald Trump signs a stop-gap spending bill into law.From there, though, it will take the various agencies, primarily in the departments of Labor and Commerce, to get up and rolling again as it regards data collection and releases. That means likely having to play catch-up for key reports like nonfarm payrolls, the consumer price index, retail sales, spending and income, and a variety of other metrics.\"The shutdown of the federal government has delayed nearly all federal economic data releases for September and October,\" Goldman Sachs economists Elsie Peng and Ronnie Walker said in a client note. \"While the shutdown appears to be nearing its end, it will take time for the statistical agencies to work through the backlog of releases.\"Assuming the government reopens before the end of the week, Goldman figures the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics will put out an updated schedule of releases in the early part of next week.watch nowThe BLS is in charge of the payrolls report as well as the CPI and the producer price index, both of which were scheduled for release this week. Other reports from the bureau include import and export prices, the employment cost index, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.Goldman's economists expect the October jobs report to be released soon after the reopening, possibly next Tuesday or Wednesday. \"But apart from that, we expect other major data releases to be delayed,\" they said.That means the November payrolls and inflation reports could be delayed by \"at least a week,\" Goldman said.For Commerce, among the more relevant reports are personal spending and income, which also includes the Federal Reserve's key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index. Outside of that, there's retail sales, durable goods and the quarterly gross domestic product reading.When the data freeze ends, the reports are likely to show more of the same as far as the economy goes — a slowing labor market, inflation still holding above the Fed's comfort level and broader growth positive but also not gangbusters.Fed officials have noted the inconvenience of not having regular data reports. But Chair Jerome Powell said recently that alternative data shows the central bank really hasn't missed much in terms of the macro picture.\"Although some important federal government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, the public- and private-sector data that have remained available suggest that the outlook for employment and inflation has not changed much since our meeting in September,\" Powell said at an Oct. 29 news conference. \"Conditions in the labor market appear to be gradually cooling, and inflation remains somewhat elevated.\"Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting the October nonfarm payrolls report to show a loss of 60,000 jobs. While Goldman puts the decline at 50,000, the general tenor of data for the month points to a slowdown.Powell said Fed estimates put the key inflation rate at 2.8% for September, which is still considerably above the central bank's 2% target but expected to decelerate gradually through 2026. The official PCE report is scheduled to drop Nov. 26, and it is unknown whether that will be the case.As for the broader economy, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker of incoming data puts third-quarter growth at a 4% rate. Goldman projects fourth-quarter growth of 1.3%, an upward revision of 0.3 percentage point from the prior forecast, putting the full year on pace for a 2% annualized gain.",

Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a foreign cybercriminal group behind a massive SMS phishing, or \"smishing,\" operation.Dubbed by some cyber researchers as the \"Smishing Triad,\" the organization, which Google said is largely based out of China, uses a phishing-as-a-service kit named \"Lighthouse\" to create and deploy attacks using fraudulent texts.The crime group has amassed more than a million victims across 120 countries, Google said in a release.\"They were preying on users' trust in reputable brands such as E-ZPass, the U.S. Postal Service, and even us as Google,\" Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado told CNBC. \"The 'Lighthouse' enterprise or software creates a bunch of templates in which you create fake websites to pull users' information.\"Google brought claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, and is seeking to dismantle the group and the Lighthouse platform.The texts usually contain malicious links to a fake website designed to steal victims' sensitive financial information, including Social Security numbers, banking credentials and more.The messages can often appear in the form of a fake fraud alert, delivery update, unpaid government fee notification, or other seemingly urgent texts.The crime group has stolen approximately between 12.7 million and 115 million credit cards in the U.S. alone, Google said.\"The idea is to prevent its continued proliferation, deter others from doing something similarly, as well as protect both the users and brands that were misused in these websites from future harm,\" DeLaine Prado said.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

Looking deeper under the hood, though, tells a different story.The level of job openings as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for years has shown there are at least as many available positions as there are unemployed workers.But comparing the openings with actual hirings shows that not all those jobs are being filled.Not even close, in fact: Since the beginning of 2024, job openings have outnumbered job hirings by more than 2.2 million a month, according to BLS data. That points to an ongoing problem with \"ghost jobs\" that never seem to get filled.\"The U.S. labor market looks deceptively strong on paper. Millions of openings suggest opportunity, but many are illusions,\" said Jasmine Escalera, career expert at MyPerfectResume, an employment assistance platform that released a report this week on the shadow employment market. \"The ghost job economy inflates hope, wastes job seekers' time and clouds the data [that] policymakers rely on to steer the economy.\"Job openings have generally been on the decline since peaking above 12 million in March 2022, when opportunities outnumbered available workers by better than 2 to 1. In August, the latest month for which data is available because of the government shutdown, openings totaled more than 7.2 million while hires were just 5.1 million. The ratio of vacancies to workers was about even.To be sure, the picture isn't as simple as comparing the two numbers.The postings number represents the total stock of jobs, while hirings are the flow of people hired during a particular month. So a job can get posted across multiple months without being filled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the companies advertising those positions don't intend to hire someone.watch nowPotential inventoryMoreover, some companies will post jobs just to keep an inventory of potential workers for positions that may open in the future.Finally, the openings-to-hire ratio has fallen over the past few years, from 1.8 to 1 at the peak of the job opening cycle to the current level around 1.4 to 1, indicating fewer \"ghost jobs\" out there.One issue affecting the gap: the changing labor pool as the U.S. has tightened its immigration standards.Small business owners report the toughest time filling open positions since the Covid pandemic while noting that 88% of applicants for jobs lack the required skills, according to a National Federation of Independent Business report Tuesday.However, the issue has drawn more serious attention in recent months as the labor market has begun moderating and net hiring has slowed to a crawl. At the same time, official government data is unavailable due to the shutdown in Washington, D.C.Job seekers have become frustrated at not being able to find new positions. Mobility has decelerated, with the \"quits rate\" falling more than 30% from that March 2022 peak of job openings, during what was called the \"Great Resignation.\"A petition on Change.org seeking to clamp down on companies advertising ghost jobs has garnered nearly 50,000 signatures.There are real impacts on a policy level: Federal Reserve officials watch BLS job openings numbers closely for clues about how tight the labor market is, so having unreliable data clouds their vision.\"For job seekers, that means wasted time. For policymakers, it means distorted data. For employers, it raises serious credibility issues,\" Escalera said. \"Until postings more accurately reflect actual hiring, workers will continue to chase jobs that don't exist, and trust in the labor market will erode.\"",

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Tuesday extended until late Thursday night a pause in a federal judge's order that the Trump administration pay full SNAP benefits for November.The two-day delay, which was objected to by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, gives Congress time to pass a short-term funding bill that would reopen the U.S. government, which has been shut down since Oct. 1, and fund the SNAP program that provides 42 million Americans with food stamps.The Trump administration had argued in a filing Monday with the Supreme Court that the tangled legal dispute over the benefits could soon be rendered moot by Congress passing that bill this week.If the bill is approved, and SNAP benefits start flowing as normal, that would remove the justification for lawsuits demanding that they continue during the shutdown.The House of Representatives is expected to start voting on the Senate-approved bill on Wednesday afternoon, and President Donald Trump has indicated he would sign that bill.U.S. District Court for Rhode Island Judge Jack McConnell last Thursday ordered the administration to pay the full SNAP benefits, rejecting the administration's plan to pay just 65% of that aid. The administration originally planned to not pay any benefits during November despite $4.6 billion being available for that purpose from a contingency fund.McConnell directed federal officials to use not only the contingency fund, but also to use about $4 billion in funds from the Children's Nutrition Program to help pay for the full benefits, which the administration had refused to do.A federal appeals court in Boston upheld McConnell's order, but a short-term stay imposed by Justice Jackson blocked the order. That stay was due to expire on Tuesday night.In its order on Tuesday extending the stay by two days, the Supreme Court said that the administration's application for a longer-term stay of the order pending an appeal had been referred to the full court for consideration.The court said that the stay will remain in effect until 11:59 p.m. ET Thursday.Tuesday's order by the court noted that Jackson had said that she would \"deny the request for extension of the administrative stay and would deny the application.\" There was no written dissent by Jackson explaining her objection.New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state had sued the administration in another case to compel full SNAP benefits payments during the shutdown, in a statement said, \"This decision means millions of Americans will once again be left wondering how they will feed their families.\"\"We hope to see an end to this suffering soon, as the government reopens and SNAP is once again fully funded. In the meantime, any New Yorkers who have received their November SNAP benefits should not be afraid to use them.\"",

(Photo by Indranil Aditya/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesIndia's consumer inflation cooled to 0.25% in October, strengthening hopes of more policy easing by the Reserve Bank of India.The headline inflation number was below estimates of a 0.48% rise, according to a Reuters poll of economists, and easing more than the 1.54% recorded in September.In October, the central bank revised its inflation forecast to 2.6% from 3.1% for the fiscal year ending March 2026, but kept its key policy rate unchanged at 5.The decline in headline inflation and food inflation in October is mainly attributed to impact of decline in GST (goods and services tax), favorable base effect and to a drop in inflation of oils and fats, vegetables, fruits, egg, footwear, cereals and products, transport and communication, according to the release.The effects of the Reserve Bank of India's outsized 50-basis-point rate cut in June have yet to filter through the economy, Governor Sanjay Malhotra had said then, adding that the decision to hold rates steady was unanimous.However, the RBI had also hinted that the Indian economy could \"see growth decelerate\" in the second half of the fiscal year 2026 due to global trade uncertainties.\"Inflation is likely to rise going into the next year and settle at around 4% for fiscal year 2026,\" Anubhuti Sahay, head of India economic research at Standard Chartered, told CNBC in a telephone interview. She added that the central bank may choose to save its \"ammunition\" for cutting interest rates.\"There is no urgency for [a] rate cut in December, when the monetary policy committee meets, as growth is holding up and transmission of earlier rate cuts is still underway,\" Sahay said.In August, the U.S. imposed an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising total duties to as high as 50%, among the steepest imposed by Washington on its trading partners. Textiles, gems and jewelry, and marine products have been hit hardest.While exports to the U.S. account for around 2% of India's GDP, these sectors are labor-intensive. Prolonged weakness could lead to job losses and weigh on overall growth.To cushion the blow, New Delhi reduced the goods and services tax on several items on Sept. 22, to spur domestic demand ahead of a month-long festive season, lowering prices for consumer goods, vehicles, and farm products.The auto and jewelry sectors have performed well, while the pickup in demand for footwear, paints, fast-moving consumer goods, and textiles has been mixed, Indian brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a research report on Nov 7.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump hosts a bilateral lunch with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban (not pictured) at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 7, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has doled out dozens of executive clemency grants in the past few weeks alone, issuing pardons and commutations to major business figures, political supporters and other allies.Some hope he's just getting started.Trump started wielding his presidential mercy powers aggressively on the first day of his second term, when he pardoned roughly 1,500 people who were charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. Presidential pardons erase federal criminal convictions, while commutations shorten or cancel prison sentences, and sometimes related fines.In subsequent months, clemency recipients have included a slew of well-known names, including former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, ex-Hunter Biden business partner Devon Archer, Nikola founder Trevor Milton, reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, disgraced former U.S. Rep. George Santos and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao.On Monday, Trump granted largely symbolic pardons to more than six dozen people who were involved in efforts to overturn his loss to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, U.S. pardon attorney Ed Martin revealed on social media. The people included in the batch of pardons are not facing federal charges related to the 2020 election. The presidential pardon power does not extend to state-level prosecutions.That group includes Rudy Giuliani, Trump's onetime personal lawyer and former New York City mayor, as well as his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.Some recipients of Trump's clemency, including multiple people involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, have since been charged with new crimes.The Department of Justice's Office of the Pardon Attorney has a formal process for people to apply for clemency, and the agency has established standards for considering petitions. But Trump's White House has reportedly taken over much of the process, including by appointing a former clemency recipient, Alice Johnson, as the administration's \"pardon czar.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsPrior presidents have been accused of misusing their clemency powers, including Biden, whose last-minute pardons for his family members and preemptive pardons for others generated bipartisan condemnations.But Trump's approach, which has at times favored famous figures and those who have heaped praise upon him, has spurred unique criticism.\"It's like a celebrity pardon-a-thon,\" John Yoo, a former George W. Bush administration official, told The Washington Post in June.It has also given rise to a cottage industry of lawyers and lobbyists who are charging steep fees to help their clients seek Trump's clemency, the online publication NOTUS reported.Trump pulled back on the pardons over the summer, after White House officials grew concerned about the efforts to profit off the process, NBC News reported last month. But the raft of clemency actions in recent weeks suggests that Trump does not currently share those concerns.That could be good news for a number of high-profile figures who have been eyed as possible candidates for pardons or commutations from Trump.Based on public reports and the president's own remarks, here's who that list might include:Ghislaine MaxwellGhislaine Maxwell on September 20, 2013 in New York City.Laura Cavanaugh | Getty ImagesThe House Judiciary Committee's Democratic minority on Monday shared \"whistleblower information\" that Maxwell, the longtime accomplice of notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, is preparing a \"commutation application\" for the Trump administration.Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for acting as a procurer of teenage girls for Epstein. The Supreme Court in early October declined to take up Maxwell's appeal of her conviction.She \"has good reason to believe\" that she \"may receive the extraordinary grant of clemency from you,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the committee's ranking member, accused Trump in a letter seeking answers from him.\"Feigning ignorance and distancing yourself from the situation, you have pointedly refused to rule out clemency for her,\" Raskin wrote to Trump.Trump has given ambiguous answers when asked on multiple occasions about that possibility of pardoning Maxwell.Asked on Oct. 6 if he was considering a pardon for her, Trump said, \"I haven't heard the name in so long. I can say this, that I'd have to take a look at it. I would have to take a look.\"\"I will speak to the DOJ,\" Trump said when asked to clarify if he was considering it. \"I wouldn't consider it or not consider — I don't know anything about it.\"A White House spokeswoman, in response to the whistleblower claims shared Monday, told NBC that it \"does not comment on potential clemency requests.\"\"As President Trump has stated, pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell is not something he has thought about,\" the spokeswoman said.Lauren Hersh, national director of anti-trafficking group World Without Exploitation, said in a statement Tuesday that Maxwell's sentence \"should be upheld like anyone else's.\"\"To now entertain a commutation would sadly send a clear message to survivors of her crimes — and to countless others who have been victimized sexually — that her power outweighs truth and that the justice owed to survivors can be denied,\" Hersh said.DiddySean \"Diddy\" Combs sits with his lawyers Brian Steel, and Alexandra Shapiro during a court sentencing, after the music mogul was convicted on charges of transporting prostitutes to engage in drug-fueled sexual performances, in New York City, U.S., Oct. 3, 2025 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | ReutersMusic mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' path to clemency currently appears narrow at best.Combs was sentenced to more than four years behind bars in early October over his conviction on two prostitution-related charges.After his conviction, Combs' lawyers reached out to Trump to seek a pardon, a member of his legal team told CNN.\"It's my understanding that we've reached out and had conversations in reference to a pardon,\" attorney Nicole Westmoreland told the news outlet.Trump said in an Aug. 1 interview with Newsmax that he was leaning against pardoning Combs.On Oct. 6, Trump confirmed that Combs' team had reached out.\"A lot of people have asked me for pardons. I call him 'Puff Daddy,' [he] has asked me for a pardon,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.After TMZ reported on Oct. 20 that Trump was considering commuting Combs' sentence, the White House pushed back, calling the story false.Elizabeth HolmesFormer Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes alongside her boyfriend Billy Evans, walks back to her hotel following a hearing at the Robert E. Peckham U.S. Courthouse on March 17, 2023 in San Jose, California.Philip Pacheco | Getty ImagesElizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, in late 2022 was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison for deceiving investors about her now-shuttered company's blood-testing technology.Trump has not commented on Holmes, and she has not explicitly pleaded for clemency, though she has maintained she was \"wrongly convicted of defrauding investors.\"Holmes is nevertheless included in the online betting site Polymarket's list of possible Trump pardon subjects, with her chances currently on par with Maxwell's.On Tuesday, Politico reported that some people who identify with the pro-Trump \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement have thrown their support behind Holmes.In late August, Holmes resumed posting on her dormant social media account on X. Some of her posts appear to approvingly reference Trump and officials in his administration, while others detail her allegedly harsh prison conditions.On Oct. 31 she reached out to Santos, whose sentence Trump had recently commuted, writing, \"Glad you are working to fix the many problems you have experienced personally.\"On Nov.3, she responded to a post calling Trump the \"Best President Ever\" in response to the president reportedly stepping in to help provide medical treatment to Scott Adams, one of his supporters.Sam Bankman-FriedFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried leaves the U.S. courthouse in New York City on July 26, 2023.Amr Alfiky | ReutersSBF is serving a 25-year prison sentence following his conviction in late 2023 for defrauding customers of his cryptocurrency exchange FTX.The 33-year-old and his parents have reportedly pursued a pardon, in part by consulting a lawyer with ties to Trump, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both reported in March. Bankman-Fried has also expressed more conservative political views in media interviews conducted after Trump returned to the White House.Trump has embraced the crypto industry in his second term, but there is no indication that he is considering a pardon for Bankman-Fried.After Trump pardoned Zhao, the founder of crypto exchange Binance, on Oct. 23, SBF's chances of getting a pardon spiked on Polymarket.Asked in a CBS \"60 Minutes\" interview why he pardoned Zhao, Trump said: \"Okay, are you ready? I don't know who he is.\"Bob MenendezFormer Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) departs Manhattan Federal Court after his sentencing on Jan. 29, 2025 in New York City.Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesAllies of Menendez, the former Democratic U.S. senator from New Jersey, have made multiple attempts to ask Trump for a pardon or commutation of his 11-year prison sentence, NBC reported in May.While Trump has not ruled out clemency for Menendez, some of the former senator's allies believe the president will ultimately decline to do so, NBC reported, citing people familiar with the matter.Menendez, 71, was convicted in July 2024 of bribery and other charges. He reported to prison in June.— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

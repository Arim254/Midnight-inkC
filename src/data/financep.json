    "body": "The Toyota Industries Corp. logo at the company's Nagakusa plant in Obu, Aichi Prefecture, Japan.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of forklift manufacturer Toyota Industries jumped to a record high on Thursday, a day after Toyota Motor sweetened the tender offer price for buying out the carmaker by more than 15% to over $35 billion.Shares of Toyota Industries rose almost 6% to 19,080 yen, soaring past the revised offer price, signaling investors likely expect an even better deal. Shares of Toyota Motor, the world's largest carmaker by sales, advanced over 2%.Toyota Motor said late Wednesday it had raised the buyout offer for the group company to 18,800 yen ($118.11) per share, from 16,300 yen apiece announced in June last year, advancing plans to take the company private. Last year, Toyota Motor had sought to acquire Japan's largest corporate group for 4.7 trillion yen. The deal included 1 billion yen from chair Akio Toyoda, and Toyota Motor's investment of about 700 billion yen in non-voting preferred shares.In December, Toyota Industries said it had asked for a higher price, citing concerns that the deal's chances of success were limited.\"While the revised offer represents an all-time high, it remains arguably light,\" said Arun George, a global equity research analyst on SmartKarma.It comes in below the middle of the valuation range set out by the independent adviser, suggesting the company may still be undervalued, he said.Toyota Industries, which founded Toyota Motor, produces a range of products including forklifts, engines, electronic components, and stamping dies.\"I expect there to be some interesting fireworks on this deal. It is the biggest mis-priced takeover in Japan for quite a while. To be clear I expect activist action,\" said Travis Lundy, an independent analyst, adding that he expects activists to demand a higher price or try to block the deal.In its latest sales and production report, Toyota Motor's global output slid 5.5% to 821,723 units in November,  marking the first year-on-year decline in six months. Global sales also fell 2.2% year-on-year, with the company reporting that sales in China fell after the country scaled back on purchase subsidies in certain regions.The automaker flagged a substantial hit from U.S. tariffs, projecting a 1.45 trillion yen (over $9 billion) impact for its financial year ending March. Toyota Motor last November announced it would invest $912 million across U.S. manufacturing facilities in five Southern states, part of a broader plan to spend up to $10 billion in the U.S. by 2030.",

    "body": "TSMC offices in San Jose, California, on April 18, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday reported a 35% increase in fourth-quarter profit, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips remained strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 1.046 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($33.73 billion), vs. NT$1.034 trillion expectedNet income: NT$505.74 billion, vs. NT$478.37 billion expectedThe world's largest contract chipmaker has now posted year-over-year profit growth for eight consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, TSMC's revenue in the December quarter rose by 20.5% from a year ago to surpass NT$1 trillion, also beating forecasts.In an earnings call, TSMC executives guided revenue for the current quarter to hit between $34.6 billion and $35.8 billion, up 4% sequentially, or up 38% year-over-year at the midpoint. \"We expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading edge process technologies,\" said TSMC's Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang during an earnings call. TSMC, Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, has benefited greatly from the proliferation of artificial intelligence, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and AMD. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the October-December quarter at 55%. Demand from smartphones made up 32% of sales.TSMC said advanced chips measuring 7-nanometer or smaller made up 77% of total wafer revenue during the quarter. For full-year 2025, those chips made up 74% of revenue, up from 69% in 2024.In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes indicate more compact transistor designs, allowing faster processing speeds and greater energy efficiency. The company is looking to further ramp up its cutting-edge 2 nm offerings this year, after rolling out mass production last quarter. With TSMC further leaning into its advanced products, it said that its capital expenditure was expected to reach between $52 billion and $56 billion in 2026, as compared to $40.9 billion in 2025. \"The demand for AI remains very strong, driving overall chip demand across the entire server industry,\" Counterpoint Research senior analyst Jake Lai told CNBC, predicting that 2026 will be another \"breakout year\" for AI server demand. \"With TSMC's ongoing 2nm capacity expansion and new production contributing to revenue, along with continuous expansion of advanced packaging... TSMC is expected to maintain strong performance in 2026,\" Lai said. However, he added that chip demand tied to consumer electronics such as smartphones and PCs could be affected by the ongoing memory shortage and price hikes.",

    "body": "Gene Yu is the co-founder and CEO of Blackpanda.Courtesy of Gene YuAt age 46, startup founder Gene Yu seems to have lived several lives in one.Before he started his own company, he was a Division 1 tennis player, graduated with a computer science degree from the United States Military Academy, commonly known as West Point, served as a \"Green Beret\" in the U.S. Army Special Forces, led the rescue of a family friend from a hostage situation and authored a book. Today, he is also the co-founder and CEO of cybersecurity startup Blackpanda which has raised over $21 million to date, according to an official company announcement.While he's undergone extremely rigorous military training, served on battlefields and led major counter-terrorism missions, he said his hardest battle was internal.Growing up Asian AmericanYu was born in Concord, Massachusetts, where he says he was the only Asian kid in his town. He then moved to Cupertino, California when he was 10. His family background is unique and, in some ways, high-profile: his uncle is Ma Ying-jeou who served as the president of Taiwan from 2008 to 2016. Growing up as an Asian male in America, he says that he often internalized the messages he was told by society that \"you are inferior, you are unattractive, you are not desired, you are not equal.\" This took a toll on Yu's self-esteem. These feelings of inferiority were, at times, amplified at home. He learned early on to prioritize achievement. \"In Asian culture, what we learn is performance equals love, right? Or even better yet, lack of performance equals the absence of love,\" Yu told CNBC Make It. Yu says his early experiences led him to chase achievement as a way of protecting a younger version of himself. \"It's like you are a wounded child, and you're wearing the Iron Man suit,\" he said. \"You're armoring yourself as a traumatized person.\" \"I hated my own identity, because it was wounded, right? I wanted to create a new one, and that's what the military does for you,\" he said. So, at age 17 after graduating from high school, he left home and went straight to West Point, which is known to be a highly prestigious and selective military academy. After that, he joined the U.S. Army Special Forces where he served as an officer and commander.From his high school years to his time at West Point, he was working approximately 16 to 20 hours a day. That intensity shaped his work ethic which he still carries today.\"At West Point, you're up at like 5 a.m., and then you're down at like [midnight] ... And it's six days a week of school, no summer breaks,\" he said. \"So I definitely know how to work hard, that's for sure, which I think [helped] at Blackpanda.\"From special forces to startup CEOIn 2009, Yu's military career came to a crossroads when his uncle, Ma Ying-jeou, was elected as the president of Taiwan.\"There was [an] investigation around ... the fact that my uncle was the sitting president of Taiwan, which had occurred while I was in Special Forces,\" said Yu. This period prompted difficult questions about his future.Ultimately, Yu made the decision to leave the army, which left him feeling disoriented and exiled. \"I had a massive loss of identity,\" he said. \"I had waves of deep survivor's guilt, because I knew that I was in my prime as one of the best Special Forces captains the U.S. Army had, and that our boys were overseas, dying and fighting, and I was just chilling out.\"In the years that followed, he struggled to find a new sense of identity. He spent a few years studying Chinese and going back to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, where he was recruited to work as an equity trader at Credit Suisse. Eventually, in 2012, he joined Palantir Technologies which he grew to love, only to get retrenched in 2013. \"After Palantir let me go ... that was the hardest time in my life, by far. And I was also broke...so financially stressed, and couch surfing,\" he said. Then, a crisis involving a family friend named Evelyn Chang pulled him back into action.In 2013, Chang was taken hostage abroad by terrorist group Abu Sayyaf. Yu helped orchestrate the rescue: He put a team together, went into the Philippines and rescued her after 35 days. Notably, this mission was what helped inspire the idea for Yu's company today, Blackpanda. He realized that companies or entities facing cyberattacks needed the same kind of fast, 24/7 support that crisis insurance and services provide during kidnappings and ransom situations. \"So the same models that are [used in] the physical safety and security world need to be copied in the digital world. That's what's missing in cyber security,\" he said. He teamed up with some former Green Berets and they all went on to build Blackpanda, an idea shaped from Yu's unique background.Today, in reflection, Yu says that attaching identity to accomplishments is \"a rigged game.\" \"Because every time that you strive for the next achievement, you think that ... Everything is going to be all good, right? But the problem is that if you never heal the original trauma wound, then anyone can still come hurt you from a different angle,\" he said.

Anushree Fadnavis | ReutersAmazon launched its \"sovereign cloud\" offering in Europe on Thursday in a move designed to keep it among the leading players in the region even as more stringent regulations for tech giants are enforced.The term sovereign cloud broadly relates to cloud computing services where the data is stored, handled and not moved out of a specific jurisdiction. The European Union (EU) has pushed for companies operating in the bloc to be compliant with its various data and privacy regulations, as concerns have risen about the dominance of U.S. tech giants in the cloud space and potential access to European citizens' data.The Amazon Web Services (AWS) European Sovereign Cloud, based in Brandenburg, Germany, and first announced in 2023, is a new concept. Amazon said in a press release on Thursday that the cloud is \"physically and logically separate\" from other AWS regions. To do this, Amazon has created a new parent company for the sovereign cloud that will be locally controlled in the European Union (EU) and run by EU citizens. Stéphane Israël will lead the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. Stefan Hoechbauer, who is vice president of AWS global sales for Germany and Europe Central, has been appointed as a managing director. AWS also announced five new members of an advisory board for the sovereign cloud, three of which are Amazon employees.AWS said the sovereign cloud has \"no critical dependencies on non-EU infrastructure\" and it can continue to operate in the event of a communications disruption with the rest of the world. Under \"extreme circumstances, authorised AWS employees of the AWS European Sovereign Cloud, who are EU residents, will have independent access to a replica of the source code needed to maintain the AWS European Sovereign Cloud services,\" the company said.For the past few years, European politicians and regulators have grown concerned about the dominance of U.S. tech firms over critical technology infrastructure. Despite the EU pushing for regional companies to grow their businesses, AWS, Microsoft and Google account for 70% of the cloud computing market in the region, according to Synergy Research Group. Even as AWS pushes its sovereign cloud, European regulators are currently investigating cloud computing services from Amazon and Microsoft under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to curb the power of Big Tech. In 2024, Amazon said it would invest 7.8 billion euros ($9.1 billion) in the AWS European Sovereign Cloud in Germany through 2040. On Thursday, Amazon said it would expand the AWS European Sovereign Cloud to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal.",

    "body": "Restaurants and pubs on James Street in London, UK, on Friday, Dec. 13, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.K. economy grew by a more-than-expected 0.3% in November, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a very modest growth figure of 0.1%. The ONS said services and production both grew in November, by 0.3% and 1.1%, respectively. Meanwhile, construction fell by 1.3% in the same month. Pound sterling was largely flat against the dollar following the data, last trading at $1.3433.The latest data comes after the economy contracted unexpectedly by 0.1% in October, a figure that was attributed to the ongoing fallout of a cyber-attack at Jaguar Land Rover, which affected car production, and consumer and business uncertainty in the run-up to the Autumn Budget.watch nowJane Foley, head of FX Strategy at Rabobank, said the latest monthly growth data was a \"big relief.\"\"We've seen this recovery in the manufacturing sector, coming in far stronger than expected, and it's quite likely that that had some knock-on effect on the retail sector ... so that is probably leading to some growth in consumption as well, which is probably quite positive,\" she told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday.Economists expect the U.K. economy to improve in 2026, particularly as the Bank of England is likely to continue on its interest rate-cutting path.\"Looking ahead, we expect GDP to rebound strongly in the first quarter of 2026,\" Sanjay Raja, chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Bank, said in emailed comments this week. \"Survey data are already improving as the dust on the Budget settles and there are tentative signs that the labour market may be stabilising,\" he said. \"We expect households to spend a little more to start the year, and investment to remain on an uptrend,\" he added. Deutsche Bank expects that U.K. GDP growth this year will be slightly lower than in 2025 (seen at 1.1%) while it expects quarterly growth to track 0.35% quarter-on-quarter.\"There are more downside risks to our growth projection, given the vulnerabilities in the labour market,\" Raja cautioned, however.",

    "body": "watch nowNetflix is likely to amend its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery's assets, making an all-cash bid, CNBC's David Faber reported on Wednesday. In December, Netflix reached a deal to purchase WBD's streaming platform HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio in a transaction comprised of cash and stock. The deal is currently valued at $27.75 per WBD share. This would put the deal's equity value at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Bloomberg first reported this week that Netflix was considering adjusting its offer to be all-cash. An amended offer would allow WBD shareholders to vote to approve the offer on a faster timeline, Faber reported, citing sources familiar with the matter.Under the current deal, shareholders are expected to vote on the deal in the spring or early summer, Faber reported. Deals comprised of stock typically mean more financials and accounting need to be issued as part of seeking approval, which requires more time and expense, Faber added.If Netflix were to make its offer all-cash the shareholder vote could move up to as early as late February or early March, Faber reported.The change would come as Paramount Skydance has turned up the heat on its hostile push to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery's business. Earlier this week Paramount sued Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav seeking more information about why the company's board continues to reject its $30 per share offer in favor of Netflix. Paramount has repeatedly argued its deal is superior in value, given the estimated value of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV networks. It has also amended its bid to solidify the backing of Oracle co-founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison. ",

    "body": "Security forces are seen during a pro-government rally on Jan. 12, 2026 in Tehran, Iran. Getty Images | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIran reopened its airspace early Thursday after a temporary closure that barred most incoming and outgoing flights for several hours amid concerns the U.S. could carry out military strikes, raising risks for airlines.The restriction, which ended at 3:30 a.m UTC, or 10:30 p.m. EST Wednesday, was in place for 5 hours.Live data from flight tracker FlightRadar24 showed most aircraft still skirting Iranian airspace as of 4 a.m. UTC, though some domestic carriers had begun resuming flights.The initial order exempted international flights to and from Tehran, provided they received prior approval from Iran's civil aviation authority. The airspace closure comes as tensions escalated after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened intervention following a deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in Iran. Trump has publicly said he would \"come to the rescue\" of Iranian protestors if the violent crackdown continued.   The U.S. has begun relocating some personnel and equipment from American military bases in the Middle East amid Iranian threats to strike those locations if Washington launches an attack. Trump later appeared to soften his tone. Speaking at the White House on Wednesday night, Trump said he has been assured that the killings of protestors in Iran had stopped and that he would \"watch it and see\" regarding potential U.S. military action. watch nowSeveral airlines have canceled or rerouted flights to Tehran in recent days. India's largest airline, IndiGo, said Thursday that some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran's airspace closure. Earlier this week, Germany warned its airlines against entering Iranian airspace. In an emailed response to CNBC on Thursday, the Lufthansa Group said it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, with some flights canceled. The U.S. has prohibited all American commercial flights from overflying Iran. Airlines, including Emirates, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have also canceled multiple flights to Iran over the past week. Protests erupted late last year after Iran's national currency, the rial, plunged to record lows, worsening a cost-of-living crisis. The unrest has since evolved into a broader movement against the government's theocratic rule, leading to brutal clashes that have killed at least 2,571 people, according to the U.S.-based HRANA rights group.— CNBC's Nur Hikmah Md Ali contributed to this story.

    "body": "(L/R) US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio depart the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the White House campus after a meeting with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt in Washington, DC, on Jan. 14, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesAny U.S. attempt to seize Greenland by force would trigger \"monumental consequences\" for the Western alliance and the global order, Iceland's former President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson said, as President Donald Trump sharpens rhetoric on controlling the Arctic territory. Grimsson warned on CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" that \"the fallout would be on a scale that we have never seen in living memory.\" Grimsson, the longest-serving president of Iceland from 1996 to 2016, currently serves as the Chairman of the Arctic Circle, the world's largest annual gathering on Arctic issues.  Trump has framed Greenland — an autonomous region within the Kingdom of Denmark — as central to U.S. national security, saying China and Russia were building up their influence in the strategically located minerals-rich area around the island. watch nowA meeting at the White House between officials from Greenland, Denmark and the U.S. Wednesday ended with \"fundamental disagreement\" over the ownership of the island, a Danish official said following the meeting, adding that both sides would continue to talk.     Trump had doubled down on his rhetoric on Greenland ahead of the talks, saying on social media that anything less than Greenland becoming a part of the United States was \"unacceptable.\"  Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen made it clear Tuesday that the country would choose Denmark over the United States if it had to make a choice.  The European Union Commissioner for Defense and Space Andius Kubilius said earlier this week that any American military takeover of Greenland would be the end of NATO, the U.S.-led military alliance of 32 countries that includes Denmark. A group of European countries, led by Britain and Germany, has reportedly been discussing plans to boost their military presence in Greenland to deter Trump's aggressive takeover bid. Grimsson pointed out that concerns about Russia or China's growing influence in the Arctic were overblown. \"At the present there is not a direct, clear, obvious threat from Russia and China in the Arctic,\" he said. China's most prominent role is in Russia's Arctic zone, where it has been involved in mining, energy resources exploration and potentially in military exercises, said Grimsson. Beyond that — across the Canadian, U.S. and Nordic Arctic — \"China is not a big player,\" while Russia \"is not there,\" he added. U.S. should 'start at home,' not 'buy Greenland' Grimsson also argued that if Trump's goal is a stronger U.S. posture in the Arctic, Washington should focus on domestic capacity. The U.S. is \"already an Arctic country,\" he said, noting its Arctic expanse is larger than Texas. watch nowTrump's successive administrations have underinvested in infrastructure such as icebreakers and ports in America's Arctic, leaving the U.S. behind its rivals, he added. \"If you want an enhanced presence in the Arctic, start at home,\" Grimsson said, pointing to the absence of a major harbor in the U.S. Arctic. It is unclear what strategic or economic advantage Washington would gain from overtaking Greenland, the Arctic leader said, noting that existing arrangements already give the U.S. extensive latitude. The 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement allowed the U.S. to operate American military bases in the island and Danish leaders have expressed willingness to work with Washington to expand the American and NATO presence there. Greenland's government has also allowed American companies to participate in mining and other parts of the economy. \"There are no barriers at the moment for enhanced American security or business presence within Greenland,\" he said. \"Since we have not heard any more detailed explanation for this desire, it's very difficult to understand concretely what it is about.\" Instead, Grimsson suggested Trump's worldview — shaped by his background in real estate — may be influencing the fixation on territory. \"He is probably the first major global leader who had all his training and thinking done through the real estate business,\" he said. \"Real estate guys think in locations.\" When asked whether Trump could take Greenland by force, Grimsson said a military move was conceivable given the imbalance of power and Greenland's small population, but warned the political costs would be unprecedented.\"Yes, of course, it's possible,\" he said, but \"the question is ... what is it going to do with it, apart from .. putting the flag of the United States and acquiring location.\"  ",

    "body": "Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa speaks during an event in Turin, Italy, Nov. 25, 2025.Daniele Mascolo | ReutersDETROIT — Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa views 2026 as an execution year for the embattled maker of Jeep, Ram and Dodge vehicles in the U.S. after years of market share declines.Filosa has been undertaking a turnaround plan since he was named CEO in May. So far, his plans have included prioritizing the company's Jeep and Ram brands in the U.S. as well as undoing many decisions his predecessor Carlos Tavares made to focus on all-electric vehicles.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa, wearing a Jeep vest over a white button-down shirt, said this year is a \"first step\" in remaking the company, which was formed five years ago through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and French automaker PSA Groupe.He declined to discuss specifics, adding that his executive team will lay out a detailed future strategy for the automaker at a capital markets day in the first half of this year.Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also include Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.Filosa said he does believe that the company wants \"to stay together\" following some Wall Street speculation in recent years that it would be better to sell off assets or brands. \"We are building a culture,\" Filosa said.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come next week during a meeting with more than 200 company executives that will focus on the company's capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.\"We are a global company with strong regional roots,\" Filosa said, referring to one of three guiding cultural principles he's attempting to instill in the company. The others are being customer focused and working together.Stellantis' global sales under Tavares fell 12.3% from 6.5 million in 2021 — the year the company was formed — to 5.7 million in 2024. That included a roughly 27% collapse in the U.S. in that period to 1.3 million vehicles sold. The automaker dropped from fourth in U.S. sales to sixth, falling from an 11.6% market share to 8% during that time frame.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he arrives to address House Republicans at their annual issues conference retreat, at the Kennedy Center, renamed the Trump-Kennedy Center by the Trump-appointed board of directors, in Washington, D.C., U.S., January 6, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Republicans are down in the polls with less than 10 months until the midterm elections. Now, Trump is giving the economic populism of the left a try. Last week, Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest at 10%, unveiled plans to bar large private-equity funds from buying up housing and said he would bar defense companies from issuing dividends or stock buybacks. These moves check off many policy wishes of the populist progressive left and borrow from political opponents like former Vice President Kamala Harris.It comes as Trump, who strode into a second term on a pledge to lower costs, finds himself underwater on the economy. A recent CBS News poll found that only 39% of voters approved of his performance on the issue, while 61% disapproved, one of his worst polls since retaking the presidency. That's a big problem for Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill, who could lose their slim majorities in both the House and the Senate in the November elections. Democrats are pounding the administration with an election-year message centered on affordability, arguing that the president and his allies have failed to bring down costs for everyday Americans. This line of attack on the cost of goods worked well for Democrats in gubernatorial races in late 2025.Republicans hold a razor-thin 218-213 vote majority in the House and a 53-47 seat majority in the Senate. A growing number of Republicans in the House have decided to retire at the end of this term, and Trump has warned that if Democrats take the House, \"they'll find a reason to impeach me.\"Trump's moves appear aimed at addressing voters' concerns around affordability — in the Truth Social post where he announced the credit card interest cap, the president wrote \"AFFORDABILITY!\" But not all Republicans on Capitol Hill are convinced that Trump's populist shift represents a life raft as Democrats take a consistent lead in generic congressional ballot polling.\"Self-control, clear messaging, clear priorities would be helpful,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican who will retire at the end of this term, in an interview with CNBC. \"He actually sounds more and more like a Democrat, if you think about it.\"  Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probe\"When you talk about limiting businesses buying houses, limiting the salaries of corporate heads, I mean, that's much more like a Democrat messaging to me,\" Bacon said. Other Republicans were even more dismissive of the effort. One longtime House Republican, granted anonymity to discuss Trump's proposals candidly, said, \"The kind of stuff we're talking about right now ... is called hiding from your record.\"The Trump administration is defending the president's populist shift amid the complaints from some in the GOP.\"President Trump was given a resounding mandate by the American people to smash Washington, D.C.'s obsession with consensus orthodoxy that has let Americans down,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai. \"The Trump administration is turning the page on Joe Biden's economic disaster by implementing traditional free market policies that do work – like deregulation and tax cuts – while rectifying the America Last policies that have Americans behind.\"But even top House and Senate Republicans have not exactly embraced Trump's latest moves to lower costs for Americans, and appear to be coalescing around the message that Trump is an \"ideas guy.\" Trump in the past has thrown a myriad of policy proposals at the wall to see what will stick, forcing his Republican allies to quickly adjust their priorities. \"The president is the ideas guy, and what he's doggedly determined to do, and laser-focused upon doing, is the same thing that we are, and that is reducing the cost of living,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a press conference on Tuesday when asked about the credit card interest cap proposal. \"I wouldn't get too spun up about ideas that are out of the box that are proposed or suggested,\" Johnson added.Republicans have largely echoed banks in warning against a 10% cap on credit card interest, arguing such a cap could result in fewer people being offered credit and depress spending. Trump's credit card interest cap proposal came in a Truth Social post, hours after Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., tweeted about it. Sanders, the former presidential candidate in 2016 and 2020, has long pushed a populist economic agenda and proposed a credit card interest cap in 2019. He sponsored a bill with Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican of Missouri with a populist streak, to impose the cap. \"Trump promised to cap credit card interest rates at 10% and stop Wall Street from getting away with murder,\" Sanders wrote. \"Instead, he deregulated big banks charging up to 30% interest on credit cards … Unacceptable.\"Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks to the crowd at U.S. Representative Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) campaign rally in the Bronx borough of New York City, U.S., June 22, 2024. Joy Malone | ReutersHours later, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was \"calling for a one year cap on Credit Card Interest Rates of 10%.\"Trump's housing proposal, too, is similar to a proposal from former Vice President Kamala Harris. In 2024, during her presidential campaign, Harris urged Congress to pass a bill that would have curtailed investors from buying large numbers of single-family rental homes. Large private equity firms currently own less than five percent of single-family rental homes. \"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" Trump said in his Truth Social post announcing the policy. It's unclear whether Trump's populist turn will end up providing any cover for Republicans, who are planning to crisscross the country selling voters on their \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" law that cut taxes and advanced other policy items sought by Trump.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has become a frequent foil of the Trump administration after leading the charge to compel the release of files related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, said it's unclear if the ideas will even be popular. \"Its populist economics is what it is,\" Massie said in an interview. \"It may very well be popular, I mean, there are going to be some downsides to it as well. We'll see how it plays out and whether he can actually pull it off.\" Pollsters say Trump is looking for a \"game changer\" to change voters' minds on the economy. \"He needs to convince people that things are going to be better economically in a short period of time and that's what all of these moves, I think, are intended to do,\" said Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling. \"It might tighten, and the bottom might come out, and the other side could run away with it.\"How Trump pulls it off remains to be seen. Many of the proposals would likely require congressional authorization. To that end, Trump appears to be reaching out to Democrats — including those he has repeatedly maligned.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Trump called her on Monday after she gave a speech at the National Press Club, where she laid out a case for a Democratic victory in 2026 by arguing that \"when the choice is between 'make the rich richer' and 'help everybody else,' winning elections is about choosing 'everybody else.\"\"I told him that Congress can pass legislation to cap credit card rates if he will actually fight for it,\" Warren said in a statement after the president's call. \"I also urged him to get House Republicans to pass the bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, which passed the Senate with unanimous support and would build more housing and lower costs.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who represents Silicon Valley and is an oft-discussed potential presidential candidate in 2028, welcomed the president in an interview with CNBC.\"Well, I'm glad Trump is proposing populist policies. I support the idea that we should ban private equity from buying up single-family homes; that was my bill,\" Khanna said. \"If he wants to propose policies that are progressive or populist that are going to help Americans, I'll vote for them.\" That's not to say all leading Democrats are ready to help Trump lower prices and salvage the midterms for Republicans. \"I don't know why we would take what he says seriously, because it's his policies that are jacking up prices,\" said Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif, the vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, during a press conference this week. \"Unless he reverses his policies, these prices are going to keep on increasing.\" Then, there's the possibility that Trump is using his slew of economic proposals to drive the news cycle away from his weak points. The president has recently come under immense scrutiny for his use of the military after the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, his appearances in the Epstein files and his aggressive deportation agenda.\"Quite frankly, he's the master of distraction. In the middle of something, he'll make a statement or then look over to something else,\" said Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., who was Trump's Secretary of the Interior in his first term. ",

In a social media post on Wednesday, the U.S. president said anything less than Greenland becoming a part of the United States would be \"unacceptable.\" \"The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building. NATO should be leading the way for us to get it,\" Trump said on Truth Social.\"NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable,\" he added. In a subsequent social media post, Trump said only the U.S. could counter an alleged threat from Russia and China to the island.His comments come just one day after Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen portrayed a united front against Trump's takeover threats.Speaking at a joint news conference in Copenhagen on Tuesday, Greenland's Nielsen said that if the self-governing Danish territory must choose between the U.S. and Denmark, \"we choose Denmark.\"Frederiksen also said it had not been easy to stand up to what she described as \"completely unacceptable pressure\" from our closest ally. \"But there is much to suggest that the hardest part is still ahead of us.\" Read moreTrump, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the United States, renewed his interest in the vast and mineral-rich Arctic island following an audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela on Jan. 3.  Trump's comments have raised alarm in Denmark, which is responsible for the defense of Greenland, with Frederiksen cautioning that a U.S. attack would mark the end of NATO. Defense and resourcesIan Lesser, distinguished fellow at GMF, a Washington-based think tank, said the stakes were \"very high\" for the talks, warning that failure to resolve the diplomatic crisis \"does not just threaten NATO cohesion, it threatens the future existence of the Alliance as we know it.\" The meeting will likely seek to clarify the prospects for and potential contours of a negotiated settlement of the crisis, Lesser said.Greenland's Head of Government (Naalakkersuisut) Jens-Frederik Nielsen (L) and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen give a statement on the current situation at a press conference in the Mirror Hall at the Prime Minister's Office in Copenhagen, Denmark, on January 13, 2026.Liselotte Sabroe | Afp | Getty Images\"There could be new European commitments to strengthening the defence of Greenland, and more important, the surrounding maritime space. There might also be parallel talks around new and preferential US access to Greenland's resources,\" Lesser told CNBC by email.\"Or, the meeting could end in acrimony,\" he added. The prospect of a public fallout between U.S. and European officials at the White House brings to mind a highly contentious meeting between Trump, Vance and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February last year.Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of a lack of respect as the meeting veered sharply off track, devolving into an extraordinary shouting match live on camera.'A profound crisis'Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden, said he does not expect the U.S., Greenland and Denmark to be able to find a diplomatic solution on Wednesday, describing the situation as \"a profound crisis.\" \"I think there was a significant change, I think it was yesterday, when it was announced in Washington that JD Vance, the vice president, was going to take over the meeting,\" Bildt told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Wednesday. \"It was scheduled to be with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has indicated a slightly milder approach, but JD Vance has, of course, been directly insulting towards Denmark and demanding very strange things,\" Bildt said.watch now\"I expect a fairly hard meeting. I don't expect any resolution. At best, I expect that they will initiate the process of talks of some sort,\" he added.Bildt, who serves as co-chair of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank, referred to Vance's remarks at the Munich Security Conference in February last year, saying his \"rather extraordinary\" analysis of Europe was more in line with the \"extreme right\" of the region. \"This is not the trans-Atlantic alliance we used to have,\" he added. What would a good outcome look like?Otto Svendsen, associate fellow with the Europe, Russia, and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said tensions between Greenland and Denmark have been set aside to present a united front against U.S. threats.The White House meeting, Svendsen said, will provide further clues as to how committed the entire Trump administration is to acquiring Greenland — and how deterred the administration is to threats of a complete breakdown in bilateral relations.Read more\"A good outcome for the Danes and Greenlanders would be a statement that affirms Greenland's sovereignty and position within the Kingdom. Anything short of that leaves the door open to continued threats and coercion,\" Svendsen told CNBC by email.\"In return, the Danish and Greenlandic delegation will likely offer plans to revisit economic and security arrangements among the three countries, such as more favorable access for U.S. companies to the Greenlandic mining sector and additional Danish investments in Arctic security,\" he added.Several European leaders rallied in support of Greenland last week, saying security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively.\"Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,\" the leaders said. The letter was signed by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, as well as the leaders of Italy, Spain and Poland. ",

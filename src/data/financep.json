    "body": "Many people think that if they're determined enough — if they push themselves really hard — they'll be able to create better habits.Those people are missing an important piece to the puzzle of self-control, according to James Clear, author of The New York Times bestselling book \"Atomic Habits.\" Even if you're disciplined, you likely need to put yourself in environments that allow you to stay that way, free of distractions or opportunities to be tempted out of your habits-in-progress, Clear told \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\" in a Jan. 8 episode.\"When you look at people who exhibit high levels of self-control, the common pattern across them is not that they have higher discipline than the average person,\" he said. \"The common pattern is that they are in situations where they're tempted less frequently.\"If you're avoiding alcohol while doing Dry January for the first time, for example, you may not want to go to happy hour with your friends, where external pressures or fear of missing out could sway you. The goal is to stay away from temptation, not resist it.\"You don't need to try to be more disciplined. You don't need to wish that you were a person with more willpower,\" said Clear. \"You need to take a little bit of time to design an environment where you're not tempted as frequently ... That could mean simple things like not having chips in the house or not having cigarettes in the house or things like that.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsYour environment can include the people you surround yourself with: Keeping company with likeminded individuals can help you stay focused, some studies show. If you and your friends are regularly in situations that keep you from building your desired habit, you might want to speak transparently with them about your goals or find other ways to spend time with them, Clear recommended.\"And that's not necessarily saying I never see these people again, but maybe I only see them in pockets or in certain situations,\" Clear said. \"And then other people I'm trying to expose myself to more and hang out with more.\"You may be inclined to tell yourself that, if you mess up during your pursuit for better habits, you should just quit trying altogether. Instead, flip your self-talk to be more optimistic, Clear advised. Tell yourself that your efforts today will pay off down the line, for example, or that you can stay the course even if you slip up.A positive attitude can also help you better manage the stress that comes with lifestyle and habit changes, according to a 2023 report from the Mayo Clinic. \"A bad attitude and self-pity makes every problem harder,\" said Clear. \"And so you're just layering on another challenge to the already challenging situation. It just does not serve you.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. In \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,\" which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Buffett eventually arrives at a challenge he used to pose to college students. Buffett would ask the students to consider a scenario in which, given a class of 300 or so of their peers, they could receive 10% of the lifetime earnings of five of them. Who would they choose — and why? And who would they sell short? The people you chose, he says, wouldn't necessarily be the best looking or the smartest or the most athletic. \"Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy,\" Buffett says. \"There is nothing impossible. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five.\" How to get on the listSo what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? \"It's luck, a lot of it. If you choose the right parents, you're rich when you come out,\" Buffett says. \"You've won the lottery — the ovarian lottery.\"But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. \"You can do it by being a good person, by reading a lot, by spending less than you take in,\" he says. \"I just told them you can spend 110% of what you earn once, and then you used it up. The rest of your life you're underwater.\"Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. \"Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out,\" he says. \"It isn't that it's impossible, and I give credit to people to do it. But do it the easy way.\"Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of \"selling himself\" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients.\"That's not crazy,\" Buffett says. \"Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"JPMorgan and the White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed in a CNBC interview in August, without providing evidence, that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The shares, and others in the banking sector, fell in response to Trump's demand to cap credit card rates at 10%, giving financial firms until Jan. 20 to comply.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"The Journal and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

    "body": "Da-kuk | E+ | Getty ImagesAs many Americans struggle to keep up with the rising cost of living — housing, groceries, electricity and other necessities — their financial stress is getting more attention in the workplace.In 2025, employer discomfort at their workers' financial well-being reached a new high: 48% rated their concern at 9 or 10 on a scale of 1 to 10, compared with 43% in 2024 and only 39% in 2023, according to recent research from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. As recently as 2019, the year before Covid, that share stood at 22%. Since 2022, \"we've seen employers shift away from retirement as the top area of concern toward more of the day-to-day cost of living issues, and budgeting and savings issues,\" said Jake Spiegel, a senior research associate at the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"Employees are feeling the squeeze from above-trend inflation,\" Spiegel said.Paycheck to paycheckAlthough inflation has eased to a yearly rate of 2.7% since peaking at 9.1% in June 2022, prices overall have climbed more than 25% since 2020, based on the consumer price index.The result has been a large share of households whose budgets are pinched by higher costs. More than half (57%) of employees live paycheck to paycheck, according to a 2025 survey of close to 90,000 participants in 401(k) retirement plans by Bank of America. While wage growth has generally outpaced inflation over the past two years, that came after a period when income lagged behind inflation in 2021 and 2022.Employers, who are interested in helping employees manage stress in order to reduce absenteeism or worker dissatisfaction, have been doing more to focus on the financial well-being of their employees.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

The study included responses from 406 benefits decisionmakers at companies with at least 500 employees and that are either offering financial wellness programs or interested in doing so.At the same time, a smaller share of employers say their efforts are making a \"large impact\": 43%, compared with 60% in 2024 and 73% in 2023. Employers may be taking cues from their employees when assessing the impact of their programs, he said.\"We see evidence in one of our other surveys … that employees tend to be less rosy than employers when it comes to rating the effectiveness of benefits,\" he said.Financial wellness designThe specifics of any financial wellness program differ from company to company. They could include, for example, benefits like payroll advance loans, short-term loans through a third-party and access to emergency funds through dedicated savings accounts or their 401(k) — either through a loan or hardship withdrawal.Other times, it could include offering seminars or webinars that focus on specific issues like creating a budget, investing or saving for retirement.Also, 68% indicated that their workers have access to financial advisors and 46% offer access to financial coaches. Sometimes, the company subsidizes the cost either fully or partly for workers to meet with experts one-on-one.\"Financial wellness [programs] with one-on-one sessions are a strategic way to provide more access\" to professionals who specialize in providing financial guidance, said certified financial planner Uchechi Kalu, founder of Greenlight Financial Planning in Los Angeles.Kalu is working with a nonprofit in Chicago whose employees are able to meet with her twice annually, via video calls, about whatever financial issues they are facing. With the employer subsidizing half of the cost, workers pay $118 per session, Kalu said. She said that when employers help pay for these kinds of sessions, it can make a difference in whether workers make use of the benefit or not.She has provided guidance related to a variety of financial issues, including budgeting, investing, home buying and affording overseas travel.  \"The one-on-ones are when you get to reach people in critical moments and help them along their journey,\" Kalu said.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visits \"Making Money With Charles Payne\" at Fox Business Network Studios in New York on Dec. 4, 2024.Mike Coppola | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Friday announced it will begin testing ads within ChatGPT in the coming weeks, a highly anticipated decision that could kick-start a lucrative new revenue stream for the artificial intelligence startup. OpenAI said its Plus, Pro and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads, but it plans to start testing them with adult free users in the U.S. The company also made its low-cost Go offering available in the U.S. on Friday, and it said users who opt for that plan will also begin to see ads. The company inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in November that the startup was on track to generate $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate last year. Introducing ads to ChatGPT could help OpenAI meet its ambitious spending commitments, as digital advertising has long been the cash cow for other big tech companies like Google and Meta. \"It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don't want to pay, so we are are hopeful a business model like this can work,\" Altman wrote in a post on X on Friday.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseAds within ChatGPT will appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers, and they will be clearly labeled, OpenAI said. ChatGPT's responses will not be influenced by ads, and OpenAI said it will \"never\" sell users' data to advertisers, according to a release. Users under the age of 18 will not see ads, and ads will not appear near certain topics, including politics, health and mental health, OpenAI said. Altman has publicly expressed reservations about introducing ads to ChatGPT in recent years, stating in interviews that doing so could erode users' trust in OpenAI's products. But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads \"at some point,\" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity. \"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.As OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he'd prefer to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his position as top economic advisor, a statement that could change the dynamic in the race to see who will replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.During an appearance in the White House, Trump said, \"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today.\"\"I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,\" he added.Hassett has been considered a leading contender to take the central bank reins, competing closely with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and has indicated he will replace Powell when his term as chair ends in May. Hassett and Warsh are two of five finalists for the position, a group that also includes current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Turning to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, \"We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out.\"After Trump spoke, traders on predictions market site Kalshi raised their bets to a 60% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared with just 16% for Hassett and 14% for Waller. As recently as Wednesday, Warsh and Hassett were in a near dead heat.\"It is not certain this is a definitive signal — the President has given various signals at various times and appears to enjoy the drama of this Celebrity Apprentice season — but it does look as if the former Fed governor is for the first time the clear front-runner,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh, at 60%, leading Hassett, at 15%, and Waller at 13%. Traders are giving little odds to Bowman and BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder, the other two candidates considered finalists. Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.",

    "body": "Recently the Australian Senate passed a law to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X. Matt Cardy | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAustralia's social media ban for under-16s has grabbed global attention, and governments worldwide are considering implementing similar policies, with the U.K. seen as likely to be next. The Australian government's Online Safety Amendment Act came into effect on December 10, and included major social media platforms including Reddit, X, Meta's Instagram, Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok. The platforms were forced to implement age verification methods to ensure under-16s are unable to create an account, and the companies can face fines up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for not complying. Although teenagers, tech giants, and experts have had mixed reactions since the ban came into force, governments globally are drafting bills to implement an Australia-style ban. \"This is a global issue, and governments everywhere are under pressure to respond,\" Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of U.K.-based Smartphone Free Childhood, told CNBC. SFC is a grassroots campaign urging parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access.\"We're already seeing countries move in this direction, and as confidence builds and evidence accumulates, more will follow. No one thinks the status quo is working for children, parents, or society – and this is one of the clearest policy responses currently on the table,\" Greenwell added. Other countries that are considering an under-16s social media ban include the U.K., France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. The U.S. is trailing behind on this front with a national ban being unlikely, however there is certainly state and local interest, according to Ravi Iyer, a managing director of the University of Southern California Marshall School's Neely Center. Iyer has worked closely with social psychologist Jonathon Haidt who wrote the renowned book The Anxious Generation, about the harmful impacts of social media and smartphones on children and teens. \"It's really hard to predict Federal policy, but it is one of the few bipartisan issues left, so it certainly is possible,\" Iyer said in emailed comments. \"I'm more confident at the state level and I believe we will see a few U.S. states enact such a policy in the next couple years.\"Lawmakers in California and Texas are looking at bringing in state-level bans in 2026. But governments looking to implement such bans could face resistance from the tech giants. Following Australia's move, community-focused forum Reddit launched a lawsuit, arguing that the new law goes too far by restricting political discussion online. Facebook and Instagram owner Meta urged Canberra to reconsider the ban. And in a statement to users explaining how the restrictions work, Elon Musk's X said: \"It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires.\"U.K. set to vote on social media ban Meanwhile, calls for a social media ban for under-16s in the U.K. have grown rapidly at the beginning of this year. The U.K.'s House of Lords is expected to vote this week to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include a social media ban for under-16s. Greenwell's SFC launched an email campaign this week, which saw more than 100,000 emails sent to local U.K. lawmakers. The SFC template email urged the government to set \"reasonable, age-appropriate boundaries that protect children's wellbeing.\" \"We consistently see that the more time children spend on smartphones and social media, the worse their mental health outcomes tend to be. If these platforms are no longer available, the network effects collapse – and young people can reconnect with each other and with the real world,\" Greenwell told CNBC. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has even backed the idea saying \"we need to better protect children from social media\" and that he's studying Australia's ban. \"All options are on the table in relation to what further protections we can put in place - whether that's under-16s on social media or an issue I am very concerned about, under fives and screen time,\" Starmer said last week. \"Children are turning up age four at reception [the first year of school] having spent far too much time on screens,\" he added.Meanwhile, U.K. health secretary Wes Streeting asked The Anxious Generation author Haidt to address his officials at an event to push for stricter limits on young people. France is also a strong contender as it debates two bills, one backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to prevent social media access for under 15s, France24 reported last week. France's public health watchdog ANSES outlined that social media's negative effects are \"numerous\" and well documented. USC's Iyer said that if a teen ban becomes a global norm, it alleviates the pressure on young people to self-police. \"One of the primary goals of the law is to change the norm, such that teens don't feel pressure to use social media because all their friends are doing so\" Iyer said. \"It's not really a realistic choice to abstain if you feel that all your friends are using a particular platform. If we can solve that problem and the majority of teens are off of social media, we'll have done a lot of good,\" he added. Read more",

    "body": "U.S.President Donald Trump arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of the existing U.S. tariffs already levied on goods from these countries.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its allies already average about 15% on goods from the European Union countries in Trump's crosshairs and roughly 10% on imports from the United Kingdom, with rates varying by sector. In sensitive areas such as metals and certain autos, stacked measures have already pushed effective tariffs into the mid-teens to mid-20% range.The imposition of tariffs on one or more members of the EU, which comprises 27 nations, means the new tariffs would apply to all. Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold.\"Ambassadors from the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday, Reuters reported. Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, called the meeting, which is set to start at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).Tariff strategyTrump's post suggested that the new tariffs on European allies are being imposed in response to the countries' moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the president did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that the new tariffs play right into the hands of China and Russia. \"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Some cautioned European leaders to avoid reacting hastily to Trump's tariff threat.\"Just ignore it and wait and see,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, told Reuters. \"Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.\"Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"Likewise, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., both members of the Bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, warned that threatening tariffs on NATO would raise costs for U.S. families while benefiting adversaries like Russia and China. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said: \"Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America's allies… At a time when many Americans are already concerned about the cost of living, these tariffs would raise prices for both families and businesses.\"The lawmakers said Danish and Greenlandic officials want to \"partner with the United States,\" urging the administration to \"turn off the threats and turn on diplomacy.\"— Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

The two turbines are part of a pilot program for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Program.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind will resume construction, after a federal judge Friday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. It is the largest offshore wind project under construction in the U.S. Shares of Dominion Energy, the owner and developer, rose about 1% on the news.The Department of Interior in December halted construction of five wind farms off the East Coast, including Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, claiming national security concerns. Judge Jamar Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion's request for a preliminary injunction Friday. Dominion called the Trump suspension \"arbitrary and illegal\" in its lawsuit. \"Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,\" a Dominion spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Friday. \"While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government,\" the spokesperson said. Dominion said in December that \"stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI and civilian assets.\"Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176-turbine project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. It is scheduled to start dispatching power by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The project will help meet power demand in in northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Data centers are increasingly straining the electric grid as they consume more power to train and run artificial intelligence applications. The Trump administration tried to halt four other offshore wind farms in December. They are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England; and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island.Federal judges this week allowed Revolution Wind and Empire Wind to resume construction.

    "body": "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, speaks to members of the media outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

Investors who focus only on chips and software risk missing where the next phase of value is occurring, according to investing experts on this week's episode of CNBC's \"ETF Edge.\"Some of the trends and innovations driving the market, and the rapid scaling of companies, are tied to AI's physical requirements. Power, cooling, grid stability, and data center efficiency have become binding constraints. Just look at the stock price of Bloom Energy, which for years after its 2018 IPO struggled to eke out a return above its IPO price. Since last year, when its onsite fuel cells began being ordered furiously for data centers, Bloom has seen its shares shoot up over 500% and the company reached a market cap above $30 billion. Many opportunities are being created in small- and mid-cap companies for investors. Firms that once sat outside the market's focus are now \"very quickly moving up the cap table,\" TCW Group global head of distribution Jennifer Grancio said on \"ETF Edge\" on Monday. In many cases, these companies operate in narrow segments with limited competition, allowing fundamentals to improve faster than investor awareness. Energy reliability is the central issue. In recent years, as the cost of renewable energy sources came down and became competitive with fossil fuel sources, the market debated \"How much regularity could we get out of wind, or could we get out of solar?\" Grancio said. But AI has shifted the conversation since data centers cannot tolerate intermittency, requiring a constant supply of power to avoid unintended downtime.That reality has driven \"a huge shift towards nuclear,\" according to Grancio, including renewed investment in servicing existing plants and developing small modular reactors. These projects are spawning new suppliers and accelerating growth for specialized players that sit upstream of utilities and hyperscalers.Nuclear power ETFsFirst Trust Bloomberg Nuclear Power ETF (RCTR)VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF (NLR)Themes Uranium & Nuclear ETF (URAN)Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF (NUKZ) Global X Uranium ETF (URA) Efficiency inside the data center is equally critical. As AI workloads expand, cooling and power management have become the chokepoints. Investors are increasingly drawn to companies that are \"one or two in their field\" and \"the best at a certain technology\" particularly where alternatives are limited, Grancio said.The structure of these markets matters. In some cases, there are \"only a few providers\" bordering on oligopolies, Grancio said. That concentration creates operating leverage, but it also means missteps can be costly.Actively managed ETFs are gaining traction as a result. While passive indices can capture broad market returns and the indexes do add new companies as components as they scale, active strategies aim to identify them earlier and hold them through multiple phases of growth.But the risks can be significant. Some parts of the AI-powered ecosystems include \"small, financially weak companies\" that are leveraged to electricity demand, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck. \"That also means you get a lot of volatility along the way,\" he said on \"ETF Edge.\"As a result, he said no single AI theme should dominate an investor's asset allocation. \"You don't want to overweight them in your portfolio,\" Van Eck said.He described Van Eck's nuclear ETF as having traded at \"nosebleed levels\" last year before it came down to a more reasonable entry point for new investors.The ETF experts said that as investors bring the AI theme into their portfolio construction in a more targeted way in 2026, active rebalancing and clear risk expectations will allow investors to stay invested without chasing peaks or panicking at drawdowns.",

    "body": "The Texas State Capitol building, in Austin, Texas. Chris Rogers | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesLed by Texas and New Hampshire, U.S. states across the national map, both red and blue in political stripes, are developing bitcoin strategic reserves and bringing cryptocurrencies onto their books through additional state finance and budgeting measures. Texas recently became the first state to purchase bitcoin after a legislative effort that began in 2024, but numerous states have joined the \"Reserve Race\" to pass legislation that will allow them to ultimately buy cryptocurrencies.New Hampshire passed its crypto strategic reserve law last May, even before Texas, giving the state treasurer the authority to invest up to 5% of the state funds in crypto ETFs, though precious metals such as gold are also authorized for purchase. Arizona passed similar legislation, while Massachusetts, Ohio, and South Dakota have legislation at various stages of committee review. Despite much of the legislation being largely sponsored or co-sponsored by Republicans, the adoption of crypto at the state level is not expected to strictly fall along party lines. The 2024 election cycle was the first time that the cryptocurrency industry played a major role in lobbying in both state and national elections. In fact, it was the largest corporate donor in an election cycle, with support given to candidates on both sides. It is already amassing a war chest for the 2026 midterms. Congress is currently debating a crypto market structure bill, and state-level politicians are as much out to prove that they, and their states, won't be left out of the digital assets boom. Justin Marlowe, a public policy professor at the University of Chicago, sees the state-level trend as largely one of signaling at present. \"If you're a governor and you want to broadcast that you are amenable to innovative business development in the digital economy, these are relatively low-cost, low-risk ways to send that signal. That's why we've seen leaders across the ideological spectrum and all over the country take tangible steps in this direction,\" he said.Where the state-level crypto efforts can be described as \"bigger steps\" — Marlowe cited Texas, Arizona, and Florida, as examples — he said it has helped to acknowledge the growing political power of crypto advocates in these states. Similarities in the actions taken across states to date include include authorizing the state treasurer or other investment official to allow the investment of a limited amount of public funds in crypto and building out the governance structure needed to invest in crypto. This often will involve more frequent reporting requirements and stronger custodial agreements compared to traditional asset classes. The seeding of the reserve can take the form of utilizing cash or government-seized crypto, as in the recent case of the federal government. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last March, but limited the authorization to seized crypto in an effort to show taxpayers would bear no financial burden.It is no surprise that Texas was the first state to fund a crypto reserve. Texas has been a crypto hub for years through its role in bitcoin mining. The state's affordable and flexible power, as well as a political environment that has largely been pro-crypto, led Texas in recent years to a sizable position in not just the national, but global bitcoin hashing market. \"Texas has spent the last few years becoming one of the key centers of bitcoin activity, especially on the mining side,\" said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab, seeing this move as one that early branded the state as \"open for business\" when it comes to digital assets.\"Once you've made that bet on infrastructure and industry, adding some Bitcoin exposure at the treasury level is a natural next step,\" Catalini said. Such a move essentially makes the state's balance sheet one that is explicitly aligned with the ecosystem it aims to attract. Texas also has a long history with bitcoin's traditional market competitor: gold. \"Texas has proven to be a bedrock of government adoption of bitcoin, starting with laws that allow for legal custody arrangements akin to gold storage laws that are well established there,\" said Nik Bhatia, founder of The Bitcoin Layer.  When it comes to storing physical gold, Texas has clear rules on storage and ownership, and even the language invoked – vaults, custodians – helps grease the wheels for crypto assets at the state level. The Texas Bullion Depository of 2015, which allowed for state-level depository of bullion and precious metals, was specifically adapted to apply to digital assets like bitcoin. The Texas Bullion Depositary was the first state-administered precious metals depository in the nation.Texas has not purchased any on-chain bitcoin. After passing the legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve that gave authorization to the state comptroller to hold the cryptocurrency, Texas purchased a stake in a bitcoin ETF — roughly $5 million in the largest bitcoin ETF, the BlackRock iShares' Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which since its launch in January 2024 has grown to over $72 billion in assets under management.  The Comptroller's office made its purchase on the morning of November 20, 2025, when the price of a single bitcoin was $91,336. As of Saturday morning, bitcoin was trading at a little over $95,000.Bhatia said the approval of bitcoin ETFs by the SEC was crucial to the state plans to be comfortable with the holdings under current U.S. securities law. \"Using ETFs is a very clean and safe way to invest in bitcoin, minimizing storage logistical risk and opting for security law protection,\" Bhatia said.Texas state officials have described this purchase — which deployed only half of the $10 million set aside by the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — as a \"placeholder\" while security and storage for raw bitcoin can be put into place.Crypto's move into core state finance and budgetingIn addition to the concept of reserve funds, states are bringing crypto into core finance functions, with an approach that balances the inherent trepidation of venturing into new terrain with a desire to be a part of the fast-moving crypto realm. New Hampshire, for example, became the first state to approve the issuance of a bitcoin-backed municipal bond last November, a $100 million issuance that would mark the first time cryptocurrency is used as collateral in the U.S. municipal bond market. The deal has not taken place yet, though plans are for the issuance to occur this year. \"The idea is they'll use bitcoin to back a municipal bond issue, the proceeds of which will then be divvied up into loans to smaller governments for economic development projects across the state,\" Marlowe said. Repayment of these loans will recapitalize the fund. It is a creative evolution in state finances, but like many of the mechanisms for crypto development at the state level, it utilizes existing financial structures and state goals, according to Marlowe, with similar public bonds in prior decades used for projects like clean water, school upgrades, and other infrastructure. \"What's different here is it's bitcoin rather than taxpayer dollars as the collateral,\" he said.In numerous states, including, Colorada, Utah, and Louisiana, crypto is now accepted as payment for taxes and other state business. As more state public finance crypto efforts develop, the shift represents a change in a core philosophy of safety and liquidity that has dominated the investing of state and local funds for centuries.  In recent decades, assets including real estate and private equity expanded the investment approach of public funds, but crypto represents not only the most recent addition, but the most volatile. \"For many in the state/local investing industry, crypto-backed assets are still far too speculative and volatile for public money,\" Marlowe said. \"But others, and I think there's a sort of generational shift in the works, see it as a reasonable store of value that is actually stronger on many other public sector values like transparency and asset integrity,\" he added. ",

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, on Feb. 3, 2025.Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesIn November, following Nvidia's latest earnings beat, CEO Jensen Huang boasted to investors about his company's position in artificial intelligence and said about the hottest startup in the space, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"While it's true that Nvidia maintains a dominant position in AI chips and is now the most valuable company in the world, competition is emerging, and OpenAI is doing everything it can to diversify as it pursues a historically aggressive expansion plan. On Wednesday, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with chipmaker Cerebras, a relatively nascent player in the space but one that's angling for the public market. It was the latest in a string of deals between OpenAI and the companies making the processors needed to build large language models and run increasingly sophisticated workloads. Last year, OpenAI committed more than $1.4 trillion to infrastructure deals with companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom, en route to commanding a $500 billion private market valuation. As OpenAI races to meet anticipated demand for its AI technology, it has signaled to the market that it wants as much processing power as it can find. Here are the major chip deals that OpenAI has signed as of January, and potential partners to keep an eye on in the future. Nvidia Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesSince its early days building out large language models, long before the launch of ChatGPT and the start of the generative AI boom, OpenAI has relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units. In 2025, that relationship went to another level. Following an investment in OpenAI in late 2024, Nvidia announced in September that it would commit $100 billion to support OpenAI as it builds and deploys at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems. A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration. Huang said in September that 10 gigawatts will equate to between 4 million and 5 million GPUs. \"This is a giant project,\" Huang told CNBC at the time. OpenAI and Nvidia said the first phase of the project is expected to come online in the second half of this year on Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform. However, during Nvidia's quarterly earnings call in November, the company said there is \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI will progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. Nvidia's first investment of $10 billion will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed, and investments will be made at then-current valuations, as CNBC previously reported.AMDLisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., displays an AMD Instinct MI455X GPU during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn October, OpenAI announced plans to deploy six gigawatts of AMD's GPUs across multiple years and multiple generations of hardware. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, which could amount to a roughly 10% stake in the company. The warrant includes vesting milestones tied to both deployment volume and AMD's share price.The companies said they plan to roll out the first gigawatt of chips in the second half of 2026, and added that the deal is worth billions of dollars, without disclosing a specific amount. \"You need partnerships like this that really bring the ecosystem together to ensure that, you know, we can really get the best technologies, you know, out there,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC at the time of the announcement.Altman planted the seeds for the deal in June, when he appeared on stage alongside Su at an AMD launch event in San Jose, California. He said OpenAI planned to use AMD's latest chips. Broadcom Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersLater that month, OpenAI and Broadcom publicly unveiled a collaboration that had been in the works for well over a year.Broadcom calls its custom AI chips XPUs, and has thus far relied on a few customers. But its pipeline of potential deals has sparked so much enthusiasm on Wall Street that Broadcom is now valued at over $1.6 trillion.OpenAI said it's designing its own AI chips and systems that will be developed and distributed by Broadcom. The companies have agreed to deploy 10 gigawatts of these custom AI accelerators.In the October release, the companies said Broadcom will aim to begin deploying racks of the AI accelerator and network systems by the second half of this year, with a goal to complete the project by the end of 2029.But Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told investors during the company's quarterly earnings call in December that he doesn't expect much revenue from the OpenAI partnership in 2026.\"We appreciate the fact that it is a multiyear journey that will run through 2029,\" Tan said. \"I call it an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed.\"  OpenAI and Broadcom did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.  Cerebras Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, speaks at the Collision conference in Toronto, June 20, 2024.Ramsey Cardy | Sportsfile | Collision | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Wednesday announced an agreement to deploy 750 megawatts of Cerebras' AI chips that will come online across multiple tranches through 2028. Cerebras builds large wafer-scale chips that can deliver responses up to 15 times faster than GPU-based systems, according to a release. The company is much smaller than Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.OpenAI's deal with Cerebras is worth more than $10 billion, and it could be a boon for the chipmaker as it weighs a potential debut on the public markets. \"We are delighted to partner with OpenAI, bringing the world's leading AI models to the world's fastest AI processor,\" Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman said in a statement. Cerebras sorely needs marquee customers. In October, the company withdrew plans for an IPO, days after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round. It had filed for a public offering a year earlier, but its prospectus revealed a heavy reliance on a single customer in the United Arab Emirates, Microsoft-backed G42, which is also a Cerebras investor.Potential partners Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, speaks during a media tour of the Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the U.S.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhere does that leave Amazon, Google and Intel, which all have their own AI chip plays?In November, OpenAI signed a $38 billion cloud deal with Amazon Web Services. OpenAI will run workloads through existing AWS data centers, but the cloud provider also plans to build out additional infrastructure for the startup as part of the agreement. Amazon is also in talks to potentially invest more than $10 billion in OpenAI, as CNBC previously reported. OpenAI could decide to use Amazon's AI chips as part of these investment discussions, but nothing official has been determined, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential. AWS announced its Inferentia chips in 2018, and the latest generation of its Trainium chips in late 2025. Google Cloud also supplies OpenAI with computing capacity thanks to a deal that was quietly finalized last year. But OpenAI said in June that it has no plans to use Google's in-house chips called tensor processing units, which Broadcom also helps produce.  Intel has been the biggest AI laggard among traditional chipmakers, which explains why the company recently took massive investments from the U.S. government and Nvidia. Reuters reported in 2024, citing people with knowledge of the discussions, that Intel had a chance to invest in OpenAI years earlier and potentially make hardware for the then-fledgling startup, offering it a way to avoid reliance on Nvidia.Intel decided against the deal, according to Reuters.In October, Intel announced a new data center GPU that it's codenamed Crescent Island and says is \"designed to meet the growing demands of AI inference workloads and will offer high memory capacity and energy-efficient performance.\" The company said \"customer sampling\" is expected in the second half of 2026.   Wall Street will hear updates on Intel's latest AI efforts when the company kicks off tech earnings season next week. — CNBC's Kif Leswing, MacKenzie Sigalos and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.WATCH: Breaking down AI chips, from Nvidia GPUs to ASICs by Google and Amazonwatch now",

    "body": "(This is the Warren Buffett Watch newsletter, news and analysis on all things Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. You can sign up here to receive it every Friday evening in your inbox.)Buffett talks about almost everythingWarren Buffett and Becky Quick covered too many topics in the interviews that aired in a two-hour special on CNBC Tuesday evening for me to write a cogent summary.\"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy\" included discussions about his inability to find a big company to purchase for Berkshire Hathaway as its cash pile moves toward $400 billion, new CEO Greg Abel, his company's future and past, the difficulty of giving away billions of dollars, and the invaluable role of luck in his success. That's not a comprehensive list.Here, however, are some brief clips and quotes that caught my attention.  Buffett on what's needed to find good businesses: \"It doesn't take a genius, and it sure doesn't take any Greek symbols or anything like that to figure out what a business is worth... If (Greg Abel) quit at high school like some of our managers have, he'd still be as smart as he is.\"Buffett on the Sunday board meeting when directors considered his recommendation they name Greg Abel as next CEO: \"(Director) Steve Burke finally said, you know, 'We don't need to sit around for three months and peer at our navel or anything on this. This is the right decision.' And so they voted to do it.\"Greg Abel speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCBuffett on Berkshire's future: \"It'll always be moving somewhat, but it'll be mostly expanding. Occasionally, there will be things that disappear ... We will have companies that 50 or 100 years from now will not be viable in the economy of that world. But we'll have a whole lot more that developed over the years. And we can go wherever the country goes, and we can go with capital.\"Why being on a corporation's board of directors is the best job in the world:\"Being a director. I mean, it's the best job in the world. You get 250, 300, even up to 500 thousand dollars a year for doing something that's quite pleasant. Usually they give you the transportation, and they have cars waiting to take you around everything. And everybody's polite. And everybody'd love that job. I mean, who wouldn't?\"Why he gave up betting on horses when he was in high school: \"One of the first things you learn in horse racing is you can beat a race, but you can't beat the races... I had a couple of horses in mind, but I lost the money on the first race. And then I did the dumbest thing you can imagine... I just kept betting every race. And when I went home, I was $50 poorer, which was all I'd taken with me... I went to the Howard Johnson's, and I had a couple of dollars left. I bought myself a fancy meal and just sat there and thought about it and thought about it on the train. And that was the end of horse racing.\"Buffett on running Berkshire for decades:\"Everything I wanted to have happen has worked out... Doesn't mean that everything we've done has worked out. But I couldn't imagine more fun than I've had running Berkshire. And Charlie and I would have more fun out of the things that didn't work a lot of times than (if they) did.\"On being a teacher on the side: \"I loved it. It appealed to my didactic style, and I liked my own ideas... I just had fun teaching. And I still do, except I ran out of gas a few years ago.\"Advice for new parents: \"The only piece of advice I give to newlyweds is don't ever use sarcasm with your children. I mean, it may be sarcasm to you, but it's a lash across the back to them they'll never forget.\"Learning and evolving:\"You should be wiser in the second half of your life than the first half. And if you've -- if things have worked well for you, you should be a better person in the second half of your life.\"On being kind: \"I would just ask anybody to challenge me on whether being kind could hurt them in any way, and whether the happiness of the world wouldn't be better if ... every morning they said to themselves, 'I'll have things that are good and bad happen to me today, but I can be kind to anybody.'\"Warren Buffett Watch's exclusive clipEven though the special was two hours long, there was more interview than time, forcing the producer to make some difficult decisions.Here for Warren Buffett Watch readers is a clip that she wanted to get into the final cut. Buffett explains why he hasn't been speaking out on politics in recent years:BECKY QUICK:  You haven't commented as much publicly lately, either. You basically save it for the annual meeting when all the shareholders come into town.WARREN BUFFETT:  Right.BECKY QUICK:  Why is that?WARREN BUFFETT:  Well, for one thing, I made the statement a few years ago — maybe, I don't know, five or six years ago — somebody asked about taking a political stance. And I said that you don't put your citizenship in a blind trust. But —BECKY QUICK:  As a CEO.WARREN BUFFETT:  And — as a CEO, yeah.You have three or four hundred thousand employees, and you have millions of shareholders, but nevertheless you were entitled — I took the position — to speak out.But I think — I've revisited that opinion in my mind, because people will have — gotten so tribal. We saw it on our gifts program at one time.But there's no reason why somebody that's answering a phone at GEICO or waiting on a customer at the Nebraska Furniture Mart should be dealing with people who have a negative opinion of the company because of something I've said.And, you know, here I am — if I want to speak as a private citizen, I should resign from Berkshire.But I don't really want — I've got identified so much with Berkshire that I — as long as I'm speaking at the annual meeting or anything like that, people will associate it with the voice of Berkshire to some extent.And the employees don't deserve that. The companies don't deserve it. And so I backed away from that.Buffett's children on philanthropy and growing up BuffettBuffett has given his three adult children the extremely difficult talk of unanimously deciding how to give away his enormous net worth after he dies.When she was in Omaha to interview their father, Becky sat down with Howard, Susan, and Peter Buffett to talk about that assignment, their own philanthropic efforts, and what it was like growing up in Buffett's famously unassuming house.An extensive portion aired in the special, but this is the entire conversation:In this excerpt, they remember how their father got \"clever\" about giving them an allowance:HOWARD BUFFETT: You know, we'd earn this allowance for cleaning out gutters and cutting the lawn and raking leaves and stuff.But he — but Warren got pretty clever and he started giving it to us in quarters.

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve officials were at odds during their October meeting over cutting interest rates, divided over whether a stalling labor market or stubborn inflation were bigger economic threats, minutes released Wednesday showed.While the Federal Open Market Committee approved a cut at the meeting, the path forward looks less certain. Disagreements stretched into the outlook for December, with officials expressing skepticism about the need for an additional reduction that markets had been widely anticipating, with \"many\" saying that no more cuts are needed at least in 2025.\"Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period,\" the minutes said. \"Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year.\"In Fed parlance, \"many\" is more than \"several,\" indicating a tilt against a December cut. However, \"participants\" does not denote voters. There are 19 participants at the meeting, but only 12 vote, so it's unclear how the voting members' sentiment is set for a December move.However, the notation jibes with a statement at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference. Powell told reporters that a December cut was not a \"foregone conclusion.\"\"In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee's December meeting,\" the minutes said.Previous to Powell's statement, traders had been pricing in a near certainty of another move at the Dec. 9-10 session. As of Wednesday afternoon, that had been reduced to about a 1 in 3 chance, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure of futures pricing. Odds for a January cut are around 66%.The minutes did note that \"most participants\" saw further cuts likely in the future, though not necessarily in December.Ultimately, the FOMC approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. But the 10-2 vote was not indicative of how split officials were at an institution not generally known for dissent.Officials generally indicated concern over a slowing labor market and inflation that has \"shown little sign of returning sustainably\" to the Fed's 2% target. The minutes reflected multiple camps within the committee.\"Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range,\" the minutes said.At the heart of the debate was a disagreement over how \"restrictive\" the current policy is for the economy. Some participants thought that even with the quarter-point cut policy was still holding back growth, while others saw that \"the resilience of economic activity\" indicated that policy is not restrictive.Judging from public statements, the panel is divided between inflation doves including Governors Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who prefer cuts as a way to stave off weakness in the labor market. On the other side are more hawkish members such as regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City, Susan Collins of Boston and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis, who worry that cutting more could prevent the Fed from getting to its 2% inflation goal.In between are moderates such as Powell, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and New York President John Williams who favor a patient approach.The minutes noted that \"one participant,\" a reference to Miran, preferred a more aggressive half-point cut. Schmid also voted no, saying he preferred not to cut at all.The meeting minutes indicated the decision-making was complicated by a lack of government data during the 44-day federal government shutdown. Reports on the labor market, inflation and a host of other metrics were not compiled or released during the impasse. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis have announced schedules for some of the releases but not all.Powell compared the situation to \"driving in the fog,\" though Waller on Monday rejected that comparison, saying the Fed has plenty of data to formulate policy.The minutes also discussed the balance sheet aspect of policy. The FOMC agreed to stop the reduction of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in December, a process that has shaved more than $2.5 trillion off the balance sheet, which is still around $6.6 trillion. There appeared to be widespread approval for the halting of a process known as quantitative tightening.",

    "body": "Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Shohei Ohtani (17) throws a pitch during the MLB game between the Philadelphia Phillies and the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 16, 2025 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, CA. Brian Rothmuller | Icon Sportswire | Getty ImagesMajor League Baseball officially announced a new three-year media rights agreement with NBC, Netflix and ESPN on Wednesday, foreshadowing the league's more significant TV deal to come in 2028.The new deal stems from ESPN's decision to opt out of its \"Sunday Night Baseball\" package earlier this year. ESPN struck a new deal with MLB, acquiring the rights to MLB.TV and a midweek game package. NBC Sports will take over the Sunday Night games, and Netflix will be the new home for the next three Home Run Derbies. All the deals begin with the 2026 season.CNBC previously reported most of the details of the agreement in August.\"Our new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee events,\" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The new deal foreshadows MLB's quest to raise TV revenue at the end of the 2028 season, when it will get these rights back plus existing broadcast rights from Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. While it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison, MLB had to take a haircut of about $300 million per year relative to what ESPN had been paying before opting out earlier this year. NBC is paying about $200 million a year for its new package, and Netflix is paying about $50 million annually for the Derby, CNBC reported in August. The two packages, together, roughly make up what ESPN had been paying for.Even so, MLB has a chance to expand its reach through the new and streaming-exclusive partners.The average ESPN Sunday Night Baseball game averaged 1.8 million viewers this past season.The loss in revenue for the Sunday Night package suggests MLB may have to get creative with the way it carves up new packages of games in 2028 to ensure it continues to grow media revenue. In aggregate, the league is now making more in overall media revenue, but it needed to sell ESPN rights and games it hadn't previously offered. ESPN is paying about $550 million for its new package, CNBC reported in August.The NBA nearly tripled its national media revenue in its most recent rights deal, and the NFL is so confident it can generate a huge increase on the deal it signed in 2021 that it's open to accelerating talks with its current media partners as early as next year, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC in September.New deal detailsESPN's new deal allows it sell and distribute MLB.TV, the league's out of market streaming service, through the ESPN app. ESPN will also receive a new 30-game midweek package of live games on ESPN's linear networks and the ESPN app. ESPN also will sell and distribute MLB Network and in-market games for select MLB teams via the ESPN app. Those teams are the Cleveland Guardians, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies — franchises whose games have been produced and distributed by MLB after the collapse of regional sports networks that carried those teams.NBC will now have MLB, NBA and NFL on Sunday for its broadcast network, its new cable sports channel, and its Peacock streaming service. NBC will also carry MLB's entire Wild Card round, ranging from eight to 12 games each season. In addition to three years of the Home Run Derby, Netflix will own the rights to a singular game on Opening Night for the next three seasons. Netflix will also exclusively deliver all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic to its audience in Japan. Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",

    "body": "Recruiters speak to job seekers at the Appalachian State University internship and job fair in Boone, North Carolina, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday it will not release a full U.S. jobs report for the month of October, following the longest federal government shutdown in the history of the country. Instead, the agency said October payroll data will be released along with a full report for November. An unemployment rate for October will not be included in those figures because the data \"could not be collected,\" the BLS said, citing the shutdown. The agency also pushed back its November jobs data release to Dec. 16 from Dec. 5. The new date is six days after the Federal Reserve concludes its final policy meeting of the year — leaving the central bank with less information on the state of the economy. The delayed September nonfarm payrolls report is scheduled to be released on Thursday.Without the full October data — and following recent hawkish commentary from some Fed officials — traders may be pricing in a lower chance of another rate reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool at midday Wednesday showed there's a 63.8% chance that the Fed keeps its overnight benchmark rate steady in the 3.75%-4% range. That's up from around 50% earlier in the day. ",

    "body": "Signage for SGX Group at the Singapore Exchange Ltd. stock exchange headquarters in Singapore, on Monday, July 14, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSingapore is doubling down on its efforts to make the city-state's stock market more attractive for companies and investors. The country's bourse has tied up with the Nasdaq to simplify dual listings in the U.S. and Singapore, introducing a \"Global Listing Board\" for companies with a market capitalization of more than 2 billion Singapore dollars (about $1.5 billion). The \"Landmark partnership\" is aimed at enabling firms to \"access global capital, investors and liquidity through a harmonized cross-border listing framework that bridges the two markets,\" according to a statement released by the Nasdaq and the Singapore Exchange late Wednesday.A key feature, the SGX said, would be the streamlining of regulatory obligations and fundraising with a single set of documents and simplified review process by mid-2026. So effectively, the companies will only need to fill a single set of paperwork fulfilling the regulations on both exchanges.Speaking to CNBC's Martin Soong, SGX CEO Loh Boon Chye said that this benefits investors, because it's a dual listing across different time zones. \"You get to have price discovery almost round the clock ... given where volatility is today, this allows investors to risk manage 24 hours, and you're also giving choices to investors, whether that could be US dollars or that could be in Sing dollars.\"Adena Friedman, CEO of Nasdaq, told CNBC that this dual listing bridge was the \"first of its kind,\" and added that it was \"something that's very exciting for companies that have an Asian footprint, want to have global exposure and have a singular regulatory experience.\"The step aligns with the broader efforts by the Singapore government to strengthen the attractiveness of Singapore's stock market to investors and companies seeking to list and access growth capital, SGX said.Stepping up The announcement also come as the Monetary Authority of Singapore revealed more measures to strengthen the competitiveness of Singapore's stock market. These include a SG$30 million \"Value Unlock\" package to help companies develop abilities in corporate strategy, capital optimization, and investor relations. \"It is an opportune time for companies to reinforce strategic fundamentals, enhance communications, and demonstrate value creation to attract and sustain investor participation,\" MAS said. The central bank also announced placing SG$2.85 billion with six asset managers in Singapore, adding on to its SG$1.1 billion allocation in July this year, aimed at developing Singapore's fund management industry and increasing investor participation in Singapore equities.CGS International analysts Lock Mun Yee and Lim Siew Kee said in a note that the liquidity boost is a positive for the Singapore stock market and new measures such the \"Value Unlock\" program are complementary to the value chain.The MAS said that it had seen \"increasing\" activity and interest in Singapore's equity market, with average daily turnover in the third quarter of 2025 climbing 16% year on year to SG$1.53 billion — the highest since the first quarter of 2021. In particular, trading activity in small- and mid-cap stocks has picked up. IPOs have also gained pace, raising over SG$2 billion so far this year. CGS International cautioned that while a potential dual listing in Singapore could broaden regional investor access, factors such as the SGX's relatively lower liquidity compared to the Nasdaq remain near-term hurdles. Analysts from Goldman Sachs said that the guidelines and enforcement details of the \"Value Unlock\" program are currently limited, adding that recent investor engagements suggest that corporate action would be required for a further re-rating of the Singapore market. Goldman pointed to Japan and South Korea that have implemented measures such as dividend tax cuts and disclosure guidelines to drive corporate action. Singapore's STI is up about 30% since the equities review group was established in August 2024, compared to the near 60% increase in Japan and South Korea's equity markets after the announcement of their respective reform measures, Goldman said.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAsian chip stocks rallied in early trading Thursday after American AI chip darling Nvidia posted strong third quarter earnings, in a sign that AI bubble concerns aren't slowing down the AI industry.  South Korea's SK Hynix pared gains to rise nearly 2%. The memory chip maker is Nvidia's top supplier of high-bandwidth memory used in AI applications. Samsung Electronics, which also supplies Nvidia with memory, was up more than 5%. The company has been working to catch up to SK Hynix in high-bandwidth memory to land more contracts with Nvidia. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, which produces most of Nvidia's chip designs, rose over 4% in Taipei.  Hon Hai Precision Industry — also known as Foxconn, and manufacturer of server racks designed for AI workloads — climbed 3.28%.The Asian chip giants' rally comes after Nvidia's earnings topped Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, with the company providing a stronger-than-expected sales guidance for the fourth quarter.Nvidia's sales and outlook are closely watched by the technology industry as a sign of the health of the AI boom, and its earnings come against the backdrop of recent market fears regarding an AI bubble. However, the company's strong results and forecasts should ease immediate AI bubble concerns, Rolf Bulk, equity research analyst at New Street Research, told CNBC.\"Demand is diversified, with AI-native companies deploying agentic AI solutions, and enterprises increasingly integrating AI across their existing products and services,\" Bulk said. \"We expect Nvidia's results to drive higher earnings estimates across the sector, including for its primary GPU supplier TSMC, memory vendors SK Hynix and Samsung, and the broader Asian subcomponent and assembly value chain,\" he added.In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics, a key Nvidia supplier, pared gains to rise 1.51%. Tokyo Electron, which provides essential chipmaking equipment to foundries that manufacture Nvidia's chips, gained 5.67%. Another Japanese chip equipment maker, Lasertec, was up more than 6%. Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank skyrocketed nearly 7% at the open and was last trading 2.66%, though the firm recently offloaded its shares of Nvidia. Softbank owns the majority of British semiconductor company Arm, which supplies Nvidia with chip architecture and designs.SoftBank is also involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told investors on an earnings call. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"— CNBC's Nur Hikmah Md Ali contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Job seekers speak with recruiters during the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday will release the September nonfarm payrolls number, ending a shutdown-induced blackout on official jobs data, albeit with a decidedly rear-window view.Due at 8:30 a.m. ET, the release is forecast to show a gain of 50,000 jobs in the public and private sectors, up from the initially reported 22,000 in August but still indicative of a soft labor market.Though the report will be backward-looking, it at least will provide some fodder for investors, economists and Federal Reserve officials who have had to rely on a host of private alternative data during the record-long shutdown in Washington, D.C. It will be the first BLS jobs report since the August release on Sept. 5.\"My sense is that the both the September report and the revisions for July and August will suggest a little bit brighter outlook than is commonly assumed, but not much to brag about,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"The labor market is holding in there, just like the economy.\"Coming a week after the government impasse ended, the data also is expected to show the unemployment rate at 4.3% while average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.7% from a year ago, all numbers unchanged from August, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates.Because the numbers are from September, they will provide only a little help for policymakers trying to navigate a difficult landscape and could be disregarded by markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently referred to the situation as \"driving in the fog\" and cautioned against looking at further interest rate cuts as guaranteed while officials look for direction.While one month's jobs report will help clear up some of the way, visibility will remain limited.'Pervasive uncertainty'The BLS on Wednesday updated its release dates for the data points it produces.The bureau will not release October's jobs report separately, instead including it with the November report, which has been pushed to Dec. 16 from its original release date of Dec. 5. There will be no unemployment rate released for October due to household data that the BLS will not be able to collect. Similarly, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey will see a combined September and October release on Dec. 9.The BLS on Oct. 24 released September's consumer price index report only because it is used as a benchmark for Social Security cost of living adjustments.\"The economy is muddling through a period of pervasive uncertainty,\" Brusuelas said. \"Because of the duration of the shutdown, I don't think we're going to get a clean reading until early February on where the labor market's at.\"Nevertheless, other data, such as the private payrolls running tally from ADP along with layoff announcements from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas and a host of other indicators are providing some clues on where the labor market stands.In fact, Fed Governor Christopher Waller in a speech Monday rejected the notion that the Fed doesn't have enough data to make decisions.\"Policymakers and forecasters are not 'flying blind' or 'in a fog,'\" Waller said in a speech advocating a December rate cut. \"While it is always nice to have more data, as economists, we are skilled at using whatever available data there is to formulate forecasts.\"Judging by data revealed so far, Goldman Sachs holds an above-consensus view of 80,000 jobs created in September but sees a decline of 50,000 in October, due largely to the expiration of the federal government's deferred resignation program from cuts associated with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\"While we do not expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to produce an October unemployment rate, we estimate it likely would have increased, reflecting upward pressure from shutdown-related furloughs and increases in broader measures of labor market slack,\" Goldman economists Ronnie Walker and Jessica Rindels said in a note.In addition to the September headline number, Thursday's report also will include revisions for July and August. Both Brusuelas and the Goldman economists said they expect those numbers to come in higher than the previous counts.",

South Florida Sun-sentinel | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury charged U.S. Rep. Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick, D-Fla., with stealing $5 million in Covid-19 disaster funds — a chunk of which was then illegally contributed to her 2021 congressional campaign, the Department of Justice said Wednesday. Cherfilus-McCormick and her brother, Edwin Cherfilus, tried to launder the money through multiple accounts to disguise its source, the DOJ said, citing the indictment issued in U.S. District Court in Miami.The siblings obtained the money in July 2021, after the family health-care company where they worked received a $5 million overpayment from FEMA, which funded the company's Covid vaccination staffing contract, according to the DOJ.Cherfilus-McCormick and another defendant, Nadege Leblanc, are also accused of orchestrating a \"straw donor\" scheme in which money from the FEMA contract was sent to friends and relatives, who then donated it back to her campaign for Congress.Cherfilus-McCormick joined the House in 2022 after winning a special election that January to fill late Rep. Alcee Hastings' seat representing Florida's 20th Congressional District.The congresswoman and her 2021 tax preparer, David Spencer, are also charged in the indictment with conspiring to file a false tax return, the DOJ said. They claimed personal and political expenses as business deductions and \"inflated charitable contributions in order to reduce her tax obligations,\" the indictment alleges.Cherfilus-McCormick faces a possible maximum sentence of 53 years in prison if convicted, the DOJ said in a press release. Actual sentences are often significantly lower than the maximums due to judges' discretion and federal sentencing guidelines.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov.

We will fight to clear her good name.\"Cherfilus-McCormick has been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee, the panel revealed in late May.The Office of Congressional Conduct sent a referral to that committee in May 2024, laying out a number of possible violations. Cherfilus-McCormick \"may have requested community project funding that would be directed to a for-profit entity,\" the office said in that referral.Edwin Cherfilus faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted of the charges announced Wednesday, while Spencer faces up to 33 years, and Leblanc faces a 10-year maximum sentence.",

Chesnot | Getty ImagesPalo Alto Networks beat Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates after the bell on Wednesday and announced plans to buy cloud observability platform Chronosphere for $3.35 billion. The stock fell about 3%.Here's how the company did versus LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 89 cents expectedRevenue: $2.47 billion vs. $2.46 billion expectedRevenues grew 16% from $2.1 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $334 million, or 47 cents per share, from $351 million, or 49 cents per share in the year-ago period. Palo Alto's Chronosphere deal is slated to close in the second half of its fiscal 2026. The cybersecurity provider is also in the process of buying Israeli identity security firm CyberArk for $25 billion under CEO Nikesh Arora's acquisition spree.He told investors in an earnings call that Palo Alto is making this simultaneous acquisition to address the fast-moving AI cycle.\"This large surge towards building AI compute is causing a lot of the AI players to think about newer models for software stacks and infrastructure stacks in the future,\" he said. Palo Alto guided for revenues between $2.57 billion and $2.59 billion in the second quarter, the midpoint of which was in line with a $2.58 billion estimate. For the full year, the company expects $10.50 billion to $10.54 billion, versus a $10.51 billion estimate. Capital expenditures during the period were much higher than expectations at $84 million. StreetAccount expected $58.1 million. Remaining purchase obligations, which tracks backlog, grew to $15.5 billion and topped a $15.43 billion estimate. The rise of artificial intelligence has also stirred up increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and contributed to tools for customers.

    "body": "watch nowBlock said Wednesday that it expects gross profit to increase in the mid-teens annually for the next three years, reaching about $15.8 billion in 2028. At the payment company's first investor day event since 2022, Block unveiled a three-year financial outlook. The announcements land as Wall Street has turned skeptical on Block's prospects, pushing the stock down by more than 30% in 2025, while major indexes have notched solid gains. Block shares were initially halted around the time of the announcement and then jumped 9% when trading resumed. The fresh guidance also comes two weeks after Block reported quarterly results, missing revenue estimates for a sixth straight time. Block has been diversifying away from its point-of-sale business, which has become increasingly crowded, launching more services tied to Cash App and offering artificial intelligence tools to sellers. Block said in its new outlook that adjusted operating income is projected to increase about 30% annually, topping $4.6 billion by 2028. Adjusted earnings per share will grow in the low 30% range, reaching $5.50 in three years.Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told CNBC ahead of the release that the company is entering a new phase of execution. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlock vs. Nasdaq this year\"Since 2022, our last investor day, we're nearly double the size from a gross profit perspective,\" Ahuja said, adding that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \"more than tripled.\"Block also introduced a new non-GAAP cash flow metric, designed to reflect the capital required to grow its lending products, which it expects to reach more than $4 billion, or 25% of gross profit, by 2028.For 2026, Block expects gross profit to rise 17% to $11.98 billion, with adjusted operating income and EPS both increasing more than 30%, to $2.7 billion and $3.20, respectively.Ahuja said Block has adopted a \"rule of 40\" investment framework. That typically refers to revenue growth rate plus profit margin exceeding 40. She said the company expects to reach that metric this year and has reorganized around a single roadmap with a shared technical infrastructure. \"That transformation has resulted in us moving faster, with more connected decisions across our ecosystem,\" Ahuja said. On Wednesday, Block also expanded its share repurchase program by $5 billion, adding to the $1.1 billion in remaining authorization as of Sept. 30. The prior buyback plan was for up to $4 billion in purchases. Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who co-founded the company as Square in 2009, was in attendance at the investor event. Dorsey has largely been out of public view in recent years. WATCH: Block shares drop more than 8% on quarterly misswatch now",

There are also administrative controls that district leaders can use to determine how ChatGPT for Teachers will work within their communities. OpenAI said it is initially launching ChatGPT for Teachers with a cohort of districts that represent roughly 150,000 educators. ChatGPT for Teachers will be free to K-12 educators in the U.S. through June 2027, the company said. \"Our objective here is to make sure that teachers have access to AI tools as well as a teacher-focused experience so they can truly guide AI use,\" Leah Belsky, vice president of education at OpenAI, told reporters during a briefing. The company said student data will be protected and that anything shared within ChatGPT for Teachers will not be used to train its models. Read more CNBC tech newsAnthropic valued in range of $350 billion following investment deal with Microsoft, NvidiaZoox begins offering robotaxi rides in San Francisco, facing off with WaymoGoogle announces Gemini 3 as battle with OpenAI intensifiesCloudflare blames 'unusual' spike in traffic before massive outageOpenAI rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its generic ChatGPT chatbot in 2022.

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk (L) talks with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum at the Kennedy Center on Nov. 19, 2025 in Washington, DC.Win McNamee | Getty ImagesNvidia and xAI said on Wednesday that a large data center facility being built in Saudi Arabia and equipped with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips will count Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup as its first customer.Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang were both in attendance at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C.The announcement builds on a partnership from May, when Nvidia said it would provide Saudi Arabia's Humain with chips that use 500 megawatts of power. On Wednesday, Humain said the project would include about 600,000 Nvidia graphics processing units. Humain was launched earlier this year and is owned by the Saudi Public Investment Fund. The plan to build the data center was initially announced when Huang visited Saudi Arabia alongside President Donald Trump. \"Could you imagine, a startup company approximately 0 billion dollars in revenues, now going to build a data center for Elon,\" Huang said. The facility is one of the most prominent examples of what Nvidia calls \"sovereign AI.\" The chipmaker has said that nations will increasingly need to build data centers for AI in order to protect national security and their culture. It's also a potentially massive market for Nvidia's pricey AI chips beyond a handful of hyperscalers.Huang's appearance at an event supported by President Trump is another sign of the administration's focus on AI. Huang has become friendly with the president as Nvidia lobbies to gain licenses to ship future AI chips to China. When announcing the agreement, Musk, who was a major figure in the early days of the second Trump administration, briefly mixed up the size of the data center, which is measured in megawatts, a unit of power. He joked that plans for a data center that would be 1,000 times larger would have to wait. \"That will be eight bazillion, trillion dollars,\" Musk joked.Humain won't just use Nvidia chips. Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm will also sell chips and AI systems to Humain. AMD CEO Lisa Su and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon both attended a state dinner on Tuesday to honor Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. AMD will provide chips that may require as much as 1 gigawatt of power by 2030. The company said the chips that it would provide are its Instinct MI450 GPUs for AI. Cisco will provide additional infrastructure for the data center, AMD said.Qualcomm will sell Humain its new data center chips that were first revealed in October, called the AI200 and AI250. Humain will deploy 200 megawatts of Qualcomm chips, the company said.WATCH: Qualcomm CEO on new AI chipswatch now",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (L), and Jensen Huang CEO of Nvidia.ReutersTwo months ago Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stood side by side in San Jose, California, to announce a historic agreement between the two leaders in artificial intelligence. Nvidia would invest $100 billion over a number of years, starting in 2026, as OpenAI's AI supercomputing facilities come online, the duo said. The timing of the buildouts and the cost of each data center weren't disclosed. But in Nvidia's quarterly financial report on Wednesday, the chipmaker reminded investors that there's a big difference between an announcement and a contract. \"There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms,\" Nvidia said in the risk factors section of its quarterly filing.Nvidia has been on an investing binge of late, putting its ever-expanding cash hoard to use, and financially supporting companies that buy its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In addition to the OpenAI arrangement, Nvidia on Wednesday highlighted its $5 billion commitment to invest in Intel during the quarter and its agreement this week to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic.An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment but pointed to Huang's statements on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"\"There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all,\" Nvidia said. The key difference with OpenAI is the scale of the planned investment and the benchmarks that would need to be met for all the money to come through. A source told CNBC at the time of the announcement that an initial $10 billion would be available to OpenAI soon to help the company work towards deploying its first gigawatt of capacity.Altman said recently that OpenAI will end the year on a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate, which is a massive number considering its flagship ChatGPT product is only three years old. Altman said the company expects to reach hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue by 2030. But that figure doesn't come anywhere close to covering the company's expenses. In total, OpenAI has announced roughly $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending with a number of partners as it seeks to continue building out its AI models and services. To get there, the company is reliant on outside capital. Despite the uncertainty of the September agreement, Nvidia executives continue to sound bullish on the company's work with OpenAI. On Nvidia's earnings call, after the chipmaker reported a solid revenue and earnings beat along with stronger-than-expected guidance, CFO Colette Kress touted OpenAI's growth.\"OpenAI recently shared that their weekly user base has grown to 800 million, enterprise customers has increased to 1 million and that their gross margins were healthy,\" Kress said. She added that the two companies are \"working on a strategic partnership\" and that Nvidia is \"focused on helping them build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers.\"And Huang said, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment, but pointed to Huang's commentary on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"There's no question that as OpenAI builds out data centers, it will keep spending money on Nvidia's chips. But OpenAI has also partnered with Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices, agreeing last month to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware, beginning in the second half of next year. The AMD agreement has one critical component that Nvidia's lacks: signatures. As part of the pact, the company has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock, with vesting milestones tied to deployment volume and AMD's share price. That agreement was signed on Oct. 5, by AMD CFO Jean Hu and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar. — CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

    "body": "Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta, speaks at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, June 13, 2023.Chesnot | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesYann LeCun, known as one of the godfathers of modern artificial intelligence and one of the first AI visionaries to join the company then known as Facebook, is leaving Meta.LuCun said in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday that he plans to create a startup that specializes in a kind of AI technology that researchers have described as world models, analyzing information beyond web data in order to better represent the physical world and its properties. \"I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond,\" LeCun wrote. \"The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.\"Meta will partner with LeCun's startup.The departure comes at a time of disarray within Meta's AI unit, which was dramatically overhauled this year after the company released the fourth version of its Llama open-source large language model to a disappointing response from developers. That spurred CEO Mark Zuckerberg to spend billions of dollars recruiting top AI talent, including a June $14.5 billion investment in Scale AI to lure the startup's 28-year-old CEO Alexandr Wang, now Meta's new chief AI officer.LeCun, 65, joined Facebook in 2013 to be director of the FAIR AI research division while maintaining a part-time professorial position at New York University. He said in the LinkedIn post that the \"creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment.\"\"I am extremely grateful to Mark Zuckerberg, Andrew Bosworth, Chris Cox, and Mike Schroepfer for their support of FAIR, and for their support of the AMI program over the last few years,\" LeCun said. \"Because of their continued interest and support, Meta will be a partner of the new company.\"At the time, Facebook and Google were heavily recruiting high-level academics like LeCun to spearhead their efforts to produce cutting-edge computer science research that could potentially benefit their core businesses and products.LeCun, along with other AI luminaries like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, centered their academic research on a kind of AI technique known as deep learning, which involves the training of enormous software systems called neural networks so they can discover patterns within reams of data. The researchers helped popularize the deep learning approach, and in 2019 won the prestigious Turing Award, presented by the Association for Computing Machinery.Since then, LeCun's approach to AI development has drifted from the direction taken by Meta and the rest of Silicon Valley.Meta and other tech companies like OpenAI have spent billions of dollars in developing so-called foundation models, particularly LLMs, as part of their efforts to advance state-of-the-art computing. However, LeCun and other deep-learning experts, have said that these current AI models, while powerful, have a limited understanding of the world, and new computing architectures are needed for researchers to create software that's on par with or surpasses humans on certain tasks, a notion known as artificial general intelligence.\"As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta's commercial interests, but many of which do not,\" LeCun said in the post. \"Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact.\"Besides Wang, other recent notables that Zuckerberg brought in to revamp Meta's AI unit include former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads the unit's product team, and ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao, the group's chief scientist.In October, Meta laid off 600 employees from its Superintelligence Labs division, including some who were part of the FAIR unit that LeCun helped get off the ground. Those layoffs and other cuts to FAIR over the years, coupled with a new AI leadership team, played a major role in LeCun's decision to leave, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.Additionally, LeCun rarely interacted with Wang nor TBD Labs unit, which is comprised of many of the headline-grabbing hires Zuckerberg made over the summer. TBD Labs oversees the development of Meta's Llama AI models, which were originally developed within FAIR, the people said.While LeCun was always a champion of sharing AI research and related technologies to the open-source community, Wang and his team favor a more closed approach amid intense competition from rivals like OpenAI and Google, the people said.WATCH: Meta is a table pounder here.",

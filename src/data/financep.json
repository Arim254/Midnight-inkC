    "body": "Gold and silver have rallied this year — and prices keep climbing.Gold futures for February delivery rose settled 0.8% higher at $4,505.7, after hitting a record of $4,530.80 per ounce. Spot gold was up 1.03% to $4,491.23 per ounce. Meanwhile silver futures for March advanced 4.46% and was last seen at $71.62 per ounce, while spot silver was last trading at $71.4449, up 3.51%. Spot silver crossed $70 for the first time earlier in the session.   The metals have soared this year, smashing consecutive price records as sentiment shook on riskier assets amid fears of an AI bubble and uncertainty over the next Federal Reserve chair looking into 2026. Gold is typically viewed as a safe bet in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty and is often used as a hedge.watch nowThe futures prices represent a fresh highs for the metals, topping Monday's record-breaking moves. David Neuhauser, CIO at Livermore Partners, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" that gold has more room to run — potentially hitting $6,000 per ounce. \"I think all metals, for the most part, are rising because they have been under-owned and there's a further risk that global debt around the world is just exploding, and therefore you need to own assets which will defend against that debasement. That's what you're seeing now. It's loud and clear, but it could continue for some time to come,\" Neuhauser said. ",

Known for its beer brewing business, Sapporo is looking to concentrate management resources on its core operations, and plans to use the funds generated from the sale to invest in its beer business and other areas. \"Sapporo Holdings will focus on and further strengthen its alcoholic beverages business, where it has competitive advantages,\" the statement said.

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. watch nowFrench President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. \"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

    "body": "A fire engulfing a residential building complex at Wang Fuk Court in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhat a year this has been. Understandably for many, it could not be over soon enough. From the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs to natural and man-made disasters across Asia. To new leaders breaking glass ceilings and old leaders whisked off to The International Criminal Court, or even sentenced to death in absentia. Missiles fired across borders. Terrorist attacks in South Asia and the Pacific. Enduring corruption challenges and real estate woes. And people scammed and enslaved. As 2025 comes to a close, we look back and see who had it bad and who had it good. Worst year: Asia's cyber scam victimsThe year saw a growing tsunami of cybercrime sweeping across the globe, emanating from Southeast Asia. Criminal gangs largely operating out of Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia defrauded billions of dollars from victims worldwide.The \"perpetrators\" are also the victims. Hundreds of thousands of individuals enticed with fake employment offers to these nations, many transiting via Thailand, then held against their will, enslaved to work in these scam centers.The year saw a growing tsunami of cybercrime sweeping across the globe, emanating from Southeast Asia. Sarayut Thaneerat | Moment | Getty ImagesThe kidnapping of Chinese actor Wang Xing, who was lured by a fraudulent acting gig, then forced to work in one operation in January 2025, brought heightened attention to this growing crisis. Even the Trump administration took notice. \"The scam centers are creating a generational wealth transfer from Main Street America into the pockets of Chinese organized crime,\" said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. Weak governments and corruption allow these multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprises to function, despite high-profile efforts to free captives and close compounds that have operated with near impunity in Southeast Asia. Unless stopped, these operations will only grow more sophisticated as they begin to use AI and deepfakes to perpetrate their crimes. Asia's enslaved cyber scam victims earn the distinction of having the worst year in Asia, with sadly far too little hope for escape and rescue in sight. Bad year: casualties of earth, wind, water and fireThe death count across large swaths of Asia seemed to accelerate by the year's end. Throughout all of 2025, too many people fell victim to natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods, seemingly made worse by human corruption or ineptness. A March 28 earthquake in Myanmar killed more than 3,600, displaced some 200,000 and even brought down a skyscraper under construction across the border in distant Bangkok, killing dozens more. From Sri Lanka to Thailand to Indonesia to Vietnam to Malaysia and the Philippines, floods, mudslides and typhoons combined to impact millions and kill more than 1,600. Add fire to the mix. The year closed with the horrific Wang Fuk Court apartment complex fire in Tai Po, Hong Kong. Televised scenes of towering infernos were seen worldwide. Inoperable fire alarms and below-grade construction materials reportedly contributed to the heartbreaking tragedy, with at least 160 people dead —  making it one of the deadliest fires in the city's history. Mixed Year: Gen Z uprisingsArmed with memes, hashtags and reels and some waving the Jolly Roger Flag popularized by the Japanese anime and manga series \"One Piece,\" Gen Zers hungering for change had a mixed year in 2025.  Many in this cohort of young people born between 1997 and 2012 took to the streets, including in Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines, the Maldives and even in the new ASEAN member state Timor-Leste, to protest corruption, nepotism and economic inequality. The results were decidedly mixed though their frustrations seemed all too common in Asia. The Gen-Z group escalates their ongoing demonstrations, confronting police outside the Prime Minister's official residence in Kathmandu, Nepal, on November 26, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThese \"digital natives\" succeeded in bringing down Nepal's government. Last year, this generation had played a key role in toppling the government of Bangladesh. In other countries, small concessions were achieved in 2025. Yet, at year-end, the question remains whether Gen Z — the first generation to fully grow up in the internet era — is able to maintain momentum and turn these uprisings into a viable movement for constructive change. The shared hope remains for a political force that can reform entrenched and corrupt systems, alleviate the youth's deep frustration with the status quo and bring about more economic opportunities. To quote Monkey D. Luffy from \"One Piece,\" \"If you don't take risks, you can't create a future.\" Good Year: Asia's 'Bamboo Economic Tactics' Resilience was in full display across Asia's slowing but still growing economies at year-end. Leaders across the region adopted flexible strategies — akin to bamboo bending in high winds — to navigate Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. Indeed, it proved a good year for \"bamboo economic tactics\" as the region's reputation for pragmatism held and countries were able to manage the new global economic reality. This approach led to reduced U.S. tariffs — down from duties proposed initially — and revamped trade configurations and new economic strategies.Asian countries were able to manage the new global economic reality, entering into deals that cut U.S. tariffs. Ignatiev | E+ | Getty ImagesOne example is the India, Canada and Australia cooperation agreement on technology and innovation, underscoring Asian nations' own \"Art of the Deal.\" Recalibrating economic approach allowed developing Asia to achieve growth hovering around 5% for the year, according to the Asian Development Bank. This also kept Asia on track overall as the world's fastest-growing region in the world. Best Year: Chinese Soft PowerIf tech and creative content are the new soft power, this past year showed that \"Made In China\" could be a contender, with Beijing joining the ranks of the United States and Korea as a soft-power giant.  The year began with the January surprise: the launch of DeepSeek'a low-cost AI model in a world once-enamored by ChatGPT and American tech prowess. By year-end, the \"ugly-cute\" Pop Mart collectible, Labubu, had taken the world by a storm, even appearing in New York City's iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Labubu is part of a larger group of characters called \"The Monsters,\" created by Hong Kong artist and author Kasing Lung.The Friends-giving in POPCITY float is prepared on the eve of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade 2025 on Manhattan's upper west side in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersFrom BYD electric vehicles to the biggest animated film in the world ever — Ne Zha 2 that reportedly grossed more than $2 billion — to Li-Ning sneakers appearing on NBA courts and Luckin Coffee shops opening at a rapid pace throughout Asia and the United States, Chinese soft power was clearly on the rise in 2025, and so receives the distinction for having the best year in Asia.

    "body": "watch nowCitadel plans to return about $5 billion in profits earned in 2025 back to investors at the beginning of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The firm's flagship multistrategy fund, known as Wellington, gained 9.3% in the year through last week, the person said, who asked not to be named discussing performance details. The profit being returned is not all that was generated in 2025, the person said, but rather, a way of constraining capital to better match what the firm sees as the opportunity set going into the new year. As such, Citadel will start 2026 with $67 billion in assets, down from the $72 billion it currently manages, the person said. A spokesperson for Citadel declined to comment. The firm does not opt for profit distributions every year, but since 2017 (and including what's expected to be given back this year), Citadel has returned $32 billion in profit to its investors. Citadel has been ranked the most profitable hedge fund based on net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Through 2024, Citadel has generated $83 billion in net gains since it was founded in 1990. It is anticipated that number will jump to more than $88 billion when the new rankings come out in January.",

Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines' profit fell 42% in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2024. But its stock has been on a tear.Shares of Southwest are up nearly 24% so far in 2025, more than any other U.S. passenger carrier. Industry profit leaders Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have risen about 17% each this year.Southwest stock this week hit a 2½ year high. Analysts and investors have high hopes for the carrier next year, when it completes its planned transformation from a one-size-all-fits airline to one that looks more like its larger rivals.\"What's helping Southwest's stock is clearly the initiatives, not the [demand] environment, because if it was you'd see it in all the other stocks as well,\" said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSouthwest Airlines stock compared with the NYSE Arca Airline indexStarting Jan. 27, Southwest is ditching open seating and moving to assigned seats on its all-Boeing 737 fleet. The first rows of seats have extra legroom — for a fee. Seat prices vary, but, for example, a Baltimore to Las Vegas flight in early February showed the seats going for about $80 each way. Southwest in October forecast that assigned seating and extra legroom seats could drive $1 billion in pretax earnings next year and $1.5 billion in pretax earnings in 2027.\"Because the assigned seating, the extra legroom, kicks in and there's a lot of value in that, of course, [results are] going to be better year over year,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC on Dec. 10. \"The bookings that we're seeing reflect the business case for assigned seating and extra legroom.\"Barclays upgraded Southwest's stock earlier this month, with transportation analyst Brandon Oglenski forecasting Southwest's adjusted earnings will be above $4 per share next year and surpass $6 per share in 2027.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesThe end of the cattle call boarding lineup comes months after the Dallas carrier got rid of another decades-old policy: two free checked bags for customers.

    "body": "People gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a rare blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting his bid to overrule a lower court order and allow the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of local and state leaders.The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case in October after a District Court judge blocked the president's plans to send troops to aid in an immigration crackdown. The court on Tuesday declined Trump's request.\"Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a post on X.\"This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump's march toward authoritarianism,\" Pritzker continued.U.S. presidents can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, but guardsmen are typically not permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. Trump's attempts to send troops to mostly blue cities to fight crime have tested the bounds of presidential authority and led to a series of lawsuits. Citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by the Constitution or Congress, the court found Trump lacked the authority to deploy troops to Illinois in this case.\"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,\" the unsigned order states.The order is not final, but for now bars the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Chicago.Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch offered dissenting opinions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion.Trump has sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Portland in recent months, despite objections from local leaders. Those deployments have resulted in several lawsuits, including a legal challenge from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and Trump foil, and local officials in D.C.\"The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday.\"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,\" Jackson continued. \"Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The Administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",

    "body": "Annealed neodymium iron boron magnets sit in a barrel at a Neo Material Technologies Inc. factory in Tianjin, China on June 11, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRare earth magnet makers are having a moment as Western nations scramble to build domestic \"mine-to-magnet\" supply chains and reduce their dependence on China.A turbulent year of supply restrictions and tariff threats has thrust the strategic importance of magnet manufacturers firmly into the spotlight, with rare earths surging toward the top of the agenda amid the U.S. and China's ongoing geopolitical rivalry. Magnets made from rare earths are vital components for everything from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones to medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications, and precision weaponry.It's in this context that the U.S., European Union and Australia, among others, have sought to break China's mineral dominance by taking a series of strategic measures to support magnet makers, including heavily investing in factories, supporting the buildout of new plants, and boosting processing capacity.The U.S. and Europe, in particular, are expected to emerge as key growth markets for rare earth magnet production over the next decade. Analysts, however, remain skeptical that Western nations will be able to escape China's mineral orbit anytime soon.\"Frankly, we were the solution to the problem that the world didn't know it had,\" Rahim Suleman, CEO of Canadian group Neo Performance Materials, told CNBC by video call. Photo taken on Sept. 19, 2025 shows rare-earth magnetic bars at NEO magnetic plant in Narva, a city in northeastern Estonia. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\"The end-market is growing from the point of physics, not software, so therefore it has to grow in this way,\" he continued. \"And it's not dependent on any single end market, so it's not dependent on automotive or battery electric vehicles or drones or wind farms. It's any energy-efficient motor across the spectrum,\" Suleman said, referring to the demand for magnets from fast-growing industries such as robotics. His comments came around three months after Neo launched the grand opening of its rare earth magnet factory in Narva, Estonia. Situated directly on Russia's doorstep, the facility is widely expected to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China. European Union industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, for example, lauded the plant's strategic importance, saying at an event in early December that the project marked \"a high point of Europe's sovereignty.\" watch nowNeo's Suleman said the Estonian facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond.\"Globally, the market is 250,000 tons and going to 600,000 tons, so more than doubling in ten years,\" Suleman said. \"And more importantly, our concentration is 93% in a single jurisdiction, so when you put those two factors together, I think you'll find an enormously quick growing market.\"'Skyrocketing demand'To be sure, the global supply of rare earths has long been dominated by Beijing. China is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency.A recent report from consultancy IDTechEx estimated that rare earth magnet capacity in the U.S. is on track to grow nearly six times by 2036, with the expansion driven by strategic support and funding from the Department of Defense, as well as increasing midstream activity. Magnet production in Europe, meanwhile, was forecast to grow 3.1 times over the same time period, bolstered by the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's demand by 2030.  Regional composition of rare earths and permanent magnet production in 2024, according to data compiled by the International Energy Agency.IEAJohn Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based rare earth magnet producer, told CNBC that the company is seeking to scale up as fast as possible \"so that this fundamental supply chain doesn't hold America back.\" Vulcan Elements is one of the companies to have received direct funding from the Trump administration. The magnet maker received a $620 million direct federal loan last month from the Department of Defense to support domestic magnet production.\"Rare earth magnets convert electricity into motion, which means that virtually all advanced machines and technologies—the innovations that shape our daily lives and keep us safe—require them in order to be operational,\" Maslin told CNBC by email. \"The need for high-performance magnets is accelerating exponentially amid a surge in demand and production of advanced technologies, including hard disk drives, semiconductor fabrication equipment, hybrid/electric motors, satellites, aircraft, drones, and almost every military capability,\" he added. Read moreSeparately, Wade Senti, president of Florida-based magnet maker Advanced Magnet Lab, said the only way to deliver on alternative supply chains is to be innovative.\"The demand for non-China sourced rare earth permanent magnets is skyrocketing,\" Senti told CNBC by email. \"The challenge is can United States magnet producers create a fully domestic (non-China) supply chain for these magnets. This requires the magnet manufacturer to take the lead and bring the supply chain together – from mine to magnet to customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "Novo Nordisk shares received a much-needed end of the year boost as the Wegovy maker became the first drugmaker to secure approval of a GLP-1 pill for weight loss, in what one analyst called a \"redemption for the investors\" after the stock's worst year ever. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which has also filed for FDA approval for its oral weight loss drug orforglipron.\"As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey,\" said Novo CEO Mike Doustdar in a statement late Monday.Shares closed 9.2% higher Tuesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEli Lilly shares have outperformed Novo Nordisk in 2025.Novo plans to launch oral Wegovy, or \"Wegovy-in-a-pill,\" in the U.S. – by far its largest market– in early January 2026. The company has also submitted the pill for approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities.Wegovy's starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month, Novo said.Cash-paying patients can access it for the same price via President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, according to the deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Drug pricing has been top of mind this year as the U.S. looks to reduce the costs paid by consumers.Redemption for investors?The approval caps a turbulent year for Novo, which has been marked by multiple guidance cuts, mass layoffs, dramatic leadership shakeups, and a high-profile public bidding war against U.S. rival Pfizer.Novo's latest news \"is a redemption for the investors,\" Danish Jyske Bank analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told CNBC, especially after a year in which shares halved in value as confidence faltered in Novo's ability to compete with Eli Lilly and others.\"A welcome 'Christmas gift' for Novo investors — and for patients as New Year weight-loss resolutions typically kick in — given that Novo expects to launch the product in early January 2026,\" Hallengreen Laustsen said.\"The Wegovy pill represents a key growth driver over the coming years and a critical competitive tool versus Eli Lilly, which is expected to receive approval for its oral obesity drug in March–April 2026,\" he said, adding that the Wegovy pill's approval covers both weight management and reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. watch nowNovo's clinical data looks \"fantastic,\" Rajesh Kumar, who heads up European life Sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"Efficacy-wise, Novo's product, on the clinical trials at least, looks better,\" Kumar said. \"Tolerability looks quite attractive compared to [Lilly's orforglipron].The Wegovy pill has so far shown that it can help patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over about a year. Meanwhile, Lilly's pill resulted in 12.4% weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.\"Novo actually might have an edge, and it will entirely depend on how they execute,\" he added. Even so, oral Wegovy must be taken on an empty stomach, and that might make it easier for doctors to prescribe orforglipron — which doesn't have the same restrictions — to patients because of compliance, Kumar noted. Novo has said it doesn't see oral Wegovy's food restriction as a significant barrier, as it can be taken in the morning on an empty stomach and then only requires patients to wait about 30 minutes before eating.Lilly reported positive findings from a maintenance trial where patients switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy. This may help Lilly \"keep a bit of market share,\" Kumar said. \"That's the thing we have to watch,\" he added. Worst year everEven as analysts and investors alike are mostly optimistic about the Wegovy pill U.S. launch, investors will be watching how Novo and its new pill will fare in relation to Lilly's oral version. A first-mover advantage is no guarantee for future sector dominance and success.Ozempic, which contains the same active ingredient semaglutide as Wegovy but is approved for treating type 2 diabetes, had a four-year head start on Lilly rival Mounjaro. Still, Lilly has now overtaken Novo in terms of U.S. prescriptions as Novo has struggled to meet demand, allowing a market for compounding pharmacies to flourish. Lilly's jabs have also been shown to lead to greater weight loss.It has led Novo shares to plummet about 50% in 2025, in the stock's worst year on record.Investors have also voiced concerns about Novo's pipeline and how it might not stack up to Lilly's and other hopeful market entrants such as heavyweights Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Roche.— CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates quickly enough, even though the U.S. economy grew at a much faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter.Hassett, a leading contender to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, said the artificial intelligence boom is boosting economic growth while simultaneously putting downward pressure on inflation. \"If you look at central banks around the world, the U.S. is way behind the curve in terms of lowering rates,\" the top White House economic advisor told CNBC in a \"Money Movers\" interview.U.S. economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, faster than the Dow Jones consensus of 3.2%. Hassett said 1.5% of that growth was due to President Donald Trump's tariffs reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, the third cut this year, but the central bank indicated that the pace of future reductions could be slower. Three Fed governors voted against the quarter-point move, the most dissents since 2019. After this month's meeting, Powell said the decision to cut a quarter point was a \"close call.\" Trump has repeatedly bashed the Fed for not lowering rates as quickly as he would like. Hassett's candidacy has raised concerns among some Fed watchers that he is too close to the president.Hassett told CNBC last week that the Fed's independence is \"really important.\" Trump said in an address to the nation last week that he will announce his nominee for Fed chair soon, emphasizing that he will pick \"someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot.\"The president's prime-time speech focused on affordability. His approval rating on the economy stood at 37% in a CBS News/YouGov published Sunday. When asked about Trump's sagging approval rating, Hassett said public sentiment often does not reflect the economic numbers. \"In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing,  their glimpse of the outside world,\" Hassett said.

    "body": "watch nowMembers of the Federal Reserve rate-setting committee say they are factoring increased labor productivity into their economic forecasts as artificial intelligence technology becomes more widely adopted.Fed Chair Jerome Powell addressed this topic in his December news conference, saying that in past technology waves \"there's always been more work and higher productivity and incomes have risen. What will happen here? We're going to have to see.\"Economists and investors say generative AI tools in particular have potential to increase worker productivity and shake up the labor market. Powered by machine learning, these tools may improve over time as more people use them to augment their work, according to researchers writing in the National Bureau of Economic Research. \"This is because AI can learn. And human beings can also try to utilize AI more effectively, and train AI to suit each person. And the resulting productivity gain is huge,\" said Ping Wang, a professor of economics at Washington University in St. Louis and co-author of \"Artificial Intelligence and Technological Unemployment.\" Wang and his co-author, Tsz-Nga Wong, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, modeled various scenarios for AI's development. In an \"unbounded growth\" scenario, in which the technology becomes fully developed over many decades, 23% of workers lose employment and labor productivity increases by as much as three to four times.\"Over the next decade which is more like an intermediate run, labor productivity will increase by about roughly 7% per year,\" said Wang in an interview with CNBC. He noted that this is a hypothetical scenario that may not unfold.The potential effects could affect the employment side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. The Federal Open Market Committee in December forecasted a federal funds rate settling near 3% over the longer run. This may be a moderately accommodative posture relative to an estimated medium-run neutral interest rate at 3.7%, according to Cleveland Fed economists. Some investors see similarities between today's rush to build data centers and a capital expenditures boom on network components in the 1990s.\"The fact that we see a run up in valuations makes us a little more cautious about future returns,\" said Dan Tolomay, chief investment officer at Trust Company of the South in an interview with CNBC.Watch the video to learn more about how AI affects the Fed's economic outlook.",

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. By law, borrowers must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

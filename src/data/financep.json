    "body": "Les Wexner speaks during a deposition about Jeffrey Epstein. Courtesy: GOP Oversight via YouTubeJeffrey Epstein would \"name drop\" President Donald Trump as one of the many high-profile people he claimed to know, billionaire retail magnate Leslie Wexner said this week in a congressional deposition about the notorious sex offender.The 88-year-old Wexner, who was one of Epstein's top clients and benefactors, said Epstein \"held [Trump] out as a friend,\" according to a video of the deposition that House Democrats released Thursday.But Wexner, the retired founder of Victoria's Secret ex-parent L Brands, said he did not believe Trump and Epstein were actually friends. And he denied seeing or hearing anything about Trump having a sexual relationship with someone introduced to him by Epstein or his convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.He also told lawmakers that both Trump and Epstein would sometimes be at the lingerie company's fashion shows — though he suggested it was a \"coincidence\" and that he can't recall \"something ... that would put them together.\"\"I remember because Trump would always introduce himself to me, and I always thought it was kind of odd that he was at the fashion show because he had nothing to do with fashion,\" Wexner said.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The deposition occurred as the Department of Justice's recent release of millions of additional Epstein-related files raises new questions about the late sex criminal's ties to a growing list of prominent figures.Video of the nearly five-hour deposition, conducted Wednesday in New Albany, Ohio, where Wexner lives, was shared on the YouTube account for the House Oversight Committee's Republican majority. Democrats on the Oversight panel, who had traveled to Ohio for the deposition, said that no Republican committee members attended.They also expressed skepticism about Wexner's insistence that he had virtually no social life with Epstein, and they vowed to continue investigating.\"I do not believe when Mr. Wexner says that he did not have a personal relationship or a friendly relationship\" with Epstein, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the panel's ranking member, told reporters Wednesday.Asked if he had a relationship with Trump, Wexner laughed and said he did not. Despite their occasional exchanges at the fashion shows, \"we didn't know each other,\" Wexner said. \"I'd be shocked if he remembered me.\"Trump has never discussed Epstein with Wexner, he said.But when asked if Epstein ever discussed Trump with him, Wexner paused and then said, \"I would describe it — he would name drop it.\"\"So he would say things like, 'I know [former President Bill] Clinton or I know the Pope or I know God... It was that kind of name dropping, but never, I can't remember [a] specific place, but Jeffrey dropped a lot of names.\"Asked to clarify that Epstein specifically referenced Trump, Wexner seemed to backtrack. \"No, I'm saying it could have and I don't remember,\" he said.Wexner also said Epstein never shared any information with him about Trump's sexual activities.The comments revealed from the deposition video align with the prepared statement Wexner gave the committee, in which he claimed he was \"duped\" and \"conned\" by Epstein but was uninvolved with, and ignorant of, any of his criminal activities.Wexner in the deposition also denied ever meeting prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in Epstein's presence. Giuffre has claimed that Wexner sexually abused her. Wexner, in his prepared statement, said he has never been unfaithful to his wife in 33 years of marriage.",

    "body": "An assortment of Bath & Body Works products.Courtesy of Bath & Body WorksBath & Body Works Champagne Toast body wash, with no minimum shipping threshold, is now just a click away for Amazon Prime members.The mall-favorite brand is making some of its best-selling fragrances, body washes, hand soaps and candles available for Amazon's U.S. shoppers. The selection is also eligible for Prime shipping. Amazon is the No. 1 online destination for U.S. beauty shoppers, accounting for 47% of the online beauty and personal care market in the U.S. in 2024, according to Euromonitor. Sephora is second with 9% share. Euromonitor estimates 39% of all beauty and personal care sales take place online. \"Launching our first authorized brand storefront on Amazon allows us to put ourselves directly in the path of the consumer,\" Bath & Body Works CEO Daniel Heaf told CNBC. \"It's about meeting them where they already shop.\"The Amazon launch marks the latest effort by Columbus, Ohio-based Bath & Body Works to expand its access points for customers. Last year, it began selling its products in college campus stores — with a footprint of now more than 1,000 locations — in the company's first points of sale outside its roughly 2,600 owned and franchised stores and its own website.Heaf joined Bath & Body Works in May after his role as Nike's chief transformation and strategy officer was eliminated by CEO Elliott Hill. Heaf recently laid out his \"plan to return [Bath & Body Works] to profitable, sustainable growth.\" He calls it a \"consumer-first formula\" with four pillars: creating disruptive and innovative products, reigniting the brand, winning in the marketplace, and operating with speed and efficiency.The Amazon partnership, Heaf said, \"is the first of many milestones that we'll be delivering this fiscal year against that strategy.\"Before the official storefront launch, Bath & Body Works products were sold on Amazon through third-party resellers. Now, Heaf says the company is attempting to reclaim the brand story on Amazon — and those marketplace sales.Amazon: Friend or foe? While Amazon has many first-party relationships with brands from Nike to Calvin Klein that use wholesale partnerships as part of their business models, there are few examples of retailers selling on the site that design, manufacture and sell their products entirely on their own. For those so-called vertically integrated brands, like Bath & Body Works, Amazon is increasingly filling the role of skilled logistics partner rather than retailer. Gap, J. Crew and Everlane are similarly vertically integrated and have small selections of branded products for sale on Amazon. Gap began selling what it calls \"core basics for the whole family\" in 2022 through a wholesale relationship, where Amazon owns and sells the products, which are Prime eligible. Gap has said its goal is to reach new or lapsed customers as well as provide existing shoppers the convenience for \"core essentials.\" Under Bath & Body Works new agreement with Amazon, the brand will retain ownership of the inventory and control pricing, but will use Amazon's fulfillment partners network for Prime eligibility. Everlane declined to comment on its Amazon partnership. J. Crew did not respond to request for comment.Jewelry company Kendra Scott has an authorized storefront on Amazon after initially opposing the partnership — even though it had wholesale relationships with other retailers, including Macy's and Nordstrom. But over time, the brand began to view Amazon as another opportunity to reach shoppers rather than a competitive threat, according to a person familiar with the company's decision making, who spoke about internal matters on the condition of anonymity.On its own website, Bath & Body Works is making it easier for shoppers to place their orders. The company lowered its free shipping threshold to $50 from $100 last month. Still, Heaf admits, \"We know that we will never compete with Amazon in terms of their Prime Network. No one is going to be offering next-day shipping. That's just not what we're in the business of. And so I think that by going on Amazon, we are also making our own site more competitive but recognizing that our job is not to build a fulfillment network that can operate at the speed of Amazon.\"",

    "body": "People walk near a sign outside of Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury indicted three Silicon Valley engineers on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google and other technology companies and transferring sensitive data to Iran, prosecutors said Thursday.Samaneh Ghandali, 41, her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, and Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40 — all residents of San Jose — were arrested Thursday and appeared in a federal district court the same day.The indictment identified the defendants as Iranian nationals. Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. \"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,\" spokesman José Castañeda said. The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. Alleged efforts to concealAuthorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. \"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani. The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.",

    "body": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announces new nutrition policies during a press conference in Washington, Jan. 8, 2026.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersSecretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. defended President Donald Trump's executive order spurring the domestic production of the weed killer glyphosate, as his Make America Healthy Again movement reels from the president's embrace of the chemical they despise.Trump on Wednesday night signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act to compel the domestic production of elemental phosphorus and glyphosate-based herbicides. Glyphosate is the chemical in Bayer-Monsanto's Roundup and is the most commonly used herbicide for a slew of U.S. crops. Trump, in the order, said shortages of both phosphorus and glyphosate would pose a risk to national security.Kennedy backed the president in a statement to CNBC Thursday morning. \"Donald Trump's Executive Order puts America first where it matters most — our defense readiness and our food supply,\" he said. \"We must safeguard America's national security first, because all of our priorities depend on it. When hostile actors control critical inputs, they weaken our security. By expanding domestic production, we close that gap and protect American families.\"But Kennedy's MAHA coalition that supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election hates glyphosate, which has been alleged to cause cancer in myriad lawsuits. Now, the executive order threatens to unravel that coalition ahead of the 2026 midterm elections that could loosen the president's grip on Washington. \"Just as the large MAHA base begins to consider what to do at midterms, the President issues an EO to expand domestic glyphosate production,\" Kelly Ryerson, a prominent MAHA activist known as The Glyphosate Girl, said in a post on X. \"The very same carcinogenic pesticide that MAHA cares about most.\"Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a watchdog that has pushed back against chemicals in food for years, said in a statement that he \"can't envision a bigger middle finger to every MAHA mom than this.\"\"Elevating glyphosate to a national security priority is the exact opposite of what MAHA voters were promised,\" Cook said. \"If Secretary Kennedy remains at HHS after this, it will be impossible to argue that his past warnings about glyphosate were anything more than campaign rhetoric designed to win trust — and votes.\"Kennedy, a former environmental attorney, notably once won a nearly $290 million case against Monsanto for a man who claimed his cancer was caused by Roundup. The executive order came down one day after Bayer proposed paying $7.25 billion to settle a series of lawsuits claiming Roundup causes cancer. Former Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., knocked Trump for signing \"an EO protecting cancer causing Glyphosate in our foods.\"Glyphosate is a critical chemical to American agriculture. It's applied to many key cash crops, such as corn and soybeans, and has been defended by agricultural trade organizations. Phosphorus is a key input to the creation of glyphosate, which the White House argues is necessary to maintain food security. Elemental phosphorus is also used in the manufacture of some military materials.\"Thank you, President Trump, for acknowledging the importance of glyphosate-based herbicides in American agriculture,\" the House Agriculture Committee Republicans said Wednesday night in an X post. \"This is a vital step forward in ensuring a domestic supply of this critical crop input remains available for our producers.\"House Agriculture Chair Rep. G.T. Thompson, R-Pa., is trying to push a farm bill through Congress this year — a legislative package that covers federal farm support and nutrition subsidies. He's also come under fire from MAHA recently for a provision in that bill that would block state and local pesticide regulations from differing from federal guidance.",

The therapies rely on induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells — adult cells that are reprogrammed back into a stem-cell-like state.Stem cells are are capable of self-renewal and work as a repair system, replacing damaged cells and maintaining tissues, allowing them to be used in regenerative medicine.\"While the treatment could potentially see widespread use and become a blockbuster in Japan and the US over the long term, we expect almost no profit contribution near term,\" said Citigroup Global Markets Japan's analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi.Sumitomo's stock has been overheated, and recent gains have been  \"excessive,\" he added.According to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, formal approval will be granted within the next one to two months, NHK reported.The endorsement comes years after Kyoto University professor Shinya Yamanaka, who later won a Nobel Prize for his stem cell research, first succeeded in generating iPS cells from mice in 2006. Japan has been striving to develop stem-cell therapies, with Kyoto University's CiRA, which runs a clinical-grade iPS cell bank, providing researchers access to prepared cells that can be used in trials for a range of conditions.Sumitomo Pharma develops and markets prescription medicines across multiple therapeutic areas, including neuroscience, oncology and regenerative medicine.",

    "body": "Man and boy sit on a paved sidewalk and draw alien faces.Annie Otzen | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would direct the Department of Defense and other agencies to make public government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life.Trump said the files that will be identified and released will also concern unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects, as well as \"any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.\"In a Truth Social post, the U.S. president said his move was based on the \"tremendous interest\" in the subject, without providing additional details. This comes after he accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of leaking \"classified information\" on aliens. \"I don't know if they're real or not, but I can tell you he gave classified information,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Obama said on Saturday in a podcast that aliens were real, \"but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51.\" \"There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States,\" Obama added.Area 51 refers to a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, and has been the center of conspiracy theories saying the U.S. government has been conducting research and using the facility for storing extraterrestrial materials and technology. Obama had previously said that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was \"Where are the aliens?\"After the podcast on Sunday, the former U.S. president clarified his stance on a post on Instagram, saying that the universe was so vast that the odds are good that there's life out there. However, he said that he also saw \"no evidence\" during his presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with Earth.\" In late 2024, the Pentagon said it had seen 757 new reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs between May 2023 and June 2024, NBC News reported.Of these, 21 \"merit further analysis\" due to \"anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors,\" the report said, adding that there was no evidence, so far, to substantiate life from another planet being involved in these sightings.",

    "body": "U.S. growth slowed more than expected near the end of 2025 as the government shutdown impacted spending and investment, while a key inflation metric showed high prices are still a factor for the economy, according to data released Friday.Gross domestic product rose at an annualized rate of just 1.4%, according to the Commerce Department, well below the Dow Jones estimate for a 2.5% gain. Consumer spending increased at a slower pace for the period while government spending tumbled sharply in a quarter marked by the record-length shutdown. The department estimated that the shutdown subtracted about 1 percentage point from growth, though it added that the exact impacts \"cannot be quantified.\"For the full year in 2025, the U.S. economy grew at a 2.2% pace, down from the 2.8% increase in 2024. \"The Federal government shutdown clearly sent the economy careening off its strong growth path in the fourth quarter which is a one-off that won't be repeated in early 2026,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds.Just before the data release, President Donald Trump warned that the GDP number would be soft, blaming it on the government shutdown that ended in November.\"The Democrat Shutdown cost the U.S.A. at least two points in GDP. That's why they are doing it, in mini form, again. No Shutdowns!\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"Also, LOWER INTEREST RATES. 'Two Late' Powell is the WORST!!!\"The latter part of the post was a reference to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized for not lowering rates more aggressively.While growth slowed, inflation held firm in December, according to the gauge most closely watched by Fed officials.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes food and energy, rose 3% in December, up 0.2 percentage point from November, according to a separate release. That matched the consensus forecast but kept the pivotal inflation measure well above the Fed's 2% target.On a headline basis, the PCE index accelerated 2.9%, or 0.1 percentage point higher than expected. Both indexes rose 0.4% for the month, compared with the respective forecasts for 0.3%.On a monthly basis, goods prices climbed 0.4% while services increased 0.3%, indicating that price pressures remained relatively broad-based rather than concentrated in any single category. Fed policymakers have been watching that balance closely to see whether inflation is being spurred by temporary tariff-related pressures that would hit goods, or more fundamental demand-driven factors that would show up in services.The Fed cut its benchmark rate by three-quarters of a percentage point in late 2025 but has since signaled a more cautious approach as officials assess progress on inflation alongside risks to the labor market.While Trump blamed the shutdown, the Commerce Department said the deceleration in GDP, which grew at a 4.4% rate in the third quarter, was the result in a pullback in consumer spending and exports, as well as the impact from the government closure that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12.\"The government shutdown hurt growth at the end of 2025. The economy will likely bounce back in early 2026, but it isn't harmless to do prolonged shutdowns,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Overall, the U.S. economy was resilient in 2025 despite many headwinds. Solid consumption and the AI boom kept the economy growing.\"Personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer outlays, rose 2.4% in the quarter, down from the 3.5% gain in the prior period. Exports fell 0.9% after surging 9.6% in Q3.Though the headline GDP number looked weak, underlying signs of demand were strong.Another key Fed metric, called final sales to private domestic purchasers, posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter but still indicative of solid underlying demand in the $31.5 trillion U.S. economy.Also, gross private domestic investment rose 3.8% after being flat in Q3.On the downside, government spending and investment slid 5.1%, slammed by a 16.6% tumble at the federal level that was only partially offset by a 2.4% increase from state and local entities. Correction: Final sales to private domestic purchasers posted a 2.4% increase for the quarter, half a percentage point lower than the prior quarter. An earlier version misstated a time element.",

The paper also reported that Washington's Metropolitan Police Department on Jan. 24 filed a report about forced sexual contact at the department in December.CNBC obtained a public copy of that police report, which says, \"The complainant reported a sexual contact against her will\" during an incident at 11:30 a.m. ET on Dec. 18 at the Department of Labor building.The complainant's name was not given in the public copy of the report, nor was the name of the alleged assailant.Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House, in Washington, April 30, 2025.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe inspector general's office would not confirm or deny it was conducting an investigation when contacted by CNBC.Dr. DeRemer, the Labor Department, the Police Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.The Times in late January reported that a member of Secretary Chavez-DeRemer's security detail with whom she had been accused of having a romantic relationship, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the inspector general.The Labor Department's social media account in January posted a video that featured a slideshow of artworks depicting glorified scenes of American history.The caption above that video said, \"One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.\"Social media users noted similarities between the Labor Department's post and a Nazi Party slogan.The slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer,\" which the U.S. Holocaust Museum notes was used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party, translates to \"One People, One Country, One Leader.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing about the annual report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 4, 2026. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDozens of House Democrats wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday calling for an investigation into possible conflicts of interest and national security concerns related to World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture.The letter, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. and 40 other lawmakers, landed after Bessent testified at a contentious House Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this month. Meeks at the hearing called Bessent a \"flunky\" of President Donald Trump and raised questions about a $500 million stake that Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — a royal from the United Arab Emirates also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — bought in World Liberty Financial last year.\"The Trump family's $500 million deal connected to the Emirati royal family is not only a matter of national financial instability, but it also carries serious national security implications,\" Meeks said in a statement accompanying the letter. \"Trust that the record will reflect whether Secretary Bessent chooses to answer to the American people, or his mob boss.\"The request for a probe was made as World Liberty Financial is seeking a national bank charter, a distinction reviewed and issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent arm of the Treasury Department that regulates banks. World Liberty Financial held a day-long forum Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago where presidential sons Don Jr. and Eric Trump touted the family's stablecoin and called traditional banking a \"Ponzi scheme.\"Meeks at the hearing asked Bessent to commit to pause any pending applications from World Liberty Financial before the OCC and to complete an investigation into the \"conflicts of interest and foreign influence.\"\"The OCC is an independent entity,\" Bessent said then, over the shouts of Meeks, without addressing the topic further.President Donald Trump and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are co-founders emeritus of the company, which is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families.\"This is no longer just a debate about crypto chartering theory. It is about foreign ownership, national security, regulatory integrity, and whether our bank-chartering process is resilient to political and geopolitical pressure,\" the lawmakers wrote Thursday.In the letter, Democratic members asked for information on the safeguards in place to ensure that \"foreign government officials, sovereign proxies, or politically connected investors cannot use the bank-chartering process to gain leverage over the U.S. financial system or access sensitive financial or technological infrastructure.\"It also asks what role the White House, Office and Management and Budget and Treasury have in \"reviewing, approving, or otherwise influencing national bank or trust chartering decisions made by the\" OCC. It lawmakers requested a response from Treasury by Feb. 26.A Treasury Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\"The credibility of America's banking regulatory framework, and of the institutions charged with protecting it, depends on transparency, independence, and a demonstrated willingness to resist undue influence,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Our constituents need confidence that our banking system is governed by law, not proximity to power; by prudential judgment, not political convenience.\"",

Trump said Thursday that he would make a decision in the next 10 to 15 days on whether to attack the Islamic Republic. He has left open the possibility that a deal could still be reached with Tehran over its nuclear program. Trump has previously said an attack on Iran would be \"far worse\" than the limited strikes launched by the U.S. in June against its nuclear facilities.Oil prices were stable Friday after rallying more than 5% this week as traders price in some risk of imminent U.S. military action. U.S. crude oil fell 28 cents to $66.15 per barrel by 10:39 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent was down 23 cents at $71.43 per barrel.A massive U.S. military buildup is underway in the Middle East. The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier is in the region. A second aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, is en route. The oil market's biggest fear is that a conflict between the U.S. and Iran could lead to a prolonged disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz. The strait is a vital chokepoint for the global oil trade. More than 14 million barrels per day of oil and condensates passed through the narrow waterway on average in 2025, according to data from consulting firm Kpler, which says that amount accounts for a third of total worldwide seaborne oil exports.About three-quarters of the oil that passes through the strait goes to China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to Kpler.",

    "body": "watch nowThe Supreme Court on Friday struck down a huge chunk of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, delivering a major rebuke of the president's key economic policy.The law that undergirds those import duties \"does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,\" the majority ruled six to three in the long-awaited decision.The ruling is a massive loss for Trump, who has made tariffs — and his asserted power to impose them on any country at any time, without congressional input — a central feature of his administration's economic and foreign policies.Trump's legal stance \"would represent a transformative expansion of the President's authority over tariff policy,\" the majority concluded. And they highlighted that Trump imposed the tariffs without Congress, which has the power to tax under the Constitution.Chief Justice John Roberts delivered the opinion of the court. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented.The decision noted that before Trump, no president had ever used the statute in question \"to impose any tariffs, let alone tariffs of this magnitude and scope.\"To justify the \"extraordinary\" tariff powers, Trump must \"point to clear congressional authorization,\" the court wrote. \"He cannot.\"The ruling was silent on whether tariffs that have been paid under the higher rates will need to be refunded. That sum could total $175 billion, according to a new estimate from the Penn-Wharton Budget Model.Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent that the refund process \"is likely to be a 'mess,'\" after predicting that the short-term impact of the court's tariff ruling \"could be substantial.\"Betting it all on IEEPA Since retaking the White House, Trump has rapidly reshaped America's longstanding trade relationships by imposing a staggering array of import duties that have touched nearly every country on earth.Many of those tariffs were invoked using a novel reading of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. They include Trump's near-global \"reciprocal\" tariffs, and separate duties related to the alleged trafficking of deadly drugs into the U.S.IEEPA does not explicitly mention tariffs, as the Supreme Court noted Friday. Instead, it allows the president to \"regulate … importation\" of foreign property transactions after declaring a national emergency in order to deal with certain \"unusual and extraordinary\" threats.The Trump administration has argued that language empowers the president to impose tariffs on foreign goods.Critics charged that the law does not permit the president to unilaterally impose levies of any size on any country at any time. A federal trade court and a federal appeals court both found Trump's IEEPA tariffs illegal before the Supreme Court took up the case.The majority of U.S. tariff revenue generated last year came from the IEEPA duties.Trump critics — and businesses — rejoiceReaction to the ruling quickly poured in, with the loudest voices cheering the demise of the chaotic policy that has been blamed for raising prices and straining longstanding global alliances.\"This ruling is a victory for every American family paying higher prices because of Trump's tariff taxes,\" Rep. Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, the House Budget Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. \"The Supreme Court rejected Trump's attempt to impose what amounted to a national sales tax on hardworking Americans.\"House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Richard Neal, D-Mass., in a statement called the decision \"a victory for the American people, the rule of law, and our standing in the global economy.\"Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America, a U.S. sneaker industry group, said Friday's ruling \"marks an important step toward creating a more predictable and competitive environment for American businesses and consumers.\"\"This ruling provides relief at a time when cost pressures have been significant,\" Matt Priest, president and CEO of the footwear group, said in a statement.The Distilled Spirits Council, an advocacy group for U.S. liquor makers, responded to the ruling by urging the Trump administration to \"secure a permanent return to zero-for-zero tariffs\" with top trade partners.Doing so \"would provide much needed certainty for American spirits exporters while helping ease financial pressures on bars, restaurants and retailers at a time when affordability remains a major concern for consumers,\" said the council's president and CEO, Chris Swonger, in a statement.Dominic LeBlanc, Canada's minister for trade with the U.S., said in an X post that the decision \"reinforces Canada's position that the IEEPA tariffs imposed by the United States are unjustified.\"Tariff tumultTrump last April unveiled his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans at a much-ballyhooed White House event marking what he had dubbed America's \"liberation day.\"That announcement stoked a sudden market panic, and the tariffs were quickly put on pause. They have since been repeatedly tweaked, delayed and reimposed, adding confusion and further complexity to the administration's tangled web of trade policies.Other IEEPA-based tariffs include a set aimed at Mexico, Canada and China related to allegations that those countries have allowed the deadly drug fentanyl to flow into the U.S.Trump, a fierce critic of America's recent history of making free trade deals, has repeatedly praised tariffs as both a bountiful source of federal revenue and a key tool in negotiations with foreign partners and adversaries alike.He has claimed foreign countries bear the cost of his tariffs, and he has downplayed concerns that the taxes lead to higher prices for Americans. His administration, however, has admitted that the duties are paid by U.S. importers.Trump has claimed the tariff revenue has been so large that the duties may be able to replace the income tax. He has also floated the idea of sending Americans $2,000 tariff dividend checks.\"We have taken in, and will soon be receiving, more than 600 Billion Dollars in Tariffs,\" he wrote in a recent Truth Social post.Other estimates are significantly lower: The Bipartisan Policy Center, for instance, tallied U.S. gross tariff revenue in 2025 at about $289 billion. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it had collected roughly $200 billion between Jan. 20 and Dec. 15.For the IEEPA-specific tariffs, the administration said it has collected about $129 billion in revenue as of Dec. 10.Ahead of the ruling, Trump and his administration talked up the consequences of the high court striking down the tariffs.\"If the Supreme Court rules against the United States of America on this National Security bonanza, WE'RE SCREWED!\" Trump wrote on Jan. 12.U.S. officials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have stated they believed the Supreme Court would not undo the president's \"signature\" economic policy.This is breaking news.

The model is a non-partisan fiscal research group at the University of Pennsylvania.Multiple importers already have pending lawsuits seeking refunds of their tariffs, citing lower-court rulings that found Trump's tariffs are not legal.

He was the first president to ever use IEEPA for that purpose.Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of three conservative members of the high court to dissent from Friday's ruling, warned about the potential logistical difficulty of having to refund tariffs already collected.\"In the meantime, however, the interim effects of the Court's decision could be substantial,\" Kavanaugh wrote in his dissent.\"The United States may be required to refund billions of dollars to importers who paid the IEEPA tariffs, even though some importers may have already passed on costs to consumers or others,\" he wrote.\"As was acknowledged at oral argument, the refund process is likely to be a 'mess,' \" Kavanaugh wrote.\"In addition, according to the Government, the IEEPA tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions of dollars — including with foreign nations from China to the United Kingdom to Japan, and more,\" he wrote.\"The Court's decision could generate uncertainty regarding those trade arrangements.\" Brian LeBlanc, senior economist at PNC Financial Services Group, in a LinkedIn post on Friday said \"we estimate\" that the IEEPA-related tariffs that have been ruled illegal constitute \"roughly 60% of the tariffs issued to date.\"\"That's a big deal. Until President Trump replaces those tariffs with alternative authorities, the tariff rate just dropped from around 9.5% to around 5%,\" LeBlanc wrote. \"Refunds are going to be tricky, and we expect the Trump administration to replace most (but not all) of this lost tariff revenue.\"The U.S. Customs and Border Protection in December said the amount of tariffs collected that would be at risk of having to be refunded was $133.5 billion. That tally would have risen since then because of the ongoing collection of duties.",

    "body": "Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, brother of Britain’s King Charles, leaves Aylsham Police Station in a vehicle on the day he was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Aylsham, England, Feb. 19, 2026.Phil Noble | ReutersBritish police on Thursday released Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, former prince and the brother of King Charles III, after having arrested him earlier on suspicion of misconduct in public office.The nature of the investigation has not been revealed. But Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest came after renewed focus on his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, the now-dead notorious sex offender, after the U.S. Department of Justice released millions of documents about Epstein.Thames Valley Police, who had arrested Mountbatten-Windsor without publicly identifying him, had said they were assessing reports that he had sent Epstein confidential trade reports in 2010, when he was Britain's special envoy for international trade.Thames Valley Police, in a statement, said, \"On Thursday ... we arrested a man in his sixties from Norfolk on suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"\"The arrested man has now been released under investigation,\" police said. \"We can also confirm that our searches in Norfolk have now concluded. Our searches in Berkshire are still underway.\"King Charles, in a statement earlier Thursday following the arrest of his brother, said, \"I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office.\"\"What now follows is the full, fair and proper process by which this issue is investigated in the appropriate manner and by the appropriate authorities,\" the king said. \"Let me state clearly: the law must take its course.\"President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, called Mountbatten-Windsor's arrest \"a shame.\"\"I think it's very sad. I think it's so bad for the royal family. It's very, very sad. To me, it's a very sad thing,\" said Trump, who himself is a former friend of Epstein.Charles stripped Mountbatten-Windsor of his title of prince in October and forced him out of his home near Windsor Castle because of his ties to Epstein, who killed himself in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges filed in New York.Mountbatten-Windsor has denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, including allegations that he sexually assaulted Virginia Giuffre, a known victim of Epstein, when she was 17 years old.In February 2022, Mountbatten-Windsor reached a confidential settlement with Giuffre of her lawsuit in New York federal court related to those allegations, without admitting wrongdoing.But he agreed at the time to what was called \"a substantial donation to Ms. Giuffre's charity in support of victims' rights,\" and in a statement said he regretted his association with Epstein, and commended \"the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.\"Giuffre died by suicide last April.Maria Farmer, a victim of Epstein, in a statement Thursday after the arrest of Mountbatten-Windsor, said, \"Today is just the beginning of accountability and justice brought forth by Virginia Roberts Giuffre — a young mother who adored her daughter so deeply, she fought the most powerful on earth to protect her. She did this for everyone's daughters.\"\"Let's now demand all the dominos of power and corruption begin to fall,\" Farmer said.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.",

    "body": "Customers near a Ford Maverick pickup truck at a Ford dealership in Richmond, California, US, on Wednesday, April 16, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT – The strength of the U.S. automotive industry will face an early test this spring that has nothing to do with cars or trucks.With tax season starting, industry experts are projecting that some Americans, many of whom have been priced out of the new vehicle market, will use anticipated higher tax returns to purchase a new or used vehicle.Extra cash on hand could lend a needed boost to an industry that's suffering from slowing vehicle sales — or it could reveal continued problems for the automotive industry with inflated prices and consumers still reluctant to spend on big-ticket items.\"Their new tax bill is actually going to be less, and they're going to be getting more in their tax return. It's going to be a little bit of a surprise, we think, for a lot of potential buyers out there,\" said Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough at a recent auto analyst conference.The average IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, compared to the same point in 2025, according to early filing data. As of Feb. 6, the average refund amount was $2,290, compared with $2,065 reported about one year prior.The increases were expected under tax changes by the Trump administration, including the One, Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July. That legislation removed taxes on overtime and tips and allowed eligible taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in annual interest paid on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles purchased, among other adjustments. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAuto dealer stocksMany of the tax changes were made retroactive to January 2025, which means taxpayers may have withheld more than they will ultimately owe.\"Although it's a bit of an unknown, it feels like it could be really beneficial to vehicle sales, particularly in that sort of Q1-Q2 timeframe,\" said David Oakley, GlobalData manager of Americas vehicle sales forecasts.March is historically one of the top months for U.S. vehicle sales, especially for used vehicles. The month has represented 9.1% of annual new vehicle sales on average over the past 12 years, according to Cox, trailing only the month of December at 9.3% of sales. Many of the recent tax changes also assist middle- and higher-income consumers who may decide to pull ahead a vehicle purchase. The industry saw a similar dynamic during the Covid pandemic when the Trump administration issued many Americans $1,400 stimulus checks.Back then, though, federal interest rates were near zero compared to the current Federal Reserve funds rate of 3.5%–3.75% and inventory of new vehicles was low. Now, with higher borrowing costs, but improved inventory, the equation could be different. More buyers are agreeing to longer-term loans amid higher financing costs and prices. Putting down extra cash ahead of time can help lower monthly payments, which Carmax's Edmunds reports reached a record of $772 per month for new vehicles during the fourth quarter.The average transaction price for new vehicles in the U.S. was hovering around $50,000 toward the end of last year, up 30% from the start of 2020, according to Cox.\"What we don't know is with consumer finance so stressed already, is that extra money already spent? Whether that's going to be in the pockets. It's a really mixed bag out there,\" Chesbrough said. Consumers could choose to use higher tax returns to pay off credit card debt — which nationally stands at a record level of $1.28 trillion, according to a report last week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — or replenish their savings after a period of persistent inflation. U.S. consumer confidence fell to 84.5 in January, the lowest level since May 2014, driven by intense anxiety over high prices and a weakening labor market.\"It's only confident people, people who feel comfortable about their economic fortunes of the economy of the United States, that are going to be interested in taking out a $40,000 or $50,000 auto loan,\" Chesbrough said. \"It's a very difficult situation right now.\"– CNBC's Kate Dore contributed to this report.",

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesOil prices edged lower on Friday, after President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran over its nuclear program.\"I guess I can say I am considering that,\" Trump said when asked by a reporter at a White House breakfast with U.S. governors.International benchmark Brent crude futures with April delivery fell 43 cents to $71.23 per barrel by 11:10 a.m. ET, erasing earlier gains, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures with March delivery lost 41 cents to $66.02. Both contracts notched their highest settle in six months in the previous session as energy market participants continue to monitor supply risks in the oil-rich Middle East.The U.S. and Iran have held talks in Switzerland this week to try to resolve a standoff over Tehran's nuclear program. Initial reports of progress, however, gave way to accusations from Washington that Iran had failed to address core U.S. demands. Speaking at the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington on Thursday, the U.S. president said \"bad things will happen\" if Tehran doesn't agree to a deal over its nuclear program. Trump added that the world will likely find out over the next 10 days whether the U.S. will reach a deal with Iran or take military action. He later told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wanted an agreement within \"10 to 15 days.\" Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude futures over the last six months.His comments come after a significant buildup of U.S. military forces in the Middle East and amid reports the White House is considering fresh military action against Tehran as soon as this weekend. Trump said Iran's nuclear potential had been \"totally decimated\" by U.S. strikes on its facilities in June last year, before adding \"we may have to take it a step further or we may not,\" without providing further details.Iran reportedly said in a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday that Tehran will respond \"decisively\" if subjected to military aggression.The Islamic Republic has conducted military drills in the strategically vital Strait of Hormuz in recent days, as well as joint naval drills with Russia in the Gulf of Oman, also known as the Sea of Oman.Naval units from Iran and Russia carry out to simulation of rescue a hijacked vessel during the joint naval drills held at the Port of Bandar Abbas near the Strait of Hormuz in Hormozgan, Iran on February 19, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\"Everything is in place, or will be by Saturday night, for strikes to commence and so the window opens then,\" Daniel Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" on Friday. \"Doesn't mean that's going to happen immediately. The president did indicate that he is waiting to hear from Iran whether they are prepared to make concessions on their nuclear program that he's insisting on,\" Shapiro said. \"I think it's unlikely. We have never seen Iran open to those types of concessions, so I think it is unlikely they will agree to those, which means that in the days coming, the president will have to make that decision on military strikes,\" he added. A 'very well supplied' marketThe Trump administration has said it still hopes to reach a diplomatic resolution over Tehran's nuclear program, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying on Wednesday that it would be \"very wise\" for Iran to make a deal. Martijn Rats, chief commodity strategist at Morgan Stanley, said that, while the oil market is \"very well supplied\" on a global basis, there are three factors propping up prices. \"Worries about Iran, clearly. Also, an unusually large amount of buying by China, simply for stockpiling purposes. It makes you wonder what they are going to do with all these inventories and then also we have very high freight rates,\" Rats told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Friday.\"The factor of those three that is most prominent, of course, is the issue in Iran,\" Rats said. watch nowStrategists at Barclays said Friday that while equity markets have largely shrugged off the geopolitical noise so far, tensions have been rising since Vice President JD Vance accused Iran of failing to discuss so-called \"red lines,\" alongside reports of increased U.S. military capability in the region. \"We believe that any strike would likely have to be time limited and with defined targets (nuclear, ballistic missiles), as they were last summer,\" the strategists said in a research note. \"With midterm elections later this year and the administration prioritizing affordability for US consumers, we suspect their willingness to tolerate a prolonged period of significantly higher oil prices, and potentially casualties too, will be limited,\" they continued. \"So if conflict is imminent it is likely to be short lived, in our view.\"",

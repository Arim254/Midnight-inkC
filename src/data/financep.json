President Donald Trump said Saturday that U.S. oil companies would invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector after the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. The White House official did not say which companies the administration has spoken to or when the conversations took place. \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Reuters reported earlier that Chevron, Conoco and Exxon have not spoken to the administration about Maduro's overthrow. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is scheduled attend an energy conference hosted by Goldman Sachs in Miami this week. Executives from Chevron and ConocoPhillips are also expected to attend.  Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela. CNBC has reached out to Chevron, Conoco and Exxon for comment.",

But he also said, \"We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.\"\"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Trump said separately on Sunday aboard Air Force One.Gallego on Monday introduced an amendment to the Senate Defense Appropriations bill to prohibit the use of funds for military force against Greenland.\"President Trump believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security, and he is confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region,\" a White House spokeswoman said in a statement Tuesday.\"The President is committed to establishing long-term peace at home and abroad,\" the spokeswoman said.Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican,  was asked by reporters on Capitol Hill earlier Tuesday if he was concerned about the attack on Venezuela spreading to Cuba and Greenland.\"I hope it does spread to Cuba.

    "body": "A Samsung Electronics Co. CXL memory module displayed on a monitor during the Semiconductor Exhibition (SEDEX) in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024.SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 16.3% higher this year. Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.\"The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.\"We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models.\"This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMicron and ASML stocks have rallied this year so far. The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.Intel shares are up 7.6%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise 15.2% this year. Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. \"ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027,\" with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit \"from the upcoming DRAM super cycle.\"Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. \"Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure,\" Barringer said.\"That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand.\"",

    "body": "Moor Studio | Digitalvision Vectors | Getty ImagesFollowing the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that led to the removal of its leader, Nicolas Maduro, AI-generated videos purporting to show Venezuelan citizens celebrating in the streets have gone viral on social media.These artificial intelligence clips, depicting rejoicing crowds, have amassed millions of views across major platforms like TikTok, Instagram and X. One of the earliest and most widely shared clips on X was posted by an account named \"Wall Street Apes,\" which has over 1 million followers on the platform. The post depicts a series of Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy and thanking the U.S. and President Donald Trump for removing Maduro. The video has since been flagged by a community note, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature on X that allows users to add context to posts they believe are misleading. The note read: \"This video is AI generated and is currently being presented as a factual statement intended to mislead people.\"The clip has been viewed over 5.6 million times and reshared by at least 38,000 accounts, including by business mogul Elon Musk, before he eventually removed the repost. CNBC was unable to confirm the origin of the video, though fact-checkers at BBC and AFP said the earliest known version of the clip appeared on the TikTok account @curiousmindusa, which regularly posts AI-generated content.Even before such videos appeared, AI-generated images showing Maduro in U.S. custody were circulating prior to the Trump administration releasing an authentic image of the captured leader. The deposed Venezuelan president was captured on Jan. 3, 2026, after U.S. forces conducted airstrikes and a ground raid, an operation that has dominated global headlines at the start of the new year. Along with the AI-generated videos, the AFP's fact-check team also flagged a number of examples of misleading content about Maduro's ousting, including footage of celebrations in Chile falsely presented as scenes from Venezuela. Misinformation from major news events is not new. Similar false or misleading content has circulated during the Israeli-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. However, the massive reach and realism of AI-generated content related to recent developments in Venezuela are stark examples of how AI is advancing as a tool for misinformation. Platforms such as Sora and Midjourney have made it easier than ever to quickly generate hyper-realistic video and pass it off as genuine in the chaos of fast-breaking events. The creators of that content often seek to amplify certain political narratives or sow confusion among global audiences.Last year, AI-generated videos of women complaining about losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a government shutdown also went viral. One such AI-generated video fooled Fox News, which presented it as real in an article that was later removed.In light of these trends, social media companies have faced growing pressure to step up efforts to label potentially misleading AI content.Last year, India's government proposed a law requiring such labeling, while Spain approved fines of up to 35 million euros for unlabeled AI materials.To address growing concerns, major platforms, including TikTok and Meta, have rolled out AI detection and labeling tools, though the results appear mixed.CNBC was able to identify some videos on TikTok presented as celebrations in Venezuela that were labeled as AI-generated. In the case of X, the platform has relied mostly on community notes for content labeling, a system critics say often reacts too slowly to prevent AI misinformation from spreading before being identified.Adam Mosseri, who oversees Instagram and Threads, acknowledged the challenge facing social media in a recent post. \"All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality,\" he said.\"There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media,\" he added. — CNBC's Victoria Yeo contributed to this report ",

    "body": "A view of houses in the old town of Nuuk, Greenland, March 27, 2025.Leonhard Foeger | ReutersDonald Trump is interested in annexing Greenland, an Arctic island offering a wealth of untapped mineral resources. But as the U.S. president dialed up the rhetoric about America annexing the self-governing Danish territory, sparking a backlash from international leaders, a report detailed the challenges facing its economy.Published Tuesday, a report by Søren Bjerregaard, head of securities and balance of payments at Danmarks Nationalbank, warned that there were \"major challenges ahead\" for Greenland's economy. The Arctic island's economy — largely driven by the fishing industry — expanded by 0.8% in 2025 and is expected to grow a further 0.8% this year, down from 2% in 2022. According to the Danish central bank, the slowdown is likely to continue.\"The Greenlandic economy is slowing down, with modest growth and serious challenges for public finances,\" Bjerregaard wrote.\"This is partly because the expansion of infrastructure in the form of airports is nearing completion, and planned major projects in energy supply and other areas have not yet begun.\"He added that at the same time, vital shrimp stocks were declining, while public finances \"deteriorated surprisingly sharply in 2025.\" Part of the pressure on public finances was arising from a decrease in dividends from government-owned firms. \"Liquidity in the Greenland Treasury fell to a critically low level in the second half of the year,\" Bjerregaard said, noting that legislation set to be rolled out this year contains urgent fiscal tightening measures. \"More fiscal challenges lie ahead, with a declining and ageing population putting further pressure on the economy,\" he added.Greenland's population, which stood at 56,699 in the final quarter of 2025, is expected to shrink 20% by 2050, as the territory struggles to attract migrants to replace emigrating residents. Trump 'very serious' about acquiring GreenlandIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said he was \"very serious\" about acquiring the Arctic island. A day earlier, he told reporters that the U.S. needs Greenland to bolster its national security.He was speaking after Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro.Trump later told The Atlantic that America \"absolutely\" needs Greenland, with the president telling the magazine that countries aside from Venezuela could be subject to U.S. intervention.Trump has long floated the idea of taking Greenland. In early 2025, he said the U.S. would assume control \"one way or the other.\"Officials in Greenland, Denmark and across the European continent have rejected the notion that the U.S. can make any claim on Greenland.Read moreOn Monday, Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, rebuked parallels between the territory and Venezuela. \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland,\" Nielsen told a news conference. \"Our country is not really the right one to compare with Venezuela. We are a country that is democratic and has been democratic for many, many years.\"",

In 2019, the automaker sold 2.42 million vehicles in the U.S.Ford finished the year as the third-largest automaker in the U.S. behind Toyota Motor and domestic sales leader General Motors. Ford's U.S. vehicle sales for the year were largely in line with analyst expectations, such as those from Cox Automotive, which expects industrywide sales to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units in 2025.\"We're really pleased with where we finished the year,\" Andrew Frick, president of Ford's nonfleet vehicle businesses, said during a media call. \"As the year unfolded, we saw really good performance throughout. ... We outperformed the industry for 10 straight months.\"Ford's fourth-quarter performance came as it continues to battle production troubles with its F-Series pickup trucks due to two separate fires at a New York plant of key aluminum supplier Novelis.Frick said the automaker \"seems to be on track\" to offset lost production of tens of thousands of its lucrative pickup trucks this year, including adding another shift to a plant in Michigan.F-Series sales, including the popular F-150, were up 8.3% in 2025, but off 3.1% during the fourth quarter. Like many automakers, Ford's all-electric vehicles business notably declined 14.1% last year, including a roughly 52% plummet during the fourth quarter. A nearly 22% increase in sales of Ford's hybrid vehicles, which the company expects to grow, assisted in offsetting those losses.Traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines continued to dominate Ford's sales, representing about 86% of the company's volume in 2025.",

    "body": "Nearly a year ago, DeepSeek shook the AI world. Stocks of some of the leading Western tech companies plunged as the markets hit panic mode at the prospect of a new model from a relatively unheard of Chinese AI lab that challenged the premise of U.S. dominance in the space.Nvidia plummeted 17%, losing close to $600 billion from its market cap. U.S. chipmaker Broadcom also fell 17%, and ASML dropped 7% in a single day.Eleven months on, and those companies have not just recovered but continued to grow. Nvidia became the first company to hit a $5 trillion valuation in October, Broadcom's shares rose 49% across 2025, with ASML's stock increasing 36%.\"January [DeepSeek] (R1) caused a broad, visible repricing because it changed global beliefs about frontier-model cost curves and China's competitiveness, and it did so in a way that hit the semiconductor and hyperscaler narrative directly,\" Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at Gartner told CNBC. Since then, DeepSeek has released seven new model updates. None have caused the kind of waves seen in January. So why haven't the markets reacted?Shock factorFounded in 2023, DeepSeek released a free, open-source large language model (LLM) in late 2024, called V3, which it said was trained with less powerful chips and at a fraction of the cost of models built by the likes of OpenAI and Google. Weeks later, in January 2025 it released a reasoning model, R1, that hit similar benchmarks or outperformed many of the world's leading LLMs. The Chinese AI lab's January release \"really surprised the market,\" Alex Platt, senior analyst at investment firm D.A. Davidson, told CNBC. \"The narrative [at the time] was that China was 9 to 12 months behind the U.S.\"watch nowThe promise of a model achieving similar results to the most advanced systems, but using less compute, raised concerns in the market that the demand for AI infrastructure would be impacted, and revenue for firms like Nvidia would be hit, Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC. \"Instead, we saw no slowdown in spending in 2025, and as we look ahead, we foresee an acceleration of spending in 2026 and beyond.\"There's also the type of releases DeepSeek has made since January, all of which have been updates to the V3 and R1 models as opposed to entirely new models. While DeepSeek's more recent model updates are \"credible step changes\" in efficiency and capability, the market has viewed them as a \"continuation and consolidation rather than a new shockwave,\" Khandabattu said.Limited computePart of the reason DeepSeek hasn't released a new model is likely due to limited compute, analysts told CNBC.\"Compute has been a large bottleneck,\" said Platt. \"You can only do so much algorithmic research and find so many architectural ingenuities.\"The AI company delayed the release of its R2 model, which was initially planned for May, because of challenges training it on homegrown Huawei chips, the Financial Times reported in August. Chinese authorities had encouraged DeepSeek to use the processors as it looked to reduce reliance on U.S. alternatives in the face of export controls on Nvidia's most powerful chips, the publication said. DeepSeek has been approached for comment on the report.\"China's been constrained in the amount of computing power it's been able to access over the last couple of years, in large part because of U.S. restrictions on the sale of chips,\" Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War,\" told CNBC.\"If you want to build advanced models, you need access to advanced compute.\"DeepSeek said in a research paper it released earlier this month that it acknowledges \"certain limitations when compared to frontier closed-source models\" such as Gemini 3, including compute resources. watch nowMarkets have also been reassured of continued U.S. leadership in the AI space by new advanced model releases from frontier labs in the West. In August, OpenAI unveiled GPT-5, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5, and Google launched Gemini 3 in November. \"The competition between these providers is intense with rapid model releases and incremental improvement in capabilities,\" Gartner Analyst Arun Chandrasekaran told CNBC. \"As a result, fears of a sudden commoditization shock have eased.\"But there are signs DeepSeek is gearing up for a more significant model release in the coming months. On New Year's eve the company published a paper detailing a more efficient way of developing AI models.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives thinks there are more shocks in the market to come. \"Some of these moments that we've seen, we'll continue to see next year,\" he told CNBC.\"There'll be another DeepSeek.\"",

    "body": "Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., leaves a meeting of the House Republican Conference at the Capitol Hill Club on Wednesday, January 22, 2025. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesCalifornia Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa died Tuesday, his office announced. He was 65. \"Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord. He leaves a lasting legacy of servant leadership kindness to the North State,\" LaMalfa's chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, said in a statement. \"Congressman LaMalfa cared deeply for the people he served and worked tirelessly to hold the government to its word to fix our failing forests, build water storage, and leave people to be free to choose what is best for themselves.\"LaMalfa's death tightens the razor-thin House majority and could imperil Speaker Mike Johnson's grip on the chamber. The House stood at 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., resigned on Monday. LaMalfa's death brings the House to 218 Republicans. Democrats are favored to pick up additional seats from special elections in the coming months. Two Democrats are in a runoff in Texas at the end of the month, and the election to replace now-New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will take place later this year. LaMalfa represented California's 1st Congressional District since 2013. He chaired the Congressional Western Caucus. LaMalfa died in the hospital while undergoing emergency surgery, the Butte County Sherriff's Office said in a statement. He was brought to the hospital by ambulance after suffering a medical emergency at home. \"In accordance with standard protocols, the Coroner's Unit of the Butte County Sheriff's Office is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of death. A forensic pathologist is scheduled to conduct an autopsy as part of this investigation,\" the statement read.

Doug LaMalfa dies at 65, GOP saysClassified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro captureRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's ousterA rice farmer by trade, LaMalfa was a key player on California water issues and served on the House Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees. He also served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His electoral prospects, however, were increasingly at risk in 2026 after California adopted new congressional maps that favor Democrats. \"Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa,\" said House Speaker Johnson, R-La. \"He was as fierce of a fighter for his state's vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known.\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also expressed condolences for LaMalfa. \"A fourth-generation rice farmer, Rep. LaMalfa treasured his community, worked powerfully to protect California's farmers and served those he represented with principled purpose, from the state legislature to the United States House of Representatives,\" Jeffries said. President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned LaMalfa in remarks before the House GOP conference.\"He was a fantastic person,\" Trump said. \"He voted with me 100% of the time.\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a post to X that he's \"devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.\"\"Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,\" Emmer said. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom now has 14 days to announce a special election to replace LaMalfa, per California election laws. The election then must take place no more than 140 days after Newsom's proclamation -- potentially pushing an election to replace LaMalfa to June.Jeffries held a moment of silence for LaMalfa before a Democratic hearing on the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. \"A great member of Congress, from the great state of California,\" Jeffries said. Correction: There are 213 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. That fact was misstated in an earlier version of this article.",

The clerk, who also said \"I'm new here,\" then repeated that he had not been informed of any policy changes, and he offered to speak to the owner.

These 5 tips can helpOver 300,000 student loan borrowers were denied a new repayment planCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedEnacted in July, Trump's multitrillion-dollar legislation included several retroactive tax changes for 2025 that affect returns filed in 2026.  However, the IRS didn't update withholding tables for employers, which dictate how much to take from workers' paychecks. As a result, 2025 employee withholdings were based on taxes owed before Trump's cuts.   \"We expect that's going to pretty dramatically increase refunds on average during the [2026] tax filing season compared to prior years,\" said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. As of Dec. 26, the average refund for individual returns was $3,167 during the 2025 filing season, up slightly from $3,138 in 2024, according to the latest IRS data.Who could see a bigger tax refund in 2026 Millions of Americans could see a bigger refund or smaller tax bill in 2026, and a few tax breaks will impact a \"significant portion\" of filers, according to Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank.For 2025, Trump's legislation increased the standard deduction to $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, which impacts most filers. That's up from $15,000 and $30,000, respectively, before the change. Many families could also see a higher child tax credit. For 2025, the maximum tax break increased to $2,200 from $2,000 for families eligible to claim the full value.  The new $6,000 senior deduction for individuals age 65 and up could also impact many older Americans from 2025 through 2028. The full deduction is available with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income ($150,000 for married couples filing jointly).  Larger tax cuts for fewer Americans Trump's legislation also added temporary tax breaks for smaller groups of filers, which could provide \"much larger\" cuts, according to Lautz.Some of these include deductions on tip and overtime income, a tax break on auto loan interest, and a higher limit for the deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates. And nationally, about 6% of workers reported overtime pay in 2024, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an economic organization.  \"Where we'll see the biggest increases in refund size is actually from the higher SALT cap,\" Lautz said.  For 2025, the SALT deduction limit was raised to $40,000, up from $10,000 in 2024, which includes state and local income taxes and property taxes. But you can only claim the SALT deduction if you itemize tax breaks. Roughly 90% of filers don't itemize, according to the latest IRS data.",

    "body": "Nvidia is building out an automotive tech business. Pictured here are its autonomous vehicle test cars at the company's auto garage in Santa Clara, California, June 5, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia on Monday said it is working with robotaxi operators in hopes of having them use the company's AI chips and Drive AV software stack to power their fleets of autonomous vehicles as soon as 2027.Around that time, the chipmaker said that it hopes to power partner deployment of \"Level 4\" robotaxis, meaning vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in pre-defined regions, Xinzhou Wu, Nvidia's vice president of automotive, said at a self-driving demonstration in San Francisco last month.\"We will probably start with a limited availability but work with the partner for us to get our footing,\" Wu said. Since 2015, Nvidia has offered chips and other technology for cars under the Drive brand name, but that remains a small part of the company's business. Automotive and robotics chips accounted for just $592 million in sales in the quarter ended in October, or about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with Uber in October.The chipmaker said in December that it had developed software that can power a self-driving car and that Mercedes-Benz models to be released in late 2026 will be able to use Nvidia's technology to navigate cities like San Francisco.Self-driving cars remain one of the primary areas where Nvidia can show growth outside of AI infrastructure. CEO Jensen Huang has said that robotics — including self-driving cars — is the company's second most important growth category after artificial intelligence.\"We imagine that someday, a billion cars on the road will all be autonomous,\" Huang said at a launch event on Monday at the CES conference in Las Vegas. \"You could either have it be a robotaxi that you're orchestrating and renting from somebody, or you could own it.\"In addition to chips that go inside self-driving cars, Nvidia sells access to its famed AI chips as well as its simulation software to automotive companies so they can train self-driving models and develop technology. Nvidia says that car makers can use its Drive AGX Thor automotive computer, which costs about $3,500 per chip, to save on research and development costs and get self-driving features to market faster. Nvidia said it works with car makers to tune its technology, such as determining how hard the car should accelerate, for specific vehicles. \"Some say, 'Hey, I need your help on training and optimizing my software on your chip, but I'll take care of simulation myself,'\" said Ali Kani, general manager of Nvidia's automotive platform.Car companies, like Mercedes-Benz, want to tune Nvidia's technology, market it as part of its in-car experience and sell it as part of or alongside a new car. Robotaxis have caught on in the past year, led by Alphabet's Waymo, which is operating a commercial taxi service without drivers in five U.S. markets, including San Francisco. Nvidia's robotaxi announcement signals that it is targeting self-driving fleets in addition to personal cars that consumers can buy.watch nowRiding an Nvidia self-driving vehicleIn December, Nvidia offered reporters and analysts an hourlong ride through San Francisco in a 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan. While my car had a safety driver employed by Mercedes-Benz behind the wheel, the driver said that the car was driving itself for 90% of the ride. The drive was uneventful. San Francisco is a tricky city to drive in, with big hills, frequent red lights and trucks unloading in the middle of streets, but I never felt stressed and could focus on holding a conversation. But there was one major snag: The driver took control during a thorny situation where two buses and a self-driving Waymo were trying to pass in a four-lane road with street parking that also had trucks on both sides unloading goods. The driver had to back the car up and wait for the jam to clear. Nvidia said my drive was \"Level 2 Plus Plus,\" which means that its technology has features similar to Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode. Nvidia-powered cars like the Mercedes-Benz will have increasing self-driving capabilities, but the responsibility of keeping everyone safe still falls to the driver, who must pay attention at all times. The chipmaker said the system would eventually be able to do \"park-to-park,\" meaning it can drive from a starting parking space to another, but the Mercedes-Benz CLA cars won't come with that feature to start. \"Any parking situation that you feel is intimidating, that car will solve for you,\" said Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius at an Nvidia event on Monday. The Mercedes-Benz model that Nvidia demonstrated was launched last year in Europe, but it's launching in the U.S. this year, Kani said. The Mercedes-Benz cars were rolled out with lane keep and driver assistance features to help drivers stay in their lanes, Kani said. The vehicles received a lane-switching feature through a software update and will get hands-free highway driving, urban driving and park-to-park features this year.Nvidia said that it is using two AI systems in Drive-powered cars to ensure safety. The car mostly drives with an \"end-to-end\" system, called a vision-language model, that uses AI to decipher visual sensors and chart a path. The chipmaker said it also built a second, safety-oriented \"stack\" that uses strict rules — such as stopping at a stop sign — to take over when the AI is unsure about what to do. Still, Nvidia hopes that recent advances in generative AI — driven by the company's graphics processing units — will allow self-driving algorithms to become more capable. Nvidia is targeting 2028 for point-to-point self-driving features in consumer cars. Eventually, Nvidia said it wants to make the car itself feel like an actual driver that the users can simply speak to. \"With transformers and generative AI, we can do much more,\" Wu said.

    "body": "Demonstrators hold a large Venezuelan flag outside the National Assembly, on the day Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was formally sworn in as the country's interim president, as U.S.-deposed President Nicolas Maduro appeared in a New York court after the Trump administration removed him from power, in Caracas, Venezuela Jan. 5, 2026. Maxwell Briceno | ReutersVenezuela's long-defaulted bonds are suddenly one of the hottest trades in emerging markets.Prices on the country's benchmark notes due in October 2026 have surged to about 43 cents on the dollar, more than doubling since August. The rally comes as traders reassess recovery prospects on the distressed securities following the surprise removal of President Nicolas Maduro and a shift in U.S. policy that has opened the door to a potential restructuring of the nation's debt.Investors are betting that a faster-than-expected political transition along with a clearer path to asset recovery could unlock value that has been frozen for nearly a decade. Venezuela fell into default in late 2017 after failing to make payments on overseas bonds issued by both the government and its state-owned oil producer PDVSA. Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price are among the holders that own significant amounts of these defaulted bonds, according to reports.Donato Guarino, an emerging-market strategist at Citi, said uncertainties remain particularly given lingering questions about the new government's political alignment with Washington.\"To the Trump administration, it's key to extract the oil reserves the Venezuela has at the moment. That means that the GDP of Venezuela will go higher. That means that the ability to pay bondholders will be higher,\" Guarino told CNBC. \"However, in the short term, you may see some risks because what Trump did is a big gamble... there is a question of loyalty of the current new president towards Trump.\"Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. Big risk remainsBarclays upgraded Venezuela bonds to market weight after rapidly unfolding political developments altered its outlook.The Wall Street firm also cautioned that the scale and complexity of Venezuela's debt overhang could cap upside from here. Venezuela and PDVSA together have $56.5 billion of unsecured eurobonds outstanding, Barclays said. Including past-due interest, total bondholder claims rise to $98.3 billion, or roughly 119% of GDP, based on the IMF's 2025 GDP projection.The bank said recovery values could vary widely, noting that Venezuela's economy is now about 30% smaller and oil production has nearly halved over the past eight years. As a result, ultimate recoveries will depend heavily on how quickly the economy and oil sector can rebound in the years ahead.Jeffrey Sherman, deputy chief investment officer at DoubleLine, believes the rally may be running ahead of reality. \"There's still a lot of risks there. you have this kind of continuation right now of the leadership there,\" Sherman said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" \"We'll see how that transitions are talking about elections and things. So again, I think it's way too early to get too excited about that, especially as a debt investor.\"watch nowThe recent developments in Venezuela could also prove a major win for Elliott Investment Management, the firm founded by billionaire investor Paul Singer. Less than two months ago, the investor, known for striking lucrative deals in high-risk markets, won U.S. approval for a $6 billion bid for Citgo Petroleum, the refining firm owned by state-run PDVSA.— With assistance from Gina Francolla",

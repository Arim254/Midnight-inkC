    "body": "Students are seen on the campus of Columbia University in New York City on April 14, 2025.Charly Triballeau | AFP | Getty ImagesColumbia University said a student was detained by federal agents early Thursday, the latest sign of President Donald Trump's nationwide escalation of immigration enforcement.The student was taken by Department of Homeland Security officials from a university-owned residential building around 6:30 a.m., according to an email from Claire Shipman, the school's acting president, obtained by CNBC. \"Our understanding at this time is that the federal agents made misrepresentations to gain entry to the building to search for a 'missing person,'\" Shipman said.The New York City-based university is gathering more details and attempting to contact the student's family, Shipman said. The student was not named in the email.Thursday's detainment comes as Trump's focus on immigration has become a national flashpoint.Border czar Tom Homan said earlier this month that the administration would wind down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, an operation that sent thousands of agents to the Minneapolis area. Two U.S. citizens were killed by immigration officials this year in Minnesota, bringing the backlash against the White House's efforts to a fever pitch.All law enforcement agents required a judicial warrant or subpoena to enter housing and other non-public campus areas, Shipman said in her email. Agents looking to enter private campus spaces should wait until the school's public safety team has been contacted, she added.Columbia has been in the White House's crosshairs since Trump returned to office last year.The Education Department said in June that the Ivy League school did not meet its accreditation standards because it was \"is in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" A month later, Columbia said it would pay $200 million to the federal government to restore its funding that the Trump administration.Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was released after months in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention last year.The White House and DHS did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., holds a press conference as Congress faces a midnight Friday deadline for a deal to fund the Department of Homeland Security, in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Annabelle Gordon | ReutersAs they gathered in northern Virginia on Wednesday for their annual policy retreat, House Democrats rallied like they were on the brink of victory.\"House Democrats are on the verge of a takeover. The break's over for these MAGA extremists,\" Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said at the leadership press conference kicking off the retreat. \"It's over because people know that Donald Trump and House Republicans have failed the American people.\"Jeffries and his Democratic colleagues have toiled this Congress as House Republicans hold a razor-thin majority. They see a path back to power by focusing on affordability and the economy in this year's midterm elections, pointing to topics they say Trump has largely neglected.Much of the three-day policy retreat is focused on cost-of-living issues. Guests include labor union leaders, representatives from the Black Economic Alliance and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, and Virginia Gov. Abigail Spanberger, a former member of the House who delivered the Democratic rebuttal to Trump's Tuesday night State of the Union.Democrats will use the time together away from the Capitol to hone their messages to voters and to coalesce around what they think are the themes that will resonate with ordinary Americans.\"Is the president working for you?\" Spanberger asked in her speech, which made the case that Trump's policies were hurting average Americans.\"This is the defining contrast of the midterms. While Republicans broke their promise to lower costs, Democrats are focused on lowering costs for hardworking families just trying to get by,\" said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the person responsible for leading her party to taking control of the House.But victory is far from assured. Trump and Republicans are making their own aggressive pitch on affordability. They also have a cash advantage this cycle. And they have rolled out a series of election proposals — like voter-identification requirements and changes to mail voting — that Democrats say could disenfranchise millions. Coupled with the Supreme Court's pending decision on a challenge to a section of the Voting Rights Act that, if upheld, could eliminate some Democratic-held districts, Republicans are not out of contention come November.Still, there is cause for Democratic optimism. Recent polling shows many Americans are souring on Trump — a Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found 60% disapprove of the president. And Democrats have maintained a healthy lead in the generic ballot. Also, they need to net just three seats to flip the House.\"President Trump wants to take over elections. He's going to continue to tweet out and put out executive orders. He and republican governors could do other untoward things to affect our elections,\" House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., said. \"What we can control is communicating a message that will resonate to people. And that's what we're focused on,\" Aguilar said. ",

Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles,\" Peskov said.

    "body": "Rolls-Royce said Thursday it expects profits of over £4 billion ($5.42 billion) this year as the aero engine and power systems maker promised another year of robust growth.The aerospace giant is targeting underlying operating profit of between £4 billion and £4.2 billion in 2026, above the midpoint of £3.65 billion as expected by analysts polled by FactSet. It expects free cash flow of between £3.6 billion and £3.8 billion this year, also above expectations. It also announced that £2.5 billion of share buybacks would be completed this year as part of a multi-year buyback program of between £7 billion and £9 billion ($12 billion) for 2026 to 2028, above what earlier media reports had suggested. Shares rose as much as 7% in early trading on Thursday. The stock last traded up 4.5% and was on track for a record high after already reaching new highs multiple times this year.Based on the bullish outlook, the company now expects to deliver profits within the prior mid-term guidance range two years earlier than planned, CEO Tufan Erginbilgic said. \"Our transformation continues with pace and intensity,\" he said in a statement. The British company upgraded its 2028 targets to £4.9 billion to £5.2 billion in underlying operating profit, an operating margin in the range of 18% to 20%, and free cash flow of £5 billion to £5.3 billion. Beyond the mid-term, Erginbilgic said he expected his company to benefit from AI, the energy transition, and increased defense spending.Rolls-Royce shares have been on a tear over the past few years amid growth in all three of its businesses: civil aerospace, defense, and power systems. Over the past 12 months, the stock has more than doubled as the company has thrived amid a transformation plan launched by Erginbilgic, which has boosted investor confidence. The plan includes cutting costs and prioritizing its core businesses. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRolls-Royce shares are up more than 100% over the past year.In 2025, underlying operating profits jumped over 40% to a record £3.46 billion, beating FactSet estimates of £3.32 billion. Underlying revenue in the year rose 12% to £20.1 billion.It was the company's fourth straight year of beating earnings expectations.The beat-and-raise quarterly report was described as a \"high quality release\" by Jefferies analyst Chloe Lemarie, who noted that profits were driven by the power systems business. The unit, which is benefitting from the mass build-out of data centers that rely on Rolls-Royce's power generation system, generated £4.89 billion in revenue in 2025, reflecting an organic growth of 19% year-on-year.Read moreIts civil aerospace business — its biggest revenue and profit driver — which sells engines to Boeing and Airbus among others, grew 15% compared to last year.

Rolls-Royce currently makes engines for wide-body planes such as Boeing's Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus' A330 neo jets.It comes amid an engine squeeze for aircraft makers who are struggling to secure enough engines to meet delivery targets.\"We have an unsatisfactory situation with less engines than what we would need,\" Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC last week, referring to a clash with its key engine supplier Pratt & Whitney about 2026 engine deliveries.",

Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats will force a vote on a war powers resolution relating to Iran next week, Democratic leadership announced Thursday, as President Donald Trump engages in a massive military buildup in the region. The resolution would limit Trump's ability to conduct military action there.Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., have introduced a measure known as a war powers resolution that would compel the administration to seek congressional approval before engaging in any further activity in Iran. Congress has the sole authority to declare war under the U.S. Constitution, though that authority has been stretched in recent years by the executive branch. \"As soon as Congress reconvenes next week, we will compel a vote of the full House of Representatives on the bipartisan Khanna-Massie War Powers resolution,\" the Democratic leaders led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"The Iranian regime is brutal and destabilizing, seen most recently in the killing of thousands of protestors,\" the statement read. \"However, undertaking a war of choice in the Middle East, without a full understanding of all the attendant risks to our servicemembers and to escalation, is reckless.\"The war powers resolution would also need to be approved by the Senate if it is passed by the House. But passage from the House is far from a guaranteed outcome as bipartisan lawmakers have recently lined up against the resolution. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., released a statement last week opposing the measure, citing concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.\"We respect and defend Congress's constitutional role in matters of war. Oversight and debate are absolutely vital,\" the pair wrote. \"However, this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\"Trump has overseen a massive military buildup in the Middle East and has threatened strikes against Iran. His administration is also negotiating with Tehran over the country's nuclear program. The two countries are holding a third round of talks in Geneva on Thursday.The president said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he prefers to resolve the Iran situation diplomatically but did not take military force off the table. \"I will never allow the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said.

He also said the company's decision to cancel its plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will help with profitability.Stellantis' results come as carmakers across the globe look to walk back their EV plans. Car giants including GM, Ford and Honda, for example, have all announced billions of dollars in charges to write-down EV investments in recent months. The trend underscores the shifting dynamics at play on the road to full electrification.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMilan-listed shares of Stellantis so far this year.\"Our 2025 full year results reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition and of the need to reset our business around our customers' freedom to choose from the full range of electric, hybrid and internal combustion technologies,\" Filosa said in a statement. \"In 2026 our focus will be on continuing to close the execution gaps of the past, adding further momentum to our return to profitable growth,\" he added.Stellantis said it had suspended its dividend for 2026, as it had previously flagged, and issued up to 5 billion euros of hybrid bonds. It also reiterated its 2026 forecasts, including a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenues and a low-single-digit adjusted operating margin.Other earnings highlights:Adjusted operating loss of 842 million euros in 2025, compared with an adjusted operating income of 8.65 billion euros in 2024.Estimates net tariff expenses of 1.6 billion euros in 2026. Stellantis said it expects positive industrial free cash flow in 2027.Over the second half of 2025, Stellantis it delivered a \"solid\" performance, noting consolidated shipments came in at 2.8 million units, with North America posting the strongest contribution. Net revenues rose 10% to 79.25 billion euros through the latter half of 2025 when compared to the same period a year ago. These results reflect the initial impact of improved operational efficiencies, disciplined commercial strategies and the strength of the firm's global brand portfolio, Stellantis said.",

    "body": "watch nowThere is a $3 trillion opportunity for Black and other minority entrepreneurs to become business owners as part of the \"Great Business Transfer,\" according to a new report from McKinsey.\"This is the largest ownership transition in modern US history,\" said Shelley Stewart, a co-author of the report, senior partner and Chair of the McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility. \"This is a huge opportunity but there is also a challenge, the issue is many viable businesses may not successfully transfer because the market to connect buyers, sellers and capital is not built at scale.\"Researchers forecast 6 million small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, will be available for acquisition by 2035. If Black, Latino and women entrepreneurs can increase ownership in these transitioning businesses, it has the potential to unlock $3 trillion in new household wealth, the report found.McKinsey said the contrast between the opportunity and the risk is especially stark for the Black community.Only 3% of U.S. business owners are Black compared to 13% of the population. If current trends hold, Black entrepreneurs are expected gain $87 billion of the transferring enterprise value. However, if they increase their participation in the Great Business Transfer, the number could jump to more than $369 billion. Conversely, without greater participation, disparities in wealth would only be increased according to the report.Stewart added, the ripple effect of the transfer goes far beyond underrepresented communities.\"The thing that is going to make this successful is having the broadest pool of entrepreneurs to buy these businesses, so that means you have to be inclusive,\" said Stewart. \"This is in the interest of all Americans. This has implications on employment, it has implications on local economic spend, it has implications on wealth creation.\"Funding and finding the businessAccording to McKinsey, the biggest challenges for potential acquirers in the Black and other minority communities will be financing, gaining access to deal flow and navigating the advisory process in an acquisition.\"We have more Black check writers at venture capital firms and buyout firms than ever before,\" said Jacob Walthour of Blueprint Capital Advisors. \"Also working inside other traditional financial institutions like banks, so the capital is there.\" But Walthour added it's imperative for members of the Black and minority communities to understand the dynamics of acquiring a business compared to starting a new business.\"You can get people to put capital behind a business that already exists, one of the hardest things to do is raise capital to build that business,\" said Walthour. \"The basic principles of capitalism should always be in place and this includes return on investment. That's how professional investors think about allocating capital.\"John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation Hope, also emphasized the need for Black entrepreneurs to look for opportunities in essential industries as opposed to personal interests.\"You don't have to fall in love with this business,\" said Bryant. \"Business is not personal. Once that shift happens and you connect the hustle we have, the untapped ambition … that's how you become a millionaire. This boring traditional approach we have never tried.\"The planning process The McKinsey report highlights five stages of a successful ownership transfer: aspiration and preparation, search and sourcing, deal structuring and financing, ownership and value creation and succession and exit.Sheena Gray, CEO of the African American Advisors Association, said the transfer highlights the need for Certified Financial Planners as potential acquirers will, in many cases, enter unfamiliar financial territory.\"The right planning infrastructure can be meaningful to expand minority business ownership,\" said Gray. \"Certified Financial Planners are better positioned to structure tax strategies that will help someone when they want to transition to ownership strategically. It's an important component that most business owners don't think about when they are in talks about acquiring a new opportunity.\" Gravy Wealth founder Brandon William Jones is working with the National Black MBA Association to help professionals become business owners, a transition he calls going from an \"earner\" to an \"owner.\"\"It's more urgent now than ever to be in control and capture the value you create,\" said Jones. \"The world is moving to a place where the workers, the knowledge workers specifically, are now becoming optional.\"AI impactMcKinsey's Stewart said the potential for disruption from AI only increases the upside for business acquisition.\"What's in the 6 million businesses? You've got retail, you've got restaurants, you've got construction, you've got healthcare. You've got small manufacturing. These will certainly be impacted by AI, but these are labor intensive businesses that will continue to need labor,\" said Stewart, \"AI will play a role in helping entrepreneurs get smart on different industries, AI is not likely to eliminate the need for these businesses.\"\"It will be a question of whether we can create the market mechanism that connects businesses with entrepreneurs and capital. I actually think we could see an acceleration over the next decade if we can pull the infrastructure together that actually sets people up to buy these businesses.\"Jones also said AI can also be a key tool for narrowing wealth and ownership gaps: \"If someone is AI forward, not only can they potentially acquire this business they can run the AI playbook to drive a lot more efficiency and value.\"",

    "body": "Nicolai Tangen, CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, addresses a press conference on his company's annual results for 2024 at Norges Bank in Oslo, Norway, on January 29, 2025.Ole Berg-rusten | Afp | Getty ImagesNorway's $2 trillion oil fund, one of the world's biggest investors, said Thursday that it is now using AI to screen investments for potential reputational and ethical risks. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund, which was set up in the 1990s to invest revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry. It's an investor in more than 7,200 companies across 60 countries and has stakes in around 1.5% of the world's publicly listed stocks.It's long been influential on the global market and ESG — Environmental, Social, and Governance — investing. It uses its influence and voting rights to set expectations for the companies and markets it invests in, including impact on people, the environment and society.In its annual responsible investment report, the fund's management team said it was now using AI to provide governance and sustainability insights to portfolio managers. The technology means it can expand the scope and scale of the information it analyzes, leading to \"faster identification of material risks,\" NBIM said.A spokesperson for NBIM told CNBC that the organization's ESG risk monitoring team first began using Anthropic's Claude AI model in day-to-day work in Nov. 2024. Since then, they said, it has become \"an important tool in our monitoring of ESG risk across the portfolio.\"In Thursday's report, NBIM said 2025 saw the deployment of large-language AI models to screen all companies on their first day of entering its equity portfolio.\"These tools help us rapidly scan a wide range of public information that goes beyond what data vendors typically cover,\" the report said. \"Where risks emerge around key themes, the LLM conducts deeper searches, providing contextual summaries.\"watch nowNBIM receives daily AI-generated risk assessments for investments made the previous day, which the fund manager said enabled its team to immediately consider ways to mitigate these.\"Within 24 hours of our investment, the AI tools flag new companies in the fund's equity portfolio with potential links to, for example, forced labor, corruption or fraud,\" NBIM said in Thursday's report. \"Often, this information has not been captured in international media coverage or data vendor alerts. We always review the information before we make an investment or risk decision. In multiple instances, we identified and sold these investments before the broader market reacted to the risks, avoiding potential losses.\"NBIM said using AI this way had been particularly valuable for researching smaller companies in emerging markets, where news about the firm may be limited to small media outlets in local languages.\"Artificial intelligence is changing how we work as an investor,\" NBIM CEO Nicolai Tangen said in a statement in the report adding that sustainability and governance \"are inseparable from financial performance,\" noting that \"the world will remain complex and uncertain.\"The fund's value stands at around $2.2 trillion. In 2025, it posted an annual profit of 2.36 trillion kronor, or $246.9 billion.Nearly 40% of NBIM's investments are in U.S. equities, with its most valuable holdings including a 1.3% stake in Nvidia, a 1.2% stake in Apple and a 1.3% stake in Microsoft. NBIM also invests in fixed income, real estate and renewable energy infrastructure.watch nowLast year, however, some of its ethics-related decisions drew criticism — notably from the White House.In September, the U.S. State Department told CNBC it was \"very troubled\" by NBIM's decision to exit positions in American machinery manufacturer Caterpillar and five Israeli banks, citing \"unacceptable risk\" that the companies were contributing to rights violations in Palestinian territories.A spokesperson said NBIM's Caterpillar exit \"appears to be based on illegitimate claims against Caterpillar and the Israeli government.\"Norway's finance minister, Jens Stoltenberg, responded by saying the divestment was \"not a political decision.\"Until Nov. 2025, the Executive Board of Norges Bank decided whether companies should be excluded from the fund's investment portfolio or placed on an observation list. These decisions were informed by the Council on Ethics, an independent body appointed by Norway's Ministry of Finance.But following the controversy over some of its divestments last year, temporary guidelines were put in place, with a review on NBIM's ethical framework due to be presented by a government-appointed committee later this year. Under the temporary guidelines, Norges Bank can no longer make decisions on observation or exclusion of a company from the fund – but it may revoke previous decisions on excluding a company or putting it on the observation list. Meanwhile, the Council on Ethics was stripped of its ability to recommend observation or exclusion at least until the ethical framework review is finalized.\"The conflict in Gaza and the discussions about the fund's ethical framework and investments in Israel demonstrated in 2025 how complex and challenging this can be in practice,\" Tangen said in Thursday's report.\"While the fund's ethical framework is under revision, we continue our responsible investment work, strengthening the link between ownership and investment decisions and focusing on what is financially material.\"",

    "body": "Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban arrives to attend a European Council summit at the EU headquarters in Brussels on March 21, 2024.Sameer Al-doumy | Afp | Getty ImagesHungary has accused Ukraine of disrupting oil supplies it gets from Russia and has stationed troops at critical energy facilities across the country as Prime Minister Viktor Orban ramps up the rhetoric around energy and national security ahead of parliamentary elections in April.Orban on Wednesday accused Kyiv of imposing an \"oil blockade\" on Hungary by delaying the reopening of the Druzhba pipeline which supplies it, and neighboring Slovakia, with Russian oil. Ukraine shut the pipeline a month ago, saying a Russian strike had damaged it, but Hungary's leader accused Kyiv of deliberately keeping the pipeline closed for \"political\" rather than \"technical\" reasons.\"The Ukrainian government is exerting pressure on the Hungarian and Slovak governments through an oil blockade,\" Orban said in a video on X following a meeting of the Hungarian Defence Council on Wednesday. \"They will not stop there,\" he claimed, adding: \"They are preparing further actions to disrupt Hungary's energy system,\" without further details or evidence.Orban said he had \"ordered the strengthening of the protection for critical energy infrastructure. That means that ⁠soldiers ​and the necessary equipment to repel potential attacks will be deployed near key ​energy facilities.\"\"The police will also patrol with increased forces around designated power plants, distribution stations and control centers,\" he said. Drones were also banned in the north-east border region with Ukraine. Ukraine has not publicly responded to the accusations and CNBC has contacted the country's foreign ministry for a response. The ramping up of rhetoric around energy and national security, and an increase in anti-Ukraine sentiment, comes as Hungary's leadership fights to stay in power ahead of a parliamentary election in April. Orban's right-wing Fidesz party is trailing in most independent polls while former party insider and center-right challenger, Peter Magyar, is leading voter surveys ahead of the April 12 vote.Thorny relationsThe comments come amid thorny relations between the countries over energy, Russia-related sanctions, and the ongoing war. EU countries Hungary and Slovakia have continued to import Russian oil and gas despite the bloc attempting to curb — and wanting to outright ban — such imports, with both countries saying their economies and citizens rely on cheap Russian energy supplies.The relationship with Russia goes deeper than just energy, however, with the leaders of both countries, Hungary's Orban and Slovakian PM Robert Fico, both having good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin while having frosty relations with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On Thursday morning, Orban posted an open letter to Zelenskyy on Facebook, accusing him of \"working for four years to force Hungary into the war between you and Russia.\"Russia's President Vladimir Putin meets with Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban at the Kremlin in Moscow on July 5, 2024. Valery Sharifulin | Afp | Getty ImagesHungary and Slovakia have frequently opposed EU sanctions on Russia, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, and they again blocked an attempt by the EU to impose more punitive measures on Moscow this week that coincided with the four-year anniversary of the war.Both said their vetoes were due to the halt in Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline — a Soviet-era pipeline whose name translates as \"Friendship\" — that connects the two countries via Ukraine.The countries' closeness to Russia and reluctance over sanctions have strained relations with Brussels, as they accuse the EU of turning a blind eye to their energy needs. Hungary's Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó went further on Wednesday, saying Europe had overlooked incidents in which he said Ukraine was behind the sabotage of Russian-Europe energy infrastructure, such as the blowing up of the Nord Stream gas pipelines linking Russia to Germany. Ukraine has denied involvement in damage to one of the pipelines, but investigators in Germany have said the saboteurs were Ukrainian.\"The same people are blocking transportation on the Friendship oil pipeline today are the same as those who blew up the Nord Stream gas pipeline. This is the situation, and we cannot allow this,\" Szijjártó stated in comments reported by national news agency MTI. He did not produce evidence for his accusations.watch now",

    "body": "Liubomyr Vorona | Istock | Getty ImagesThe prospect of being replaced by artificial intelligence is helping to scare higher-income workers and leading them to stay in their jobs longer, according to several recent surveys.One closely followed gauge, the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, show confidence in the labor market among high earners around its historic lows going back to the late-1970s. Likewise, the New York Federal Reserve's monthly consumer survey shows unemployment angst also around record highs.Finally, payrolls processing firm ADP notes that turnover among traditionally white-collar occupations is around record lows.The reason for the trend? \"Our guess is partially 'AI fear', as white collar jobs are possibly at greater risk, but we are open to other explanations,\" UBS chief economist Arend Kapteyn said in a note. The rise of AI is causing both excitement and fear among investors, employers and workers alike. Policymakers also are trying to gauge the impact of the new technology and how it will fit into the economy.\"In my lifetime, I have never seen a technological revolution like this — and I have seen the birth of space exploration, the rise of the personal computer, the explosion of the internet and then smartphones,\" Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Tuesday. \"Firms, households, and every government [agency] are all trying to incorporate it into the way they function and operate.\"watch nowFor the moment, AI appears to be contributing to angst and caution.Over the past year, the University of Michigan survey has found a general decline in sentiment over the labor market. However, it's been most pronounced among the top one-third of earners, whose sentiment score on the labor market, in this case expectations for a higher unemployment rate, to be at its lowest level since the financial crisis ended in 2009. Sentiment among lower-income workers also has declined but is actually higher than those at the top end.Likewise, the New York Fed's month Survey of Consumer Expectations is showing that expectations of finding a job in three months if one loses their job today is around the lowest for a data sent that stretches to mid-2013.And ADP's extensive data on the private jobs picture shows that professions such as finance and information and business services is showing reduced turnover rate. In January, turnover for professional and business services was the lowest the firm ever recorded.\"The normal push-and-pull of job gains and pay growth — quantity and price — that once kept the labor market dynamic has weakened, giving way to a market defined more by inactivity than vigor,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP.To be sure, the jobs picture is still very strong for higher-income groups.While the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not break out the unemployment rate by income, it does classify it by profession. Finance, for instance, had a jobless level of just 2.1% in January, close to the same level a year ago. Professional and business services was somewhat elevated at 4.5%, but down 0.4 percentage point from January 2025.\"We immediately jump to the notion that a bunch ⁠of people are going to ‌be displaced\" by AI, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin ‌said at an event Wednesday. \"We should also remember ⁠people are going ⁠to be enabled.\"Similarly, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid said in the long run, AI will be a benefit to the labor market and the economy.\"I personally think we're going to need AI to supplement the fact that we aren't having new entrants into the labor market like we did, let's say 30 years ago or 40 years ago,\" Schmid said during a separate event Wednesday. \"So AI is going to have to be an enhancement to do jobs.\"",

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., is at the forefront of ensuring artificial intelligence and chips are being viewed as a national security asset — and he isn't afraid to call Huang out directly.  \"The joke here is, Jensen wants us to trust the CCP,\" Mast told CNBC in an interview, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. \"Anybody watching this should laugh.\"In the latest salvo, the House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced legislation that would allow Congress 30 days to review and block sales of advanced chips to adversarial countries — similar to the power Congress has with arms and weapons sales. It would also cancel all existing export licenses to countries like China until the government submits a detailed strategy about how the chips would impact military and intelligence. All but two members of the committee voted to advance the measure. There is already a companion bill in the Senate with bipartisan backing from Sens. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\"We are in an AI arms race, and it's important that we know where the AI arms dealers are selling,\" Mast said in the interview. He said while Congress has no right to interfere with chips being sold for video games and other commercial purposes, \"when it blends into the world of now, it's real war, real weapon systems, real casualties at the highest level of all militaries, yeah, we're going to have a say.\"Mast added that Huang \"might not like it, but that's what's going to take place.\"Nvidia said in a statement to CNBC the likelihood of China's military using American chips was low as \"it makes no sense for the Chinese military to depend on American technology.\"The company added that the \"administration's critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America's lead in AI.\"Mast, a supporter of Trump's, said the committee was in sync with the White House, and the bill codified provisions in a recent Commerce Department regulation that permitted the sale of advanced chips to China. Both the bill and regulation ban advanced chips from being licensed in a way that could benefit the Chinese military, although the Commerce Department doesn't give lawmakers the power to block a sale. Despite strong support, the bill faces an uphill climb to get to the floor. Ahead of the vote in committee, David Sacks, the White House's AI czar, retweeted a post from the X account Wall Street Mav that slammed the bill, saying it \"handicaps Trump's ability to strategically position the USA favorably against China.\"Sacks quoted the tweet, adding \"Correct.\"Mast pushed back, saying that the talking points of the accounts Sacks boosted matched the talking points he'd heard from Nvidia. \"What he was promoting was literally mercenary influencers, about a dozen of them, telling literal lies,\" Mast said. Mast said he worked with others in the administration on the bill prior to the vote in committee. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The committee isn't done with its oversight of chips. Mast is also planning a vote on a bill requiring exported advanced chips contain a mechanism to verify their location — and would require exporters to flag the government if a chip wound up in an unauthorized location. The bill, known as the Chip Security Act, has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate",

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Finance Committee, said in a letter obtained by CNBC that the deal raises questions about whether Lutnick's immediate family members may have benefited financially. \"It is imperative that federal investments in critical industries be made free from conflicts of interest and on the merits,\" the senators told Lutnick in the letter dated Feb. 25, requesting more information about his involvement in the transaction. The Commerce Department issued a letter of intent last month to provide USA Rare Earth with $1.6 billion in funding to help scale up the company's planned rare earth mining and magnet manufacturing business. The deal required USA Rare Earth to secure at least $500 million in private funding. USA Rare Earth selected Cantor as the \"lead placement agent\" for a fundraising round that totaled $1.5 billion, according to a financial filing.   Lutnick stepped down last year as chairman and CEO of Cantor to lead Commerce. His son Brandon took the reins as chairman and his son Kyle was named executive vice chairman. Lutnick transferred his stake in Cantor to his sons and other adult children through trusts controlled by Brandon. \"We have serious concerns about the Commerce Department's decision to enter this deal in which your former firm, run by your sons, has a clear financial interest,\" the senators said. \"Given your close ties to Cantor, and Cantor's apparent financial interest in USAR, the Commerce Department's investment should be closely scrutinized,\" they said. CNBC has reached out to the Commerce Department for comment. watch nowThe Cantor-led fundraising round was a type of transaction called private investment in public equity, or PIPE. In these transactions, a placement agent usually sells discounted shares to a restricted pool of investors while receiving a fee, the senators wrote. \"If the PIPE funds were raised under these circumstances, then it appears that, in order to secure public funds from the government agency you lead, USAR paid your family's company to raise matching private funds,\" the senators said. The senators also raised concerns that financial firms led by donors to President Donald Trump's campaigns and inaugural committees participated in the fundraising for USA Rare Earth. They include Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman, Citadel founder Ken Griffin, and Point72 Asset Management founder Steven Cohen, according to a financial filing. Schwarzman donated to Trump's super PAC, Griffin gave funds to the president's 2025 inaugural committee and Cohen donated to his first-term inauguration.\"It is unclear how or why these supporters of the Trump administration became involved in the USAR PIPE, or the extent to which they were aware of the Commerce Department's direct investment in USAR,\" the senators said. Griffin has made donations to multiple presidents across administrations, Citadel spokesperson Zia Ahmed said. \"The USA Rare Earth investment was made by a Citadel-managed fund, not by Ken Griffin personally,\" Ahmed said. CNBC has reached out to Blackstone and Point72 for comment.The letter requests information on when Lutnick became aware of Cantor's representation of USA Rare Earth in the fundraising round and whether he or Commerce had any involvement in it, among other questions.

Mountain Pass is the only commercial-scale rare earths mine in the U.S.Once operational, 10X will produce about 7,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets annually, bringing the company's total production to 10,000 metric tons per year.The company has another magnet facility in Forth Worth, Texas, which started commercial production in 2025. Total capacity is about 3,000 tons per year, with customers including General Motors and Apple.China dominates critical minerals supply chains – including for rare earths, controlling more than 90% of processing, separation capacity, and magnet manufacturing. Last year the nation weaponized rare earths by curbing exports, shining a spotlight on chokepoints within the critical minerals supply chain.watch nowU.S. imports of rare earth magnets fell to about 6,000 tons in 2025 amid export controls. MP Materials' new factory could end direct import dependence. However, when including imports of end products that use rare earths magnets – including cars and phones – U.S. demand is significantly higher.The Trump administration has announced a host of initiatives aimed at boosting domestic mining. Last year, the Defense Department took a $400 million stake in MP Materials, while also guaranteeing a minimum price of $110 per kilogram for 10 years for neodymium-praseodymium oxide, which is used to make magnets. All of 10X's output is currently committed to the Pentagon for 10 years as part of the previously announced deal. That said, there is opportunity for commercial customers to use the material with the DOD's agreement.\"We are advancing key objectives under our public-private partnership with the Department of War and accelerating America's rare earth and magnet independence with an uncompromising focus on speed, execution, and delivery,\" said MP Materials founder and CEO James Litinsky.The factory is expected to begin production in 2028 and create 1,5000 direct manufacturing and engineering jobs at the site.\"The Chinese Communist Party represents the most acute national security threat to the United States, yet we remain dependent on the CCP for critical minerals,\" Senator Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a statement. \"MP Materials is building the infrastructure needed to undo that dependence and bolster American national security,\" he added.watch now",

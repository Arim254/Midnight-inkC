    "body": "Every job, when you boil it down, is simply people talking to other people. As a career coach, I've advised professionals at all career stages. From what I've seen, the people who get ahead the fastest know how to communicate in a way that truly gets people to listen. You may not realize it, but the language you use could be standing between you and what you want. Here are five simple language swaps that can help you succeed, forge meaningful relationships, and demand more respect at work.1. Swap closed asks for open asks You're always going to face moments where you have a question you're not quite sure how to ask. Maybe you want to work from home, take a sabbatical, or get an extra week of vacation for your honeymoon. Because these are high-stakes situations, most people walk into the conversation radiating anxiety, cornering their opponent, or blurting out a closed-ended, yes-or-no question.But making an open-ended ask can take the pressure off both parties and invite a dialogue about a process, priority or norm. It makes you look thoughtful, rather than entitled. Instead of \"Can you write me a recommendation?\" try \"What does your typical process for writing recommendations look like?\"Instead of \"Can I leave early Friday?\" try \"How does the team typically handle flexibility on Fridays?\"Instead of \"Can I get a promotion?\" try \"What would you say should be my priorities if I want to get promoted this year?\"2. Swap apologies for gratitudeWhether it's a typo in a Slack message or you're running 15 minutes late to an important meeting, missteps happen. Genuine apologies are necessary at times, but over-apologizing often backfires. Research has found that habitual, unnecessary apologizing can erode how others perceive your competence and confidence. But it can also feel awkward not to acknowledge small mistakes, so I recommend replacing unnecessary apologies with gratitude. Instead of \"Sorry I'm a minute late!\" try \"Thank you so much for waiting. Let's get started.\"Instead of \"Sorry for all the questions,\" try \"I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through this.\"Instead of \"Sorry, I know this is last-minute,\" try \"Thanks for being flexible with the timeline. I know this is last-minute.\"3. Swap your 'buts' for 'ands' The word \"but\" often negates everything that comes before it. Whenever you're stating two things that are equally valid, I encourage you to replace \"but\" with \"and.\" Instead of \"I love my job, but I need a raise,\" try \"I love my job, and I need a raise.\"Instead of \"This was a great quarter, but we need to improve retention,\" try \"This was a great quarter, and we need to improve retention.\"Instead of \"I appreciate the feedback, but I disagree,\" try \"I appreciate the feedback, and I see it a bit differently.\"The \"and\" version of these examples doesn't minimize either statement. It allows two things to be true at once, promoting greater nuance and clarity. 4. Swap 'I feel like…' for 'I noticed that'\"I feel like\" can come across as gentle, soft, and humble, which are all wonderful things to be. But in a professional setting, it can soften your message to the point where it can be easily dismissed. It frames your professional observations as personal emotions. In a work environment where data and clarity carry weight, that framing can work against you. Here's what you can say instead:Instead of \"I feel like we're behind schedule,\" try \"I've noticed we're falling behind schedule.\"Instead of \"I feel like we should go with option two,\" try \"My recommendation is to move forward with option two.\"Instead of \"I feel like we aren't on the same page,\" try \"It seems like we're not aligned on this.\"5. Swap 'why' with 'how' or 'what'Questions that begin with \"why\" can put people on the defensive. Even if unintended, \"why\" often implies judgment, asking someone to justify their choices or thinking.When someone feels like they need to defend themselves, the conversation stops being collaborative and starts being adversarial. Instead, invite your conversation partner to walk you through their thought process, rather than demanding they explain themselves.Instead of \"Why do you think launching a week earlier would be smart?\" try \"How do you think launching a week earlier would benefit the campaign?\"Instead of \"Why are you doing it like that?\" try \"What technique are you using?\"Instead of \"Why did you move the meeting?\" try \"What was the reason for moving the meeting?\"Instead of \"Why did you assume it wouldn't work?\" try \"How did you come to that conclusion?\"Ultimately, when you make these shifts, the person you're talking to will feel more heard and respected — and will be more willing to have an honest conversation with you as a result. Erin McGoff is the founder of AdviceWithErin and author of \"The Secret Language of Work.\" Follow her @AdviceWithErin.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

    "body": "Preteen girl at desk solving homework with AI chatbot. Phynart Studio | E+ | Getty ImagesThe UK government is closing a \"loophole\" in new online safety legislation that will make AI chatbots subject to its requirement to combat illegal material or face fines or even being blocked.After the country's government staunchly criticized Elon Musk's X over sexually explicit content created by its chatbot Grok, Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced new measures that mean chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT,  Google's Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot will be included in his government's Online Safety Act. The platforms will be expected to comply with \"illegal content duties\" or \"face the consequences of breaking the law,\" the announcement said.This comes after the European Commission investigated Musk's X in January for spreading sexually explicit images of children and other individuals. Starmer led calls for Musk to put a stop to it.Keir Starmer, UK prime minster, during a news conference in London, UK, on Monday, Jan. 19, 2026. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEarlier, Ofcom, the UK's media watchdog, began an investigation into X reportedly spreading sexually explicit images of children and other individuals.\"The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass,\" Starmer said, announcing the latest measures. \"We are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action.\"Starmer gave a speech on Monday on the new powers, which extend to setting minimum age limits for social media platforms, restricting harmful features such as infinite scrolling, and limiting children's use of AI chatbots and access to VPNs.One measure announced would force social media companies to retain data after a child's death, unless the online activity is clearly unrelated to the death.\"We are acting to protect children's wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media,\" Starmer said.Alex Brown, head of TMT at law firm Simmons & Simmons, said the announcement shows how the government is taking a different approach to regulating rapidly developing technology. \"Historically, our lawmakers have been reluctant to regulate the technology and have rather sought to regulate its use cases and for good reason,\" Brown said in a statement to CNBC. He said that regulations focused on specific technology can age quickly and risk missing aspects of its use. Generative AI is exposing the limits of the Online Safety Act, which focuses on \"regulating services rather than technology,\" Brown said.He said Starmer's latest announcement showed the UK government wanted to address the dangers \"that arise from the design and behaviour of technologies themselves, not just from user‑generated content or platform features,\" he added.There's been heightened scrutiny around children and teenagers' access to social media in recent months, with lawmakers citing mental health and wellbeing harms. In December, Australia became the first country to implement a law banning teens under 16 from social media. Australia's ban forced apps like Alphabet's YouTube, Meta's Instagram, and ByteDance's TikTok to have age-verification methods such as uploading IDs or bank details to prevent under-16s from making accounts. Spain became the first European country to enforce a ban earlier this month, with France, Greece, Italy, Denmark, and Finland also considering similar proposals.The UK government launched a consultation in January on banning social media for under-16s.Additionally, the country's House of Lords, an unelected upper legislative chamber, voted last month to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include a social media ban for under-16s. The next phase will see the bill reviewed by parliament's the House of Commons. Both houses have to agree on any changes before they pass into law. ",

The conference brings together leaders in business, government, technology, philanthropy, academia, and the media to discuss actionable and collaborative solutions to some of the most important questions of our time. Photographer: Dania Maxwell/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHyatt Hotels Chairman Thomas Pritzker said Monday that he would retire and renounced his relationship with sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Pritzker will leave his post as the hotel chain's executive chairman — a role he's held for more than two decades — immediately, he said in a statement released by the Pritzker Organization. The 75-year-old billionaire Hyatt heir said he would not seek reelection to the board at the annual stockholder meeting.\"My job and responsibility is to provide good stewardship. That is important to me,\" Pritzker said in the statement. \"Good stewardship includes ensuring a proper transition at Hyatt.\"Pritzker said he has \"regret\" over his connection to Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein plead guilty to state criminal charges related to soliciting prostitution, including one charge involving a minor, in Florida in 2008. He killed himself in 2019 after being arrested for federal child sex trafficking charges.Recently released files show Pritzker and Epstein exchanged friendly emails after the disgraced financier's 2008 plea deal. Being part of the release of thousands of documents and photos does not imply any wrongdoing.\"I exercised terrible judgment in maintaining contact with them, and there is no excuse for failing to distance myself sooner,\" Pritzker said in the statement. \"I condemn the actions and the harm caused by Epstein and Maxwell and I feel deep sorrow for the pain they inflicted on their victims.\"Following his retirement, Pritzker said he would focus attention on a science foundation he began.Pritzker's announcement marks the latest in a series of high-profile resignations as more details about Epstein's dealings become public. Former Goldman Sachs Legal Chief Kathryn Ruemmler and Paul Weiss Chair Brad Karp were both among the latest business leaders to step down from their positions. Both Ruemmler and Karp and have said they regret their connections to Epstein and that coverage of their ties were creating distractions for the companies they represented.Hyatt said its board appointed CEO Mark Hoplamazian to succeed Pritzker as chair starting immediately. Board member Richard Tuttle thanked Pritzker for his work and called him \"instrumental\" in determining the Chicago-based company's strategy in a press release.",

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesApple on Monday announced that it will bring a new integrated video podcast experience to Apple Podcasts this spring.The move comes as video viewership continues to reshape podcasting. About 37% of people over age 12 watch video podcasts monthly, according to Edison Research.The update brings Apple Podcasts more in-line with its competitors Spotify, YouTube and now Netflix, which have increasingly leaned into video podcasting.\"Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services, in a statement. \"By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we're putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.\"Within the Apple Podcasts app, users will be able to switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows from the same feed. They can also use picture-in-picture mode and download video episodes for offline viewing.While Apple Podcasts has supported video through RSS since 2005, those feeds were kept separate from audio versions of the same show. The new update introduces support for HLS, or HTTP Live Streaming, a streaming protocol developed by Apple that enables adaptive video playback and greater controls within the app.The new HLS format also introduces dynamic video ad insertion. Creators who distribute through participating hosting providers and ad networks will be able to insert video ads, including host-read spots, into episodes.Apple said it will not charge creators or hosting providers to distribute content. However, it will charge participating ad networks an impression-based fee for delivering dynamic video ads through HLS.These launch podcast hosting partners include Acast, Amazon-owned ART19, Triton's Omny Studio and SiriusXM who will all be supporting HLS video.The announcement comes as competitors continue investing in podcast video. YouTube said last year it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content on its platform. Spotify has also expanded its video podcast offerings and said it paid more than $100 million to podcasters in the first quarter of last year.Netflix has also entered the video podcast space. The streaming platform inked a deal with Spotify last year to bring video podcasts to Netflix and has begun investing in original video podcast programming, including \"The Pete Davidson Show,\" which launched in January.Apple does not break out revenue specifically for Apple Podcasts, but its Services segment, which includes digital content and subscription businesses, generated $30 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter.In January, the company acquired Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an undisclosed amount. The company has not released details of the acquisition, though Q.ai's website indicated it was working on audio-focused AI tools.",

    "body": "Tequila Turner collected her last regular paycheck in October 2024. Since then she's traded her steady career in corporate IT for freelance projects and gig work, like delivering for DoorDash. Her income plummeted from six figures to a fraction of that last year, she tells me over the phone between making deliveries. She moved in with friends to save money. And she's been hard at work looking for a new job — but so far, no real luck. Turner, 47, says she lost her job over a year ago when her contract role with a bank ended. The Kansas City, Missouri, resident is part of the growing share of Americans who are not only unemployed but have been looking for work for six months or more, making them what the Bureau of Labor Statistics defines as \"long-term unemployed.\" Official numbers about the job market show a relatively stable labor economy with stronger than expected job growth in January — more than half of jobs added were in health care — and a slight drop in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, or 7.4 million people.But the share of people who've been out of work for six-plus months has been rising for the last three years. Typically, long-term unemployment has gone down after the job market recovers following recessionary shocks like the pandemic or Great Recession.Today, 1 in 4 unemployed people, or 1.8 million Americans, have been job searching for over half a year, which in most cases means they've also exhausted their unemployment insurance benefits. Benefits vary by state but on average replace less than 40% of a person's previous income.In today's challenging hiring environment, stories like Turner's are becoming more common.Why long-term unemployment is on the riseThe pool of job opportunities has been shrinking for a while: Job openings, hiring and voluntary quits (which signal workers' confidence in being able to get a new job) have been sliding since the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2022. Meanwhile, U.S. employers added just 181,000 jobs in all of 2025 (compared to 1.46 million in 2024), and businesses announced 108,435 layoffs in January.These compounding factors mean those looking for a job are having a harder time landing one.Businesses are no longer adding jobs and are slowly trimming their workforce to correct for over-hiring directly after the pandemic recession, says Nicole Bachaud, a labor economist at career site ZipRecruiter.\"The moment we're in right now in labor is stagnation across the board for workers and for employers,\" she says. While workers moved jobs (and even quit on their own) after other recessions like the 2008 financial crisis or Covid-19 pandemic, today they're staying put.\"Unemployment is becoming more of a status quo versus a temporary position for workers who find themselves out of their job,\" Bachaud says.People who've been out of work long-term tell CNBC Make It the experience has chipped away at their confidence and made them question their career decisions. Some have taken on part-time work to pay for bills, while others have moved in with family. They say they're doing everything by the job-searching playbook, and even trying new methods, but still nothing seems to be working.Big challenges for young workersThe tough hiring market is hitting certain demographics hard, including young professionals.Chris Fong, 25, says he thought it wouldn't be too hard to find a job when he was laid off from a startup in March 2025. He went to a top-tier university, did well at his previous jobs and lives in the Bay Area, a major job market.But in the months since, Fong says he's noticed a drop in entry-level jobs, and he's often competing with candidates with more years of experience or higher graduate degrees than him.Fong's observations reflect a larger trend: Entry-level job postings were down by about 35% in mid-2025 compared to January 2023, according to research from Revelio Labs.Chris Fong is an early-career job seeker in the San Francisco Bay Area.Courtesy of subjectHe's also noticed the interview process getting longer as companies get \"more picky,\" he says. One recent company required eight rounds, and he still didn't get the role.Fong says he's been living on savings and recently took up a part-time job working at a friend's film rental gear company. It's minimum wage but helps pay the bills. In January, he started documenting his unemployment journey on Instagram as a creative outlet and to regain control of his life and career story. \"I was tired of letting these recruiters and companies judge me based off my previous experience\" on a resume, he says. \"I was like, 'I'm going to start something myself.'\"Long-term unemployment is still talked about a personal shortcoming when in reality it's increasingly a structural issue.Sakshi PatelJob seeker in BostonSome recent grads say changing immigration policies add stress to their search.Sakshi Patel, 22, earned her master's degree in financial management in May 2025. She's currently volunteering at a nonprofit as a business analyst, but as an international student from India needs to find employment by the spring in order to stay in the U.S. Now, she's worried new policies, like the Trump administration's revamping the H1-B visa program and adding a $100,000 application fee, will mean companies won't be looking to hire international students who need visa sponsorship like her.Sakshi Patel graduated with her master's degree in May 2025 and hopes to secure a full-time job in finance.Courtesy of subjectPatel says she's trying everything to get hired: She lives in Boston but will relocate anywhere and is open to jobs not related to her major. She estimates she sends 30 to 40 tailored applications per week but rarely hears back.\"Long-term unemployment is still talked about a personal shortcoming when in reality it's increasingly a structural issue,\" she adds. \"A lot of people are doing everything they're supposed to be doing and still not getting work.\"From feeling in-demand to 'completely ignored'Myriam Samake laments the lack of transparency in hiring today. When she landed her job as a multimedia news journalist in 2023, she'd contacted the news director on LinkedIn, set up two phone interviews, and had a gig lined up after grad school. The contract role ended in June 2025.The 27-year-old in Sterling, Virginia, keeps an Excel spreadsheet with all of her applications in the last seven months, which is 150 roles and counting, including getting to final interviews for two roles but no offers. One company completely ghosted her, she says.Do I have to knock off $5,000, $10,000 and accept a lower salary just to get my foot in the door?Myriam SamakeJob seeker in Sterling, Virginia\"It's at that point where if I did get an offer, I would take it 100%,\" she says. \"It's sad in a way, where I don't know if we can be as picky anymore.\"In another sign of the challenging job-seeker market, more workers are making a lateral move or taking a pay cut for a new job, and the share of new hires who say they landed their \"dream job\" is down, according to ZipRecruiter data from the final months of 2025.Samake says she doesn't have high hopes to land hers. \"I'm trying to look for places that have diversity. I am a Black woman, and that's important to me,\" she says. \"Do I have to lower my expectations on that or the salary I want? Do I have to knock off $5,000, $10,000 and accept a lower salary just to get my foot in the door?\"Like many job seekers, Samake is frustrated with the state of applying to jobs online and never really knowing if the materials she pours over make it to a human reviewer. In mid-2025, the average job opening received 242 applications, or three times the average in 2017, according to Greenhouse data reported by Business Insider.\"It's such a mental war,\" Samake says.Even experienced workers are having a hard time. Greg Roth, 52, remembers back in 2022 getting to final interviews with four companies and securing two competing offers. The D.C.-based executive communications professional joined Thumbtack, the home repair marketplace, in June 2022, but by December was laid off along with 14% of the company. Greg Roth is an executive communications professional in the Washington, D.C. area.Courtesy of subjectHe resumed looking for a full-time job in 2024 but says interviews are hard to come by. \"In a short amount of time I've gone from feeling very in-demand to feeling completely ignored,\" Roth says. \"My skills haven't changed, so either the market has changed, or there's just less hiring.\"Both are likely, says Bachaud, the ZipRecruiter economist. Businesses have been scaling back on hiring due to a number of economic factors (like high interest rates and stubborn inflation), political challenges (like new tariff policies) and shifting business objectives (like investments in AI), Bachaud says.And now, the supply of job seekers it outpacing demand in hiring: As of December, there were roughly 1 million more people looking for work than there were available jobs, according to BLS data analyzed by Indeed.What job seekers wish others knew about long-term unemploymentAndrew Bohan says one of the hardest parts of dealing with long-term unemployment isn't just the constant rejection, but also not have a satisfying answer when people ask how the search is going.Bohan lost his paralegal job in August 2024, exhausted his unemployment insurance benefits in March 2025, and in January 2026 moved from Chicago to Baltimore to live with family and keep bills low.\"I like to tell people being unemployed isn't the problem; it's keeping your head screwed on that's the real problem,\" he says. He says he can feel pressure to \"prove\" he's being proactive about his circumstances among friends and family, though that's hard to show without the results of interviews or offers.Losing a job can have long-term impacts: Research has shown that losing a job is associated with declines in psychological and physical wellbeing, social withdrawal and long-term earning losses. Other studies have shown people who experience unemployment tend to get new jobs earning about 5% to 15% less than similar workers who did not lose their jobs.Bohan, who's recently applied to hourly service jobs to no avail, tries not to be too pessimistic about his situation. Otherwise it shows up in his interactions, from recruiters to friends and family. \"You just have to focus on what's in front of you and what you can do about it,\" he says.That can be as simple as getting a good night's rest in order to be ready to apply to new jobs the next day, Bohan says: \"I don't like being idle. I want to get back into the game.\"These are people who've provided for their families and themselves for their entire lives. We want to do the work.Tequila TurnerJob seeker in Kansas City, MissouriTurner, the risk management worker in Kansas City, hopes long-term job seekers recognize that it takes a lot of self care and encouragement to not internalize the challenges of unemployment. To those who do have jobs or know others struggling with the search, \"I wish people knew this is not a choice,\" Turner says. \"It's new to us. These are people who've provided for their families and themselves for their entire lives.\"Many job seekers, like Turner, have years of work experience and valuable skills they've earned over their careers, she says. Now they just need the opportunity to showcase that to an employer, she says: \"We want to do the work.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "d3sign | GettyA crisis over contaminated baby formula has grown with product recall after recall in recent weeks. On Friday, Paris' public prosecutor said it opened investigations into five companies that make the formula. Parents and investors are on edge.The investigation concerns possibly contaminated infant nutrition products distributed by three of the world's largest dairy groups, Nestle, Danone, and privately-held Lactalis, as well as smaller brands Babybio and La Marque en Moins. The recalls were due to possible contamination of cereulide, a heat-stable toxin that can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea when consumed. While symptoms typically resolve within a day, it can lead to more severe complications.The Paris prosecutor said it opened its investigations due to \"deception regarding goods posing a danger to human health,\" an offence punishable by up to seven years in prison and a fine of up to 3.75 million euros ($4.45 million), according to a translated statement. CNBC reached out to the companies mentioned for comment.In January, Nestle CEO Philipp Navratil said he was sorry about the worry and disruption this has caused parents and customers. \"Let me reassure you that your safety and wellbeing is our highest priority,\" he said. The prosecutor's office took up the case due to the large number of complaints across the country, it said.In addition, the French health ministry is looking into three reported baby deaths in cases where consumption of infant formula affected by the recall was reported. On Feb. 11, it said that no causal link had been established and that judicial investigations are underway.Worldwide recallsNestle published a \"sequence of events\" on Jan. 29, saying it found traces of cereulide in batches of some of its finished products in early December in its factory in the Netherlands. On Dec. 10, it informed Dutch authorities, the European Commission and potentially impacted countries of potential risks, according to the company's timeline, which added it initiated recalls the same day of all batches produced: 25 products in 16 countries in Europe.Sod Tatong | Moment | Getty ImagesIn January, the Swiss company issued its first major public recall for brands SMA, Beba and Little Steps across Europe, and recalls by French peers Danone, the maker of best-selling Aptamil and Cow & Gate, and Lactalis followed. So far, there have been recalls in over 60 countries.The contamination source has been traced back to an ingredient supplier of arachidonic acid (ARA) oil, which is often added to baby formula, Nestle said.The fallout has grown over time because many different companies and multiple brands used this supplier. The supplier hasn't been officially named. The UK's Food Standards Agency said the supplier of the ARA oil was no longer being used by Nestle or DanoneIt still urged parents and caregivers to check if the formula products they have at home were among those batches listed in the recalls.On Feb. 2, the European Food Safety Authority set a threshold level of the toxin cereulide. There hadn't previously been a harmonized standard because of its rarity, said Barclays analyst Warren Ackerman.Earlier this month, UK authorities said they had received at least 36 clinical reports of infants showing symptoms consistent with cereulide poisoning.Nestle and Danone report earnings this weekNestle's infant formula makes up about 5% of revenue, and the company has disclosed that recalled products represent only about 0.5% of revenue. \"The larger 5% number is probably more relevant given the likely consumer confusion and brand equity risk,\" said Bernstein analyst Callum Elliott in January. \"For Danone, infant formula is more important, comprising around 21% of group revenues by our estimates, and more than this in terms of profitability.\"Nestle and Danone are both slated to report earnings later this week, where investors hope to get a better picture of the financial impact of the recalls.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNestle and Danone stocks have trailed the European benchmark index year-to-date amid recalls of the companies' baby formula products.As investors worry about the financial fallout and potential reputational damage, Nestle shares are up 1.7% year-to-date, while Danone stock has shed 5.5%. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index is up 4.6% over the same period.Nestle and Danone stocks slumped at the end of January, at the height of the recall announcements, but have since recovered some of their losses.- CNBC's Charlotte Reed contributed to this report",

    "body": "Andrew Paterson | Photographer's Choice RF | Getty ImagesCryptocurrency payments to suspected human trafficking syndicates surged 85% in 2025, with hundreds of millions of transactions traced on public blockchains, according to a new report by Chainalysis.The U.S.-based blockchain analytics firm said most of the activity was linked to an expanding criminal ecosystem in Southeast Asia, where scam compounds, illegal online gambling operations and Chinese-language money laundering networks operate in unison. Chainalysis said in its report that crypto activity by human traffickers largely fell into three categories: International escort and prostitution services; labor placement agents and scam compounds; and child sexual abuse material (CSAM) vendors. While data on the blockchain shows most services were concentrated in Southeast Asia, customers sent payments from across North and South America, Europe and Australia, highlighting the global reach of the operations.The report also found that cybercriminals are increasingly relying on messaging platforms such as Telegram to advertise their services, recruit victims, and coordinate payments. \"There's a broader migration from older darknet forums into messaging apps and semi‑open Telegram ecosystems, which, combined with crypto, let these networks scale faster, run 'customer services,' and move money globally with much less friction,\" Chainalysis intelligence analyst Tom McLouth told CNBC. However, Chainalysis adds that the transparency of public blockchains also provides \"unprecedented visibility\" into criminal financial flows, which watchdogs and authorities rely on to disrupt activities. \"The key takeaway is that the true financial scale is large, at least hundreds of millions of USD worth of crypto transactions, and the physical harm is orders of magnitude greater than any dollar figure,\" said McLouth. Escort and prostitution networks Blockchain activity suggests that highly organized networks were behind many transactions. While some escort services and sex work operate legally, the report said potential trafficking operations can be identified through distinct financial behaviors.In particular, suspected networks are increasingly relying on stablecoins and Chinese‑language money laundering groups to cash out quickly, McLouth said. These laundering networks operate primarily through Chinese-language Telegram channels, which can help cybercriminals \"clean\" illicit funds by moving them through cryptocurrency. Chainalysis estimates that those services funneled at least $16.1 billion in illicit funds in 2025. Data showed that crypto-linked international escort services also accounted for a significant share of higher-value transfers tracked by Chainalysis, with nearly half of transactions exceeding $10,000.Listings reviewed by researchers advertised cross-border travel packages, multi-day \"companionship\" services and tiered pricing structures, with VIP packages priced above $30,000. Chainalysis said the size and consistency of these transfers, along with repeated payment patterns between wallet clusters, suggest professionalized operations rather than isolated individuals.Crypto payments to suspected prostitution networks showed a distinct cluster of smaller transactions than those of escort services, mostly between $1,000 and $10,000. Still, Chainalysis said this data suggested operations consistent with agency-level activity.Labor recruiters and scam compoundsAnother major category involved so-called \"labor placement agents\" who recruit individuals into scam compounds, usually in Southeast Asia, known for carrying out crypto-based schemes. Recruitment fees typically range from $1,000 to $10,000 in cryptocurrency, matching the prices advertised on Telegram channels, the report said.Examples cited in the report include posts seeking \"customer service\" or \"data entry\" workers for jobs in Cambodia or Myanmar, promising high monthly salaries and covering travel costs. Once recruited, victims were allegedly forced to conduct romance scams, fake cryptocurrency investment schemes and other online frauds targeting victims abroad.In some Telegram conversations analyzed by Chainalysis, recruiters discussed transporting workers across borders, arranging forged documents and coordinating payments to intermediaries. The firm also identified links between recruitment channels and wallets previously associated with illegal gambling platforms and money laundering services, suggesting that the trafficking activity was linked to broader criminal enterprises.The scale of these compounds was highlighted last year when the U.S. Department of Justice announced the seizure of bitcoin worth about $15 billion at the time from a massive Cambodian scam center that was running romance scams.\"Since late 2025 we've seen more enforcement around parts of this ecosystem, especially scam compounds, but the underlying sexual exploitation and trafficking networks can often keep operating via alternative infrastructure, both physical and digital,\" said McLouth.CSAM vendorsChainalysis also tracked networks involved in child sexual abuse material (CSAM), which operated under different crypto payment structures but also reflected growing levels of organization and \"sophisticated financial and distribution strategies.\"While about half of CSAM-related crypto transactions were below $100, that price point reflected individual payments within subscription-based models in private chat groups and encrypted file-sharing channels, the report said.The blockchain tracker also observed these funds moving from mainstream cryptocurrencies into privacy-focused assets such as Monero, as well as instant exchange services that require no identity verification.The report also documented overlaps between CSAM subscription services and \"sadistic online extremism\" communities.\"These [sadistic online extremism] groups specifically target and manipulate minors through sophisticated sextortion schemes, with the resulting content being monetized through cryptocurrency payments, perpetuating cycles of abuse,\" the report said.In July 2025, Chainalysis said it helped identify one of the largest CSAM websites operating on the dark web following a UK law enforcement lead. That single operation utilized over 5,800 cryptocurrency addresses and generated more than $530,000 in revenue since July 2022. \"In general, as crypto adoption grows, its use for both illicit and legitimate purposes will increase,\" said McLouth. \"In the near term, I don't expect crypto use in trafficking‑linked activity to go away, if anything, I expect it to keep growing even as enforcement gets better.\"",

    "body": "Qwen3 is Alibaba's latest large language model, which it says combines traditional LLM capabilities with \"advanced, dynamic reasoning.\"Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesAlibaba Group has released its newest AI model series, featuring enhanced capabilities, as it faces intensifying competition in China's AI space with several models launched in the past week. The Qwen3.5 AI model comes in an open-weight version, which allows users to download, run, fine-tune, and deploy it on their own infrastructure. Alibaba also released a \"hosted version,\" meaning the model can run on Alibaba's own servers.  Both models were made available on Monday, the eve of the Chinese New Year, and come just a week after Alibaba released a new AI model designed for robots. The company highlighted that Qwen3.5 offers improvements in performance and cost and was built with \"native multimodal capabilities,\" enabling the models to understand text, images and video simultaneously within one system.Leaning into a major AI trend this year, the model also supports new coding and agentic capabilities and is compatible with open-source AI agents like those from OpenClaw, which recently surged in popularity. AI agents are systems that can independently take actions and complete multi-step tasks on a user's behalf with minimal supervision. These agents and their abilities have garnered a lot of attention in recent weeks, after American AI company Anthropic released new agent tools. The potential for these agents to replace the work of software as a service companies, amongst others, has rocked markets. Alibaba's local competitors such as ByteDance and Zhipu AI also released upgraded models in the past week aimed at supporting more agent capabilities.Marc Einstein, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that artificial intelligence companies are preparing for the possibility that AI agents could \"upend traditional Internet business models.\"\"If this happens the consequences for those who are not prepared will be severe and [Chinese AI companies] are aware of this,\" he said. Alibaba said that its new Qwen3.5 open-weight model comes with 397 billion parameters — variables that shape how an AI system learns and reasons. While less than its previous flagship model, the company said the latest model showed significant improvement based on self-reported benchmark evaluations.Alibaba provided benchmark tests showing that Qwen3.5's performance was on par with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind, though the comparisons were self-reported. Meanwhile, it also released a \"hosted model\" called the Qwen-3.5-Plus through its cloud platform Model Studio. Alibaba said this version also demonstrated performance on par with leading competitors. CNBC could not independently verify those claims.The new Qwen3.5 models also support 201 languages and dialects, up from the previous generation's 82. Counterpoint's Einstein said this feature reflects Alibaba's global ambitions.The company is expected to release more open-weight models during this Chinese New Year, Lin Junyang, technical lead of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team said in a social media post.Following the release of Anthropic's latest Claude AI agent tools, other American AI giants have been accelerating the development of agentic capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Sunday that the creator of the OpenClaw would be joining the company. Last month, Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models were just \"months\" behind Western rivals.",

    "body": "ByteDance's new AI video model Seedance 2.0 is displayed on a smartphone screen. Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant ByteDance has said it will strengthen safeguards on a new artificial intelligence video-making tool, following complaints of copyright theft from entertainment giants. The tool, Seedance 2.0, enables users to create realistic videos based on text prompts. However, viral videos shared online appear to show copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, raising intellectual property concerns in the U.S. \"ByteDance respects intellectual property rights and we have heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with CNBC. \"We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorized use of intellectual property and likeness by users,\" the spokesperson added. ByteDance's response comes after receiving backlash and stern warnings from Hollywood groups like the Motion Picture Association (MPA), a trade association representing major Hollywood studios including Netflix, Paramount Skydance, Sony, Universal, Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney. The group issued a forceful public statement at the end of last week demanding that ByteDance immediately cease what it called \"infringing activity.\" \"In a single day, the Chinese AI service Seedance 2.0 has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale,\" said MPA chairman and CEO Charles Rivkin in the statement. \"By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs.\"According to a report from Axios, Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter Friday to ByteDance, accusing the company of distributing and reproducing its intellectual property through the new AI tool without permission. The legal notice alleged that ByteDance had effectively pre-packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art,\" the report added. Disney has also sent cease-and-desist letters to AI companies in the past. In September, the company warned the AI startup Character.AI to stop the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters.While trying to protect its intellectual property, Disney has signed a licensing deal with and invested in OpenAI. The agreement allows the AI company to use Disney characters from the Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator.Paramount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, making similar accusations, Variety reported over the weekend.",

Discovery's board is considering reopening sales talks with Paramount Skydance after recently receiving an amended offer with sweetened deal terms, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.Warner Bros. in December agreed to sell both its film studio and HBO Max streaming service to Netflix for $27.75 per share. Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV, in December launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros., promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Last week, Paramount upped the ante, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share to its offer for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal. The ticking fee would be approximately $650 million in cash value per quarter for every quarter the deal has not closed by Dec. 31, 2026, CNBC.com previously reported.Paramount also said it will cover a $2.8 billion termination fee paid to Netflix if the Warner Bros. deal is terminated. Paramount also said it will eliminate $1.5 billion in possible debt refinancing costs. Both Paramount and Netflix have said they would be willing to raise their bids to secure the Warner Bros. deal, Bloomberg reported. However, this is the first time Warner Bros. has considered whether Paramount's offer could either result in a better deal or prompt Netflix to offer better deal terms, according to the report.Read the complete Bloomberg report here.WATCH: Chadwick: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramountwatch now",

Among the key attendees are OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Anthropic boss Dario Amodei and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are also slated to be there. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who was earlier expected to attend, reportedly withdrew on Saturday due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will roll out of the red carpet which tech CEOs will happily walk down as the country presents a lucrative market of young, tech-forward consumers and a huge pool of talent which could be key to continued development of AI. \"The summit ... is a huge validation of the potential of the market. Everyone's coming in because they realize that this is the place to be in and India just cannot be ignored,\" Lalit Ahuja, CEO of ANSR, a company that helps businesses run offshore teams in India.The AI Impact Summit also comes amid a reset in relations between India and the U.S. as the two nations push toward a trade deal. India strives to be a major tech hubModi's government has made its intentions clear in the last few years — it wants India to be one of the world's tech superpowers. India has approved $18 billion worth of semiconductor projects as it looks to build a domestic supply chain. The government has pushed major companies, including Apple, to manufacture more of its goods in India.Venture capital investors are betting on India's startups while the country's stock exchanges are seeing a surge in initial public offerings. Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research said government support for tech \"is a red carpet for multinational companies to set up, expand and diversify their global operations.\"And with the door open, major firms are likely to announce big investments this week in India, while New Delhi will talk up the opportunities in the country. AI focusAI, unsurprisingly, is going to be a big focus from three angles: infrastructure, users and talent.There is likely to be big infrastructure investment deals announced around AI data centers as demand continues to rise and tech companies thirst for more computing power. In December, Amazon, Microsoft and Intel made commitments to building AI infrastructure and chips in India. India is one of OpenAI's top markets for ChatGPT and alongside rivals like Perplexity are offering their products for free in a race to gain users and potentially lucrative data for further training. There is no major domestic rival to these U.S. chatbots, providing a good opportunity to gain users with a tech-savvy user base. And access to talent is also attractive. India is an \"AI talent factory,\" Sham Arora, chief technology officer at Tech Mahindra, told CNBC's \"Inside India\" last week. watch nowThere is an increasing number of so-called Global Capability Centers (GCCs) that are being created in India. These are effectively offshore hubs which are set up on behalf of international companies. More than 60% of GCCs established in the last 2 years are focused on AI, data, digital engineering, or product development, according to ANSR, which helps companies set up GCCs. More than 80% of GCCs expected to be set up in the next six-to-eight months are projected to be AI-led, ANSR said.But not only are tech giants looking to India for engineering talent, an increasing number of firms are also banking on the country for senior leadership roles. ANSR's Ahuja said the role of \"chief AI officer\" is becoming more common.\"And the fact that there's talent available ... those positions are now being created in India,\" Ahuja said. ",

    "body": "The Good Brigade | GettyParents who took out student loans for their child's education could be excluded from affordable repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs in the coming months if they don't take certain steps soon, consumer advocates warn. \"I'm hearing a lot of anxiety from parents about losing access to income-driven repayment plans,\" said Kathleen Boyd, a certified financial planner and founder of Student Loan Savvy in San Diego. The Parent PLUS federal loan program allows parents to borrow on behalf of dependent undergraduate students. Due to the passage of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, Parent PLUS borrowers will no longer qualify for IDR plans starting in July. IDR plans cap eligible borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income and culminate in student loan forgiveness.\"Our concern is that thousands of Parent PLUS borrowers who would otherwise be eligible for IDR plans and forgiveness post-July 2026 will not take the required action and be stuck with paying loans back in a plan they cannot afford,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

The typical parent balance is around $32,000. Here's what parent borrowers need to know about preserving their relief options. How parent repayment options are changingStarting July 1, Parent PLUS borrowers will have only one option to repay their debt: the new Standard Repayment Plan. Under Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the Standard Plan will spread a borrower's debt into fixed payments over one of four time frames, depending on what they owe. In its current form, the plan comes with a 10-year term for all borrowers.Under the revised plan, only borrowers with balances up to $24,999 will retain a 10-year repayment term. Those who owe between $25,000 and $49,999 will repay over 15 years; balances ranging from $50,000 to $99,999 will be repaid over 20 years; and debts of $100,000 or more will have a 25-year repayment term. Due to longer repayment timelines, borrowers stand to pay significantly more in interest under the new program. Often, parents risk jeopardizing their own financial futures by borrowing for their children's education, Boyd said. Having only a single repayment option could worsen the problem. \"A Standard amortizing payment can be very hard to absorb, especially if they're nearing retirement,\" she said. Consolidate before April to ensure IDR accessMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesIf borrowers consolidate their Parent PLUS loans into a so-called Direct Consolidation Loan now, they can maintain access to IDR options, Nierman said.  The consolidation process, which involves packaging your federal loans into a new one, usually takes between four and six weeks, so Nierman recommends borrowers submit their request at Studentaid.gov no later than March 31. If you've already consolidated your Parent PLUS loans, you now have a Direct Consolidation Loan and therefore more repayment flexibility, \"so you are generally not in a group with any deadline pressure,\" Boyd said. During the consolidation application process, parents must select the Income-Contingent Repayment plan and make at least one payment under that program, she added. After that, you should be able to move into the Income-Based Repayment plan, which will likely result in the lowest monthly payment, Nierman said. This is the process the Department of Education requires from its interpretation of the new law.If you're in default on a Parent PLUS loan, requesting a consolidation should bring you back into a current status and preserve your IDR plan and loan forgiveness options, she said. Current parent borrowers should plan ahead Parent borrowers with a student currently in college will need to think ahead. If you take out any new Parent PLUS loans on or after July 1, 2026, you forfeit IDR access and must repay your student debt in the new Standard program. Consolidating will not help you after that date. Parent PLUS borrowers will also face a new annual loan limit of $20,000 starting in July, with a $65,000 lifetime cap. Currently, parents can borrow up to the cost of attendance for their children, minus any other aid, and there is no aggregate limit.",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesAn annual cigar festival in Cuba's capital city of Havana, which had been due to take place over five days in late February, has been suspended until further notice due to a worsening economic crisis.The postponement comes as the island nation's communist-run government endures its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Habanos S.A., the cigar fair's organizer, said on Saturday that it had suspended the festival \"with the aim of preserving the highest standards of quality, excellence and experience that characterize this international event.\" The organizing committee said it was working on setting a new date for the fair, without providing further details. The festival has previously welcomed more than 1,000 guests from around 80 countries, with attendees participating in auctions and touring tobacco plantations. Premium Cuban cigars are globally renowned and considered of high economic importance, serving as one of the island's main exports and a major source of foreign currency. They are illegal in the U.S., however, due to a decades-old trade embargo. Last year, Habanos. S.A., a state-run entity that holds a monopoly on global sales of Cuban cigars, reported record sales of $827 million in 2024, reflecting a 16% increase compared to the year prior. A man stares at black smoke billowing from a fire at the Nico Lopes oil refinery in Havana on February 13, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba is currently grappling with a severe fuel shortage amid a U.S. oil blockade.The Trump administration has effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil since launching a military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Jan. 3.U.S. President Donald Trump has since called its government \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil. Cuba's government, which has condemned U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors. Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" earlier in the month. \"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.",

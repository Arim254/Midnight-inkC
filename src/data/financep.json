    "body": "Signage at the Google Midlothian Data Center in Midlothian, Texas, US, on Friday, Nov. 14, 2025.Jonathan Johnson | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAlphabet's Google will build its first data center in Minnesota and deploy a significant amount of new renewable energy in the state under an agreement with utility Xcel, the companies announced Tuesday. The data center will be located on a 480-acre site at Pine Island, a town of about 4,000 people some 70 miles southeast of Minneapolis. Google had not publicly disclosed its role in the project previously. The facility will be used for artificial intelligence applications as well as Google's broader cloud business. The proposed data center at Pine Island has faced community opposition but is supported by the city council. It has not begun construction yet. Data centers are facing political blowback in communities across the U.S. more often as people blame them for rising electricity prices in some regions and worry about their environmental impact. Data centers also consume a significant amount of water for cooling. Google declined to disclose how much electricity the data center will consume. The tech company said it will pay for any electric grid infrastructure needed for the project. The Minnesota Public Utility Commission still must review the agreement between Google and Xcel. \"What Google is doing is ensuring that when we show up, we aren't putting additional costs on other ratepayers,\" Amanda Peterson Corio, head of data center energy at Google, told CNBC in an interview. \"We will pay 100% of our energy and electricity costs, and we will make sure that new additional capacity is put on to the grid to be able to serve our needs.\"Additional transmission infrastructure is needed for the Pine Island data center, said Bria Shea, president of Xcel for Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Google will pay for any new transmission associated with the project even if the data center does not materialize for some reason, Corio said. Google will deploy 1,400 megawatts of wind power, 200 megawatts of solar, and 300 megawatts of battery storage to the grid under the agreement with Xcel. The renewable projects will be owned by the utility. They are expected to come online in 2028 and 2029, Shea said.Google will also pay a premium for the renewable power under a tariff designed to insulate consumers from the infrastructure costs while accelerating the deployment of clean energy in Minnesota, according to the tech company. The town's residents have formed a group called \"Stop the Pine Island Data Center.\" The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy filed a lawsuit in October challenging the environmental review of the project. Pine Island's city council approved two preliminary development plans for the data center in December, according to local broadcaster KTTC. It also approved financial incentives that include a $36 million tax abatement in February, according to the outlet. City Administrator Elizabeth Howard said Pine Island would collect more than $130 million in tax revenue from the project, according to KTTC.  Minnesota has not been a major data center market in the past but the big tech companies are increasingly eyeing the state. There are currently 74 data centers in Minnesota. Virginia, the largest market worldwide, has 570 such facilities, according to Data Center Map. ",

    "body": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts and ranking member of Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, speaks during a roundtable on housing affordability in Washington, Jan. 7, 2026.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoth congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump both want to limit how many homes major corporations can own, but a new proposal from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., makes it clear that's where the agreement ends. In a bill released hours before Trump's State of the Union speech, Warren, Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and 16 other Senate Democrats propose ending some housing-related tax benefits for major corporations. The bill would prevent companies with more than 50 single-family homes for rent from taking deductions for housing value depreciation and mortgage interest payments. Corporations would also be barred from getting federally backed mortgages. The bill would provide a temporary carve-out for companies building new multifamily housing or rehabilitating properties that would otherwise be uninhabitable. The Trump administration is pushing its own housing proposal. In a memo sent to lawmakers last week, the administration proposed banning institutional investors who own more than 100 single-family homes from buying any new ones. Trump's proposal also includes several exceptions for companies that increase the number of single-family homes.The dueling proposals come as legislation to boost housing supply and affordability is in the home stretch to becoming law. The House passed a bipartisan bill earlier this month with broad support, and the Senate advanced its own bipartisan bill last year. The two sides are working to combine the proposals into a final package. ",

    "body": "Uber to acquire SpotHero.Courtesy: Uber Technologies, Inc.Uber said it's acquiring SpotHero, a company that provides a parking reservation app for crowded downtowns, sporting events and concerts. Terms weren't disclosed, but Uber said on Monday that it plans to offer a \"parking reservation experience, powered by SpotHero\" within its own app to help users find parking for events, venues and airports. \"For the moments when people do choose to drive, SpotHero on the Uber app will make the experience easier than ever, and bring more people into the Uber ecosystem,\" Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement. Earlier this month, Uber reported better-than-expected revenue for the fourth-quarter but issued soft profit guidance for the current period, sending the stock down. The company's strongest revenue growth for the quarter was in its delivery business, which started with restaurants and now includes groceries and retail.Uber's expansion into new markets and geographies has turned into the dominant U.S. ride-hailing company. Its market cap currently sits at $146 billion, while Lyft is valued at just over $5 billion. Within food delivery, Uber faces stout competition from companies including DoorDash, which has a market cap of over $71 billion.SpotHero last announced outside funding in 2019, when it raised $50 million in a round led by Macquarie Capital. The Chicago-based company launched in 2011, and now says it offers parking at more than 13,000 garages, lots and valets in over 400 cities in the U.S. and Canada.\"Joining forces with Uber will allow us to bring that experience to millions more drivers and make parking a natural part of the Uber platform,\" SpotHero CEO Mark Lawrence said in a statement. Uber said the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of this year.

    "body": "The Anthropic logo displayed on the stage during the company's Builder Summit in Bengaluru, India, on Monday, Feb. 16, 2026. Photographer: Samyukta Lakshmi/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnthropic on Monday accused three Chinese AI enterprises of engaging in coordinated campaigns to extract information from its model, making it the latest American tech firm to level such claims after OpenAI issued similar complaints.According to a statement from Anthropic, DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax — the three firms in question — engaged in concerted \"distillation attack\" campaigns, flooding Claude with large volumes of specially-crafted prompts to train proprietary models.Through distillation, smaller AI models are able to mimic the performance of larger, pre-trained models by extracting knowledge from the better-trained model, a technique particularly useful for smaller teams with fewer resources.Despite Anthropic's service restrictions preventing commercial access to Claude in China, the three firms allegedly engaged commercial proxy services to sidestep Anthropic's restrictions, enabling access to networks running tens of thousands of Claude accounts simultaneously.\"Once access is secured, the labs generate large volumes of carefully crafted prompts designed to extract specific capabilities from the model,\" Anthropic said in the statement.Claude's responses to these prompts are farmed en masse either for direct training of the Chinese models, or to run a process known as reinforcement learning, a data-intensive process where AI models learn decision-making through trial and error, in the absence of human guidance.Anthropic estimated that the three Chinese firms were collectively able to generate over 16 million exchanges with Claude from around 24,000 fraudulently created accounts. Of the three enterprises, Anthropic found MiniMax to have driven the most traffic, with over 13 million exchanges.DeepSeek, Moonshot AI and MiniMax have yet to respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Not the first timeAnthropic joins a growing chorus of American companies expressing concerns over distillation from Chinese AI firms.Earlier this month, Sam Altman's OpenAI submitted an open letter to U.S. legislators, claiming to have observed activity \"indicative of ongoing attempts by DeepSeek to distill frontier models of OpenAI and other US frontier labs, including through new, obfuscated methods.\"The company has flagged evidence of distillation by Chinese firms since early last year, with the launch of China's first DeepSeek model, which users found strikingly similar to ChatGPT, the Financial Times reported in Jan. 2025, citing insiders from OpenAI.Distillation, however, is not an uncommon practice in the AI industry. Anthropic acknowledged in the Monday statement that AI firms \"routinely distill their own models to create smaller, cheaper versions.\" The company was, however, concerned with the competitive advantage rival firms stand to gain, as the practice can be used \"to acquire powerful capabilities from other labs in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost, that it would take to develop them independently.\"In their respective statements, Anthropic and OpenAI have framed distillation by these Chinese firms as national security threats. watch nowLike OpenAI, who described DeepSeek's practices as \"adversarial distillation,\" Anthropic expressed concern over the possibility of \"authoritarian governments deploy[ing] frontier AI for offensive cyber operations, disinformation campaigns, and mass surveillance.\"It remains unclear, however, how much these statements reflect genuine security concerns over a desire to preserve the competitive lead of America's AI corporations.Some online users were quick to point out the similarities between Anthropic's claims and its own use of distillation to train proprietary models.Anthropic has long framed \"compute leadership as a national security priority,\" consistently advocating for tighter export controls of advanced AI chips to China, according to Rui Ma from boutique consulting firm Tech Buzz China.\"Whether intentional or not, the narrative of illicit capability transfer strengthens the case for stricter chip restrictions,\" Ma added.On the same day of Anthropic's statement, Reuters reported that the U.S. had found evidence of DeepSeek training its AI model on Nvidia's flagship Blackwell chip, apparently flouting export controls, according to anonymous senior officials.Such reports add fodder to concerns from an administration that appears increasingly anxious over China's rapid advancements in the AI industry, especially as China's gains reportedly arise from the use of American-developed systems.Last Friday, the White House announced the establishment of the Peace Corps, an initiative within the Peace Corps established to promote American AI interests abroad, and to help partner nations adopt cutting-edge systems.",

Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor who accused President Trump of heinous crimes,\" said Garcia, who is the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\"Oversight Democrats will open a parallel investigation into this.\"Garcia also said that because of a prior subpoena issued by the Oversight Committee, as well as the Epstein Files Transparency Act, \"these records must immediately be shared with Congress and the American public.\"\"Covering up direct evidence of a potential assault by the President of the United States is the most serious possible crime in this White House cover up,\" he said.CNBC has requested comment on Garcia's statement from the DOJ and the White House.Trump is a former friend of Epstein. The two fell out in the early 2000s.The president has never been criminally charged in connection with a claim by an Epstein survivor.Trump last week said the Epstein files had \"totally exonerated\" him.Trump's comment came after he was asked by a reporter about the arrest of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former British prince, by police in the United Kingdom on suspicion of misconduct in public office. That arrest is believed to be related to an investigation into whether Mountbatten-Windsor, the younger brother of King Charles III, had shared confidential trade reports with Epstein.\"I'm the expert in a way because I've been totally exonerated. That's very nice. I can actually speak about it very nicely,\" Trump said of the arrest.\"I think it's a shame. I did nothing,\" the president said.",

    "body": "An aerial view of the Paramount logo on the water tower at Paramount Studios on Feb. 23, 2026 in Los Angeles, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWarner Bros. Discovery on Tuesday said it had received a higher takeover offer from Paramount Skydance and will review the new bid under the terms of its existing deal with Netflix. Last week, WBD announced it would re-engage Paramount in deal talks under a seven-day waiver from Netflix. WBD and Netflix have an agreement to sell the legacy media group's studio and streaming businesses to the streamer. Paramount is seeking to buy the entirety of WBD. \"Following engagement with PSKY during the seven-day limited waiver period, we received a revised PSKY proposal to acquire WBD, which we are reviewing in consultation with our financial and legal advisors,\" WBD said in a statement. \"We will update our shareholders following the Board's review. The Netflix merger agreement remains in effect, and the Board continues to recommend in favor of the Netflix transaction. WBD shareholders are advised not to take any action at this time with respect to the amended PSKY tender offer.\"Paramount in a statement confirmed it had submitted a revised bid and said it will continue with its previously announced tender offer while the WBD board reviews both deals. If WBD deems the new Paramount offer superior, Netflix will have four days to improve its previously agreed-upon bid. Netflix agreed to acquire WBD's studio and streaming assets for $27.75 per share in December, valuing the assets around $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Paramount subsequently launched a hostile tender offer to WBD shareholders for $30 per share for all of WBD, which includes linear cable networks such as CNN, TBS, HGTV and TNT and digital assets including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights.If WBD concludes Paramount's new offer is superior and Netflix doesn't alter its bid, Netflix will receive a $2.8 billion breakup fee. Paramount has agreed to fund that fee as part of a previously altered hostile bid.A combined Paramount-WBD would bring together HBO Max with Paramount+ along with merging two of the five largest movie studios by revenue — Warner Bros. and Paramount Skydance Studios. It would also put CNN and CBS News under one ownership structure.  Both the Netflix-WBD deal and a potential Paramount-WBD merger would need U.S. and European regulatory approval for completion, and both deals have raised antitrust concerns among critics. watch now",

    "body": "Michael Selig, President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission speaks during a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on Nov. 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesSix Democratic senators told the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a previously unreported letter that they have strong concerns about prediction market contracts \"that incentivize physical injury or death,\" saying the contracts \"present dangerous national security risks.\"The senators urged CFTC Chairman Michael Selig in the letter sent Monday to \"clearly reiterate that the CFTC will categorically prohibit any contract that resolves upon or closely correlates to an individual's death.\"The letter, led by Sen. Adam Schiff of California, notes that under federal commodity regulations, the CFTC already \"categorically prohibits\" contracts that involve or reference terrorism, assassination, war or similar actions. The letter was sent as prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi have become increasingly popular and as questions have been raised about how those markets should be regulated, whether they are contributing to a rise in gambling addiction, and about the risk of people with inside information taking positions on contracts.The letter notes that the CFTC \"has cleared the way\" for Polymarket to reenter the U.S. market after U.S. users being ostensibly blocked from accessing contracts on the company's offshore exchange.In addition to Schiff, the Democrats who signed the letter are Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, New Jersey's Cory Booker, Tim Kaine of Virginia, and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen.The CFTC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter, which cites three contracts offered by Polymarket in recent months relating to a NASA spaceship launch, the fate of Venezuela's authoritarian leader, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\"These recent events highlight the lack of internal controls and safeguards to prevent insiders from profiting off of non-public information, and direct profiteering off of human suffering,\" the letter said.The CFTC last week filed a legal brief in a federal appeals court asserting that the commission has exclusive jurisdiction over the U.S. commodity derivatives markets and that individual states had no role in exercising such oversight.\"The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency's exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by  seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products,\" Selig wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed about the filing.The senators' letter noted that one of Polymarket's contracts asked if Artemis II, the upcoming NASA crewed spaceflight mission, would explode.That contract, which Polymarket listed on Jan. 20, saw the bet \"Yes\" trading as high as 8% before it \"was subsequently renamed and ultimately withdrawn due to public backlash,\" the letter said.\"Not only did this contract directly correlate with crewmember death, it incentivized the failure of the mission and potential insider sabotage,\" the letter said.Polymarket in a Feb. 15 post on X about the controversy said, \"To clarify: this was a market about a potential booster-stage rupture — a defined hardware failure scenario — not about the Orion crew capsule or astronaut safety. This was not a market on crew injury or loss of life.\"Another contract on Polymarket was on the question of whether Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro would be removed from power. On Jan. 5, an unknown trader made $20,000 in bets that Maduro would be out by Jan. 31, and about two hours after those bets were placed, President Donald Trump ordered a military strike on Venezuela that led to Maduro's capture and removal to the United States for criminal prosecution.\"When Polymarket resolved the contract around twelve hours later, this trader had netted more than $400,000 in profits,\" the letter noted, citing reporting by The Wall Street Journal.A Polymarket advertisement in a subway station in New York, US, on Thursday, Feb. 5, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn the third example cited by the senators,  \"In November 2025, Polymarket resolved a contract that the Ukrainian town of Myrnohad would be captured by Russian forces by November 15, and individuals who bet YES profited by as much as 33,000 percent.\"\"Public reporting later found that a staffer at the Institute for the Study of War, a D.C. based think tank, had edited its map to show that Russia had taken control of a key intersection in the town, 'despite the lack of indications' that Russia had made any such advance,\" the senators wrote. \"This is a contract that unambiguously 'involves, relates to, or references' war and clearly displays the dangers of listing such contracts.\"The letter said the three contracts \"underscore the dangerous incentives directly or indirectly tied to offering contracts related to prohibited categories under the\" Commodity Exchange Act.The senators warned that government officials, regulated entities and consultants who may have knowledge about possible policy changes \"can easily act on confidential or operationally sensitive information to personally profit in markets that operate with minimal oversight or transparency, or share this information with contacts who can similarly profit.\"\"These contracts further risk incentivizing real-world harm by creating financial rewards linked to destabilizing events or physical injury, and by encouraging actors to influence or precipitate those outcomes for personal profit,\" the letter said.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesU.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla's sales in Europe were down for a 13th consecutive month in January, while its biggest Chinese rival saw another surge.Data published Tuesday by industry lobby group ACEA, or the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, found that Tesla's new car registrations fell to 8,075 in January, down 17% from a year ago, representing the 13th consecutive month in which sales have shrunk.Tesla's market share across the European Union, Britain, Switzerland, Norway and Iceland fell to 0.8%, meanwhile, down from 1% in the same month last year.It marks another \"very weak\" start of the new year for Elon Musk's company, Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, told CNBC by email.\"Tesla's image has deteriorated in Europe last year and people have much more choice now with the range of new affordable EVs (including those of BYD and others like MG and ZEEKR) entering the market, while Tesla lacks new models,\" he added.Tesla's focus on autonomous driving, rather than introducing new vehicles and expanding its range of mass models, is likely a factor too, Luman said.\"Another thing in Europe is that large numbers of first generations of Tesla's are remarketed at the moment (after being leased for 4-6 years), this has driven second hand prices down,\" Luman said, adding that there's an abundance of competitively priced Tesla's available on the used market. A Tesla car is being charged at a Tesla electrical vehicle charging station in Norheimsund, Norway, Aug. 22, 2025.Sergei Gapon | Afp | Getty ImagesTesla has been beset by challenges in Europe, including robust competition, particularly from Chinese car brands. It's also struggled to shake off reputational damage from Musk's rhetoric and close relationship with the Trump administration after the U.S. president returned to office last January.Musk spent nearly $300 million to help elect U.S. President Donald Trump to a second term and subsequently led a tumultuous initiative to slash federal agencies. Protests erupted at Tesla dealerships across Europe at the height of Musk's involvement with the White House.Musk's relationship with Trump later cooled, following a bitter online feud with the U.S. president. Shares of Tesla were 0.5% lower in premarket trading on Tuesday. The company is off by around 11% year-to-date.BYD continues its rapid growthChinese EV giant BYD continued its rapid growth in Europe at the start of 2026, per the ACEA data. New car registrations for the company rose by 165% year-on-year to 18,242 in January.  BYD also more than doubled its market share across the region, hitting 1.9% last month, up from 0.7% in January 2025. Tariffs have largely kept the company out of the U.S., including a 100% levy on Chinese EVs.watch nowMichael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, said one of the main problems for companies such as Tesla is that Chinese automakers like BYD have an insurmountable cost advantage. \"The big question now is 'will this trend continue?'. The answer, unfortunately for European automakers and Tesla, is yes,\" Field told CNBC by email.\"Even looking 5 years out, we don't believe the cost advantage will be completely breached because of China's structurally lower labour costs,\" he continued.\"There is some good news however, that European automakers and Tesla are learning. The cost gap in terms of battery and auto production is slowly closing, and these firms are introducing more models at lower price points, which should help reduce the hemorrhage in market share.\"Overall, sales in the European Union, Britain and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries, fell 3.5% to 961,382 cars in January.Petrol car registrations fell about 26% year-on-year in January, while battery-electric, plug-in hybrid and hybrid-electric cars were up nearly 14%, 32% and 6%, respectively.",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle exits a charging lot on Jan. 15, 2026 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesAlphabet-owned Waymo on Tuesday opened its robotaxi service to some public passengers in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando, the company announced. With the multi-city expansion, Waymo is now operating its service in 10 U.S. cities, extending its lead in the North American driverless ride-hailing market. The Google sister company is aiming to lock in loyal riders and win over skeptics, including six in 10 U.S. drivers who said they were fearful of driverless cars, according to a 2025 survey by the American Automobile Association. The expansion comes as rivals Tesla, Amazon-owned Zoox and startups Waabi and Nuro work to bring their own commercial robotaxi services online to U.S. markets. Robotaxi leaders in Asia including Apollo Go, which is owned by Baidu, and publicly-traded WeRide have been snapping up marketshare overseas.Waymo said \"select riders\" in the four cities who have downloaded the company's app will \"receive an invitation to take their first local rides.\" The company plans to invite more passengers on a rolling basis and make the service generally available in these markets by the end of 2026. Tuesday's expansion \"deepens our commitment in the states of Texas and Florida,\" Waymo said in its blog.In January, Waymo opened service to riders in Miami, and the company began serving Austin riders last year in partnership with Uber. Additionally, Waymo operates in the Atlanta, Phoenix, Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area markets. For the markets launched Tuesday, Waymo will use its fifth-generation driver system in its base model Jaguar I-PACE sedans. Earlier this month, the company began offering employees and their guests rides in Waymo's sixth-generation driver system, built on Geely's base model Ojai electric cars, in California. watch nowThe company in February also announced that it raised a $16 billion funding round that valued the company at $126 billion, with Alphabet serving as the \"majority investor.\" At the end of January, Waymo was operating just over 3,000 autonomous vehicles, according to filings with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The auto safety regulator has initiated investigations into the way the company's vehicles behave around schools and school buses. The company has also faced criticism for how its vehicles behaved during a December power outage in San Francisco in the middle of a storm. Waymo vehicles stopped in the middle of some roads and contributed to gridlock.In a letter to Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., this month, Waymo said it was already providing over 400,000 paid trips per week across the U.S. and had surpassed 20 million trips over the lifetime of its service.Markey has called on Waymo, and other AV developers, to be more transparent about the way their driverless vehicles rely on humans, namely \"remote assistants,\" to give their cars guidance from far-away customer service centers when the vehicles encounter difficult to navigate situations.-- CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed reporting",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, Copenhagen, Denmark, Feb. 4, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk on Tuesday said it plans to slash the monthly list prices of its popular obesity and diabetes drugs in the U.S. by up to 50% starting in 2027, in a bid to make the treatments more accessible to patients with insurance coverage. The obesity injection Wegovy, its new pill counterpart, the diabetes shot Ozempic and the oral diabetes drug Rybelsus will have a new lower list price of $675 per month starting on Jan. 1, 2027. The Wegovy medicines both currently have list prices of around $1,350 per month, while the diabetes drugs have list prices of around $1,027 per month. For the first time, Novo said its price cuts are targeting insured patients whose out-of-pocket costs are linked to list prices, such as people with high-deductible health plans or coinsurance benefit designs. \"Both of these patient populations should, beginning [in 2027], see a benefit with lower out-of-pocket burdens,\" Jamey Millar, the company's head of U.S. operations, told CNBC in an interview. He added that Novo expects improvements in access and uptake among patients in the commercial insurance market, though the company is not giving any specific expectations.The move could help Novo compete better with Eli Lilly, which now holds the majority share in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. Lilly's more effective drugs and earlier foray into the direct-to-consumer space have allowed it to take the lead in the space, but the company has yet to significantly lower the U.S. list prices of its medicines.watch nowIt's unclear exactly how much commercial insured patients typically pay out of pocket for Novo's drugs. Those patients may pay as little as $25 per month for Novo's drugs in \"only the best of circumstances,\" Millar said. But patients in high-deductible plans would have to pay out of pocket \"more or less the full list price of a drug until they reach that\" threshold and the insurance benefit kicks in, he added. Millar said some of those patients defer treatment entirely because they don't want to shoulder that expense. The number of patients using high-deductible plans has increased over the years due to the trade-off of lower premiums, he noted. Meanwhile, Millar said other people have 25% to 33% of their coinsurance linked to the list prices of those drugs.The Danish drugmaker has previously cut the direct-to-consumer prices of Wegovy and Ozempic, which primarily benefit cash-paying patients who often don't have insurance coverage for the drugs. Novo offers its drugs to cash-paying patients for $149 to $499 per month, depending on the specific product and dose. Novo and Lilly have escalated a GLP-1 pricing war over the last year, especially following the landmark \"most favored nation\" deals they struck with President Donald Trump in November.The move also coincides with new, lower Medicare prices going into effect for Novo's obesity and diabetes drugs in 2027 following negotiations with the federal government under the Inflation Reduction Act. The new negotiated prices for Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus will be $274 per month. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks during the Angel Families Remembrance Ceremony in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on February 23, 2026. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump's new blanket tariffs came into force on Tuesday — but investors appear to be shrugging the changes off, with one analyst telling CNBC they were \"bigger issues.\"Trump announced over the weekend that a new, blanket 15% global levy on imports to the U.S. The president initially announced plans to impose a 10% duty on global imports, before saying that the rate would rise \"to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level.\"The announcement came after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Trump's country-specific tariffs — a source of major market volatility when they were first unveiled by the White House last April.Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act empowers the president to implement tariffs of up to 15% for up to 150 days. Trump said in a Truth Social post that any country that wants to \"play games\" with the Supreme Court decision \"will be met with a much higher tariff.\"Read more Despite Trump saying there would 15% tariffs, the new levies came into effect at 10% on Tuesday. A customs notice from U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the temporary Section 122 duties meant \"an additional 10% ad valorem duty on imported articles of every country for a period of 150 days, unless specifically exempt.\"In Europe, equity markets were muted, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 rising above the flatline after initially notching losses at the open. Stocks reacted negatively on Monday to Trump's fresh tariff talk over the weekend, but the moves were a far cry from the continent's deep sell-off after Trump's first \"liberation day\" tariff announcements in April.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStoxx 600\"I think people are now used to his little explosions,\" Paul Skinner, investment director in the London office of Wellington Management, told CNBC on a call, saying the market reaction was an example of the \"TACO\" or \"Trump Always Chickens Out\" trade.The phrase refers to the president's history of threatening levies, only to ease, delay or cancel them. After Trump backed down on his \"liberation day announcements, markets were more muted in response to later U.S. trade policy announcements.Wellington has long held the view that U.S. tariffs will drift lower over time — and Skinner said on Tuesday that this view had not changed in light of the latest announcements. The global asset manager sees the general tariff rate falling to around 9% by year's end. \"I don't think there's anything really market moving in what's happened … there's no surprises,\" he said.  Skinner added that tensions over Iran were capturing more attention than \"the path of tariffs, which I think is heading very much the way people were assuming.\"Stocks in the Asia-Pacific region also lacked direction on Tuesday as investors digested tariffs. U.S. stocks were slightly up shortly after Tuesday's opening bell.Toni Meadows, head of investment at U.K.-based BRI Wealth Management, said the Trump administration was \"temporary.\" He said the president's new tariffs \"yield more tariff revenue to the U.S., but that is ultimately a tax on the U.S. consumer that chips away at growth and increases inflation — but not enough to change a view.\"\"There are regional winners and losers if the regime sticks but let's not forget that there is a limited time horizon of a few months on this legislation, so the picture is likely to change. For now, countries like the U.K. lose out and China benefits but it is not an investable move,\" he added.Meadows also told CNBC that investors have \"bigger issues to grapple with,\" such as AI. \"The move to a global tariff regime does nothing to end the uncertainty of U.S. trade policy, so the market will largely ignore it for now and the total sums are not a game changer,\" he added. \"For now, some might try to 'day trade' Trump's policy changes, but not long term investors.\"watch nowPaul Surguy, managing director and head of investment management and proposition at Kingswood Group, told CNBC the wealth management firm was keeping a holding pattern on tariff news. \"There is simply no clarity on which one can make an informed decision,\" he said. \"In terms of tariff politics, history would suggest that where we are today is not where we might be tomorrow.\"Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at Dutch bank ING, said that although tariffs came into force at the 10% rate, Trump's avowed rise to 15% was thought to be imminent. He said the temporary Section 122 tariffs had come in at 10% because \"probably someone must have told Trump\" shortly afterwards that the law actually allowed a tariff of up to 15%, \"which is why he mentioned it on Saturday. But the services hadn't prepared any official executive order.\"\"Rumor has it that the folks at the White House are now working on a new order for the 15%. Consequently, we are now at 10%, but 15% should be coming shortly,\" Brzeski added.Brzeski argued that the rate itself was no longer what mattered to investors, as it did in April. \"It is currently not so much the absolute level of tariffs [that counts] but rather the new uncertainty, both regarding what's next from Trump but also regarding whether the larger trading partners, particularly the EU, will try to renegotiate the bilateral deals from last year,\" he said.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump looks on, during a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (not pictured), after an announcement of a trade deal between the U.S. and EU, in Turnberry, Scotland, Britain, July 27, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe U.S. has breached the terms of its trade deal with the European Union and the bloc is ready to retaliate if necessary, a top EU trade lawmaker told CNBC.\"We wanted to have really stability and predictability. And unfortunately, the government, the president of the United States, has really made a breach of this deal several times,\" Bernd Lange, chair of the European Parliament's international trade committee, told CNBC on Tuesday.After the U.S. Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs, he responded with announcements of fresh levies, with a universal 10% levy on all imports. Trump said Saturday that the rate would be raised to 15%, although the timing of that remains unclear, and the levy came into effect at 10% early Tuesday.European officials expressed concern about the latest levy, signaling that it could pose a threat to the trade deal it signed with the U.S. last summer. The European Parliament announced Monday that it has paused work on ratifying the U.S.-EU trade deal while it sought clarity from the White House on whether the deal still stands. That agreement included a baseline 15% tariff on most EU goods entering the U.S. but included exemptions for specific sectors. Others, like steel and aluminum, face a higher 50% levy, as well as their \"derivative\" products.watch nowLange said the EU was ready to adhere to the commitments laid out in the 2025 trade deal but that the U.S. had already shifted its position on the agreement \"several times\" with tariff changes and hazards, including Trump's threat in January to impose higher levies on European countries supporting Denmark's sovereignty in Greenland.\"We are sticking to the deal. A deal is a deal, no doubt about. But on the U.S. side, there was a breaking [of the agreement] some weeks after the deal was concluded, 400 products — so-called derivatives — were lifted from 15 to 50% and this is really harming a lot of small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"\"Then we had this Greenland exercise, and now we have this 15 -plus tariff. So this is a clear breaking on the side of the United States and several times. And this is not certainty,\" he said.\"We need clarity, and this is also my clear request for the United States government — give us a certainty that for the next three years, we have no other irritations with new tariffs from the United States, and then we stick to the deal.\" 'Bazooka' at the ready?The U.S. has sent mixed messages over whether trade deals, such as those with the EU and U.K., remain valid under the new tariffs regime.At the weekend, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer appeared to suggest that the president's trade policy had not changed fundamentally, and that the deals still stand.European officials want urgent clarity on the matter, however, and French officials appeared to be pushing for the EU to consider using its Anti-Coercion Instrument, or ACI, as a retaliatory measure, if necessary.German Member of European Parliament, S&D group and Chair of the International Trade Committee Bernd Lange gives a press conference on EU-US trade negotiations at the European Parliament, in Strasbourg on July 9, 2025.      Jean-christophe Verhaegen | Afp | Getty ImagesThe ACI is seen as a nuclear option of economic counter-measures as it could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region.Several European countries, and particularly exporters like Germany and Italy, are generally opposed to using the trade \"bazooka\" and it has never been used before.Lange said the EU remained willing to use the ACI if necessary, but said he would not call it a \"bazooka.\"\"I would not call it bazooka ... It's a normal legislation for a specific case, if one country is using tariffs, trade policy, investment policy, as a coercive instrument, then we will use it [the ACI],\" Lange said. \"At the moment, I see the case is not given [to use it], but we have it on the table. If necessary, we will use it,\" he said.Read moreOn Monday, Trump warned of higher duties for countries that want to \"play games\" following the Supreme Court ruling.He has said that additional levies would be coming in the next few months. At the time of writing, a 10% tariff is in place.",

    "body": "watch nowHome Depot on Tuesday posted a roughly 4% quarterly sales decline, as a sluggish real estate market and selective spending by homeowners continued to weigh on home improvement demand.The company also stuck by the current fiscal year forecast that it shared in December at an investor day. It said it expects full-year total sales growth to range between about 2.5% and 4.5% and adjusted earnings per share to be between roughly flat and up 4% from $14.69 in the prior fiscal year. It expects full-year comparable sales growth, which takes out one-time factors like store openings and closures, to range from flat to up 2%.Despite the fiscal fourth-quarter sales decline, Home Depot topped Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations for that period.In an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said U.S. consumers and the company have \"been in a frozen housing environment for three years\" – and there hasn't been a meaningful thaw. \"What we've seen as an added pressure during the last year has been this increase in consumer uncertainty, a gradual decline in consumer confidence,\" he said. \"And so those are signs we're watching.\"He said customers have told the company that they are concerned about housing affordability and job losses, dynamics that colored Home Depot's outlook for the year.Here's what Home Depot reported for the fiscal fourth quarter of 2025 compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.72 adjusted vs. $2.54 expectedRevenue: $38.20 billion vs.  $38.12 billion expectedShares rose more than 3% on Tuesday, as Home Depot beat earnings expectations after missing estimates three quarters in a row. Higher interest rates, lower housing turnover and economic uncertainty have challenged the company, as homeowners delay the pricier projects typically spurred by buying or selling a home. In the three-month period that ended Feb. 1, Home Depot's net income fell to $2.57 billion, or $2.58 per share, from $3.0 billion, or $3.02 per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue dropped from $39.70 billion in the year-ago period. The company said some decline was due to the most recent fiscal year 2025 having one fewer week. The additional week in the 2024 fiscal year contributed $2.5 billion in sales. As the Atlanta-based retailer waits for business to pick up, it laid off 800 employees and announced a five-day a week return-to-office policy in late January.Yet some investors anticipate an inflection point could be coming for Home Depot, as mortgage rates moderate slightly. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to 5.99% on Monday, matching its lowest level since 2022, according to Mortgage News Daily. Home Depot's biggest selling season, springtime, is also ahead.McPhail said Home Depot's business was relatively stable throughout the year, including in the fourth quarter, when adjusting for storms. He said the company is gaining market share, even as the sector lags.Comparable sales, an industry metric also called same-store sales, increased 0.4% in the fiscal fourth quarter across the business and 0.3% in the U.S. Store transactions in the quarter across Home Depot's website and stores dropped by 1.6% year over year, but average ticket rose 2.4% year over year. Pricing and tariff trendsThe growth in average ticket \"primarily reflects some price increases,\" Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising, said on the company's earnings call. McPhail told CNBC that Home Depot has had \"modest\" price increases, though he declined to say which items and categories now cost customers more.Half of Home Depot's 16 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales from the year-ago period, Bastek said. Those included power, electrical, storage, indoor garden, hardware, plumbing, bath and kitchen.Big-ticket purchases, which the company defines as those over $1,000, were 1.3% higher than the year-ago period, due to customers trading up for new and innovative items and buying higher-priced products, Bastek said.Even with those pricier purchases, there are signs that some customers are value-conscious. Bastek said some customers are trading down to lower-priced countertops and appliances, though that behavior hasn't been widespread.As U.S. consumers put off selling and buying homes, CEO Ted Decker said \"there's maybe a bit more repair than replace.\"\"We're certainly bouncing along what we hope would be a bottom in things like [housing] turnover,\" he said.Higher tariffs have been one of the forces driving price hikes at retailers, including Home Depot. Companies now face a new landscape for import duties after the Supreme Court on Friday ruled that some of the Trump administration's tariffs were illegal. Soon after the ruling, President Donald Trump said at a press conference that he would pursue alternative tariffs and proposed an across the board global tariff that he has since set at 15%. He said Home Depot is \"still in the middle of our analysis\" after the Supreme Court ruling and latest proposed tariffs.\"Not all the information is out right now. Not all the language is final around what was announced,\" he said. He added that Home Depot is \"as well positioned as anyone to understand any impacts and manage through them.\" More than half of what Home Depot sells comes from the U.S., according to the company. It's diversifying its imports, so that no single country outside of the U.S. represents more than 10% of the company's purchases, McPhail said.Though do-it-yourself buyers have cut back, the company still has a more stable business segment.A growing business from home professionals, such as contractors and roofers, has boosted Home Depot's overall business. It acquired SRS Distribution, a company that sells supplies to roofing, landscaping and pool professionals, for $18.25 billion last year in 2024 and bought GMS, a specialty building products distributor, for about $4.3 billion last year. Pro business is strong, but still pressuredPro sales were stronger than do-it-yourself sales during the fourth quarter, McPhail told CNBC, though he declined to share specific figures. Even the pro side of the business has been pressured. McPhail said on the company's earnings call that SRS's sales declined by a low single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared to the year-ago period.Yet he added the company — which sells supplies to roofers and other pros — fared better than others. He referred to market research data for the industry, which showed that total shipments of shingles fell 28% year over year to the lowest industry volume since 2019. For the full fiscal year, SRS' organic sales grew by a low single-digit percentage, despite slower demand in the home improvement industry and a lack of storms, Decker said. He said Home Depot expects the company's organic sales to grow by a mid-single digit percentage in fiscal 2026.Home Depot opened 12 stores in fiscal 2025 and plans to open 15 additional stores this fiscal year.The company also announced on Tuesday that its board of directors increased its quarterly dividend by 1.3%, or 3 cents, to $2.33 per share. It will be payable next month.As of Monday's close, Home Depot shares are down about 2% over the past year, but up about 10% year to date. That compares to the S&P 500's nearly 14% gains over the past year and its roughly flat performance year to date.",

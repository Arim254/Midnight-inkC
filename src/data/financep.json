    "body": "If you've been thinking about making certain energy-efficient improvements to your home, now may be a good time to act. That's because President Donald Trump's so-called \"big beautiful\" budget bill, which Congress passed in July, accelerates the expiration date for two credits aimed at helping Americans pay for energy-efficient home upgrades. Both the residential clean energy and energy efficient home improvement tax credits expire Dec. 31, meaning you have just about two weeks to take advantage. The residential clean energy credit generally allows you to claim 30% of the cost of new, qualified clean energy property for your home, whether you own it or rent it — as long as you reside there. Per the IRS, these include: Solar electric panels Solar water heaters Wind turbines Geothermal heat pumps Fuel cells Battery storage technologyIf you make energy-efficient home upgrades before the end of the year, you could also qualify for the energy efficient home improvement credit, which is worth up to $3,200. That includes up to $2,000 for qualified heat pumps, water heaters, biomass stoves or biomass boilers and $1,200 for other energy-efficient property costs, including doors, windows, skylights and home energy audits — with limits per item. Talk with a tax pro before renovatingBefore you start dialing contractors, it may make sense to speak with a tax pro. The language around these credits' expiration is specific. The residential clean energy credit, per the bill's language, expires with respect to \"expenditures made after December 31.\" The energy efficient home improvement credit, meanwhile, expires for any product \"placed in service\" after year-end. For all intents and purposes, this language means the same thing for taxpayers. Any improvements or installations you plan to make must be completed by year-end to qualify for the credit. That means your qualified heat pump, solar panels or energy-efficient doors and windows must be installed, working and paid for by midnight on Dec. 31. \"You have to be very, very careful,\" says Miklos Ringbauer, a certified public accountant and founder of MiklosCPA. \"This is where you have to do your homework as a taxpayer.\"A project you're considering might require a lengthy installation or permitting process, Ringbauer says. Even if you pay for it now, you could find yourself holding the bag tax-wise if the work isn't completed before the applicable tax credit expires, he says. \"With the energy credits, it is incredibly crucial that you have the ability to properly plan it out and [make sure] everything is set,\" Ringbauer says. \"Don't leave it down to the wire.\" Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Demonstrators holding flags of Ukraine and the European Union on the Boulevard du Temple in Paris, France on Feb. 23, 2025.Amaury Cornu | Afp | Getty ImagesEuropean Union countries will allocate 90 billion euros ($105.5 billion) in aid to Ukraine for 2026 and 2027, EU Council President Antonio Costa said on Friday. \"We have a deal,\" Costa wrote on social media platform X, confirming the package had been approved.EU governments had been debating whether to use 210 billion euros of frozen Russian assets, most of it held in Belgium, to support a so-called reparations loan for Ukraine.\"I am grateful to all leaders of the European Union for the European Council's decision,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on X, adding that it was important that \"Russian assets remain immobilized and that Ukraine has received a financial security guarantee for the coming years.\"On Wednesday, Zelenskyy had urged EU leaders and partners to increase support and decide on using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine, saying a sustained backing was vital to keep the country resilient and to deter Russia from pressing on with the war next year.Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever had said his country needed concrete guarantees before supporting the use of Russian assets to fund the loan to Kyiv, citing legal uncertainties and potential litigation risks, Reuters reported.EU leaders ultimately opted not to tap Russian assets to finance Ukraine's support package. Instead, the bloc agreed to raise money through joint borrowing backed by the EU budget. \"Ukraine will only repay this loan once Russia pays reparations,\" Costa said in a statement. \"The only way forward is a ceasefire and a negotiated peace. Our political and financial support to Ukraine will not falter.\"Under the Ukraine Facility and related programs, the EU has already delivered several tranches of financial assistance, including around 6 billion euros in bridge-financing, or short-term loans or advances provided to help Kyiv cover urgent budget needs. Ukraine has also received 18.1 billion euros in loans under a Group of Seven, or G7, led scheme this year. The agreement provides a  financial backstop for Ukraine, while underscoring Europe's push to shape U.S.-led peace negotiations to end Russia's conflict with Kyiv.Since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine in 2022, the European Union support to Kyiv has reportedly exceeded 187 billion euros.In late November, U.S. and Ukrainian officials met in Geneva to work on a refined peace framework aimed at narrowing disagreements over a U.S.-proposed plan to end the conflict. That plan, Reuters reported, included provisions on territory and security that reflected some Russian positions, including freezing current front-line control and recognizing changes to control over occupied areas, as well as measures affecting Ukraine's military and NATO aspirations, which Kyiv found difficult to accept.",

    "body": "watch nowNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Friday that \"technical factors\" likely distorted November's inflation data, pushing the headline reading lower than it otherwise would have been.\"There were some special factors or practical factors that really are related to the fact that they weren't able to collect data in October and not in the first half of November. And because of that, I think the data were distorted in some of the categories, and that pushed down the CPI reading, probably by a tenth or so,\" Williams said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"It's hard to know, we'll get some when we'll get to December data, I think we'll get a better reading of how much that distortion, how big the effect was, but I do think that that was pushed down a bit by these technical factors,\" he added.The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%.Williams said the data may have a downward bias because it was collected mainly in the second half of November, when sales were widespread, and noted there were also complications with rent and other categories. The New York Fed president said he took some comfort from categories not affected by those issues, seeing cooling price pressures in certain sectors.\"Some of the data that we're seeing is actually pretty encouraging in the sense of the CPI news. and I think it represents a continuation of the disinflationary process we've seen,\" Williams said.Because the October CPI release was canceled, Thursday's report lacked several of the standard data points typically included in a CPI report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it could not go back and collect October survey data, though it relied on \"nonsurvey data sources\" to construct the index. As a result, economists may be cautious about interpreting the report as clear evidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path, given the absence of an October comparison. Economists believe some some inputs to the owners' equivalent rent calculation for the canceled October month were estimated by the BLS to have zero inflation, distorting that calculation downward.",

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.Noem posted to X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Chief of Police Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.\"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery.

    "body": "UnitedHealthcare sign is displayed at its office building in Minnetonka, Minnesota, U.S., Dec. 11, 2025. Tim Evans | ReutersUnitedHealth Group on Friday released the first results from a sprawling independent audit of its business practices and committed to a wide range of steps to track and implement improvements in three specific areas. The health-care giant said it has adopted 23 ongoing \"action plans\" to put in place and monitor recommended improvements, with oversight by its internal audit and advisory services team. Around 65% of those actions will be complete by the end of 2025, while 100% of those plans will be finished by the end of March next year. The results come as private insurers try to rebuild trust with the American public after fierce, pent-up backlash over their practices and the broader U.S. health-care system. Critics say insurer business tactics have made it harder for some patients to access and pay for care. The company owns UnitedHealthcare, the nation's largest and most powerful insurer. While the announcement on Friday is a step toward improving the business, it's unclear how much it will change the public's view on the company and the broader industry.UnitedHealth in July announced that two independent consultancies had launched a third-party review of its business policies and performance metrics. That same day, UnitedHealth also confirmed that it is facing Department of Justice investigations over its Medicare billing practices. The independent audit marked one of Steve Hemsley's earliest steps as CEO after he took the reins in May, following the abrupt departure of Andrew Witty.\"We hope that you see these assessments as a commitment to setting a new standard of transparency for the health care marketplace, as we believe that you and every person who engages with our health system deserves to understand how we go about our work,\" Hemsley said in a letter Friday. \"We know that our actions and decisions have significant impacts on patients, care providers and the broader health system, and we are determined to hold ourselves to the highest standard,\" he added. FTI Consulting reviewed UnitedHealthcare's approaches to risk assessment operations within its Medicare Advantage programs, which refers to how the company rates the health status of members in those privately run plans. The firm also examined the company's care services management policies, procedures and processes. Consulting firm the Analysis Group also assessed the policies and processes of Optum Rx – the company's pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM  – for ensuring prescription discounts from drug manufacturers are \"accurately collected and distributed to clients.\" PBMs are middlemen who negotiate rebates with drug manufacturers on behalf of insurers, create lists of medications covered by insurance and reimburse pharmacies for prescriptions.Hemsley said the firms determined that the company's policies and practices are \"robust, rigorous and generally sound; and, in many respects, industry leading.\" But he noted that they also provided recommendations for improvements. For example, a review by the Analysis Group found that OptumRx has \"implemented a comprehensive and well-structured framework that governs all stages of manufacturer discount administration.\" More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe assessment identified at least 25 distinct \"controls\" in place that collectively lower the risk of miscalculating or delaying the distribution of discounts owed to clients and collecting incomplete discounts from drugmakers, said Aaron Yeater, managing principal at the Boston office of Analysis Group, in a document Friday. The review found \"no deficiencies or need for corrective measures\" but recommended ways to enhance Optum Rx's practices. That includes strengthening Optum Rx's escalation processes for resolving nonpayment and dispute cases through communication with manufacturers. Among UnitedHealth's action plans is to develop a formal policy that supports procedures for addressing those cases. Yeater noted that he examined the business processes and not the legal and regulatory issues the company is facing with its PBM. Meanwhile, FTI Consulting found that UnitedHealth scored better than its peers by several measures when it came to Medicaid and Medicare. But the firm pointed to slow decision-making on authorizations, documentation issues and the need to better address the findings raised in regulatory audits. Beyond these first results, UnitedHealth said it will share the findings from a review of medical records of diagnosis codes during the first quarter. The company will also report on its processes to craft what it calls \"evidence-based medical policy\" by the middle of the year. Shares of UnitedHealth Group are down more than 35% for the year after it suspended its 2025 forecast amid skyrocketing medical costs, announced the surprise exit of Witty and grappled with the probes into its Medicare Advantage business. It followed a difficult 2024 marked by a historic cyberattack and public blowback after the murder of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, Brian Thompson.Correction: UnitedHealth Group had a difficult 2024. An earlier version misstated the year. ",

    "body": "The House of Representatives on Thursday passed a bill aimed at making it easier to get federal permits to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence projects.The bill, known as the SPEED Act, is backed Big Tech giants such as OpenAI, Micron and Microsoft The bill cleared the House in a 221-196 vote, overcoming a conservative rebellion that nearly sank the legislation in a procedural vote earlier this week. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is likely to be part of a larger conversation around permitting reform. The SPEED Act's proponents argue it is critical to help the U.S. outpace China and other global competitors in the race for AI dominance. \"The electricity we will need to power AI computing for civilian and military use is a national imperative,\" said Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., the bill's sponsor and chair of the House Natural Resources Committee. The SPEED Act would reform the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which mandates federal reviews for projects that would impact the environment.It would tighten the timelines for NEPA reviews and shrink the statute of limitations for NEPA litigation to 150 days from the current six years. Permitting reform has drawn bipartisan support recently as clean energy projects supported by Democrats became ensnared in permitting delays.Pressure has built on Congress to act as AI has emerged as a key sector and power-hungry data centers have placed an increased strain on the electric grid. The Democratic cosponsor of the bill, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, said the SPEED Act would allow the U.S. to be \"nimble enough to build what we need, when we need it.\" Most Democrats opposed the SPEED Act, however, demanding that any permitting bill overturn President Donald Trump's moves to choke renewable energy sources like offshore wind. Democratic resistance was only compounded after GOP leadership inserted language to exempt Trump's efforts to block renewables from provisions in the SPEED Act that would limit the White House's ability to arbitrarily yank permits it does not like.The amendment was added after a standoff on the House floor during a procedural vote, where conservatives opposed to renewable energy demanded concessions for their votes.\"That provision codifies a broken permitting status quo,\" said Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., who supports permitting reform but opposed the SPEED Act.\"I look forward to working with my colleagues across the aisle in the Senate to craft a bipartisan product that can become law.\"",

Sales came in at an annualized rate of 4.13 million units.This count is based on closings, so it reflects contracts likely signed in September and October, when mortgage rates initially came down slightly but then stayed in a tight range.   Supply, which had been gaining for much of this year, fell in November. There were 1.43 million homes for sale at the end of the month, down 5.9% from October but up 7.5% year-over-year, according to the association. At the current sales pace, that represents a 4.2-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. \"Inventory growth is beginning to stall,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, said in a release. \"With distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Sellers who were on the market also began to delist their properties at a higher rate than usual. Sellers often take unsold homes off the market heading into winter, but that dynamic was much stronger this year. And that is keeping pressure on home prices. The median price of a home sold in November was $409,200, an increase of 1.2% from November 2024, and the highest November reading on record. The Realtors use a median measurement, which can skew to what end of the market is selling most. The high end is currently doing much better than the low end. Sales of homes priced in the $100,000 to $250,000 range were down nearly 8% from a year ago, while homes priced over $1 million were up 1.4%.\"Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand,\" Yun said.Homes are staying on the market longer, at 36 days compared with 32 days last November. First-time homebuyers made up 30% of sales, unchanged from a year ago, but historically they make up about 40%. Investors stepped back into the market, making up 18% of transactions, up from 13% in November 2024.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the unveiling of the Kennedy Center Honors nominees at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Aug. 13, 2025.Mandel Ngan | Afp | Getty ImagesThe John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, commonly known as the Kennedy Center, will be renamed the \"Trump-Kennedy Center,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.The prestigious Washington cultural center's board of trustees, who were appointed by President Donald Trump in February, \"have just voted unanimously\" on the name change, Leavitt said in an X post.They did so \"because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building,\" Leavitt said.\"Congratulations to President Donald J. Trump, and likewise, congratulations to President Kennedy, because this will be a truly great team long into the future! The building will no doubt attain new levels of success and grandeur,\" she said.The move may face challenges, however: U.S. code states that no new \"memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"To change that would require Congress, NBC News reported in July. House Republicans have already introduced at least one bill to rename the center in Trump's honor.\"The Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law,\" said former Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy III, a grandnephew of former President Kennedy, on X. \"It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says,\" he wrote.Leavitt's depiction of a center that has been saved \"not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation\" contrasts with reporting from multiple news outlets that ticket sales and staffing both have sharply declined this year.The New York Times reported last month that internal figures showed ticket sales during a typical week in October down by about 50% from the same period a year earlier.The Washington Post, which analyzed sales data from early September through Oct. 19, found an \"across-the-board drop-off\" in ticket sales for the center's three largest performance spaces.Weeks after taking office, Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and terminated a slew of existing board members, saying they \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"He signaled in October that the name change was forthcoming.In a Truth Social post, Trump shared pictures of a newly painted colonnade on the outside of the building below a caption praising \"the new TRUMP KENNEDY, whoops, I mean, KENNEDY CENTER, columns.\"He nevertheless said later Thursday that he was \"surprised\" by the board's decision.\"I was honored by it. You know, we're saving the building,\" he told reporters in the Oval Office.The center was not initially named after Kennedy.It was created in 1958, when President Dwight Eisenhower signed legislation to \"provide for a National Cultural Center\" in Washington.In 1962, Eisenhower's successor, Kennedy, and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy led a $30 million fundraising campaign to build the center.Kennedy was assassinated in November 1963. Two months later, President Lyndon Johnson signed a law renaming the center in honor of the slain president.Trump has used the Kennedy Center extensively during the first year of his second presidential term.He attended a board meeting there in March, claiming the building was in \"tremendous disrepair.\" In June, he and first lady Melania Trump appeared for the opening night of the musical \"Les Miserables.\"This month, Trump took the unusual step of hosting the Kennedy Center Honors, where actors Sylvester Stallone and Michael Crawford, and musicians including Gloria Gaynor, George Strait and the members of '80s rock band Kiss, were saluted.Trump also attended the FIFA World Cup drawing at the center, where he was awarded the soccer organization's newly created \"peace prize.\"",

    "body": "Novo Nordisk CEO Maziar Mike Doustdar shakes hands with U.S. President Donald Trump during an event to announce a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to reduce the prices of GLP-1 weight‑loss drugs during an event in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 6, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDrug pricing has emerged as one of the biggest issues for pharmaceutical companies this year, as the U.S. looks to dramatically reduce the costs paid by consumers.As the largest single market for most pharma and biotech firms, higher drug prices in the U.S. — often nearly three times as costly as in other countries — are a key factor in the industry's reliance on American sales, with branded drugs commanding even steeper premiums.President Donald Trump has pushed for lower drug prices for Americans through so-called Most Favored Nations drug pricing, whereby the prices in the U.S. are set at the lowest price paid by other wealthy countries. That could have a tremendous impact on companies' balance sheets.But exactly how exposed are Europe's biggest pharma companies to the U.S. market?Majority U.S. salesAmong the 10 largest biopharmaceutical companies in the Stoxx 600 health index, five have a majority of their total sales from the U.S.: Roche, Novo Nordisk, GSK, Argenx, and UCB.Argenx is the most exposed, with 85% of total sales originating in the U.S. in its last reported period.The least exposed are Germany's Merck KGaA and Bayer, with about 30% of sales coming from the U.S. Both Merck and Bayer have diversified businesses that go beyond pharmaceuticals while Roche also has a sizeable diagnostics division. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca, the FTSE 100's largest company, generates 42% of its sales from the U.S., and is aiming to boost this share as it targets $80 billion in revenue by 2030. In its third-quarter earnings report, the company, which has a broad portfolio of blockbuster drugs comprising cancer, respiratory, and diabetes medicines, said it is delivering on its strategy to strengthen operations in the U.S. to \"power growth.\"The Cambridge, U.K.-based company has also pledged significant investments in the U.S., just like peers Novartis, Roche, and GSK, since Trump took up his second presidential term.Making deals​Trump's push for slashing drug prices has led many firms on both sides of the Atlantic to make deals with the administration.​In May this year, the president signed an executive order establishing MFN drug pricing. He has also sent letters to 17 major drugmakers, calling for them to slash U.S. prescription prices to levels paid overseas.​At the same time, Trump has made a push for onshoring production of various goods, including pharmaceuticals, and threatened triple-digit tariffs for drugmakers that fail to invest in U.S. manufacturing — further ramping up the pressure on companies to make deals with his administration.​AstraZeneca, Novo Nordisk, and other U.S. pharma giants have already made deals with Trump to lower prices of their medicines in the country, although analysts say it may not have a significant impact on their bottom lines due to the way the deals were structured. \"[AstraZeneca's] MFN deal is more benign than appreciated, but EU countries may see access to drugs reduced,\" said Jefferies analysts in November. ​Late Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that heavyweights Roche and Novartis – the two biggest European pharma companies by market value – were closing in on drug pricing deals with the Trump administration, which may be announced as soon as Friday. Both companies told CNBC they supported the administration's goal of lowering drug costs for Americans but declined to confirm an imminent deal. Novartis said it was \"in discussion with the Administration.\"– Carolin Roth contributed to this report",

    "body": "Kazuo Ueda, governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), during a committee on financial affairs meeting at the lower house of parliament in Tokyo, Japan, on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank on Friday raised its short-term rates to a three-decade high, driving a sell-off in government bonds, while signaling its readiness to tighten further as it marches ahead with policy normalization.     The Bank of Japan raised benchmark rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%, their highest level since 1995, and in line with expectations of economists polled by Reuters. The BOJ said that real interest rates are expected to remain \"significantly negative,\" adding that accommodative financial conditions will continue to firmly support economic activity. Following the decision, the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds rose about 5 basis points to 2.019%, while the 20-year JGB yield climbed 3 basis points to 2.975%, both reaching their highest since 1999. The yen weakened 0.25% to 155.92 against the dollar, and the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index gained 1.28%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan embarked on policy normalization last year, abandoning the world's only negative interest rate regime that had been in place since 2016. Since then, the BOJ has consistently maintained its stance on gradually lifting rates, stating that its goal was to see a \"virtuous cycle\" of rising wages and prices.Inflation has run above above the BOJ's 2% target for 44 straight months, with  data released earlier in the day showing consumer price growth at 2.9% in November. High inflation has pressured real wages that have been declining for 10 months in a row, according to labor ministry data. The BOJ projected that core inflation — which strips out the prices of fresh food —  is likely to decelerate below 2% from April to September 2026, due to a slower rise in food prices as well as the effects of government measures aimed at addressing rising prices.Higher rates risk exacerbating the downturn in the Japanese economy. Revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that economy shrank more than initially estimated, contracting 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis.   The BOJ said in its statement that while weakness has been seen in the economy, corporate profits were likely to remain high, and firms are expected to continue raising wages in 2026.\"It is highly likely that the mechanism in which both wages and prices rise moderately will be maintained,\" the bank said, adding that the possibility of underlying inflation reaching its 2% target was rising. The rate hike also comes at a time when JGB yields have been hitting multi-decade highs, spiking further after the decision, raising the risk of higher borrowing costs for Japan and increasing fiscal strain. Asia's second-largest economy already boasts of the world's highest debt-to-GDP ratio, standing at almost 230%, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Rising yields could, however, support the Japanese currency. The yen has been trading around 154-157 against the dollar since November, having weakened over 2.5% since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, a proponent of looser monetary policy, took office in October.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAfter this hike, the BOJ is likely to raise its policy rate in mid-2026, taking it to a terminal rate of 1%, Shigeto Nagai, head of Japan Economics at Oxford Economics, said in a statement to CNBC before the BOJ decision. Terminal or neutral rate refers to one that balances inflation and economic growth — it neither overheats, nor slows down the economy. At a press conference following the rate decision, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda said that \"We will seek to produce new estimates on Japan's neutral rate, if needed, though I don't think that will help us narrow the range that much,\" according to Reuters.Ueda reportedly said earlier this month that it was difficult to estimate the terminal rate, with the central bank pegging it at 1% to 2.5%.\"Looking ahead, the BOJ is likely to continue hiking rates gradually without explicitly indicating where it sees the terminal rate, Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, said in a note after the press conference.Suzuki added that a rapid tightening was not expected, and downward pressure on the yen will continue. Oxford's Nagai warned that another rate hike by the BOJ could cause friction with Takaichi, if inflation declines smoothly towards 2% in the first half of 2026. Takaichi during her leadership contest had staunchly opposed rate hikes by the BOJ, but has since softened her stance.Nagai said that the reason why Takaichi would accept this rate hike was because of the weak yen, and that \"addressing the cost-of-living crisis has become an urgent policy issue.\"In November, Japan's cabinet approved a stimulus package totaling 21.3 trillion yen ($135.5 billion) as  Takaichi seeks to boost the country's slowing economy and offer support to inflation-hit consumers.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United",
    "body": "President Donald Trump's social media company will provide the capital needed to bring TAE Technologies' first fusion power plant online in the United States by 2031, TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told CNBC on Thursday.Binderbauer spoke shortly after his privately held company and Trump Media and Technology Group announced plans for an all-stock merger valued at more than $6 billion.The CEO said the deal would combine Trump Media's \"fortress balance sheet\" with TAE's technologies.\"We've got capability and technology to really scale this,\" Binderbauer told CNBC.\"We've got the engineering prowess to do that, but the last piece of the puzzle was the capital,\" he said. \"Now, you're marrying capital with that underlying base of technical capability.\"Fusion is a form of nuclear power that could one day generate enormous amounts of energy by fusing atoms. The process, which powers the Sun, does not produce the long-life radioactive waste that is the byproduct of fission, the process created in traditional nuclear reactors. Despite decades of research, scientists and companies have so far been unable to commercialize fusion technology. Fusion ignition was only achieved for the first time in a laboratory setting in December 2022. But Binderbauer said he is bullish on his company's prospects to reliably generate — and sell — fusion power, now that it can tap funding from Trump Media.Trump Media, which operates the Truth Social app, will invest up to $200 million in TAE with another $100 million coming after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Binderbauer said. Trump Media has meager revenue relative to its market capitalization, which was above $4 billion on Thursday, and to its balance sheet. For the third quarter that ended on Sept. 30, Trump Media had financial assets of $3.1 billion, which included cash and digital assets, the company announced last month. Trump Media for that quarter reported a net loss of $54.8 million, with sales of just under $973,000.TAE and Trump Media said that their merged company in 2026 plans, subject to regulatory approval, to \"site and begin construction on the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant,\" which would generate 50 megawatts of electrical power, an industry measurement. TAE has plans to scale up future fusion power plants to generate between 350 to 500 megawatts of power, Binderbauer said. A traditional fission nuclear power plant can generate about two to three times that much power, depending on the reactor. \"Fusion power will be the most dramatic energy breakthrough since the onset of commercial nuclear energy in the 1950s,\" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said on a call Thursday. \"An innovation that will lower energy prices, boost supply, ensure America's AI supremacy and revive America's manufacturing base and bolster national defense,\" Nunes said.Trump Media's investment comes as the artificial intelligence boom has left utilities scrambling to find enough power to fuel the build-out of data centers across the country. In October, the Energy Department launched a national strategy in October to accelerate the commercialization of fusion. Nunes said, \"Together with TAE, we will have the capital and public market access to scale TAE's vision to put abundant nuclear energy on the grid.\"Nunes, who is a former House member from California, and Binderbauer plan to serve as co-CEOs of the merged company.\"Nunes will continue to lead all Trump Media brand operations. Binderbauer will manage TAE Technologies,\" a news release said.TAE, whose board members include Ernest Moniz, who served as Energy secretary in the Obama administration, was founded in 1998.Since then, the company has raised more than $1.3 billion in private capital in a dozen rounds of funding, from investors such as Chevron and Alphabet's Google. Asked why TAE did not strike a deal with one of its prior investors, Binderbauer said Trump Media moved quickly and boldly.\"We have these partnerships, but this is the one that moved,\" Binderbauer said.\"I just have to reduce it to that simple sort of factor. That's really the difference,\" he said. \"We're going to build a power plant. We're going to take this technology to the commercial level.\" TAE has not yet made siting decisions or reached offtake agreements for its planned plants, Binderbauer said. \"We're in the process on that,\" he said.  \"We're going to announce that when we're ready with that, but we have a game plan.\" Michael Schwab will serve as chairman of the combined company's nine-member board. Donald Trump Jr., Nunes and Binderbauer will serve as directors. The five other members are yet to be chosen. ",

    "body": "A shopper carries Nike bags in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 17, 2025.  David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike shares fell more than 10% in premarket trading on Friday morning, as concerns about its performance in China outweighed the sportswear giant's earnings beat. On Thursday, Nike posted quarterly earnings and revenue that topped Wall Street's estimates, as strength in North America helped to offset a plunge in China sales.The stock movement comes as investors digest the weakness reported in China and the sustained hit Nike is taking from higher tariffs.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNike share priceHere's what Nike reported for its second fiscal quarter of 2026, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 53 cents vs. 38 cents expectedRevenue: $12.43 billion vs. $12.22 billion expectedThe athletic apparel retailer said sales in North America rose 9% to $5.63 billion. But revenue in its Greater China market dropped 17% to $1.42 billion.The company reported net income of $792 million, a 32% drop from $1.16 billion in the prior-year period. Revenue rose 1% to $12.43 billion from $12.35 billion.Shares of German athleisure giants Adidas and Puma also took a small hit on Friday morning, as concerns about Nike's performance spilled over to companies across the Atlantic.Investors in Western consumer discretionary companies, like sportswear and luxury goods makers, are closely monitoring the shape of the critical Chinese market, where consumer demand has been volatile for some time after slowing sharply in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Adidas reported 10% growth in China revenues in its third-quarter earnings report. In its third-quarter earnings report, Puma said sales in the Asia Pacific region fell 9% due to a \"significant decline\" in the Greater China wholesale business. Nike's turnaround progressNike is just over a year into CEO Elliott Hill's turnaround strategy, focusing on regaining its growth and market share, clearing out old inventory and investing in wholesale relationships.\"Fiscal year '26 continues to be a year of taking action to rightsize our classics business, return Nike digital to a premium experience, diversify our product portfolio, deepen our consumer connection, strengthen our partner relationships and realign our teams and leadership,\" Hill said on a call with analysts. \"And I say we're in the middle inning of our comeback.\"\"We're nowhere near our potential,\" he added.Hill said Nike's improvements in its China market are \"not happening at the level or the pace we need to drive wider change,\" though he said the country remains one of the company's most powerful long-term opportunities.Nike expects fiscal third quarter revenues to fall by a low single digit percentage, with modest growth in North America. It also anticipates gross margins will drop 1.75 to 2.25 percentage points – including a 3.15 percentage point hit from tariffs.The company said wholesale revenues climbed 8% to $7.5 billion during the quarter. But direct sales — which were a focus for Nike in the years before Hill took over and moved away from the strategy — fell 8% to $4.6 billion.Nike has also been feeling the impact of tariff increases. It said Thursday that its gross margin decreased by 3 percentage points and inventories dropped 3% primarily due to higher tariffs.watch nowThe sneaker company has been reporting weakness in its Converse brand, too. In its first fiscal quarter, Nike said Converse sales dropped 27% – on Thursday, it reported a 30% drop in revenues for the sneaker brand. Despite the weakness in some parts of Nike's business, the company highlighted some areas of strength and new initiatives ahead. CFO Matt Friend said on the call that Nike.com posted its best Black Friday ever this year, partially driven by its Air Jordan \"Black Cat\" launch.Nike also plans to launch a new footwear platform in January called Nike Mind, which aims to help athletes prepare for performance and competition, Hill said on the call.Nike has been making larger internal changes under Hill.Earlier this month, Nike underwent leadership changes to \"remove layers,\" according to Hill. Under its \"Win Now\" strategy, the company announced that Chief Commercial Officer Craig Williams would leave the sneaker giant. Hill called the shakeup a move \"about growth and offense.\"\"Collectively, these changes amount to us eliminating layers and better positioning Nike to continue to have an impact the way only Nike can,\" Hill said in a statement at the time.Nike shares were already down more than 13% this year-to-date at Thursday's close.In a note following the earnings update, Citi analysts said Nike's performance in China weighed on their expectations for the company's broader recovery. \"Management expects 2Q China weakness to continue for the remainder of [2026] as they reset the market place (which will take time),\" they said. \"This keeps us cautious on the [2027] recovery and highlights the complicated turnaround underway.\"",

    "body": "Signage at an ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. branch in Delhi, India, on Thursday, Dec. 18, 2025. ICICI Prudential AMC's initial public offering to raise as much as 106 billion rupees ($1.2 billion) received bids for more than 1.37 billion shares, compared with 35.02 million offered, at close on last day of the sale Tuesday, according to exchange data. Photographer: Anindito Mukherjee/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of ICICI Prudential, one of India's largest asset management companies, rose 19% in their trading debut on Friday, following a 106 billion rupees ($1.17 billion) initial public offering.The IPO by the firm, jointly owned by India's ICICI Bank and UK's Prudential, was priced at 2,165 rupees per share at the upper end of the price band. Shares, which were listed on the National Stock Exchange as well as the BSE, closed at 2,576.20 rupees.The issue was subscribed more than 39 times during the bidding process, driven primarily by a strong demand from institutional investors. Retail portion of the IPO was subscribed just 2.5 times.Singapore's GIC and Temasek and India's public sector insurance company Life Insurance Corporation were among the major institutional investors that participated in the IPO.ICICI Prudential AMC is India's largest asset management company in India in terms of assets managed under active mutual fund schemes with an mutual fund quarterly average assets of 101.47 billion rupees. The company had 15.5 million retail investors as of end of September. Citigroup Global Markets India, BofA Securities India, Morgan Stanley, Axis Capital, Avendus Capital and ICICI Securities were among the joint bookrunners.Though this IPO saw relatively tepid individual investor interest, global consultancy firm Bain & Company estimates retail investor-driven assets of Indian mutual fund industry to grow to about $3.3 trillion by 2035 from 45 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025. This comes as salaried millennials in metro cities and Gen Zs increasingly invest savings in mutual funds, even avoiding direct equities, the report said.As more retail investors participate in capital markets, the opportunities for asset managers to handle those funds are ballooning. Investment through systematic investment plans, which refer to investing bite-sized sums at regular intervals, tripled to 2.89 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025 from 2021, data from Association of Mutual Funds in India shows.India has seen companies raise $11.4 billion via 252 IPOs during the first three quarters of this year, according to an EY report in October. With many big-ticket listings — LG Electronics, Tata Capital and Lenskart as well as ICICI Prudential AMC — coming in the final quarter, the final amount of funds raised is expected to be higher than last year's $19.9 billion.\"Due to financialization of savings Indians are increasing their exposure to mutual funds and equities. AMCs like ICICI Prudential are a carrier of this change,\" said Kranthi Bathini, equity strategist at Mumbai-based WealthMills Securities.He added that the stock is \"fairly valued, but any dips is a buy opportunity\" as ICICI Prudential AMC with its scale of operations is a good play on the long-term story of financialization of savings in India.ICICI Prudential AMC's revenue rose over 32% in fiscal year 2025 to 49.77 billion rupees, year on  year, while its net income climbed nearly 30% to 26.50 billion rupees.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump sits in the Oval Office to sign executive orders, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 18, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday directing federal agencies to reclassify marijuana, loosening long-standing restrictions on the drug and marking the most consequential shift in U.S. cannabis policy in more than half a century.The order, once finalized by the Drug Enforcement Administration, moves cannabis out of Schedule I classification — the most restrictive category under the Controlled Substances Act, alongside heroin and LSD — to a Schedule III classification, which encompasses substances with accepted medical use and a lower potential for abuse, such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.\"This action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more, including numerous veterans with service-related injuries, and older Americans who live with chronic medical problems that severely degrade their quality of life,\" Trump said from the Oval Office on Thursday.  Also on Thursday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, led by Dr. Mehmet Oz, is expected to launch a pilot program in April enabling certain Medicare-covered seniors to receive free, doctor-recommended CBD products, which must comply with all local and state laws on quality and safety, according to senior White House officials. The products must also come from a legally compliant source and undergo third-party testing for CBD levels and contaminants.Shares of cannabis conglomerates were down following the announcement, likely from worries of new compeititon from international companies.Trulieve's stock finished the day down about 23%, Green Thumb Industries fell more than 16% and Tilray Brands fell about about 4% as of close on Thursday. The AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF, which tracks American operators, slid almost 27%.\"Millions of registered patients across the United States, many of them veterans, rely on cannabis for relief from chronic and debilitating symptoms. We commend the administration for taking this historic step. This is only the beginning,\" Ben Kovler, founder and CEO of Green Thumb, said in a statement to CNBC. The reclassification is viewed by many analysts as a financial lifeline for the cannabis industry. The move exempts companies from IRS Code Section 280E, allowing them to deduct standard expenses like rent and payroll for the first time. It also opens the door for banking access and institutional capital previously sidelined by compliance fears. Many on Wall Street also expect the changes and the Medicare pilot to draw major pharmaceutical players into the sector to chase federally insured revenue.While CBD has surged in popularity in recent years, with infused consumer goods ranging from seltzers to skin care, the Food and Drug Administration has stopped short of granting the compound its full backing. Studies have found \"inconsistent benefits\" for targeted conditions, while FDA-funded research warns that prolonged CBD use can cause liver toxicity and interfere with other lifesaving medications. Currently, the FDA has only approved one CBD-based drug, Epidiolex, for rare forms of epilepsy.\"I want to emphasize that the order ... doesn't legalize marijuana in any way, shape or form, and in no way sanctions its use as a recreational drug,\" Trump said. Experts and industry insiders told CNBC this week that a reclassification could pave the way for more research into the effects of CBD use. ",

    "body": "Before your child even steps out the door every day, their emotional baseline for the day is already set — not by color-coded routines, but by how safe and connected they feel in your presence.As a conscious parenting researcher, I've studied more than 200 kids, and I'm a mother myself. I've found that the happiest, most resilient kids are raised in homes where connection matters more than control, especially in the morning.Parents who raise happy kids practice nine morning rituals to create emotional safety and support their children's developing brain:1. Self-regulate before you reconnectBefore your child wakes up, take just 60 seconds to check in with yourself: Take a few deep breaths, a moment of stillness with your coffee, or a quick meditation.Children learn how to be calm directly through our nervous systems. When you begin in a regulated state, you provide a sturdy emotional foundation for your child's day.2. Lead with connection, not correctionBefore asking about teeth-brushing or backpacks, create a moment of genuine connection, like eye contact, a warm smile, or physical touch. Your message should be: \"You matter more than the morning rush.\"This brief emotional attunement regulates your child's nervous system and sets the stage for cooperation and calm.3. Create pockets of calm amid chaosIntegrate small rituals that slow the pace, like playing soft music during breakfast, sitting together without screens, or implementing a 30-second family huddle before heading out.These micro-moments teach kids that calm is available even on busy mornings.4. Find moments for laughterEven in the midst of spilled milk and mismatched socks, find opportunities for playfulness, like a silly voice, a 10-second dance party, or a shared inside joke.Laughter reduces stress and reinforces that mistakes or morning mishaps don't overpower emotional safety.5. Check in emotionally, not just logisticallyBefore diving into the day's logistics, pause to check in with how your child is feeling: \"How's your heart this morning?\" or \"What's one thing you're looking forward to today?\"These brief emotional check-ins build emotional literacy, which is one of the strongest predictors of lifelong resilience and happiness.6. Make physical touch non-negotiableA morning hug, a forehead kiss, or a moment of snuggling releases oxytocin and increases emotional security.Choose three specific moments in your morning routine where you'll pause for intentional physical connection and affection, regardless of how rushed you feel. It's one of the fastest, most effective ways to regulate a child's nervous system.7. Create a screen-free sanctuaryMake mornings a device-free zone for both parents and children for at least the first 20 minutes of waking. No phones, tablets, or television.This digital boundary creates space for natural conversation or even comfortable silence together. 8. Honor the power of slownessChildren live at a different pace than adults. That's just their biology. I recommend adding five extra minutes to one morning transition and match your child's pace.When we slow our movements and expectations, we help regulate their nervous systems. What looks like “dawdling” is often a child’s natural rhythm: their brain processing the world at a developmentally appropriate speed.9. Create a bridge before goodbyeInstead of rushing out with a quick \"Let's go,\" pause for a real goodbye: eye contact, a hug, reassurance.Then add a \"connection bridge,\" or something to look forward to later: \"I can't wait to hear about your science project tonight,\" or \"Let's make pancakes tomorrow morning.\"Let go of the idea that every morning needs to be rushed, or that the day is in shambles because they didn't finish their homework the night before. Focus on creating emotional safety. Even adopting one of these habits can help shift your child's entire day and support healthier brain development.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Holiday Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Despite slower job growth compared to the last decade, the U.S. economy is expected to add 5.2 million jobs from 2024 to 2034, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest employment projection report. Total employment is projected to grow by 3.1%.Based on the report, the top-growing industry sectors for 2034 are health care and social assistance and professional, scientific and technical services, which have projected growth rates of 8.4% and 7.5%, respectively.Within those sectors, the fastest-growing occupational groups are health-care support, which includes roles like nurse practitioner and physician assistant, and computer and mathematical roles, such as data scientist and information security analyst. These groups are expected to grow by 12.4% and 10.1%, respectively.One of the main reasons that the health-care industry is expected to grow so rapidly is because the American population is aging, according to Emily Krutsch, branch chief at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\"That's really what's driving that trend: the older population tends to need more of this type of care and services,\" she says.Computer and mathematical roles will become increasingly important with the rise of AI technology, according to Krutsch.\"We are expecting a boost in employment growth for occupations that would be involved in developing and testing and implementing these types of tools,\" Krutsch says.Relatedly, information security analyst roles are projected to grow significantly due to the \"larger need to protect data and develop systems and tools to secure it,\" she says.Krutsch emphasizes that the growth rate for each job isn't the only important data point to consider.For example, wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers are the two fastest-growing jobs, but both occupations combined will add under 20,000 jobs by 2034. \"Just because we're talking about fast growth doesn't necessarily translate to lots of jobs, because it could just be a very, very small occupation,\" Krutsch says.Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' data, these are the fastest-growing occupations for 2034, as well as the expected increase in jobs by 2034 and the current median salary for each role.1.

    "description": "Concept Ventures was an early investor in billion dollar AI firm Eleven Labs.Reece ChowdhuryA venture capitalist says one of the biggest reasons start",
    "body": "Concept Ventures was an early investor in billion dollar AI firm Eleven Labs.Reece ChowdhuryA venture capitalist says one of the biggest reasons startups fail hinges on the relationship between co-founders.Reece Chowdhry, founding partner of Concept Ventures, said early teams often split within two years because their co-founders clash or lack a shared vision. His venture capital firm, founded in 2018, says it is Europe's largest pre-seed fund, which focuses on startups at the ideation stage. It recently announced it had raised $88 million for its newest fund.Chowdhry told CNBC Make It that he invests based on founders' personalities and traits before they even have a product. There are four to five key traits he looks for in a startup before going all-in, Chowdhry explained.\"I think 80% of our decision is on founders and we are typically the first investor in every company we invest in,\" Chowdhry said in the interview. \"The number one reason companies typically fail in the first 18 to 24 months is that founders fall out with each other or don't get along, don't have the same vision alignment, purpose, and so that is something that we think is really important,\" he said. In the initial meeting with founders, Chowdhry emphasized that co-founder chemistry is one of the key characteristics he looks for. \"One of the things we're very obsessed with is 'How well do you know each other? Have you gone through something meaningful in life? If I interview you both separately, will the answers also match? What will that person's strengths be? What will that person's weaknesses be? And do you intimately know each other?\"If I gave the New York Times' dating questions, would they match up to a level where you would really  intimately know people at their core?\"Other core traits that Chowdhry looks for in founders include an obsession with a specific field or industry, relentlessness and grit, a growth mindset, and evidence of exceptionalism in something outside of work, such as sports or chess. Concept Ventures was an early backer of $3 billion voice AI company Eleven Labs, co-founded in 2022 by Mati Staniszewski and Piotr Dąbkowski. Chowdhry said two key traits in his meeting with Eleven Labs' co-founders stood out and persuaded him to invest. \"The two things that stood out were domain obsession, so literally thinking about that problem for a long time and the team dynamics. They were like childhood friends. They knew each other super well. They complemented each other really well,\" he added. 'The whole package'Y-Combinator co-founder and startup guru Paul Graham shared similar wisdom in a blog. He warned that solo founders faced an uphill climb, noting that most successful startups have at least two or three founders. In one post, Graham wrote that a startup with only one founder is \"a vote of no confidence\" because it suggests they couldn't convince any of their friends to join.  However, failure is possible, even with multiple founders. \"The relationship between the founders has to be strong. They must genuinely like one another and work well together. Startups do to the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock: if it can be pulled apart, it will be,\" Graham said. Concept Venture's Chowdhry added that his investment decisions in early-stage startups involve examining \"the whole package,\" rather than just one founder.\"It has to be a package and I think what many VCs optimize for is they'll meet the CEO typically and they'll put a lot of lens on the CEO, although 50% of the business is two people or three people,\" he explained.He noted that many companies being built in Europe have very technical founders, but he looks for a founding team with complementary skill sets. \"It's not just technical and non-technical. Is one a very fast thinker, and the other ones are balancing them out. A slow thinker slows the other person down. Does one have magnetism, as in they can attract world-class talent to them,\" he added. ",

    "body": "Disney's \"Zootopia 2\" follows detectives Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde find themselves on the twisting trail of a mysterious reptile who turns the mammal metropolis of Zootopia upside down.DisneyThe Thanksgiving box office had enough tasty options to deliver one of the best holiday performances ever.Led by Disney's \"Zootopia 2,\" which collected an estimated $156 million, the five-day Thanksgiving weekend secured around $294 million. That figure won't be finalized until Monday, when all of Sunday's ticket sales are calculated, but would represent either the third or fourth best Thanksgiving haul of all time.The fourth-highest Thanksgiving holiday box office is currently $291.3 million, which was generated in 2012 while the third-highest is 2013's $294.2 million haul, according to data from Comscore.While the 2025 Thanksgiving period at the box office was smaller than both 2018's $315.6 million haul and 2024's record-breaking $424.9 million, it still set records. IMAX reported its best five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend ever with $40.8 million in global ticket sales, 70% higher than the previous record set during the same frame in 2024.\"'Zootopia 2' and 'Wicked: For Good' delivered a phenomenal one-two punch for the Thanksgiving holiday — hitting the sweet spot for family audiences and sending our global box office soaring well past expectations,\" Rich Gelfond, CEO of IMAX, said in a statement Sunday.Disney, too, hit several benchmarks.Largest animated box office ever \"Zootopia 2\" had the highest global opening of an animated movie of all time, with an estimated haul of $556 million. It is the fourth-highest global opening of all time, the company reported.\"A staggering global result for 'Zootopia 2' as the Disney brand coupled with a PG-rated family film extravaganza and a beloved original installment powered the film to over a half a billion dollars worldwide,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore, told CNBC. \"This film truly cracked the code on what family audiences around the world [are] looking for when venturing out to cinemas.\"Additionally, the animated sequel posted the second-highest Thanksgiving day and Thanksgiving opening for both the five-day and three-day periods. The current record holder is 2024's \"Moana 2\" which tallied $221 million for the five-day Thanksgiving period and $135.5 million for the three-day.Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" added an estimated $93 million to the domestic box office during the five-day Thanksgiving period, smaller than the $118 million \"Wicked\" picked up during the same period in 2024.Still, box office experts expected \"Wicked: For Good\" and \"Zootopia 2\" to continue to snap up ticket sales in the weeks before Christmas and ahead of the release of Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"\"This holiday weekend now sets the stage for a solid final home stretch of the box office year and with a great assortment of films on the way, including notable blockbusters and awards contenders ... this is a welcome result in the wake of what has been a very tumultuous post-summer season for the industry,\" Dergarabedian said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Mikhail Metzel | Via ReutersAll eyes are on Russia this week as talks over a peace plan to end the war in Ukraine shift to Moscow and step up a gear.U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is travelling to Russia on Monday and is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin for discussions on a U.S.-backed 19-point peace plan. Ukraine has tentatively supported the fledgling peace proposals, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it too can work with the framework agreement.The latest plan is an amended version of an initial 28-point plan, reported several weeks ago, that had been devised by the U.S. and Moscow without Ukraine's involvement, and which favored Russia.Russia will be eager to have its say on the amended proposals after a flurry of diplomacy and discussions between U.S. and Ukrainian officials in the last week and talks being in Florida on Sunday. Whether Putin will play ball when it comes to a new peace plan is a big unknown, however, with Russia feeling like it has both the advantage on the battlefield and U.S. President Donald Trump's ear when it comes to the outlines of a future peace deal. The Kremlin confirmed that Witkoff and Putin will meet on Tuesday.Will Putin play ball?Putin and Kremlin officials have reacted cautiously to the amended peace plan so far, signalling that Russia is ready to talk but that the war in Ukraine might not necessarily end soon.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said during a trip to Kyrgyzstan. He added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" with Witkoff.

President Trump has vacillated over his support for Ukraine and has appeared, at times, to support Russia's demands that Ukraine cede occupied territory to Moscow as part of a peace deal. He has then backtracked, stating that Kyiv's forces can win back all their land, muddying the waters as to where het stands on a peace settlement.Following talks with Ukrainian officials in Florida on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the process toward a peace deal was \"delicate\" and that Russia's position needed to be factored in to any deal.He said the four-hour long talks — which included Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as a Ukrainian delegation headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Ustem Rumerov — had been productive but that more work was left to be done. \"So much work remains, but today was, again, a very productive and useful session where I think additional progress was made,\" Rubio told reporters after the talks.",

    "body": "The Eli Lilly logo appears on the company’s office in San Diego, California, U.S., Nov. 21, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersEli Lilly on Monday said it is lowering the cash prices of single-dose vials of its blockbuster weight loss drug Zepbound on its direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, building on efforts by the company and the Trump administration to make the medicine more accessible.The announcement also comes weeks after chief rival Novo Nordisk unveiled additional discounts on the cash prices of its obesity and diabetes drugs. Starting Monday, cash-paying patients with a valid prescription can get the starting dose of Zepbound vials for as low as $299 per month on LillyDirect, down from a previous price of $349 per month. They can also access the next dose, 5 milligrams, for $399 per month and all other doses for $449 per month, down from $499 per month across those sizes. Zepbound carries a list price of roughly $1,086 per month. That price point, and spotty insurance coverage for weight loss drugs in the U.S., have been significant barriers to access for some patients. Eli Lilly's announcement comes just weeks after President Donald Trump inked deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to make their GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to get and afford. The agreements will cut the prices the government pays for the drugs, introduce Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offer discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January, TrumpRx. But Eli Lilly's deal with Trump centers around lowering the prices of a different form of Zepbound – a multi-dose pen – after it wins Food and Drug Administration approval. That means Eli Lilly's Monday announcement around cutting prices on the existing single-dose vials could allow more patients to get discounted treatments more quickly. \"We will keep working to provide more options — expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access — so more people can get the medicines they need,\" said Ilya Yuffa, president of Lilly USA and global customer capabilities, in a statement. With single-dose vials, patients need to use a syringe and needle to draw up the medicine and inject it into themselves. Eli Lilly first introduced that form of Zepbound in August 2024. It's unclear how many patients are currently using single-dose vials of Zepbound. But Eli Lilly previously said that direct-to-consumer sales now account for more than a third of new prescriptions of Zepbound. Novo Nordisk earlier this month lowered the price of its obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic for existing cash-paying patients to $349 per month from $499 per month. That excludes the highest dose of Ozempic. The company also launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. ",

Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShares of European aerospace giant Airbus fell as much as 10% on Monday, following reports the company has discovered an industrial quality issue regarding dozens of A320-family aircraft. The flaw, which is said to affect the aircraft's fuselage panels, is delaying some deliveries but there are no immediate indications that it has reached aircraft in service, Reuters reported, citing unnamed sources. In response, Airbus confirmed it had identified a quality issue regarding a \"limited number\" of A320 metal panels, saying the source of the issue has been \"identified and contained.\" CNBC has contacted Airbus for comment. Paris-listed shares of Airbus plunged to the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index on the news. The stock was 5.4% lower at 3:42 p.m. London time (10:42 a.m. ET), paring losses from earlier in the session.The latest report comes after Airbus said the vast majority of the roughly 6,000 A320-family aircraft impacted by a software glitch over the weekend had now received the necessary modifications.In a statement published Monday, Airbus apologized for delays caused to passengers and airlines impacted by the software issue, which affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.watch nowThe directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which were both impacted by the Airbus recall, traded 0.2% lower and 0.3% higher, respectively. Meanwhile, shares of French aerospace and defense firm Thales, which supplied the flight system software to Airbus, were last seen down 2%. — CNBC's Victor Loh contributed to this report.",

Ethereum dropped around 6.6% in early trade, to reach about $2,827.Solana had fallen more than 7%, and was last seen around $127, while other closely watched tokens were also in the red, including dogecoin, which slipped around 9%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBTC.In Asia, a statement by the People's Bank of China on Saturday warning of illegal activities relating to digital currencies heaped pressure on Hong Kong-listed shares of digital assets-related companies, which retreated during Monday's session.The fresh slide in digital assets chimes with a broader risk-off sentiment at the start of a new month. Ben Emons, founder and CIO of Fedwatch Advisors, said that people remain \"nervous\" following the recent bitcoin sell-off, adding that Monday's reversal has broadly been attributed to a $400 million exchange liquidation.Speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday, he highlighted the sizable leverage across bitcoin exchanges, which is up to 200x in some instances. With an estimated $787 billion outstanding leverage in perpetual crypto futures, against some $135 billion outstanding in ETFs, \"you can do the math,\" Emons said. \"There is still a lot of leverage in bitcoin out there. We can expect to some more of these liquidations if bitcoin prices don't get off the lows from here,\" he added.Monday's dip came on the back of a sharp sell-off in October, which also moved the stock market, Emons said, with bitcoin showing greater correlation with certain indexes including the Nasdaq. \"It's predominantly retail driven, that's the worrying part of it, because retail reacts very differently than institutional [investors],\" he said, noting the decentralized nature of crypto exchanges and opaque nature of the asset class.\"That is something to reckon with going forward from here, as more and more leverage is used in this space.\"Macroeconomic concerns — including uncertainty over a possible U.S. rate cut — continue to weigh on investors' minds, while nagging doubts over overheated valuations in artificial intelligence-related names contributed to November's bumpy markets as crypto volatility heightened.watch now",

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz.So it was perhaps unsurprising that a new inheritance tax was resoundingly rejected by voters on Sunday. The proposal to tax every inheritance and gift of more than 50 million Swiss Francs at 50% was defeated with 78% voting against it. Powerful Swiss business lobby Economiesuisse called talk of the inheritance tax a \"superfluous and damaging discussion.\"It welcomed the proposal's defeat, saying: \"The threat of forced sales of companies and the resulting weakening of the business location have convinced those entitled to vote from all political camps.\"The proposal came from the youth wing of the country's left-wing Social Democrats.

He told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge, from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" watch now\"They are very mobile. They have tons of options to optimize their taxes,\" he added.Kurt Moosmann, president of the Swiss Single Family Office Association, told CNBC the proposal had caused \"a certain uncertainty among family offices and has kept foreign capital holders away from Switzerland.\"One potential impact of the 50% tax, if implemented, would have been a fall in tax revenue, according to  Legge. He said that around 2,000 people, or 0.3% of Switzerland's population, would be affected and they currently pay between 5 and 6 billion Swiss Francs a year.But although Switzerland faces competition from wealth centers in the Middle East and other countries in Europe, Legge said Switzerland was \"still very strong\" on \"finding the right balance between taxes and the right public services.\"watch nowGiorgio Pradelli, CEO of Swiss private bank EFG International, agreed that Switzerland remains in a strong position. \"If you look at the overall competitive landscape, Switzerland remains the No. 1 destination for international private banking and wealth management,\" he told CNBC last week. \"We have an ecosystem that is super healthy and strong.\"",

Michael Fisher wrote in the appellate ruling. The unusual series of legal moves taken by the Department of Justice to install Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as an acting U.S. attorney demonstrates \"the difficulties it has faced,\" Fisher wrote.\"Yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,\" the judge wrote.Fisher and another judge on the panel, D. Brooks Smith, were nominated to the Third Circuit by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other judge, L. Felipe Restrepo, was nominated by Democratic ex-President Barack Obama.Abbe Lowell and Gerald Krovatin, lawyers for one of the parties in the case challenging Habba's appointment, noted in a statement with Norm Eisen that Monday's ruling marks \"the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.\"\"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate,\" the lawyers said in a joint statement to NBC News.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Trump nominated her in June, but she never underwent the Senate confirmation process, a Constitutionally-mandated step that can be lengthy and contentious.Habba could only legally serve as an interim prosecutor for a limited time under the FVRA. As that deadline neared, the Trump administration took a number of steps to keep Habba in the role.The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, who was set to become interim U.S. attorney for the district after Habba's scheduled departure. Trump then withdrew Habba's nomination, and Bondi appointed her as both \"Special Attorney\" to the attorney general and the First Assistant U.S. attorney, aiming to elevate her automatically to acting U.S. attorney.But the appeals court panel ruled Monday that those actions failed to comply with the provisions of the FVRA.\"Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's disqualification order,\" Fisher concluded.The ruling came one week after another Trump-picked prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was deemed invalidly appointed.That ruling, which disqualified Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also threw out the cases she brought against two major Trump foes: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.Monday's appellate ruling on Habba did not dismiss the underlying criminal charges against the two people who had challenged her appointment.",

Share price fell as low as $17.66 in April, before recovering over the past few months.\"Apple is a potential major reference customer whose presence validates Intel's high-performance foundry offering,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Global Equities, told CNBC.\"If Intel pulls it off, there is potential to win higher volume and value business from Apple, for example CPU production for the iPhone, and win business from other large chip designers.\"Intel has had an up and down relationship with Apple since it first announced the chip giant's processors would power some products in 2005. The iPhone maker transitioned away from the company's processors at the start of the 2020s.Last week Intel was on the subject of a lawsuit filed by TSMC, in which it alleged one of its former senior vice president had leaked \"confidential information\" to the company. Intel did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment at the time.",

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

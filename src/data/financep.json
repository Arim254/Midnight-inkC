Pre-tax profit plunged 72% to 602 billion won, a massive miss compared to expectations of 1.2 trillion won, while the company's operating profit dipped 16% to 753 billion won. Net profit was a bright spot, coming in above expectations despite a 54% decline at 934 billion won. LSEG estimates had pegged net profit at 717.20 billion won. Full year numbers Annual revenue skyrocketed 137% year on year to hit 26.61 trillion South Korean won, but marginally missed estimates of 27.01 trillion won. Pre-tax profit fell slightly to 2.15 trillion won, down 19% from the same period a year ago and missing expectations of 2.73 trillion.Hanwha had logged its fourth consecutive year of record operating profits, while net profit numbers beat expectations. Operating profit rose 75% year on year to 3.03 trillion won, while net profit declined 16% year on year to 2.14 trillion won, beating expectations of 1.65 trillion won. Share gainsOn an year-to-date basis, Hanwha shares have climbed 18.92%, following a blistering rally in 2025 which saw shares climb 193%, on top of a 154% jump in 2024.

    "body": "US' Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick (R) gestures on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 21, 2026. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesThe White House on Monday expressed confidence in Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after several lawmakers called for him to resign or be ousted. \"President Trump has assembled the best and most transformative cabinet in modern history,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in an email. \"The entire Trump administration, including Secretary Lutnick and the Department of Commerce, remains focused on delivering for the American people.\"Three members of Congress since Sunday called on Lutnick to resign amid revelations that his business and personal dealings with deceased sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein were more extensive than previously known.Lutnick \"lied to the country about his ties to Epstein,\" Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., wrote in an X post Monday morning.\"Now we learned that they were in business together,\" Schiff wrote. \"He has no business being our Commerce Secretary. He should resign.\"Schiff made his statement one day after Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., urged Lutnick to step down in light of The New York Times' report that the Trump administration official interacted \"regularly\" with Epstein, according to the Epstein files released by the Department of Justice. Massie was the lead Republican on the Epstein Files Transparency Act that compelled the release of the records relating to the notorious sex offender.\"He should just resign,\" Massie said on CNN's \"Inside Politics Sunday.\" \"Howard Lutnick clearly went to the island if we believe what's in these files; he was in business with Jeffrey Epstein, and this was many years after Jeffrey Epstein was convicted.\" Massie added, \"He's got a lot to answer for, but really, he should make life easier on the president, frankly, and just resign.\"Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, took it a step further, calling on Lutnick to resign — or be fired.\"It's now clear that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has been lying about his relationship with Epstein. He said he had no interactions with Epstein after 2005, yet we now know they were in business together,\" he wrote in a post late Sunday on X. \"Lutnick must resign or be fired. And he must answer our questions.\"Massie also noted that several British officials have been toppled over appearances in the Epstein files. Morgan McSweeney, chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, resigned on Sunday over his role in appointing ousted U.S. Ambassador Peter Mandelson. Mandelson was also named in the Epstein files.Lutnick's dealings with Epstein have come under increased scrutiny as dozens of public figures have been named in the files, which the DOJ has been releasing after a law was signed compelling their disclosure. The former chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald said on the podcast \"Pod Force One\" last year that he swore off interactions with Epstein after an initial encounter in 2005. The Times' analysis of the Epstein files, however, found that Lutnick and Epstein were in touch for years after the first meeting in 2005. It was previously reported that Epstein had invited Lutnick to his private island in the Caribbean and that Lutnick had been communicating with Epstein about construction happening across the street from their homes. The two also had drinks in 2011, the files revealed. The Times report also includes new details, including that Epstein's lawyer obtained the resume of Lutnick's nanny and that Epstein donated $50,000 to an event honoring Lutnick. Epstein and Lutnick also invested in the now-defunct company AdFin Solutions, according to the Times report. A Commerce Department spokesperson in an email to CNBC said Lutnick had \"very limited interactions\" with Epstein, and called the report a \"failing attempt by the legacy media to distract from the administration's accomplishments.\"",

    "body": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's logo is seen in the background beside a printed circuit board. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTaiwan has told Washington that its proposal to move 40% of the island's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. was \"impossible,\" the country's top tariff trade negotiator said in an interview. Speaking on a local television broadcast Sunday, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said she had made it clear to Washington that the country's semiconductor ecosystem, built up over decades, could not simply be relocated. The comments push back against onshoring targets outlined by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a CNBC interview in January, shortly after the latest U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement. Lutnick said he wanted 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain to shift to the U.S. within President Donald Trump's ongoing term. Under the deal, the Taiwanese government promised $250 billion in direct investments by its tech companies, with an additional $250 billion in credit provided for them to expand their production capacity in the U.S. In return, Taiwanese companies were promised higher quotas for tariff-free exports of their chips to the U.S. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's leading contract chipmaker and producer of the most advanced semiconductors, has already been working to better align with U.S. policy interests.The company has committed more than $65 billion to U.S. manufacturing in recent years, with plans to expand that to $165 billion, as it produces chips for American clients Apple and Nvidia. The investments have also leveraged grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. But according to Lutnick, Washington is also looking for hundreds of other smaller companies in the chip supply chain to come to the U.S. \"We're going to build giant semiconductor industrial parks in America ... This is a $500 billion down payment on let's bring those semiconductors home,\" he said in January, adding that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff. However, semiconductor analysts broadly agree with Cheng's assessment that Washington's most ambitious onshoring plans are unfeasible, citing the difficulties of relocating such an advanced supply chain.Analysts and industry officials point to Taiwan's deeply integrated semiconductor ecosystem, U.S. labor shortages and elevated costs as some of the key obstacles.Geopolitical analysts have also pointed to the so-called \"Silicon Shield\" theory, which posits that the island's pivotal role in global chip supply makes safeguarding its autonomy a U.S. strategic imperative, deterring a potential Chinese aggression. Beijing claims sovereignty over the democratically governed island.This Silicon Shield could further discourage Taiwan from shifting its supply chains abroad. Taiwanese authorities have already implemented a policy requiring TSMC's overseas plants to operate using technologies at least two generations behind the cutting-edge ones being deployed in Taiwan, a policy often referred to as the N-2 rule. The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cheng's statement. As part of the latest trade agreements, Washington said it would lower its levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, and waive tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically.TSMC shares were trading up 2.75% in Taiwan on Tuesday. — CNBC's Matthew Chin contributed to this report.

Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's embassy in London Tuesday criticized the U.K.'s decision to expand a visa program for Hong Kong residents, calling the move an interference in its internal affairs after a court sentenced pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison under a national security law. The U.K. on Monday expanded the British National Overseas (BNO) visa scheme on Monday to allow children of BNO status holders — who were under 18 at the time of Hong Kong's handover to mainland China in June 1997 — to apply for the route independently of their parents.  \"BNO has misled Hong Kong residents to leave their homes, only to face discrimination and hardship in the U.K., living as second-class citizens,\" an embassy spokesperson said in a statement in Chinese translated by CNBC.The embassy described the scheme expansion as \"despicable\" and \"reprehensible.\"\"China has always firmly opposed the UK's manipulation and interference in China's internal affairs,\" the embassy spokesperson said.The scheme was launched in 2021 after Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law on Hong Kong. Since then, over 230,000 people have been granted visas, and almost 170,000 have relocated to the U.K. The diplomatic tensions followed the sentencing of Lai by a Hong Kong court on Monday, in one of the city's most prominent prosecutions. That was the heaviest penalty ever meted out under the national security law. The 78-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper was a vocal critic of Beijing and was among the first prominent figures arrested in August 2020. He was jailed on charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and publishing seditious materials. Lai pleaded not guilty to all counts.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing last month, calling for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. Critics and Lai's family have argued that the U.K. did not take sufficient and concrete steps to reverse the course.The sentencing showed how the Beijing-imposed national security law has \"criminalised dissent, prompting many to leave the territory,\" the British government said in a statement, adding that it will \"rapidly engage [with Beijing] further on Mr Lai's case.\"  The expanded visa route came amid what the British government described as a \"deterioration of rights and freedoms\" in Hong Kong. The government estimated that 26,000 people will arrive in the U.K. over the next 5 years.   Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee said Tuesday that Lai deserved the harsh sentencing for all the harm that he had done, including \"using Apple Daily to poison the minds of citizens\" and \"colluding with foreign forces to take sanctions and hostile actions against China and Hong Kong.\"Other governments have renewed calls for Lai's release following the ruling. Marco Rubio, U.S. Secretary of State, called the ruling \"unjust and tragic\" and urged the authorities to grant humanitarian parole for Lai. ",

    "body": "Ali Ghodsi, co-founder and CEO of Databricks.DatabricksDatabricks said Monday it has raised $5 billion in funding and $2 billion in new debt capacity at a $134 billion valuation. The privately held data analytics software company also said that its annualized revenue exceeded $5.4 billion for the January quarter, up 65% year over year, while delivering free cash flow over the past year. That type of performance might whet the appetites of public market investors, who have not seen many new issuances of technology companies with high growth rates. Databricks is prepared to go public \"when the time is right,\" co-founder and CEO Ali Ghodsi told CNBC in an interview. This year is shaping up to potentially feature notable tech IPOs. Fast-growing artificial intelligence labs Anthropic and OpenAI are also considering 2026 initial public offerings, according to people familiar with the matter. Elon Musk said in December that his rocket company SpaceX could also go public this year.Like many other companies, Databricks is generating revenue from AI. The company helps its clients connect their data with AI models to launch custom agents, in addition to providing tools for storing, processing and querying data. AI products now generate $1.4 billion in annualized revenue, Databricks said in a statement. The pace of Databricks' overall expansion is accelerating — in June, the company forecast 50% growth.The company said in December that it was raising more than $4 billion in the round at a valuation of $134 billion. \"We weren't sure we're going to actually be able to raise all of the five,\" said Ghodsi, adding that there was heavy interest in recent weeks. He said it can take months for venture capital to reflect major changes in equity markets. Goldman Sachs, Glade Brook Capital, Morgan Stanley, Neuberger Berman and the Qatar Investment Authority are among the investors in the new round. JPMorgan led the debt round, and now Databricks has billions in cash on hand.\"If this correction hasn't bottomed out yet, and it's just going to continue, we're just going to continue as a private company,\" Ghodsi said.Databricks is now larger than rival Snowflake, which reported $1.21 billion in revenue in the October quarter. Snowflake's market cap stands at about $58 billion. With the wide release of its Lakebase database last week, Databricks has expanded its market, challenging incumbents such as Oracle and SAP.Oracle and Snowflake shares both fell about 13% last week as software stocks took a step down across the market. That happened due to investors worrying that open-source plugins for Anthropic's Claude Cowork AI-powered productivity tool might pose new competitive challenges for public software companies. \"The correction is an overreaction, and you're going to see all these companies be around, and nobody's getting rid of them anytime soon,\" Ghodsi said. \"Their moat is shrinking.\"Founded in 2013, Databricks ranked No. 3 on CNBC's 2025 Disruptor 50 list.— CNBC's Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.WATCH: Trading the tech takedown with Altimeter's Brad Gerstnerwatch now",

    "body": "Shares of SoftBank Group Corp jumped over 10% after its telecom arm, SoftBank Corp, raised its full-year profit outlook, while renewed optimism around Arm Holdings added to bullish sentiment toward the group's artificial intelligence exposure.Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 at SoftBank Corp rose 8% from a year earlier to 5.2 trillion yen, a record for the period, while operating income also climbed 8% to 884 billion yen.Reflecting the momentum, the telecom subsidiary lifted its full-year revenue forecast to 6.95 trillion yen from 6.7 trillion previously, and increased its operating income target to 1.02 trillion yen.SoftBank Corp said the results underscored steady execution toward its fiscal 2025 goals, even as it fine-tunes parts of its consumer business to prioritize long-term profitability over subscriber growth.Revenue in the consumer business posted modest gains of 3%, while segment income rose 6%, even as smartphone subscribers fell by 100,000 in the third quarter after the company tightened its customer-acquisition policy. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconA sharp rally in Arm Holdings also provided a fresh boost for SoftBank Group, given its large stake in the British chip designer, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. Arm's upside is increasingly driven by AI-linked growth beyond smartphones. \"Our data center royalty revenue has grown more than 100% year-on-year, and we expect in a few years our data center business to be our largest business, larger than mobile,\" Rene Haas, CEO of ARM, said in an earnings call on Wednesday.The company is also aiming to supply half of the central processing units used by the world's largest cloud computing companies, also known as hyperscalers, by year-end.Despite missing Wall Street estimates for licensing revenue, Arm posted record quarterly revenue of $1.242 billion for the last three months of 2025, driven by demand for artificial intelligence. That figure beat LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.",

    "body": "watch nowTarget said Monday that it's stepping up store staffing, but eliminating about 500 jobs at distribution centers and regional offices as it tries to win back shoppers who have complained about sloppier shelves, out-of-stock items and longer checkout lines.In an internal employee memo obtained by CNBC, the big-box retailer said it's making changes to the way it runs and oversees stores to improve the customer experience, a top goal of new CEO Michael Fiddelke. To do that, Target said it will reduce the number of store districts — the geographic areas that its nearly 2,000 stores are broken into, which have dedicated staffing — and put money toward more hours for front-line store employees.As part of the changes, Target is laying off around 500 people, including about 100 at the store district level and about 400 across its supply chain sites, the internal email said.\"This change also fuels our ability to put significantly more payroll in our stores — primarily in additional labor and hours where needed most, but also in new guest experience training for every team member at every store,\" the email said. The email was written by Adrienne Costanzo, chief stores officer, and Gretchen McCarthy, chief supply chain and logistics officer, and sent to Target employees across its headquarters and store field teams on Monday afternoon.A Target spokesperson declined to specify the amount of additional investment planned for Target stores, but said the announcement will not change starting wages for store workers, which range from $15 to $24 per hour depending on the location. Read moreFor Target, the organizational shift marks one of the first changes under Fiddelke, formerly the company's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, who stepped into the top job on Feb. 1. Fiddelke took the helm as the company aims to get back to growth. Its annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and it cut 1,800 corporate roles last year in its first major layoff in a decade. Customers, vendors and investors say the company had gotten weaker in some of the key areas where it used to stand out. For example, some shoppers said Target had lost its edge with attentive customer service and trendy, fashion-forward merchandise that earned the company its \"Tarzhay\" nickname.The company has also faced backlash and boycotts from customers over a string of political and social stances over the past few years, including its decision to sell and then pull some Pride Month merchandise, its embrace of and reversal of major diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and, most recently, for not speaking out against the surge of immigration enforcement in its hometown of Minneapolis. Along with Target's self-inflicted struggles, the company has faced stiffer competition from peers like Walmart and a tougher economic backdrop. Consumers have been more selective in recent years about discretionary purchases and impulse items — Target's sweet spot — while paying more for necessities like groceries and rent. In an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters in October, Fiddelke said his leading priorities as CEO would be restoring Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology to speed along the business.Yet he added that Target needs to simplify an operation that's become more complicated for store managers and store employees in recent years as they not only stock shelves, but also pick orders for curbside pickup or packing cardboard boxes headed to customers' homes.\"If you're a store manager now, yes, you're supporting your in-store guest, and you're also running a fulfillment business that's gotten pretty big,\" he said in the October interview. \"And I think we're just now fully appreciating, 'All right, we've got to make sure that we're doing both really well, and it's more complex than it used to be.'\"Last year, the company made another store-related change to try to clean up and smooth over its operations. Almost all of Target's online orders are fulfilled in stores, which has taken up more of employees' time and stores' back rooms. In response, the company shook up its online strategy, designating some stores as locations where employees pick and pack online orders to ship to customers' homes and dropping that altogether at other locations.Target is expected to share more details about its turnaround strategy, along with its holiday-quarter results and full-year forecast, on March 3. It will host an event for investors at its Minneapolis headquarters. ",

Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe world's largest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has acquired the financial services app Step, marking his company's entry into fintech with a focus on serving younger users.Step is advertised as an all-in-one money app for teens and young adults to manage money, build credit and access financial tools. The app will operate under the umbrella of Donalson's company, Beast Industries. \"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That's exactly why we're joining forces with Step,\" MrBeast told his millions of fans on Monday. \"I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had. Lots to share soon.\"Beast Industries did not disclose how much it paid for Step. CNBC contacted the company for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Beast Industries has been fundraising over the past year, including a recent $200 million investment from Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Ether and chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee.watch nowStep is backed by fintech giant Stripe, as well as venture capital firms such as Coatue, Collaborative Fund, Crosslink Capital and General Catalyst.The newly acquired Step was founded in 2018 by fintech veterans CJ MacDonald and Alexey Kalinichenko, with a mission of providing the next generation with tools for financial literacy. While it is not a bank, Step partnered with Evolve Bank & Trust, a consumer banking company, for banking services in 2022. The platform also includes a Step Visa Card, an account for saving, spending, sending money and investing, with no monthly fees.Beast Industries said in a press release Step's over 7 million users, technology platform and in-house fintech team would complement its large digital audience and philanthropic initiatives.\"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better,\" Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said in a statement. Beast Industries' other ventures include Feastables, a snack brand, Beast Philanthropy, its non-profit arm, and Beast Games, its reality competition series on Amazon Prime Video.Those ventures leverage Donaldson's YouTube brand, which had over 450 million subscribers and 5 billion monthly views across channels as of early 2026. ",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Cuban government said international airlines can no longer refuel in the island nation due to fuel shortages after President Donald Trump threatened tariffs on any country that supplies the communist country with oil.Cuba's leadership said Sunday that the country will run out of aviation fuel from Monday, likely disrupting airlines operating there, according to EFE news agency, which cited two sources. The kerosene shortage is expected to persist for the next month, with all of Cuba's international airports affected.Cuba's Foreign Ministry and the Cuban Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Trump administration has sought to tighten the U.S. chokehold on Cuba since Jan. 3, when it conducted an audacious military operation to depose Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a longtime ally of Cuba's government.Trump, in an executive order issued at the end of January, said the Cuban government constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat,\" which required a national emergency declaration. Read moreThe U.S. president said Cuba's ties to countries including China, Russia and Iran, human rights violations and communist leadership destabilize the region \"through migration and violence.\" As part of the announcement, Trump said U.S. tariffs may target countries that provide any oil to Cuba, whether directly or indirectly. Russia: Fuel situation in Cuba is 'critical'Gripped by a deepening energy crisis, Cuba on Friday outlined extensive measures designed to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a reduction of the working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.Russia, which holds friendly ties with Cuba, said Monday that Havana's fuel situation was \"truly critical\" and that U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The situation in Cuba is truly critical. We know this. We are in intensive contact with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels. Indeed, let's say the U.S.'s stranglehold is causing many difficulties for the country,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday, according to Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti.Pedestrians walk past the Habana Libre hotel, formerly the Habana Hilton, in Havana on Feb. 2, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's foreign minister, Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, previously said the country's leadership condemned Washington's tariff threats in the \"strongest possible terms.\"In a statement posted on Jan. 30, Parrilla also accused the U.S. government of resorting to \"blackmail and coercion in an attempt to make other countries to join its universally condemned blockade policy against Cuba.\"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said last week that her government would aim to send humanitarian aid to Cuba from Monday, adding that the country is working to find a diplomatic solution to resume oil shipments to the Caribbean island.Mexico had paused shipments of crude and refined products to Cuba amid pressure from the Trump administration.watch now",

    "body": "From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump, in a call two decades ago to a Florida police chief, bashed his former friend Jeffrey Epstein and called Epstein's  procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell, \"evil,\" the now-retired cop recounted to FBI agents in 2019, according to a document released by the Department of Justice.Trump called the then-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter \"to tell him 'thank goodness you' [are] stopping [Epstein], everyone has known he's been doing this,\" Reiter told the FBI in October 2019, according to the FBI document, known as a 302. Reiter's name is redacted from the 302. But the document identifies the interview subject as the person who had been Palm Beach's police chief at the time of the department's investigation of Epstein, who was Reiter.Reiter told the Miami Herald, which first reported the document, that Trump called him in 2006, after the police department's probe of Epstein became publicly known.The document came to light hours after Maxwell's lawyer called on Trump to grant her executive clemency, so that she could speak \"honestly\" about what she knows. Maxwell, earlier Monday, refused to testify to a House committee.Trump told Reiter that he had thrown Epstein out of his club, Mar-a-Lago, which is located in Palm Beach, the summary said.\"Trump told him [Reiter] people in New York knew Epstein was disgusting,\" according to the FBI's 302 summary of its interview with Reiter.\"Trump said Maxwell was Epstein's operative, 'she is evil and to focus on her,' \" the FBI said in the 302.U.S. President Donald Trump sits behind a bill he signed to end the partial government shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 3, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEpstein later pleaded guilty to Florida state charges in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, in exchange for avoiding federal criminal prosecution.Reiter's interview with the FBI in October 2019 came two months after Epstein killed himself in a New York federal jail after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.During the 2006 call, \"Trump told [Reiter] that he was around Epstein once when teenagers were present and Trump got the hell out of there,\" the summary said.\"Trump was one of the very first people to call when people found out that they were investigating Epstein,\" the summary said.In an April 2019 email released last year by House Democrats, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls,\" according to a copy of that message purportedly between the two men.It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.The White House in November said, \"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees.\"The White House, when asked for comment on Monday night by CNBC about the FBI summary, referred questions to the Department of Justice.The DOJ said, \"We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the President contacted law enforcement 20 years ago.\"The summary is among millions of documents made public by the DOJ in late January that are related to Epstein and to Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to sexually abuse.Ghislaine Maxwell and Donald Trump are shown in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 23, 2025 as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. U.S. Justice Department | Via ReutersMaxwell on Monday appeared virtually before the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the Epstein case, but refused to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Her attorney, David Oscar Marcus, in a statement, said that Maxwell is willing to \"speak fully and honestly\" if Trump grants her executive clemency. Clemency can include a pardon, which would wipe away Maxwell's conviction, or commuting her sentence to allow her release from prison earlier than scheduled.\"Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,\" Marcus said. \"For example, both President Trump and President [Bill] Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.\"Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have been subpoenaed to testify to the Oversight Committee about Epstein. They are scheduled to be deposed there in late February.",

But the scheduling of her testimony comes amid growing concerns about her presence at a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center last month when FBI agents seized ballots from the 2020 election.Gabbard has said she was at the center at the direction of President Donald Trump.But Trump has said Gabbard was there at the \"insistence\" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who is vice chairman of the Intelligence committee, last week called on Gabbard to testify about her presence during the raid. Warner said he was particularly concerned that Gabbard had facilitated a phone call between Trump and  FBI agents who were executing a search warrant.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the FBI executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | Reuters\"Let's be clear: It is inappropriate for a sitting president to personally involve himself in a criminal investigation tied to an election he lost,\" Warner told reporters last week.Warner and other Democratic lawmakers have warned that Trump may try to interfere in the 2026 congressional elections, where the president's fellow Republicans are at risk of losing their majority in the House.Trump, for years, has falsely claimed he won the 2020 presidential election. Trump lost that election to former President Joe Biden, who defeated him in Georgia, as well as in other states.A federal judge in Georgia over the weekend ordered that the affidavit filed to obtain the search warrant for the FBI raid be unsealed by Tuesday.Disclosure: CNBC and MS NOW are divisions of Versant Media.",

    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech leaders named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those four have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City. The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Hoffman.Dominik Bindl | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeanwhile, a 2015 email from Epstein mentioned a dinner Hoffman hosted in Palo Alto, attended by Zuckerberg, Musk, Thiel, and MIT neuroscientist Ed Boyden.Hoffman connected Zuckerberg and Epstein via email after the event.  In response to an inquiry, Meta directed CNBC to a 2019 statement from a spokesperson, which stated that Zuckerberg did not communicate with Epstein again after the dinner.Hoffman did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate credit markets are facing fresh uncertainty as AI-driven tools start to pressure software companies, a major borrower group for private lenders.The software industry came under renewed pressure last week after artificial intelligence firm Anthropic unveiled new AI tools, sparking a sell-off in software data provider shares. The AI tools, developed by Anthropic, are designed to perform complex professional tasks that many software companies currently charge for, raising fresh concerns that AI could weaken traditional software business models.Shares of asset managers with large private credit franchises tumbled this week as investors fretted about how AI could upend borrowers' business models, pressure cash flows and ultimately lift default risks.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPrivate credit stocks in the past monthAres Management fell over 12% last week, while Blue Owl Capital lost over 8%. KKR declined almost 10%. TPG lost about 7%. Apollo Global and BlackRock fell over 1% and 5%, respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500 declined by about 0.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 1.8%.The moves bring to fore a growing unease around private credit market which now has to brace for the impact from AI-driven disruption to the software sector that is heavily exposed to buyouts financed with opaque, illiquid loans, according to market watchers.Private credit loans to a lot of software companies. If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio.Jeffrey HookeJohns Hopkins Carey Business School\"Enterprise software companies have been a favored sector for private credit lenders since 2020,\" PitchBook wrote in a report last week following the fallout, adding that many of the largest-ever unitranche (two or more loans combined into one) loans, the favorite structure of the private credit market, have been to software and tech companies.Software makes up a significant share of loans held by U.S. business development companies, accounting for about 17% of BDC investments by deal count, second only to commercial services, data from PitchBook showed.That exposure could prove costly if AI adoption accelerates faster than borrowers can adapt. UBS Group has warned that, in an aggressive disruption scenario, default rates in U.S. private credit could climb to 13%, significantly higher than the stress projected for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, which UBS estimates could come to around 8% and 4%, respectively.\"Private credit loans to a lot of software companies,\" said Jeffrey C. Hooke, a senior lecturer in finance at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. \"If they start going south, there's going to be problems in the portfolio.\"Hooke, however, said that strains in private credit pre-date the latest AI concerns, pointing to issues around liquidity and loan extensions. \"A lot of private credit funds have had problems liquidating their loans,\" he said, adding that the recent developments has simply added another layer to a sector already under pressure. watch nowThis slate of new warnings come on the back of recent concerns in the $3 trillion industry over leverage, opaque valuations and the risk that isolated problems may turn out to be systemic issuesJPMorgan's Jamie Dimon warned late last year about private credit's 'cockroaches,' cautioning that stress in one borrower can signal more hidden trouble.\"AI disruption could be a credit risk for private credit lenders for some of its Software & Services sector borrowers and perhaps not for others as it depends on which ones are behind the AI curve and which ones are on top of it,\" said Kenny Tang, head of U.S. credit research at PitchBook LCD.Tang added that software and services companies account for the largest share of payment-in-kind (PIK) loans, which refer to arrangements where borrowers can delay paying interest in cash. While PIK structures are often used to give fast-growing companies time to build revenue and cash flow, they become risky if a borrower's finances weaken. In that case, deferred interest can quickly turn into a credit problem, he said. Moody Analytics' chief economist Mark Zandi noted that while it is difficult to grasp a complete assessment of risks in the sector given its opacity, the rapid growth in AI-related borrowing, mounting leverage and a lack of transparency are considerable \"yellow flags.\"\"There will surely be significant credit problems, and while the private credit industry is probably currently able to absorb any losses reasonably well, this may not be the case a year from now if the current credit growth continues.\"Apollo, Blue Owl, TPG and BlakRock did not immediately respond to CNBC's queries, while KKR declined to comment.Ares Management CEO Michael Arougheti said the firm’s exposure to software was limited, with software loans making up about 6% of its total assets and less than 9% of private credit AUM.He added that Ares mainly lends to profitable software firms with strong cash flow and keeps borrowing levels low, which has helped keep problem loans close to zero.",

    "body": "Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale, attends an AI summit in Paris in February 2025.Getty ImagesThe founders of some of the world's most successful startups have been young: Think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom were just 19 when they launched their ventures.But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger.A new report released by global early-stage venture capital firm Antler, found that the age of founders of AI unicorns has fallen from a peak age of 40 in 2021 to 29-years-old in 2024. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. In 2014, the average unicorn founder was 30 at the time of launch, compared with 34 for those who reached unicorn status between 2022 and 2024.Several AI startups with young founders have been in the spotlight in the past year. Alexandr Wang, co-founder of $29 billion AI data labelling company Scale AI, is only 29-years-old. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs.In fact, Meta's former generative AI team, which was headed up by 65-year-old AI godfather Yann LeCun, was reorganized after its LLama4 AI model didn't perform well. This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. It was recently valued at over $10 billion.AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. Fridtjof Berge, co-founder and chief business officer at Antler, told CNBC Make It that the key qualities in founders have shifted to being able to \"move fast and break things,\" and \"continuously iterate and test and improve.\"Berge said: \"It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company.\" Corporate experience 'matters less'Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. \"I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure,\" he said. Fridjtoff added that it \"matters less\" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. \"You might not think with a blank-slate state,\" he said. \"I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training,\" he added. In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. Examples of rapidly scaling AI startups in 2025 were Mistral, Lovable, and Suno AI. And as Zuckerberg's own example proves, executing on a wild idea in a college dorm room can lead to phenomenal success.\"He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world,\" Berge said. Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers.Berge noted that while 20-somethings have qualities that allow companies to move quickly, leadership can often change hands as the firm matures. \"I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years,\" He added.

    "body": "Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. In \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,\" which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Buffett eventually arrives at a challenge he used to pose to college students. Buffett would ask the students to consider a scenario in which, given a class of 300 or so of their peers, they could receive 10% of the lifetime earnings of five of them. Who would they choose — and why? And who would they sell short? The people you chose, he says, wouldn't necessarily be the best looking or the smartest or the most athletic. \"Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy,\" Buffett says. \"There is nothing impossible. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five.\" How to get on the listSo what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? \"It's luck, a lot of it. If you choose the right parents, you're rich when you come out,\" Buffett says. \"You've won the lottery — the ovarian lottery.\"But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. \"You can do it by being a good person, by reading a lot, by spending less than you take in,\" he says. \"I just told them you can spend 110% of what you earn once, and then you used it up. The rest of your life you're underwater.\"Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. \"Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out,\" he says. \"It isn't that it's impossible, and I give credit to people to do it. But do it the easy way.\"Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of \"selling himself\" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients.\"That's not crazy,\" Buffett says. \"Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Many people think that if they're determined enough — if they push themselves really hard — they'll be able to create better habits.Those people are missing an important piece to the puzzle of self-control, according to James Clear, author of The New York Times bestselling book \"Atomic Habits.\" Even if you're disciplined, you likely need to put yourself in environments that allow you to stay that way, free of distractions or opportunities to be tempted out of your habits-in-progress, Clear told \"The Mel Robbins Podcast\" in a Jan. 8 episode.\"When you look at people who exhibit high levels of self-control, the common pattern across them is not that they have higher discipline than the average person,\" he said. \"The common pattern is that they are in situations where they're tempted less frequently.\"If you're avoiding alcohol while doing Dry January for the first time, for example, you may not want to go to happy hour with your friends, where external pressures or fear of missing out could sway you. The goal is to stay away from temptation, not resist it.\"You don't need to try to be more disciplined. You don't need to wish that you were a person with more willpower,\" said Clear. \"You need to take a little bit of time to design an environment where you're not tempted as frequently ... That could mean simple things like not having chips in the house or not having cigarettes in the house or things like that.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsYour environment can include the people you surround yourself with: Keeping company with likeminded individuals can help you stay focused, some studies show. If you and your friends are regularly in situations that keep you from building your desired habit, you might want to speak transparently with them about your goals or find other ways to spend time with them, Clear recommended.\"And that's not necessarily saying I never see these people again, but maybe I only see them in pockets or in certain situations,\" Clear said. \"And then other people I'm trying to expose myself to more and hang out with more.\"You may be inclined to tell yourself that, if you mess up during your pursuit for better habits, you should just quit trying altogether. Instead, flip your self-talk to be more optimistic, Clear advised. Tell yourself that your efforts today will pay off down the line, for example, or that you can stay the course even if you slip up.A positive attitude can also help you better manage the stress that comes with lifestyle and habit changes, according to a 2023 report from the Mayo Clinic. \"A bad attitude and self-pity makes every problem harder,\" said Clear. \"And so you're just layering on another challenge to the already challenging situation.

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Timon Schneider | SOPA Images | APCompany: Integer Holdings Corp (ITGR)Business: Integer Holdings Corporation is a medical device contract development and manufacturing company. Its brands include Greatbatch Medical and Lake Region Medical. The company's Cardio & Vascular product line offers a range of components, subassemblies, and finished devices used in interventional cardiology, structural heart, heart failure, peripheral vascular, neurovascular, interventional oncology, electrophysiology, vascular access, infusion therapy, hemodialysis, urology and gastroenterology procedures. Its interventional cardiology portfolio is focused primarily on the design, development and manufacture of catheter and wire-based technologies intended to diagnose and treat cardiac disease. Its electrophysiology products include devices used by electrophysiologists and interventional cardiologists for the treatment of cardiac arrythmias, such as atrial fibrillation.Stock Market Value: $3.01B ($85.78 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconInteger Holdings in the past 12 monthsActivist: Irenic Capital ManagementOwnership: greater than 3%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Irenic Capital was founded in October 2021 by Adam Katz, a former portfolio manager at Elliott Investment Management, and Andy Dodge, a former investment partner at Indaba Capital Management. Irenic invests in public companies and works collaboratively with firm leadership. The firm's activism has thus far primarily focused on strategic activism, recommending spinoffs and sales of businesses.What's happeningOn Dec. 18, it was reported that Irenic took a position of more than 3% in Integer Holdings and is calling for a board refreshment and the exploration of a potential sale of the company.Behind the scenesInteger Holdings is a medical device contract development and manufacturing organization (\"CDMO\"). The company acts as an outsourced design and development partner for original equipment manufacturers (\"OEMs\"), such as Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Johnson & Johnson. When developing new medical devices, OEMs typically outsource certain components to third parties, who then become responsible for those parts for the entire lifecycle of the product. Integer is the largest of such companies and the only publicly traded pure-play medical device CDMO. From an end market perspective, the company specializes in cardiovascular and neuromodulation applications, which are generally considered to be very high quality because of their interventional, and therefore highly sticky nature. Moreover, the stringent regulatory and FDA approval requirements for these markets create very high barriers to change. However, despite this strong market position and competitive moat, the company's share price has struggled, down nearly 40% in the past year.The catalyst for this downturn was Integer's most recent quarterly report, which disclosed that the market demand for three specific products fell short of the OEM's expectations, causing the OEMs to significantly reduce their orders from Integer. As a result, Integer is now facing an air pocket in growth from 2026. While the company typically targets 6% to 8% organic growth, 2026 is now projected to be between -2% and 2%. Despite management's assurances that this is just an air pocket and that growth will normalize in 2027, the stock plummeted in extended trading and in the days that followed. A development like this followed by the assurances of management generally does not result in a 40% decline in a stock. The nature of Integer's business brings along certain confidentiality constraints around critical information. So, while management can give assurances, they cannot give transparency into its pipeline or the identity of its customers, programs and platforms.On Dec. 18, it was reported that Irenic Capital had a position of more than 3% in Integer and is calling for a board refreshment and to explore a potential sale of the company. There are a few reasons why a sale makes sense here. First, as the only public pure-play medical device CDMO, Integer has no public comps and suffers from limited investor and analyst understanding and coverage. Second, as discussed above when a company is required to have opacity around its sales and customers, it is much easier operated and grown in a private setting. Third, public investors have limited information with which to analyze the company, where a private buyer subject to a confidentiality agreement would be able to perform diligence on Integer's products, contracts and pipeline in full detail, allowing them to underwrite future growth with greater confidence. This is not lost on Integer management. In 2024, they explored strategic alternatives and reportedly received bids at a premium to the share price at the time (estimated in the $110 to $115 per share range). While the company ultimately didn't pursue a transaction, as the stock subsequently rerated, the recent share price pullback suggests that private equity interest should remain at a meaningful premium to today's valuation. For example, Teleflex Medical recently announced the sale of its OEM business at approximately 4.7-times revenue and 16- to 17-times EBITDA. Integer's largest competitors, Resonetics and Confluent Medical, are both PE owned and were acquired at valuations exceeding 20-times EBITDA. Extrapolating these multiples to Integer, which currently trades at roughly 2-times revenue and 12-times EBITDA, would equate to an acquisition price north of $120 per share.In evaluating this decision, Irenic would like to see a board refreshment that would include directors with medical OEM experience and financial acumen. This would add needed experience in two areas integral in making a transformative decision like whether to sell or not. Even without a potential sale of the company, this is a board that needs refreshment. Of the 11 directors, five will have been on the board for at least 10 years by the next annual meeting. This includes the chair, Pamela Bailey, who has been on the board for nearly 25 years. Introducing some fresh perspectives could materially improve the board's ability to assess the potential options to maximize value for shareholders on a risk-adjusted basis.Irenic has significant experience in strategic activism, identifying companies that are struggling in the public markets and helping implement spinoffs and sales of businesses, often to private equity. Integer fits the firm's playbook perfectly. While we typically prefer an activist to weigh a standalone thesis against a sale path, it is hard to recall a company with less justification for remaining in the public market. With the nomination deadline opening Jan.21, Irenic's next steps – and whether the firm chooses to nominate directors – should emerge soon. However, while Irenic is more than capable of running a proxy contest, it has historically received board representation via settlements, and we would expect the firm to be looking for the same result here. Moreover, given Irenic's strategically driven approach to its engagements, we would expect the firm to de-emphasize its governance concerns should the current board initiate a formal strategic review and receive credible and value accretive offers.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "watch nowMicron stock rose nearly 8% Friday as investors looked to buy AI chip supply chain stocks after Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported robust earnings on Thursday, signaling continued AI infrastructure spending.Shares of Micron, one of the makers of memory and storage for artificial intelligence systems, is up over 250% over the past year, as memory is in a worldwide shortage and seeing a surge of demand. Memory is used in AI systems to keep large amounts of data close to the graphics processing unit, or GPU, so it can run large AI models without slowing down.\"AI driven-demand is accelerating,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told CNBC's Jim Cramer. \"It is real. It is here, and we need more and more memory to address that demand.\"Mehrotra said that Micron is spending $200 billion to build more production capacity in the U.S., including two fabrication plants, or fabs, in Idaho and a 600,000-foot facility in Clay, New York, where the company broke ground on Friday. Mehrotra said it will take a few years to build out the facilities, including clean rooms and production equipment. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick attended the groundbreaking. Micron said it would invest $100 billion in that fab.He added that Micron is also working to produce more chips in its existing facilities in the near term.At the beginning of 2025, Micron expected 10% growth for server memory, but that growth ended up being \"high teens\" by the end of the year. Mehrotra also said the company saw stronger-than-expected growth in memory and storage for PCs. \"We see that tightness continuing into 2027, so we see durable industry fundamentals over the foreseeable future, driven by AI demand,\" Mehrotra said.The rush to supply the memory demand of companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google has led to a shortage, and prices for the essential component are expected to rise an estimated 55% in the first quarter, CNBC previously reported.

The two turbines are part of a pilot program for the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind Program.Kendall Warner | Virginian Pilot | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesCoastal Virginia Offshore Wind will resume construction, after a federal judge Friday temporarily lifted the Trump administration's suspension of the project. It is the largest offshore wind project under construction in the U.S. Shares of Dominion Energy, the owner and developer, rose about 1% on the news.The Department of Interior in December halted construction of five wind farms off the East Coast, including Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, claiming national security concerns. Judge Jamar Walker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted Dominion's request for a preliminary injunction Friday. Dominion called the Trump suspension \"arbitrary and illegal\" in its lawsuit. \"Our team will now focus on safely restarting work to ensure CVOW begins delivery of critical energy in just weeks,\" a Dominion spokesperson told CNBC in a statement Friday. \"While our legal challenge proceeds, we will continue seeking a durable resolution of this matter through cooperation with the federal government,\" the spokesperson said. Dominion said in December that \"stopping CVOW for any length of time will threaten grid reliability for some of the nation's most important war fighting, AI and civilian assets.\"Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is a 176-turbine project that would provide enough power for more than 600,000 homes, according to Dominion. It is scheduled to start dispatching power by the end of the first quarter of 2026. The project will help meet power demand in in northern Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Data centers are increasingly straining the electric grid as they consume more power to train and run artificial intelligence applications. The Trump administration tried to halt four other offshore wind farms in December. They are Vineyard Wind 1 off Massachusetts; Revolution Wind off Rhode Island; Sunrise Wind off Long Island and New England; and Empire Wind 1 south of Long Island.Federal judges this week allowed Revolution Wind and Empire Wind to resume construction.

    "body": "Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado waves to supporters outside the White House following a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump on January 15, 2026 in Washington, DC.Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesNorwegian lawmakers reacted with shock and dismay over Venezuela opposition leader María Corina Machado's decision to present U.S. President Donald Trump with her Nobel Peace Prize medal.\"It's completely unheard of,\" Janne Haaland Matlary, a professor of international politics at the University of Oslo and former state secretary in the foreign affairs ministry, told public broadcaster NRK on Friday.She called Machado's gesture \"disrespectful\" and \"pathetic,\" saying it undermined the value of the prize, which the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards annually. Raymond Johansen, a Norwegian lawmaker for the center-left Labour Party and former governing mayor of Oslo, said in a Facebook post it was \"incredibly embarrassing and damaging to one of the world's most respected and important prizes,\" according to a Google translation.Machado, who met Trump at the White House for the first time on Thursday, said the gift to the U.S. president was a \"profound expression of gratitude for the invaluable support of President Trump and the United States to the Venezuelan people.\" It comes after a U.S. military operation seized Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.The U.S. president thanked Machado on social media, describing it as a \"wonderful gesture of mutual respect.\" The White House later posted a photo of Trump and Machado, with the U.S. president holding up a large, gold-colored frame displaying the medal.A bust of Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist Alfred Nobel (1833-1896) is pictured outside the Norwegian Nobel Institute in Oslo, Norway on January 8, 2026.Jonathan Nackstrand | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Nobel Peace Center, a museum in Norway's capital dedicated to the Nobel Peace Prize, said in a post on X: \"A medal can change owners, but the title of a Nobel Peace Prize laureate cannot.\"The Norwegian Nobel Committee and the Norwegian Nobel Institute had previously said: \"The facts are clear and well established. Once a Nobel Prize is announced, it cannot be revoked, shared, or transferred to others. The decision is final and stands for all time.\"\"Whoever has received the prize has received the prize,\" Trygve Slagsvold Vedum, leader of Norway's Centre Party, told NRK. \"The fact that Trump accepts the medal says something about him as a type: a classic scapegoat who will adorn himself with other people's awards and work,\" he added. The White House was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC on Friday.'Politics over peace'Trump has frequently spoken about his desire to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The White House responded to the Nobel Committee's decision to award Machado the medal in October last year by saying they had \"proved they place politics over peace.\"Some Norwegian lawmakers appeared happy to brush off Machado's gesture, however, saying it should not be seen as an indication of who the award rightfully belongs to.Read moreDag-Inge Ulstein, leader of Norway's center-right Christian Democratic Party, told NRK that there is \"no doubt\" that the Nobel Peace Prize still belongs to Machado.Ine Eriksen Søreide, Norway's former defense minister and a member of the center-right Conservative Party, agreed with Ulstein.\"Even though Trump has now received the medal, it does not mean that he has received the Peace Prize,\" Søreide said.",

    "body": "A pharmacist displays a box of Wegovy pills at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 15, 2026.George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Novo Nordisk rose more than 8% on Friday after early prescription data showed an encouraging start to the U.S. launch of the company's new GLP-1 pill for obesity.In a Friday note, TD Cowen analysts called it a \"solid start\" for the first-ever weight loss pill, but said \"one data point does not make a trend.\" They cautioned that they need to see more data to fully assess early demand for the Wegovy pill, which officially launched Jan. 5 after winning approval in late December. Still, the initial data is a boost to the Danish drugmaker's hopes of winning back more share from its chief rival, Eli Lilly, this year in the booming obesity and diabetes drug market. Eli Lilly won the majority market share in early 2025 and is trailing closely behind Novo Nordisk in the pill space, as it prepares for the upcoming launch of its own oral drug for obesity.In a Friday note, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said around 3,100 prescriptions for the Wegovy pill were filled in the first week of the launch, citing IQVIA data for the week ending Jan. 9. In the first week of the commercial launch of Eli Lilly's popular obesity injection, Zepbound, around 1,300 prescriptions were filled, and roughly 8,000 were filled in the second week, he noted. That injection won U.S. approval in late 2023. The TD Cowen analysts cited somewhat different data published by Symphony through Bloomberg. The analysts said around 4,290 prescriptions were filled for Novo Nordisk's pill during its first full week of launch, with the majority being for the starting dose of the drug. They added that the data from their source or IQVIA likely don't include prescriptions through Novo Nordisk's direct-to-consumer pharmacy or its telehealth partners. The analysts said that compares with the roughly 1,900 prescriptions filled for Zepbound during its first full week on the market. Assuming the Symphony data is accurate, the pill \"is already outstripping its injectable counterparts at the same stage of their launch,\" TD Cowen analyst Michael Nedelcovych wrote in the note. A more direct comparison between the pill and the injections can be made based on available data early next week, though the figures may not prove more useful for another two to three quarters, he added. Nedelcovych said he wants to see the full picture on the direct-to-consumer channel, which holds \"significant promise\" for the pill's launch. Demand could also shift once Eli Lilly's pill, orforglipron, enters the market in the next few months, he added. While Novo Nordisk's drug has a head start, it is a peptide medication with dietary requirements — no food or drink for 30 minutes after taking the pill with water — that may hinder uptake. Eli Lilly's pill is a small-molecule drug and not a peptide, meaning it does not have those restrictions. watch now",

    "body": "U.S.President Donald Trump arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of existing U.S. tariffs already levied against goods from these individual countries.Trump's post suggested that the new tariffs on the European allies were being imposed in response to them moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the President did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law granting the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"This is breaking news.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he'd prefer to keep National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett in his position as top economic advisor, a statement that could change the dynamic in the race to see who will replace Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair.During an appearance in the White House, Trump said, \"I see Kevin's in the audience, and I just want to thank you. You ⁠were fantastic on television today.\"\"I actually want to keep you where you are, if you want to know the truth,\" he added.Hassett has been considered a leading contender to take the central bank reins, competing closely with former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.Trump has been a fierce Fed critic and has indicated he will replace Powell when his term as chair ends in May. Hassett and Warsh are two of five finalists for the position, a group that also includes current Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.Trump has indicated he will name a Powell successor this month but hasn't provided a specific date. Turning to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Trump said, \"We don't ‍want to him lose [Hassett], Susie, but we'll see how it all works out.\"After Trump spoke, traders on predictions market site Kalshi raised their bets to a 60% chance of Warsh getting the job, compared with just 16% for Hassett and 14% for Waller. As recently as Wednesday, Warsh and Hassett were in a near dead heat.\"It is not certain this is a definitive signal — the President has given various signals at various times and appears to enjoy the drama of this Celebrity Apprentice season — but it does look as if the former Fed governor is for the first time the clear front-runner,\" wrote Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI.Traders on Polymarket expressed a similar dynamic, with Warsh, at 60%, leading Hassett, at 15%, and Waller at 13%. Traders are giving little odds to Bowman and BlackRock fixed income chief Rick Rieder, the other two candidates considered finalists. Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship.",

    "body": "Elon musk and the xAI logo.Vincent Feuray | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Environmental Protection Agency closed a loophole this week that Elon Musk's xAI had exploited to rapidly stand up its first data center in Memphis, Tennessee. Musk's artificial intelligence startup created a kind of off-grid power plant for its Colossus facility by using a cluster of gas-burning turbines. The company was able to avoid air pollution permitting by classifying the turbines, which were mounted on trailers, as \"non-road engines.\"The EPA's updated rule clarifies that those kinds of turbines can't be designated as non-road engines and companies must also obtain Clean Air Act permits before installing them, particularly if their aggregate emissions will go above \"major source thresholds\" of pollution. The Shelby County Health Department in Memphis previously allowed xAI to designate its turbines as non-road engines, and to start using them without any public comment and environmental impact review, as would have been required in a standard permitting process. Representatives from the county's health department and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment. The move by the federal regulator could slow xAI's expansion in the Memphis area as it builds out facilities, packed with Nvidia's graphics processing units, to develop AI models and services in a booming generative AI market currently led by OpenAI and Google.At the Memphis data center, which first opened in 2024, xAI conducts inference and training for its Grok models and apps, including a chatbot and image generator tightly integrated into the company's social network X.While xAI had previously told Memphis regulators that its turbines would include state-of-the-art pollution controls, known as selective catalytic reduction technology, its supplier, Solaris Energy Infrastructure told CNBC in June that it did not install such controls in xAI's \"temporary\" turbines.SEI, a Houston-based energy services provider, has seen its stock price soar in recent months, partly due to xAI's expansion plans. SEI didn't respond to a request for comment.Pollution from the turbines has been a major source of local contention. Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a rotten egg-like stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their heart and lung health. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes around Memphis.Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, said they would sue to stop xAI's unpermitted use of the turbines. However, they didn't file a complaint after the county allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued them permits.Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environment Law Center, which is representing the NAACP, said in an email that her firm will monitor xAI operations to ensure they aren't violating terms of their permits, and are operating within the bounds of current EPA rules at forthcoming facilities in nearby Mississippi. XAI, which recently raised $20 billion from investors including Nvidia and Cisco, is currently being investigated in multiple jurisdictions after its Grok and X apps let users easily create and distribute deepfake violent and sexualized images of women and even children.WATCH: xAI closes $20 billion funding roundwatch now",

    "body": "Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, speaks to members of the media outside the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025. Francis Chung | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhite House economic advisor Kevin Hassett said Friday that large U.S. banks could voluntarily provide credit cards to underserved Americans as a means to address President Donald Trump's affordability push.A week ago, Trump called for banks to cap credit card interest rates at 10%, an idea that has been roundly rejected by industry executives and their lobbyists this week.Now, Hassett, who is director of the National Economic Council, is floating a different plan, this one more narrowly focused on consumers who don't have credit access but have the income to justify credit lines.\"They could potentially voluntarily provide for people who are in that sort of sweet spot of not having financial leverage very much because they don't have access to credit, but they have enough income and stability in their lives so they're worthy of credit,\" Hassett told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. \"Our expectation is that it won't necessarily require legislation, because there will be really great new 'Trump cards' presented for folks that are voluntarily provided by the banks,\" he said.The comments could indicate that the administration is downgrading its efforts for broad changes to the card industry that would be difficult to enact and that could hit consumer spending and the economy. This week, bankers discussing fourth-quarter results said that rather than offering cards at a 10% interest rate, as Trump has said should happen by Jan. 20, the banks would simply close many customers' accounts.Hassett's statement came in response to a question about whether bankers would be forced to comply with Trump's rate cap, a move that would probably require new legislation.  The administration has been talking with \"CEOs of many of the big banks who think that the president's onto something,\" Hassett said. A major credit card issuer and a bank lobbyist representing big lenders told CNBC that they haven't yet had any discussions with the administration about the \"Trump card\" concept.watch now",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorganChase, speaks during the Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, U.S. December 6, 2025.  Jonathan Alcorn | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to sue JPMorgan Chase over allegedly \"debanking\" him following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \"I'll be suing JPMorgan Chase over the next two weeks for incorrectly and inappropriately DEBANKING me after the January 6th Protest, a protest that turned out to be correct for those doing the protesting,\" Trump said in a social media post. \"The Election was RIGGED!\"JPMorgan and the White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.In August, Trump signed an executive order requiring banks to ensure they are not refusing financial services to clients based on religious or political beliefs, a practice known as \"debanking.\" Trump claimed in a CNBC interview in August, without providing evidence, that he was personally discriminated against by banks. He said JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office. At the time, JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons, while Bank of America said it doesn't comment on client matters. BofA also said it would welcome clearer rules from regulators on how to conduct its activities.Trump and his family have a history of railing against financial institutions for allegedly refusing to work with them on the basis of their political orientation. Last year, Donald Trump Jr. said his family had difficulty accessing big bank services — a situation that allegedly prompted the Trumps to enter the cryptocurrency industry. \"So, [my family] got into crypto, not because it was like, 'hey, this is the next cool thing,' we got into it out of necessity,\" Trump Jr. told CNBC in an interview last June.JPMorgan shares are down about 5% over the past week, even after the bank on Tuesday topped expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.Trump's legal threat against JPMorgan comes as the president, in the same Truth Social post, denied a Journal report on Wednesday that said the president had offered JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon the position of Federal Reserve chairman months ago during a meeting at the White House. Dimon took the proposition as a joke, according to the Journal report.In his post, Trump denied the report, underscoring his reservations about Dimon and JPMorgan. \"This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,\" he wrote. \"Why wouldn't The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, \"NO,\" and that would have been the end of the story.\"The Journal and JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of normal business hours. Current Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's term ends on May 15.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman visits \"Making Money With Charles Payne\" at Fox Business Network Studios in New York on Dec. 4, 2024.Mike Coppola | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Friday announced it will begin testing ads within ChatGPT in the coming weeks, a highly anticipated decision that could kick-start a lucrative new revenue stream for the artificial intelligence startup. OpenAI said its Plus, Pro and Enterprise subscriptions will not include ads, but it plans to start testing them with adult free users in the U.S. The company also made its low-cost Go offering available in the U.S. on Friday, and it said users who opt for that plan will also begin to see ads. The company inked more than $1.4 trillion worth of infrastructure deals in 2025, and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in November that the startup was on track to generate $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate last year. Introducing ads to ChatGPT could help OpenAI meet its ambitious spending commitments, as digital advertising has long been the cash cow for other big tech companies like Google and Meta. \"It is clear to us that a lot of people want to use a lot of AI and don't want to pay, so we are are hopeful a business model like this can work,\" Altman wrote in a post on X on Friday.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta's VR layoffs, studio closures underscore Zuckerberg's massive pivot to AIBig Tech is looking to energy talent to fuel its AI ambitionsPalantir is trying to 'destroy' Percepta through legal action, startup's execs say in filingMicrosoft says communities won't see energy price hikes near data centers as utility costs riseAds within ChatGPT will appear at the bottom of the chatbot's answers, and they will be clearly labeled, OpenAI said. ChatGPT's responses will not be influenced by ads, and OpenAI said it will \"never\" sell users' data to advertisers, according to a release. Users under the age of 18 will not see ads, and ads will not appear near certain topics, including politics, health and mental health, OpenAI said. Altman has publicly expressed reservations about introducing ads to ChatGPT in recent years, stating in interviews that doing so could erode users' trust in OpenAI's products. But in a November podcast appearance, Altman said he expected OpenAI to try ads \"at some point,\" though he added that he did not believe it would be the company's biggest revenue opportunity. \"We'll learn from feedback and refine how ads show up over time, but our commitment to putting users first and maintaining trust won't change,\" OpenAI said in a statement on Friday.As OpenAI tests ads, the company said users will be able to learn more about why they're seeing a specific ads, dismiss ads and submit feedback about the experience.

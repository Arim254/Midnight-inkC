    "body": "London at dawn. Dukas | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesLONDON — European stocks are expected to open broadly higher on Tuesday as investors track geopolitical developments following the U.S.' ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The U.K.'s FTSE index is seen opening 0.4% higher, Germany's DAX up 3%, France's CAC 40 0.2% higher, and Italy's FTSE MIB up 0.25%, according to data from IG. Positive sentiment looks set to continue for global markets Tuesday as global investors digest the ousting and capture of Maduro last weekend. European bourses traded higher Monday, and the U.S.' three major averages rallied following the capture of Maduro and after President Donald Trump's call for American energy giants to invest in the oil-rich nation. The 30-stock Dow closed at a record on Monday. The market moves suggest that investors this time are pushing aside fears of bigger geopolitical conflicts and remain confident in risk-on assets as the new year begins.Asian defense stocks rallied for a second straight session Tuesday, even as the region traded mixed, with investors assessing geopolitical risks after the U.S. attack on Venezuela.European data releases on Tuesday include French and German inflation data, and U.K. new car sales. — CNBC's Pia Singh contributed to this market report.

    "body": "Michael Burry attends the premiere of \"The Big Short\" at Ziegfeld Theatre on Nov. 23, 2015 in New York.Dimitrios Kambouris | Getty ImagesMichael Burry's quiet bet on Venezuelan oil is coming back into focus.The investor best known for \"The Big Short\" said he has owned Valero Energy since 2020, a position he views as increasingly attractive as the U.S. moves toward a deeper role in reviving Venezuela's oil industry.\"Realize that many Gulf Coast refineries were purpose-built for Venezuelan heavy crude,\" Burry wrote in a Monday blog post on Substack. \"So they have been running with suboptimal feedstock for years. This will, in time, produce better margins across jet fuel, asphalt, and diesel ... I have owned Valero since 2020, and I am more resolved to holding it even longer after this weekend.\"His comments came after President Donald Trump called on U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The country's oil is among the heaviest and most sulfur-laden in the world, and only a limited number of refineries are equipped to process it efficiently.Valero stands out because of its ability to process heavy crude, but Burry said smaller refiners such as PBF Energy and HF Sinclair could also benefit, even if Venezuelan oil arrives only gradually. Any meaningful recovery in exports is likely to take years.Multiple analysts on Wall Street are also highlighting Valero as the biggest beneficiary, should Venezuelan supply increase. Shares of the refiner jumped about 10% Monday. The opportunity may extend beyond refining. Venezuela's oil infrastructure has deteriorated after decades of underinvestment, creating potential demand for U.S. oilfield services companies if large-scale rehabilitation begins, Burry said.Burry said he owns Halliburton, and sees possible upside as well for Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which could be tapped to help rebuild pipelines and refineries.\"Venezuelan pipelines and refineries are old and in disrepair. This work will go to U.S. contractors,\" he said. \"Chevron is already there. Exxon and others have been litigating claims for decades and may see some justice relatively soon, if the US literally begins to run Venezuela as some have suggested. I own Halliburton, and may buy more shares or LEAPs.\"LEAPs, or long-term equity anticipation securities, are options with lengthy expiration dates that could go beyond one year.",

    "body": "Home prices are expected to rise by about 2.2% nationally in 2026, but some large U.S. cities — mostly in the Midwest and Northeast — could see prices climb much faster.That's according to a recent Realtor.com forecast, which projects \"a more balanced\" housing market as higher inventory slows overall price growth. Even so, the moderation isn't expected to be evenly felt.\"The Midwest and Northeast have maintained strong demand despite the broader slowdown, largely due to persistent inventory scarcity,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It.While many markets in the South and West are seeing price growth flatten or turn negative as new construction adds supply, cities in the Midwest and Northeast have added fewer homes in recent years, which has helped kept prices moving higher, according to Realtor.com.Here are the 11 large U.S. cities expected to see the biggest home-price increases in 2026:1. Toledo, OhioExpected 2026 price growth: 13.1%Median home price: $199,9002. Syracuse, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 12.4%Median home price: $298,9503. Scranton–Wilkes-Barre–Hazleton, PennsylvaniaExpected 2026 price growth: 10.9%Median home price: $260,0004. Rochester, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 10.3%Median home price: $256,9005. Hartford–West Hartford–East Hartford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 9.5%Median home price: $429,0006. Baltimore–Columbia–Towson, MarylandExpected 2026 price growth: 8.3%Median home price: $375,0007. New Haven–Milford, ConnecticutExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $439,0008. Winston-Salem, North CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.7%Median home price: $342,8999. Albany–Schenectady–Troy, New YorkExpected 2026 price growth: 7.5%Median home price: $419,90010. Columbia, South CarolinaExpected 2026 price growth: 7.2%Median home price: $303,30011. Milwaukee–Waukesha–West Allis, WisconsinExpected 2026 price growth: 7%Median home price: $379,000Realtor.com's metro-level forecasts are based on its own listings data, along with local inventory levels, new construction activity, employment and income trends, and mortgage rate expectations.What those projections show is that in markets where very little housing has been added, even modest demand is enough to keep prices rising — especially in smaller Midwest and Northeast cities. By contrast, in markets where construction has been heavier, home prices in some areas are expected to fall by as much as 10% in 2026.The metros with the highest expected gains \"have seen very limited new housing development, keeping supply tight,\" says Jones. At the same time, most of these cities have home prices \"well below national averages,\" she says.Overall, only three of the 11 cities on the list have median listing prices above the U.S. median of about $415,000 as of late 2025.Toledo stands out in particular for its relative affordability. The city's median home price of about $199,900 is well below Ohio's statewide median of roughly $275,000, per Realtor's data.Another factor is proximity to larger urban hubs. \"In the Northeast, demand has remained elevated as buyers seek more affordable, commutable alternatives to large, high-cost metros, such as New York and Boston,\" says Jones. \"Because new construction has lagged in many of these older, built-out Northeastern markets, supply constraints remain acute, amplifying the price impact of even modest demand growth.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., holds a news conference in the Mansfield Room in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, December 1, 2025. Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's \"seditious\" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  \"reckless misconduct\" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. \"Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, \"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action \"with everything I've got,\" and called Hegseth \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.\"\"Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,\" Kelly wrote. \"I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.\"\"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly wrote. \"Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.\"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,\" the senator said. \"It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.\"The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealedThe legality of those strikes, which were made without authorization from Congress, has been questioned.In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: \"These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.\"\"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,\" Hegseth said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"",

His hiring came amid an intensifying AI talent war, in which Meta reportedly offered $100 million signing bonuses to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models.Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the Financial Times.\"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practice research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\"Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its Llama 4 model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said.\"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added.\"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he said. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\"CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live.AI superintelligence is a 'dead end' for LLMsWhen asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\"But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\"\"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said.Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and physical data as well as language. Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a press release that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\" ",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe traditional role of an investment banker is to provide advice on deals and financings. But JPMorgan's bankers recently began noticing that clients were asking for more from the firm – like how the nation's largest bank was navigating artificial intelligence or what cybersecurity practices it used. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had an idea: formalize a group that can give certain clients access to much of JPMorgan's \"secret sauce.\" They're calling the initiative the \"Special Advisory Services,\" which launches Monday, with Liz Myers, who also serves as the global chair of investment banking, at the helm. \"These capabilities are on par or better with some of the specialized consulting firms out there,\" said Myers in an interview with CNBC. \"We think it could help C-suite executives be more effective in their roles and learn from our best practices.\" JPMorgan identified several dozen adjacent capabilities to offer clients, ranging from investor relations to real estate selection to health-care benefits to technology procurement. At the outset, the firm does not plan to charge for these services. However, if a client seeks a more time-consuming project or a service that exists on an ongoing basis, they may negotiate some sort of fee structure. The services are intended for clients that \"have, or seek to have, deep and long-term relationships with the firm,\" the company said in a press release. That cohort may include, \"companies considering JPMorgan as their lead IPO adviser, long-tenured clients preparing for transformational deals, or growing mid-sized clients looking to use JPMorgan as their primary operating bank,\" according to the release. \"More than two-thirds of our experts are internally facing people – their No. 1 job is to make sure they're delivering for our firm,\" Myers said. \"They're a precious resource, to some extent, so we have to be thoughtful about who gets it.\" Myers, a 30-year veteran of the firm, had previously served as global head of equity capital markets, and in her expanded role, she'll work with advisory teams and experts across JPMorgan. She said that in the beginning, the Special Advisory Services group will have a \"handful\" of people. And then over time, the firm may scale it if there's a sizable uptake in client demand. JPMorgan is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week. LSEG estimates that for the year through Dec. 11, JPMorgan raked in $9.44 billion in investment banking fees, making the firm No. 1 worldwide, with 7.4% of wallet share. ",

    "body": "Nearly a year ago, DeepSeek shook the AI world. Stocks of some of the leading Western tech companies plunged as the markets hit panic mode at the prospect of a new model from a relatively unheard of Chinese AI lab that challenged the premise of U.S. dominance in the space.Nvidia plummeted 17%, losing close to $600 billion from its market cap. U.S. chipmaker Broadcom also fell 17%, and ASML dropped 7% in a single day.Eleven months on, and those companies have not just recovered but continued to grow. Nvidia became the first company to hit a $5 trillion valuation in October, Broadcom's shares rose 49% across 2025, with ASML's stock increasing 36%.\"January [DeepSeek] (R1) caused a broad, visible repricing because it changed global beliefs about frontier-model cost curves and China's competitiveness, and it did so in a way that hit the semiconductor and hyperscaler narrative directly,\" Haritha Khandabattu, senior director analyst at Gartner told CNBC. Since then, DeepSeek has released seven new model updates. None have caused the kind of waves seen in January. So why haven't the markets reacted?Shock factorFounded in 2023, DeepSeek released a free, open-source large language model (LLM) in late 2024, called V3, which it said was trained with less powerful chips and at a fraction of the cost of models built by the likes of OpenAI and Google. Weeks later, in January 2025 it released a reasoning model, R1, that hit similar benchmarks or outperformed many of the world's leading LLMs. The Chinese AI lab's January release \"really surprised the market,\" Alex Platt, senior analyst at investment firm D.A. Davidson, told CNBC. \"The narrative [at the time] was that China was 9 to 12 months behind the U.S.\"watch nowThe promise of a model achieving similar results to the most advanced systems, but using less compute, raised concerns in the market that the demand for AI infrastructure would be impacted, and revenue for firms like Nvidia would be hit, Brian Colello, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC. \"Instead, we saw no slowdown in spending in 2025, and as we look ahead, we foresee an acceleration of spending in 2026 and beyond.\"There's also the type of releases DeepSeek has made since January, all of which have been updates to the V3 and R1 models as opposed to entirely new models. While DeepSeek's more recent model releases are \"credible step changes\" in efficiency and capability, the market has viewed them as a \"continuation and consolidation rather than a new shockwave,\" Khandabattu said.Limited computePart of the reason DeepSeek hasn't released a new model is likely due to limited compute, analysts told CNBC.\"Compute has been a large bottleneck,\" said Platt. \"You can only do so much algorithmic research and find so many architectural ingenuities.\"The AI company delayed the release of its R2 model, which was initially planned for May, because of challenges training it on homegrown Huawei chips, the Financial Times reported in August. Chinese authorities had encouraged DeepSeek to use the processors as it looked to reduce reliance on U.S. alternatives in the face of export controls on Nvidia's most powerful chips, the publication said. DeepSeek has been approached for comment on the report.\"China's been constrained in the amount of computing power it's been able to access over the last couple of years, in large part because of U.S. restrictions on the sale of chips,\" Chris Miller, author of \"Chip War,\" told CNBC.\"If you want to build advanced models, you need access to advanced compute.\"DeepSeek said in a research paper it released earlier this month that it acknowledges \"certain limitations when compared to frontier closed-source models\" such as Gemini 3, including compute resources. watch nowMarkets have also been reassured of continued U.S. leadership in the AI space by new advanced model releases from frontier labs in the West. In August, OpenAI unveiled GPT-5, Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5, and Google launched Gemini 3 in November. \"The competition between these providers is intense with rapid model releases and incremental improvement in capabilities,\" Gartner Analyst Arun Chandrasekaran told CNBC. \"As a result, fears of a sudden commoditization shock have eased.\"But there are signs DeepSeek is gearing up for a more significant model release in the coming months. On New Year's eve the company published a paper detailing a more efficient way of developing AI models.Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives thinks there are more shocks in the market to come. \"Some of these moments that we've seen, we'll continue to see next year,\" he told CNBC.\"There'll be another DeepSeek.\"",

    "body": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to the media ahead of a secure briefing about U.S. action in Venezuela, on Capitol Hill  in Washington,, D.C., U.S., Jan. 5, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Monday briefed congressional leaders on the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, sharpening a partisan divide over the president's authority to use force without congressional approval.Top Republicans who attended the classified briefing rallied to the president's defense while Democrats questioned the scope of the operation and pushed to halt further military action.The partisan split-screen among the lawmakers briefed, who are part of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" group authorized to receive highly classified information, underscores the difficulty Congress may face in trying to rein in President Donald Trump's military efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the raid in Venezuela \"a decisive and justified action,\" rejecting claims that Trump exceeded his authority.\"We are not at war, we do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela and we are not occupying that country,\" Johnson said. Read more CNBC politics coverageDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureDenmark tells Trump to stop threatening to seize GreenlandTrump admin pressed on pardon for ex-Honduras president after Venezuela's Maduro snatchedRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduros' ousterTrump: We are going to run Venezuela until we can do a safe transitionTrump's removal of Maduro prompts questions from CongressWatch Trump's full comments following the U.S. strike against VenezuelaU.S. indictment against Venezuela President Maduro, wife is unsealed\"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war; that is true. But it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander-in-chief,\" Johnson said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said that the briefing raised far more questions than it answered.\"The plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,\" Schumer said. \"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.\"Senate Democrats plan to force a vote later this week on a measure to suspend Trump's military action in Venezuela, known as a war powers resolution. The measure, brought by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would require Trump to cease military action in Venezuela unless Congress approves it. Kaine introduced a similar resolution in November, which the Senate rejected after only two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — supported it. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so at least four Republicans would need to break ranks for Kaine's measure to succeed. The House of Representatives would also need to approve the measure. Lawmakers there narrowly defeated a Venezuela war powers resolution 211-213 in December. \"There's real concern as it relates to congressional action connected to our sole power to declare war,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before the briefing. \"No further military action should be taken in Venezuela or anywhere else without explicit congressional approval, and we need to legislate that.\" The lawmakers were briefed by top members of the president's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The administration has labored to frame the use of the military in Venezuela as a law enforcement action, since Maduro had outstanding warrants for his arrest in the United States. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who was in the briefing, echoed that view. \"This was a law enforcement operation,\" Mast said. \"This law enforcement operation required great military capabilities … because the individual that had to be brought to justice could bring to bear an air force, a navy, an army.\" Mast said  Trump was not seeking a protracted military engagement, but did not rule out similar operations if the president deems them necessary to \"defend the homeland.\"The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, who have jurisdiction over the U.S. law enforcement apparatus, were not invited to the briefing. They are not traditionally part of the \"Gang of Eight,\" but issued a joint statement excoriating the snub. \"President Trump and Secretary Rubio have stated that this was a law enforcement operation that was made at the Department of Justice's (DOJ) request, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),\" the statement from Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., read.    \"The administration's refusal to acknowledge our Committee's indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the Committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro's arrest,\" they said. CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, Oct. 28, 2025.Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro is easier said than done. Chevron holds the advantage as the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela, according to Wall Street analysts. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the industry and seized their assets in 2007. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, at 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a long and expensive road lies ahead for U.S. oil majors to restore Venezuela to its peak production of 3.5 million barrels per day reached in the 1990s.\"It's a high-risk area for oil companies to invest in,\" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at Global Risk Management.It would require roughly $53 billion of investment over the next 15 years to just maintain crude oil production level of 1.1 million barrels per day, or bpd, according to estimates from consulting firm Rystad Energy. The capital expenditures needed to reach 3 million bpd by 2040 would more than triple, to $183 billion, according to Rystad.Certainty and stabilityU.S. oil majors will want certainty about who is charge in Caracas and how stable the government is, said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy. They will need to know whether the legal and fiscal regime will last long term because energy investments are 30-year projects, said David Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's special envoy for international energy affairs from 2009 to 2011.The situation in Caracas right now is anything but certain. Trump declared Saturday that the U.S. will run Venezuela after Maduro's overthrow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to backtrack, telling NBC News in a Sunday interview that the U.S. will use its leverage to pressure Caracas to meet U.S. demands. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has assumed power in Venezuela, pledging over the weekend that the government would defend the country's resources, but later said Caracas sought to cooperate with the U.S. A major question is whether Venezuela could return to a regime similar to Maduro's in the future and nationalize oil assets again, said Global Risk Management's Rasmussen.Surplus reserves U.S. oil majors will grapple with whether it makes financial sense to invest tens of billions of dollars in Venezuela when there is already so much oil in the world, said McNally, a former White House energy advisor under President George W. Bush. \"There are plenty of reasons to think this is going to be more of a long and winding road, rather than a quick shot,\" McNally said.Chevron maintains joint ventures with state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela through a special licensed issued by the U.S. government. Those partnerships are responsible for about 23% of Venezuela's output, according to JPMorgan. \"The company would be in an advantaged position to potentially scale future output as they have significant oil resources in place through their JVs and have been a key developer of the country's energy infrastructure,\" JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients in a Monday note. Chevron shares climbed more than 5% Monday. — CNBC's Hayley Cuccinello contributed to this report. ",

They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter and are contacting impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination,\" the statement read.Most of the more than 9,000 properties affiliated with Hilton and its brands are operated by franchisees.Everpeak Hospitality, the company that operates the Hilton-branded hotel in question, also released a statement.\"Everpeak Hospitality has moved swiftly to address this matter as it was inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all,\" the statement said. \"We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted.  We are committed to welcoming all guests and operating in accordance with brand standards, applicable laws, and our role as a professional hospitality provider.\"CNBC has reached out to DHS for comment.In September 2020, during the first Trump administration, Hilton issued a statement saying that it opposed the use of its hotels for the purpose of detaining migrants, including minors. That statement came two months after Hilton said it had confirmed reports that an independently owned and operated Hampton Inn & Suites in McAllen, Texas, had accepted reservations from a private contractor working on behalf of U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement to house migrants, including minors.\"This is not activity that we support or in any way want associated with our hotels,\" Hilton said in July 2020. \"Our policy has always been that hotels should not be used as  detention centers or for detaining individuals. We expect all Hilton properties to reject business that would use a hotel in this way.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, in a tweet on Dec. 29, said, \"Homeland Security Investigations @ICEGov are on the ground in Minneapolis right now conducting a massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud. More coming.\"A federal prosecutor in Minnesota last month said that about $9 billion or more that has been paid through more than a dozen Medicaid programs in the state since 2018 may have been fraudulently obtained.CBS News reported Monday that \"The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota.\"\"The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations,\" CBS reported.— CNBC's Jim Forkin contributed to this article.",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Nov. 24, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk will start rolling out the first-ever GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S. on Monday, the company announced, marking a new chapter of obesity treatment in the U.S. The drug's cash prices are among the lowest on the market, ranging from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose. That fuels hopes that pills could help address the long-standing affordability hurdles tied to the weekly injections dominating the weight loss drug market. The official launch of the oral drug, called the Wegovy pill, comes just two weeks after U.S. regulators cleared the treatment. The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. The higher, remaining doses of the pill will be available to patients by the end of the week, Novo Nordisk said. Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability \"opens new possibilities\" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. Pills are the next battleground for the two companies, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite.\"This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care,\" said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions. ",

    "body": "Nvidia is building out an automotive tech business. Pictured here are its autonomous vehicle test cars at the company's auto garage in Santa Clara, California, June 5, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia on Monday said it is working with robotaxi operators in hopes of having them use the company's AI chips and Drive AV software stack to power their fleets of autonomous vehicles as soon as 2027.Around that time, the chipmaker said that it hopes to power partner deployment of \"Level 4\" robotaxis, meaning vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in pre-defined regions, Xinzhou Wu, Nvidia's vice president of automotive, said at a self-driving demonstration in San Francisco last month.\"We will probably start with a limited availability but work with the partner for us to get our footing,\" Wu said. Since 2015, Nvidia has offered chips and other technology for cars under the Drive brand name, but that remains a small part of the company's business. Automotive and robotics chips accounted for just $592 million in sales in the quarter ended in October, or about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with Uber in October.The chipmaker said in December that it had developed software that can power a self-driving car and that Mercedes-Benz models to be released in late 2026 will be able to use Nvidia's technology to navigate cities like San Francisco.Self-driving cars remain one of the primary areas where Nvidia can show growth outside of AI infrastructure. CEO Jensen Huang has said that robotics — including self-driving cars — is the company's second most important growth category after artificial intelligence.\"We imagine that someday, a billion cars on the road will all be autonomous,\" Huang said at a launch event on Monday at the CES conference in Las Vegas. \"You could either have it be a robotaxi that you're orchestrating and renting from somebody, or you could own it.\"In addition to chips that go inside self-driving cars, Nvidia sells access to its famed AI chips as well as its simulation software to automotive companies so they can train self-driving models and develop technology. Nvidia says that car makers can use its Drive AGX Thor automotive computer, which costs about $3,500 per chip, to save on research and development costs and get self-driving features to market faster. Nvidia said it works with car makers to tune its technology, such as determining how hard the car should accelerate, for specific vehicles. \"Some say, 'Hey, I need your help on training and optimizing my software on your chip, but I'll take care of simulation myself,'\" said Ali Kani, general manager of Nvidia's automotive platform.Car companies, like Mercedes-Benz, want to tune Nvidia's technology, market it as part of its in-car experience and sell it as part of or alongside a new car. Robotaxis have caught on in the past year, led by Alphabet's Waymo, which is operating a commercial taxi service without drivers in five U.S. markets, including San Francisco. Nvidia's robotaxi announcement signals that it is targeting self-driving fleets in addition to personal cars that consumers can buy.watch nowRiding an Nvidia self-driving vehicleIn December, Nvidia offered reporters and analysts an hourlong ride through San Francisco in a 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan. While my car had a safety driver employed by Mercedes-Benz behind the wheel, the driver said that the car was driving itself for 90% of the ride. The drive was uneventful. San Francisco is a tricky city to drive in, with big hills, frequent red lights and trucks unloading in the middle of streets, but I never felt stressed and could focus on holding a conversation. But there was one major snag: The driver took control during a thorny situation where two buses and a self-driving Waymo were trying to pass in a four-lane road with street parking that also had trucks on both sides unloading goods. The driver had to back the car up and wait for the jam to clear. Nvidia said my drive was \"Level 2 Plus Plus,\" which means that its technology has features similar to Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode. Nvidia-powered cars like the Mercedes-Benz will have increasing self-driving capabilities, but the responsibility of keeping everyone safe still falls to the driver, who must pay attention at all times. The chipmaker said the system would eventually be able to do \"park-to-park,\" meaning it can drive from a starting parking space to another, but the Mercedes-Benz CLA cars won't come with that feature to start. \"Any parking situation that you feel is intimidating, that car will solve for you,\" said Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius at an Nvidia event on Monday. The Mercedes-Benz model that Nvidia demonstrated was launched last year in Europe, but it's launching in the U.S. this year, Kani said. The Mercedes-Benz cars were rolled out with lane keep and driver assistance features to help drivers stay in their lanes, Kani said. The vehicles received a lane-switching feature through a software update and will get hands-free highway driving, urban driving and park-to-park features this year.Nvidia said that it is using two AI systems in Drive-powered cars to ensure safety. The car mostly drives with an \"end-to-end\" system, called a vision-language model, that uses AI to decipher visual sensors and chart a path. The chipmaker said it also built a second, safety-oriented \"stack\" that uses strict rules — such as stopping at a stop sign — to take over when the AI is unsure about what to do. Still, Nvidia hopes that recent advances in generative AI — driven by the company's graphics processing units — will allow self-driving algorithms to become more capable. Nvidia is targeting 2028 for point-to-point self-driving features in consumer cars. Eventually, Nvidia said it wants to make the car itself feel like an actual driver that the users can simply speak to. \"With transformers and generative AI, we can do much more,\" Wu said. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described Nvidia's plans for working with robotaxi partners.",

Bernd von Jutrczenka | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesAsian defense stocks rallied for a second straight session Tuesday, even as the region traded mixed, with investors assessing geopolitical risks after the U.S. attack on Venezuela and capture of ousted leader Nicolas Maduro.Japanese defense firm Kawasaki Heavy Industries rose almost 6%, while IHI added 3.66%. Shares of South Korea's Korea Aerospace jumped as much as 11% before paring gains to trade over 9% higher, while Poongsan jumped more than 8%. Hanwha Aerospace climbed 0.99%.Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 1.32% to end the trading day at 52,518.08, while the Topix advanced 1.75% to close at a new record high of 3,538.44. South Korea's Kospi was up 1.52% to 4,525.48, and the small-cap Kosdaq declined 0.16% to 955.97.Australia's ASX/S&P 200 slid 0.52% to 8,682.8. Australian steelmaker BlueScope Steel surged more than 20% after it was confirmed that conglomerate SGH had submitted a non-binding indicative offer alongside American steel producer Steel Dynamics to acquire the company. The deal would value BlueScope at about $9 billion.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 1.22%, while the mainland CSI 300 rose 1.55% to 4,790.69.Singapore's benchmark STI rose as much as 0.7% to a fresh record high. Singapore banks capped 2025 with another record year, as earnings came in stronger than expected and helped financial stocks rise more than 20% despite bouts of market volatility, said OCBC analysts on Tuesday. Looking ahead to 2026, bank profits are expected to hold steady even as lending margins ease, supported by strong wealth inflows and healthy returns on equity. However, the bank cautioned that risks remain. Singapore's market is dominated by mature, value-heavy companies, which limits its exposure to the faster growth typically seen in technology stocks. A regional slowdown—particularly in China—would weigh on external demand, while a spike in oil prices, given the still-fluid situation in Venezuela, could push up operating costsU.S. equity futures were flat in early Asian hours.Overnight in the U.S., stocks rose even after the U.S.′ attack on Venezuela, as crude oil prices advanced and investors bet the action would not lead to broader geopolitical conflict.The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 594.79 points, or 1.23%, to close at 48,977.18. The 30-stock index also hit a new all-time high in the session. The S&P 500 advanced 0.64% and ended at 6,902.05. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.69%, settling at 23,395.82.— CNBC's Liz Napolitano, Fred Imbert and Sean Conlon contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Victoria Beckham, formerly Posh Spice of the Spice Girls, is known for her healthy habits and discipline when it comes to wellness.Since entering the spotlight three decades ago, the fashion designer's daily practices for peak health have evolved. While her diet remains consistent—fresh fish, vegetables, nuts, and seeds—her exercise routine and priorities have shifted now that she is in her 50s.Here are four ways Beckham's wellness routine has changed from the early 2000's to now.4 ways Victoria Beckham's wellness routine has changed1. She's more flexible with her diet\"I do try to be quite disciplined in the way that I eat,\" Beckham said on the BBC Radio program \"Gordon Ramsay's Perfect Christmas Lunch\" in 2006 at age 32.At the time, she prioritized a \"really healthy\" diet of fish, vegetables and fruit — and still does, she said. But these days Beckham is less rigid.\"I'm flexible with regards to food,\" Beckham told Net-a-Porter in 2020. \"My treat is a few glasses of red wine, and I also love tequila, and I do eat carbs. I have lots of avocado and really good fats, like salmon.\"2. She added weight training to her workoutsOver a decade ago, Beckham set a new year's resolution to start going to the gym, she told The Guardian in 2014. \"I've never stopped. Once I get into something, I do it properly,\" she said.Back then, she would exercise for 90 minutes with a trainer, attend SoulCycle classes and run often, sometimes for eight miles. By 2023, her workout routine looked much different.\"I usually workout every morning prior to beginning my day and recently incorporated strength training into my routine which has been a fun way to switch up my regime,\" Beckham said in an interview with Harper's Bazaar.The following year, she shared that weight training at 50 made her feel \"stronger than I did when I was 20.\"3. Sleep is key for her self care nowIn 2013, Beckham's three sons were still in school and her daughter was just one. Beckham started her days between 6:15 and 6:30 a.m., and would fall asleep sometime between midnight and 1 a.m., she told Harper's Bazaar that year.At the time, she was getting between five and six hours of sleep a night. \"I like to get as much sleep as I can. But when you're a mummy, you kind of—well, it would be nice,\" Beckham said.Ten years later, she told the publication that her best advice for self care was developing a healthy sleep routine.\"Creating healthy sleep habits is incredibly important; it's become a key part of my self-care practice,\" she said.\"I've been working on incorporating less screen time and more mindfulness into my routine, which means putting my phone away before bedtime.\"4. Wellness shots and green smoothies are a staple in her routineBeckham also gets plenty of nutrients and vitamins from her daily beverages.Earlier this year, Vogue covered Beckham's morning routine based on stories shared to her personal Instagram account. The first thing she consumes every morning is apple cider vinegar, \"a couple of tablespoons on an empty tummy,\" she said.Then, she and her husband David Beckham have their green smoothies which include:BroccoliSpinachCucumberCeleryAvocadoAppleGingerLemonAfter a workout, Beckham has another smoothie with berries, bananas, apples and almonds. She rounds out her morning with a wellness shot of lemon, black pepper, fresh ginger and turmeric. \"One shot a day!!\" she said.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Amina AlTai has always been a high achiever.As a child of immigrants, she was told to \"keep your head down, work really hard, and if you do that, you'll have everything you want,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Her early career looked \"great on paper,\" she says: AlTai opened her own marketing agency in her late 20s, and says she was \"achieving all the milestones\" of success.At the same time, she was overworking herself to the point of illness, she says. One day, while driving to a client meeting, she got a call from her physician. \"My doctor called to say that if I don't go to the hospital now, instead of going to work, I'll be days away from multiple organ failure\" due to severe anemia, AlTai says.In hindsight, the moment was \"such a wake-up call,\" she says — but instead of heading straight for the hospital, AlTai first attended her client meeting.She says she was subsequently diagnosed with celiac disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, both of which were exacerbated by exhaustion.\"My workaholic tendencies and painful relationship to success were — quite literally — killing me,\" AlTai, now 41, wrote in her recent book, \"The Ambition Trap: How to Stop Chasing and Start Living.\"Today, AlTai is a leadership coach who teaches her clients how to protect their wellbeing and practice healthy ambition. \"So many of us are working ourselves into pain and suffering,\" she says — but it doesn't have to be that way. Here's her advice for building a healthy mindset around ambition.'Painful' versus 'purposeful' ambitionThough AlTai's unhealthy relationship with ambition caused her to \"crash and burn,\" she says, it doesn't mean that being driven is inherently a bad thing.\"I think ambition is neutral and natural,\" she says. She defines it as \"simply a desire for more life, a wish to grow, a wish to unfold.\"In AlTai's view, people tend to experience ambition in two ways, she says: \"painful\" ambition and \"purposeful\" ambition.Painful ambition, which AlTai defines as \"the voracious desire to advance, regardless of the cost,\" stems from a feeling of \"not-enoughness,\" she writes in \"The Ambition Trap.\" From a psychological perspective, painful ambition is based in emotional \"core wounds\" like rejection, abandonment, humiliation, betrayal and injustice, she says.\"If you build your ambition upon that, it's going to be a bit of a house of cards,\" AlTai says, \"because we're perpetually looking for the salve on the outside for the wound on the inside, and that never works.\"On the other hand, purposeful ambition \"comes from a place of wholeness,\" she says. People who practice purposeful ambition are driven by a desire to make a positive impact, AlTai says. They excel at collaborating with others, protect their needs and approach their mistakes with a growth mindset.Self-awareness is the key to turning painful ambition into purposeful ambition, according to AlTai. She encourages her clients to journal about their thought patterns without self-judgement, taking note when they fall into unhealthy mindsets.Habits for healthy ambitionIn order to stay in the zone of healthy ambition, one essential practice is \"honoring your energy,\" AlTai says. That means making time for the things that nourish you, from nutrition and exercise to spending time with loved ones.Without taking care of ourselves, \"it's really hard to show up fully,\" AlTai says. From a career standpoint, honoring your energy could mean designing your work week around the times you're most productive, taking walks in between meetings or blocking off certain times on your calendar to allow uninterrupted focus.Another important habit is to \"celebrate your wins,\" she says. As a leadership coach, AlTai noticed a pattern among many of her \"really ambitious\" clients: They were \"always moving the goalpost,\" she says.Instead of taking time to enjoy their successes, her clients immediately started working toward their next goal. That mindset makes it \"very tricky\" to feel satisfied with your accomplishments, according to AlTai.AlTai encourages taking time to rest after reaching a major milestone. \"In those quiet moments, you take inventory, you take stock, you see what worked, what you loved, what you didn't love, what you would do differently, and then you rise again,\" she says.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "It's natural to want to comfort a child when they're crying. When parents see their kid hurting physically or emotionally, they often want to do anything in their power to stop their heartache. As a dual certified child life specialist and therapist, I've heard parents and even health care workers telling kids \"don't cry\" while wiping away their tears during medical procedures and other difficult moments. It comes from a place of wanting to fix the hurt and make it all better. But it can make kids feel like their emotions and tears aren't okay, especially when they're in pain or distress. Instead, try to validate kids' feelings and help them feel safe and supported expressing their emotions and tears. Use these five alternatives:1. 'It's okay to cry, I'm here with you.'This helps kids know and believe that their experience is real and it's natural. Staying with kids through their stress conveys the message that their feelings don't scare you, that you can handle the difficult moments with them, and that they can rely on you for real-time support, even when it's hard or uncomfortable. 2. 'I see your tears.'You may not always know exactly why a child is crying or understand their reaction to the situation. Validation doesn't necessarily mean agreement; it means, \"I see you and I believe you.\" One way to validate their experience is to simply reflect back what you're seeing. Naming their emotion can be helpful for some kids, but for others it can be upsetting if your label doesn't match what they're truly feeling. Try naming their behaviors or using a more encompassing term such as \"upset.\"3. 'Your feelings make sense.'If kids hear, \"don't cry,\" they might interpret that their response doesn't match the situation, when in fact, it often does. We want kids to trust their feelings and to know that their tears make sense for what they're experiencing, whether it's pain, fear, or isolation. Sometimes the behaviors will be out of proportion with the situation, but the underlying feelings are never wrong. 4. 'It's natural to feel sad.'Parents often want their kids to feel happy, but it's natural to feel a range of emotions including difficult or uncomfortable ones. The goal is not to stop the emotion but to help kids acknowledge and manage it. Helping kids understand that crying is not bad — and that it's perfectly natural to feel sad, angry, lonely, or frustrated sometimes — reduces a sense of shame from any negative experiences. 5. 'Crying is one healthy way our bodies let feelings out.'Lastly, it's important for kids to understand that crying is a very healthy way to release emotions. Crying is coping and so is coloring, playing, talking, running, listening to music, and breathing. You can help kids try different strategies and find the ones that work best for them. Use tears as a chance to meet kids where they're at and help them work through challenges with confidence and connection. Kelsey Mora is a Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "Living alone with a $2,000 housing budget may be nearly impossible in some major cities — but in others you may be able to afford up to three bedrooms.Across the U.S., the average rent for a studio apartment listed on Apartments.com in October was $1,699 a month, and a two-bedroom space had an average rent of $1,887 per month, according to data collected and analyzed by Apartments.com in a November report. Of the 25 most populous cities in the U.S., New York, Boston and California cities San Francisco, San Diego and San Jose were the most expensive. Average rent for a studio apartment in these cities was over $2,000 in October, according to data from Apartments.com shared with CNBC Make It.With $2,000, you could get an average of 267 square feet in New York City, or one-third the size of a pickleball court, according to a normalized estimate from October listings. Compare that with Oklahoma City, the most affordable of the most populous cities, where $2,000 is worth about 1,900 square feet — more than two pickleball courts. While this data offers a useful benchmark for comparison across cities, it isn't necessarily indicative of the size of any single apartment a renter is likely to encounter. In reality, apartment sizes and prices can differ within the same city due to various factors, and renters should keep that in mind, the authors of the report said.Here's where $2,000 in rent would get you the least space in the 25 most populous cities in America:New York, N.Y.: 267 square feetBoston, Mass.: 336 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.: 340 square feetSan Diego, Calif.: 458 square feetSan Jose, Calif.: 427 square feetHere's where $2,000 in rent would get you the most space in the 25 most populous cities in America: Oklahoma City, Okla.: 1,900 square feetEl Paso, Texas: 1,762 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.: 1,676 square feetColumbus, Ohio: 1,633 square feetSan Antonio, Texas: 1,517 square feetHere's how much space you could get for $2,000 a month in all 25 of the most populous U.S. cities as of October.New York, N.Y.Unit type: N/A Average size for $2,000: 267 square feetLos Angeles, Calif.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 530 square feetChicago, Ill.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 679 square feetHouston, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,443 square feetPhoenix, Ariz.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,230 square feetPhiladelphia, Pa.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 772 square feetSan Antonio, TexasUnit type: Three BedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,517 square feetSan Diego, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 458 square feetDallas, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,154 square feetJacksonville, Fla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,453 square feetFort Worth, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,305 square feetSan Jose, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 427 square feetAustin, TexasUnit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,186 square feetCharlotte, N.C.Unit type: Two bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,235 square feetColumbus, OhioUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,633 square feetIndianapolis, Ind.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,676 square feetSan Francisco, Calif.Unit type: N/AAverage size for $2,000: 340 square feetSeattle, Wash.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 534 square feetDenver, Colo.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 852 square feetOklahoma City, Okla.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,900 square feetNashville, Tenn.Unit type: One bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 863 square feetWashington, D.C.Unit type: StudioAverage size for $2,000: 512 square feetEl Paso, TexasUnit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,762 square feetLas Vegas, Nev.Unit type: Three bedroomAverage size for $2,000: 1,354 square feetBoston, Mass.",

    "body": "Signage at the Microsoft campus in Mountain View, California, US, on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesConcerns about the steep valuations of artificial intelligence (AI) stocks and a questionable outlook for an interest rate cut in December weighed on investor sentiment in recent trading sessions. For now, however, Nvidia's solid earnings last week seemed to undermine the idea that everything tied to AI investment is in a bubble.Investors looking to capitalize on the recent selloff and pick up some attractive stocks for the long term can track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. These experts can help provide key insights into a company's growth potential.Here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.MicrosoftWindows and Xbox owner Microsoft (MSFT) is viewed as one of the major beneficiaries of the AI boom. Last month, the company reported better-than-expected results in its fiscal first quarter, with revenue from the Azure cloud business growing by 40%.Recently, Baird analyst William Power initiated coverage on Microsoft with a buy rating and a price target of $600. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also optimistic on MSFT, giving it an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $628.\"Microsoft is leading the AI revolution with infrastructure and applications, aided by its OpenAI relationship, providing an end-to-end AI platform for enterprises and consumers alike,\" said Power, explaining his optimism.Power sees MSFT's partnership with ChatGPT parent OpenAI as a key differentiator, helping it run AI at scale and speed. The 5-star analyst said that after a commitment to invest $13 billion, Microsoft recently announced an incremental $250 billion Azure investment over several years.The analyst discussed the impressive growth in MSFT's total revenue and Azure business in the September quarter, with the cloud business now constituting 60% of the overall top line. Power also highlighted the strength in Microsoft's core applications, including Microsoft 365, LinkedIn and Dynamics. He noted that MSFT's revenue growth in Q1 FY26 was accompanied by a solid operating margin of 49% and free cash flow margin of 33%. Microsoft's strong margins are ensuring continued double-digit EPS growth, he said.Power believes in Microsoft's near- and long-term potential, despite any immediate pressure stemming from AI capital spending concerns.Power ranks No. 287 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 57% of the time, delivering an average return of 17%. See Microsoft Ownership Structure on TipRanks.Booking HoldingsOnline travel agent (OTA) Booking Holdings (BKNG) is another pick this week. The Priceline and Kayak owner posted impressive third-quarter results, with double-digit gains in gross bookings and revenue.Impressed by the Q3 performance and attractive valuation, Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt upgraded BKNG to buy from hold with a price targe of $6,000. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on Booking Holdings with a price target of $5,406.\"Booking remains the best-positioned OTA in our view,\" benefiting from several positives, from the company's scale and diversification to solid liquidity to free cash flow conversion, Devitt said.The top-rated analyst also noted management's impressive history of successfully executing major strategic initiatives. Devitt highlighted Booking Holdings' widening market share in alternative lodging while optimizing costs and driving efficiencies. The company's cost savings are supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives to achieve longer-term targets, he said.Additionally, Devitt discussed Booking's impressive growth across key metrics in the third quarter amid better-than-anticipated global travel demand. Third-quarter gross bookings growth of 14% surpassed management's guidance by 400 basis points, the analyst said. ASs a result, Devitt raised his 2025 gross bookings growth estimate by 100 basis points from his prior forecast, to 11.5%. Further, he expects BKNG to report adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year margin expansion of about 180 basis points.Devitt ranks No. 660 among more than 10,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 50% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.3%. See Booking Holdings Financials on TipRanks. DoorDashDevitt also upgraded his rating for food delivery platform DoorDash (DASH) to buy from hold with a price target of $260. TipRanks' AI Analyst rates DoorDash \"neutral\" with a price target of $211. DASH shares took a hit when the company announced mixed third-quarter results and said it expects to spend \"several hundred million dollars\" on new initiatives and development in 2026.Devitt believes that the pullback in DASH shares presents an attractive risk/reward opportunity, with the stock now trading at about 17.7x his 2027 adjusted EBITDA estimate. The Wedbush analyst noted that the post earnings selloff was mainly due to concerns about the level of capital spending and pressured profit margins.Devitt admits that the higher level of spending will hurt near-term margins, but argues such investments in growth initiatives are warranted given that they'll expand DASH's addressable market and bolster its product offerings.Specifically, Devitt highlighted management's plans to direct incremental investments toward three key areas: \"(1) creating a cohesive global tech platform, (2) building new verticals and products, and (3) scaling geographic expansion.\"Overall, Devitt is bullish on DoorDash, believing it has held a dominant position in the U.S. food delivery sector. Moreover, he noted the company's solid execution across strategic initiatives as management pushes for long-term sustainable growth. See DoorDash Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump offered praise for New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani on Friday after the two men met for the first time at the White House to discuss the growing issue of affordability.While the Republican president and the Democratic mayor-elect have hurled searing attacks at each other in the recent past, they repeatedly shrugged off those words while appearing side by side in the Oval Office. At one point, when Mamdani was asked for the second time about having called Trump a \"fascist,\" the president gave him cover.\"That's OK, you can just say yes,\" Trump said after Mamdani began to respond. \"It's easier than explaining it.\"Trump also appeared to backtrack on his prior threat to withhold federal funding for New York City if Mamdani became its mayor. \"I don't think that's going to happen,\" Trump said.Instead of rehashing their feud, they talked up their areas of agreement on broad issues, especially focusing on lowering the cost of living.But they also found common ground on some more specific matters, such as getting NYC-based energy giant Con Edison to lower prices. \"We've gotten fuel prices way down, but it hasn't shown up in Con Edison, and we're going to have to talk to them ... to start lowering the rates,\" Trump said. \"Absolutely,\" Mamdani added.U.S. President Donald Trump and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani speak to members of the media as they meet in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 21, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersTrump gave more praise than Mamdani returned, but the two did trade some compliments.\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" Trump said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"\"I appreciated the meeting with the president,\" said Mamdani, who stood while Trump sat at the Resolute Desk. \"And as he said, it was a productive meeting focused on a place of shared admiration and love, which is New York City and the need to deliver affordability to New Yorkers.\"The conciliatory tone was brand new. Mamdani had laced into the president on the campaign trail and in his electoral victory speech, saying, \"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him.\"And just two days earlier, Trump had called Mamdani the \"Communist Mayor of New York City.\" The mayor-elect is a self-described democratic socialist who denies being a communist.The Oval Office meeting was requested by Mamdani, the 34-year-old whose stunning triumph in the mayoral race over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has put him at the center of American politics.\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than eight-and-a-half million people who call the city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.Mamdani and other Democrats who won a bevy of elections this month had focused relentlessly on affordability — a word that Trump has chafed at, while insisting that prices are broadly down already.Meanwhile, the president's approval ratings have fallen precipitously in numerous polls, with respondents consistently pointing to the high cost of living as a main concern.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.     ",

It also outpaces the debut of last year's \"Wicked,\" which tallied $112.5 million in the U.S. and Canada.The film's haul sets the record for the biggest opening weekend of a Broadway adaptation. With additional ticket sales from international markets, \"Wicked: For Good\" is set to reach a $226 million global haul for its first three days in theaters.\"Team Universal did a fantastic job of following perfectly on the success of the original film a year ago and have parlayed that into an even bigger debut for this second installment,\" said Paul Degarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore. \"'Wicked: For Good' will look forward to incredibly strong playability throughout Thanksgiving week and beyond during the all-important holiday movie-going season.\"Last year, the combination of \"Wicked,\" Paramount's \"Gladiator II\" and Disney's \"Moana 2\" helped boost the Thanksgiving holiday box office to its highest haul ever. This year, \"Wicked: For Good\" is joined by Disney's \"Zootopia 2.\"The first \"Zootopia\" opened in 2016 to $75 million domestically but went on to gross more than $1 billion worldwide. Pent-up audience demand could push the film's three-day opening to around $100 million and the five-day Thanksgiving period to north of $125 million. \"The impressive expected over-performance by 'Wicked: For Good,' in combination with the other films in the marketplace, could give last year's record Thanksgiving literally a run for its money,\" Dergarabedian said. \"This is great news after all the negative stories about the challenging October box office drove the narrative.\" This story is developing.

    "body": "U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) salutes former U.S. President Donald Trump during a rally in Commerce, Georgia, U.S. March 26, 2022. Alyssa Pointer | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Saturday reacted to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's surprise resignation announcement, saying, \"Marjorie went BAD.\"Trump once again called the Georgia Republican a \"traitor,\" referencing Greene's alliance with Republican Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, who sponsored the bill demanding the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files by the Justice Department.Greene, who had been a close ally of Trump for years, cited backlash from the president over her advocacy for the bill in her statement, saying that her last day in the House of Representatives will be Jan. 5. \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Brown, because of PLUMMETING Poll Numbers, and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!), has decided to call it 'quits' \" Trump wrote early Saturday in a Truth Social post.\"Her relationship with the WORST Republican Congressman in decades, Tom Massie of Kentucky, also known as Rand Paul Jr. because he votes against the Republican Party (and really good legislation!), did not help her,\" Trump said.\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" he wrote.\"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country.\"Trump had opposed the bill ordering the release of the Epstein files until the last minute. This week, the bill passed the House in a nearly unanimous vote and passed the Senate unanimously. The president then signed it into law.Trump spoke with NBC News later Saturday morning about Greene, saying, \"It's not going to be easy\" for her to have a future in Republican politics.\"I would like to see it,\" Trump told NBC.\"She's got to take a little rest,\" he said.\"I can patch up differences with anyone,\" Trump said when asked if he believes he can reconcile with Greene.Trump last week said he would support \"the right person\" if they challenged Greene in the Republican primary next year for her seat representing Georgia's 14th District.In her resignation statement on Friday night, Greene wrote, \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family too much, and do not want my sweet  district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while  Republicans will likely lose the midterms.\"\"And in turn, be expected to defend the President against impeachment after he hatefully  dumped tens of millions of dollars against me and tried to destroy me,\"  Greene said.\"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and  gets better.\"\"Standing  up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and  threatened by the President of the United States of America, whom I fought for.\"",

    "body": "Short of a cash windfall, saving for a down payment on a home can take years — and in some U.S. states, it may take decades.A new analysis from ConsumerAffairs estimates how long it would take to save a 10% down payment in every state by comparing each state's median household income with its median home price, along with median tax burdens and essential living costs.In Iowa, it would take about 8.7 years to save enough for a 10% down payment, the fastest of any state. In California, the estimate is 25.1 years — longer than any other state. Across all 50 states, the average timeline is 14.4 years, according to the study.These timelines rely on what the study calls \"fractional saving,\" which assumes a household sets aside 10% of its discretionary income each year. That approach was chosen because \"that's how people really save,\" Dayna Edens, media relations manager at ConsumerAffairs, tells CNBC Make It. \"Nobody's setting aside every spare penny for a down payment on a house they're not even shopping for yet.\"A 10% down payment was also chosen over the commonly recommended 20% as a more realistic target for first-time buyers, says Edens.Here's a look at the 10 states where it would take the least amount of time to save up a 10% down payment on a home, based on each state's median income, median home price and estimated household savings.1. IowaTime to save: 8.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,501Median home price: $247,4002. OhioTime to save: 9.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $72,212Median home price: $261,7003. TexasTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $79,721Median home price: $339,4004. MarylandTime to save: 10.3 yearsMedian annual household income: $102,905Median home price: $439,3005. North DakotaTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $77,871Median home price: $298,2006. KansasTime to save: 10.6 yearsMedian annual household income: $75,514Median home price: $292,6007. OklahomaTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $66,148Median home price: $252,9008. IllinoisTime to save: 10.7 yearsMedian annual household income: $83,211Median home price: $303,3009. AlaskaTime to save: 10.9 yearsMedian annual household income: $95,665Median home price: $402,80010. IndianaTime to save: 11.0 yearsMedian annual household income: $71,959Median home price: $276,000The key factor in affordability is home price. All but one of these states have median home prices below the national median of $410,800, per U.S. Census data.In eight of the 10 states, median household income is roughly in line with the national median of $83,730, per U.S. Census data. The shorter timelines largely reflect lower home prices, not unusually high earnings.That pattern holds in many higher-income states as well. In places where median household income exceeds six figures, such as California and Hawaii, the timelines tend to run longer than in states with lower-cost homes. In those states, high living costs, especially housing, can offset the advantage of higher wages.Annual taxes and essential expenses also influence how much discretionary income households can save. Tax burdens vary by roughly $15,000 from state to state, and the annual cost of necessities ranges from the mid-$20,000s to the low-$40,000s, according to the study.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Cambridge Dictionary named \"parasocial\" as Word of the Year for 2025.Francesco Carta Fotografo | Moment | Getty ImagesAI chatbots, Taylor Swift, and social media influencers all played a part in deciding Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year, 2025: \"parasocial.\" Parasocial — revealed by the global dictionary on Tuesday as its word of the year — refers to the connection a person feels to an online personality ranging from celebrities to podcasters, and even artificial intelligence. \"Parasocial relationship is when we think we know someone, or we feel very close to someone who's in fact, a person we've never met, like a celebrity, an influencer, or somebody in public life who's famous for some reason,\" Simone Schnall, professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, told CNBC Make It. \"In reality, of course, it's only a one-sided, so-called relationship,\" she added. The term originated in 1956 when University of Chicago sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl found that people who watched television were treating the actors on-screen like friends or family. Schnall explained that the \"phenomenon\" is well-known in our culture, but it's only now that people are using the term more commonly. \"It's been there forever, but I think in our culture, we now see parasocials on steroids, simply because there are so many opportunities for it. There are so many people who, for whatever reason, we can be interested in and fascinated by, inspired by,\" she said. One example is singer and billionaire Taylor Swift who has an intense global fanbase due to her relatable songs. Many of her fan report having a deep, emotional connection with her and keep up with her personal life and romantic relationships. Other examples include social media influencer and Youtuber Logan Paul who has around 27 million followers on Instagram and 23 million subscribers on YouTube. In 2018, Paul posted a video showing a deceased person in Japan's Aokigahara \"suicide forest,\" sparking global outrage. Many of his die‑hard fans defended him, showing fierce loyalty despite the seriousness of the content. Paul later apologized for the video. Schnall warned there are \"dangers\" in following celebrities and social media influencers who might share incorrect medical advice, sell bad products, or promote unethical behaviour.  \"They [influencers] could do some serious harm to their followers. The people who feel they're in that parasocial relationship, they could really be harmed by that,\" Schnall warned. AI chatbots and loneliness culture Cambridge Dictionary referenced that part of the increasing popularity of the word \"parasocial\" stems from relationships being formed with AI chatbots. A 2025 report by Common Sense Media, which surveyed 1,060 U.S. teens, found that 72% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 had used an AI companion at least once. This was for a range of reasons from emotional or mental health support or as a friend or best friend. \"They're called chatbots because we feel like we're chatting with someone already,\" Schnall said. \"People can develop certain relationships, like a friendship or even romantic relationship, or at least, that's how they feel about it, when of course in reality, there is no one else involved.\" And it's not just teens. A recent survey by Vantage Point Counselling of over 1,000 American adults found that 28% said they have had a romantic or intimate relationship with an AI. Schnall offered two reasons why people are turning to parasocial relationships: a global loneliness epidemic and increased screentime. On phones and screens, parasocial relationships are \"just a click away\" so it's easier to get immediate social approval. Meanwhile, chatbots are designed to flatter you, per Schnall. \"People tend to be more lonely than in previous generations, and they spend so much time on their screens where these parasocial relationships are very easy to establish,\" she said.The antidote, Schnall said is investing in real-life relationships because the more time you spend online, the less time you spend pursuing in-person connections. \"The more time I spend chatting with a chatbot, the less time I probably spent chatting with a real life person,\" she added.

However, the overall unemployment rate edged up to 4.4%, and for younger workers, ages 16 to 24, unemployment was 10.4% in September. The current job market \"is an enormous challenge for members of Gen Z who are just now entering the labor force,\" a report published this week by Oxford Economics says.

Although college graduates are still less likely to be unemployed than their non-degree counterparts, the advantage is smaller than it's been in decades. Job market worsens for recent gradsFor recent college graduates, the cracks are starting to show. Some large employers have said they're replacing entry-level workers with artificial intelligence in order to streamline operations and cut costs. Concerns about the economy, persistent inflation and a slowdown in consumer spending are also likely contributors to an erosion of entry-level opportunities, other research shows.Although members of the Class of 2025 submitted more job applications than did their 2024 counterparts — 10 and six, respectively — they received fewer job offers on average than did the previous class, with mean numbers of .78 and .83, respectively, the National Association of Colleges and Employers found. NACE's study, conducted April 1-May 30, 2025, surveyed 1,479 graduating seniors.According to a report by education technology company Cengage Group, in its  survey conducted in June and July 2025 only 30% of 2025 graduates said they had secured a full-time job in their field and only 41% of the Class of 2024 said they had done so. The survey included 971 recent graduates across the U.S.\"These workers are a vital part of the labor market, and if they're having a hard time, that means the economy could be having a hard time,\" said Indeed's Stahle.The market for 2026 graduates could be as bad or worse. Employers are less optimistic about the overall job market for upcoming grads than they were in the last several years, according to a separate report by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. About half, or 51%, of employers rated the job market for this year's college seniors as poor or fair, the highest share since 2020-21.'A long-term scarring impact'A weak labor market can have a negative effect on younger workers' economic well-being over time, particularly in terms of wage growth and earning potential, according to Oxford's report.\"Unemployment is rising and wage growth is declining for young adults, which could have a long-term scarring impact,\" said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics and author of the report. \"If these workers have a hard time getting into jobs now ... that also impacts their earning capabilities,\" Stahle said. \"You start to add these things together and it really can lead to further widening in income inequality.\" \"There are big economic implications down the road,\" he said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

The busiest days are expected to be the Sunday after Thanksgiving, with about 3.4 million people flying, followed by the Monday after Thanksgiving, with around 3.1 passengers.Airline executives have expressed relief after the longest-ever government shutdown ended Nov. 12. Shortages of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular pay, delayed and canceled flights, disrupting travel plans for some 6 million people, A4A said.The industry is now pushing lawmakers to pass legislation to ensure that air traffic controllers are paid in the case of another shutdown, with executives complaining in recent weeks about air travel becoming a political bargaining chip. The latest bill funds the government only through January, so industry members are hoping to avoid a repeat of the closure just before winter break and spring break seasons begin.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

    "body": "A worker repairs a power line in Austin, Texas, U.S., on Wednesday, Feb. 18, 2021.Thomas Ryan Allison | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe rapid expansion of data centers in Texas is driving electricity demand higher during the winter, compounding the risk of supply shortfalls that could lead to blackouts during freezing temperatures. The Lone Star state is attracting a huge amount of data center requests, driven by its abundant renewable energy and natural gas resources as well as its business friendly environment. OpenAI, for example, is developing its flagship Stargate campus in Abilene, about 150 miles west of Dallas-Forth Worth. The campus could require up to 1.2 gigawatts of power, the equivalent of a large nuclear plant. The North American Electric Relibaility Corporation warned this week that data centers' round-the-clock energy consumption will make it more difficult to sustain sufficient electricity supply under extreme demand conditions during freezing temperatures like catastropic Winter Storm Uri in 2021. \"Strong load growth from new data centers and other large industrial end users is driving higher winter electricity demand forecasts and contributing to continued risk of supply shortfalls,\" NERC said of Texas in an analysis published Tuesday. Texas faces elevated risk during extreme winter weather, but the state's grid is reliable during normal peak demand, NERC said. During Uri, demand spiked for home heating in response to the freezing temperatures at the same time power plants failed in large numbers due to the same weather. Texas grid operator ERCOT ordered 20 gigawatts of rolling blackouts to prevent the system from collapsing, according to a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission report. The majority of the power plants went offline ran on natural gas. It was the \"largest manually controlled load shedding event in U.S. history\" resulting 4.5 million people losing power for several days. At least 210 people died during the storm. Most of the fatalities were connected to the outages and included cases of hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and medical conditions exacerbated by freezing termperatures, according to FERC. Data center requests surgeIn the years since Uri, Texas has received a staggering amount of requests from data centers, crypto mining facilities and industrial customers seeking a grid conenction. More than 220 gigawatts of projects have requested connection as of this month, a 170% increase over the 83 gigawatts of project requests back in January, according to data published Wednesday by ERCOT. About 73% of the projects requesting connection are data centers, according to ERCOT. If all of those projects were actually built, they would be equivalent to the average annual power consumption of nearly 154 million homes in Texas, according to a CNBC analysis based on 2024 household electricity data. But the Lone Star state only has a population of about 30 million people.Beth Garza, a former head of ERCOT's watchdog, said she is very skeptical these projects will all get built, describing the scale of the numbers as \"crazy big.\" More than half the projects have not submitted planning studies, according to ERCOT.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, who served as director of ERCOT's Independent Market Monitor from 2014 through 2019. \"There's just so much stuff in the world to make those kinds of numbers work.\" Phantom data centers are showing up in grid connection requests across the U.S. as developers shop the same projects around to mutliple jurisdictions, said John Moura, the director of NERC's reliability assessments. This makes it difficult for utilities to forecast future demand conditions. watch nowReliability at riskThe projects that ERCOT has approved to actually connect to the grid is much smaller at 7.5 gigawatts, but this is still a subsantial amount of new demand. By comparison, the six county region in southeastern Pennsylvania that includes Philadelphia, with a population of 1.7 million people, had a peak demand of about 8.6 gigwatts in 2024, according to the state utility board. Texas' supply and demand balance can become tight during winter and potentially fall into deficit. The state has 92.6 gigawatts of available resources and peak demand in an extreme Uri-like scenario could reach about 85.3 gigawatts, according to NERC. But avalaible power could fall to around 69.7 gigawatts in extreme winter weather, leaving a supply deficit of more than 15 gigawatts. This is due to typical power plant maintainence and forced plant outages as well as reductions in power capacity due to winter conditions.\"What's important to understand is the tightness we're seeing,\" Moura said. NERC's winter assessment only included data center facilities that have reached certain milestones to filter out speculative projects, he said.\"I can't stress enough how much of a monumental change this is for the electric industry,\" Moura said of the data center requests. One solution is for data centers to show flexibility in their electricity consumption to help keep demand and supply in balance during extreme winter scenarios, he said. In the case of Uri, natural gas plants made up 58% of all the unplanned outages in Texas, according to FERC. Freezing tempartures reduced gas production, led to challenges delivering fuel and problems transmitting electricity as power lines fell. Texas has adopted rules to harden natural gas infrastructure for extreme winters in the wake of the storm. When gas plants go out in such a large way, solar and battery storage also face challenges, according to NERC. Peak demand in winter is in the early morning hours when sunlight is lower and batteries may not have had enough time recharge, Moura said. With data centers running around the clock, \"maintaining sufficient battery state of charge will become increasingly challenging for extended periods of high loads, such as a severe multi-day storm like Winter Storm Uri,\" NERC said in its analysis. \"Power shortfalls and rolling outages really could happen in the next few years in certain regions\" of the U.S. as demand from facilities like data centers outstrips supply, said Rob Gramlich, president of power consulting firm Grid Strategies. \"Those are unacceptable to everybody in the United States.\" Garza said she's confident that the reliable demand from data centers will bring new supply. \"Plants love that kind of of opportunity,\" she said. \"My expectation is that then attracts additional private capital investment to meet those supply needs.\"",

    "body": "Daniel Gray and his husband, Douglas, and their dog.Courtesy: Daniel GrayOn Oct. 23, the day after Daniel Gray's 56th birthday, he received an email that made him feel like he was dreaming: The U.S. Department of Education would forgive his more than $170,000 student loan balance.\"I could not believe it,\" Gray said. \"This is the first time I've been without debt since I'm 18.\"Yet the relief should not have been so surprising. Gray began paying his student loan debt in the 1990s and was eligible for the loan cancellation under the terms of his income-driven repayment plan. IDR plans lead to loan erasure after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. But, like many borrowers, Gray was worried by reports that the relief was becoming harder to access under the Trump administration. \"Because of what's been going on, it was unclear whether they'd get forgiven,\" Gray said. Recently, many student loan borrowers have been left doubting if they'll get the loan cancellation to which they're entitled, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. \"When borrowers worry about whether the Trump administration will renege on the student loan forgiveness promised by the federal government, it places them under extreme financial and emotional stress,\" Kantrowitz said. The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment. Loan forgiveness becomes uncertain under Trump Earlier this year, the Education Department stopped forgiving the debt of borrowers in two long-standing student loan repayment plans, the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, or ICR, and the Pay As You Earn plan, or PAYE. It also temporarily paused debt forgiveness under the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. More than 12 million student loan borrowers are enrolled in one of the Education Department's IDR plans, according to Kantrowitz.  But then, in October, there was a major victory for borrowers: The Trump administration agreed to resume clearing people's debts under ICR and PAYE, as a result of a lawsuit brought by the American Federation of Teachers. That same month, eligible borrowers enrolled in IBR also began to see their debts canceled again. The AFT contended that Trump officials were blocking borrowers from their rights mandated in their loan terms. \"We cannot say for sure, but it is possible that the AFT lawsuit prompted the discharge,\" said Weena Sanchez, a student loan counselor at the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, a nonprofit, about Gray's student loan forgiveness. EDCAP worked with Gray on his request for the relief. Gray had earned the loan cancellation by May 2024, according to his loan forgiveness statement. \"We've heard of other clients receiving similar notices,\" Sanchez said.

The Trump administration announced this week that it will transfer much of the Education Department's programs to other agencies, a move experts say is part of President Donald Trump's directive to dismantle the agency. Education Department officials are also exploring options to sell portions of the $1.6 trillion federal student portfolio to the private market, Politico reported in October.A lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain. Mark Kantrowitz higher education expert Whatever changes lie ahead, it's important for borrowers to remember that the original terms of their student loans, spelled out in their Master Promissory Note, cannot change in the middle of repayment, Kantrowitz said. When borrowers signed that agreement, any programs that were in existence at the time, including repayment plans that conclude in loan forgiveness, must remain available to them, by law.Since student loans can't be discharged in normal bankruptcy proceedings, like other types of debt, borrowers \"depend on there being a light at the end of the tunnel,\" with the government's forgiveness, Kantrowitz said.\"When a low-income student is forced to borrow to pay for college, a lifetime vow of poverty should not be part of the bargain,\" he said. Student loan forgiveness 'the only way out' For some 30 years, Gray says his student loan debt weighed on him. He graduated in the mid-1990s from the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a degree in film studies and began working technical jobs in video and television production. But in the following years, he says, he grappled with substance abuse issues and clinical depression. As a result, his career took a hit, and Gray struggled to keep up with his monthly student loan payment, he said. Originally, he borrowed roughly around $30,000, but his balance steadily grew due to interest charges. \"This system is designed for students to graduate, get good jobs and start paying,\" Gray said. \"But what about for those of us who don't get our lives together until we are 37 or 38?\" By then, he said, his debt was already nearing six figures. By the time his debt was canceled by the government in October, his balance had spiraled to more than $170,000. \"I couldn't believe I had allowed it to get to this point; I felt incredibly guilty and ashamed,\" Gray said, but he also \"felt like the whole situation was engineered to take advantage of the borrower.\"  In 2011, Gray got a job offer at a television studio in Brazil. Frustrated with the cost of living in the U.S. and hoping for a major change, he made the move to São Paulo. He's lived in Brazil ever since. He met his now-husband, Douglas, a chef, there. The couple live close to the beach and take their dog for long walks every day.The biggest change Gray has felt since his student debt was wiped away is psychological: \"I suddenly feel like I can relax,\" he said. \"It's easy for people to say, 'Why don't people just pay them off? What's the big deal?\" Gray said, about his student loans. But he went on: \"It reached a point where it was beyond control. It seemed impossible. Student loan forgiveness is the only way out for a lot of people.\"",

Ryan Murphy | ReutersAir traffic controllers and technicians with perfect attendance during the government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonuses, the Department of Transportation and Federal Aviation Administration said this week.The bonuses will go to 776 controllers and technicians, who will receive notification next week with payments going out by Dec. 9, the FAA and DOT said. There are about 11,000 fully certified air traffic controllers in the U.S., according to their union.\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a release late Thursday.The DOT and FAA didn't immediately say whether preplanned vacation time or fatigue calls would disqualify controllers and technicians from the bonus.An increase in absences of air traffic controllers, who were required to work without their regular paychecks during the more than 40-day shutdown, the longest ever, forced airlines to slow or cancel flights. The shutdown ended Nov. 12 with a bill to fund the government through January.The shutdown's disruptions and additional strain on air traffic controllers, many of whom are already required to work six-day weeks, sparked an outcry from the aviation industry, which urged lawmakers to ensure critical workers aren't left without pay if there's another shutdown.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

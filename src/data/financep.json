    "body": "Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer, speaking on Squawk on the Street at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 20, 2026.Oscar Molina | CNBCPfizer on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter results that topped estimates even amid dwindling demand for its Covid products, while reaffirming its modest 2026 guidance that rattled investors in December.The pharmaceutical giant is looking to longer-term investments in its pipeline, including its $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera, to counter waning Covid product sales and declines from older drugs. Pfizer moved to show the promise of that investment Tuesday, when it also reported mid-stage data showing that an obesity injection from Metsera can be taken once a month and drive solid weight loss. In addition, Pfizer is on track to cut costs by about $7.7 billion by the end of 2027 as part of two separate initiatives. Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: 66 cents adjusted vs. 57 cents expectedRevenue: $17.56 billion vs. $16.95 billion expectedPfizer reported revenue of $17.56 billion for the fourth quarter, down around 1% from the same period a year ago. That is largely because of lower demand for its Covid vaccine and Paxlovid, an antiviral pill for the virus. The company booked a net loss of $1.65 billion, or 29 cents per share. That compares with net income of $410 million, or 7 cents per share, during the same period a year ago. Excluding certain items, including restructuring charges and costs associated with intangible assets, the company posted earnings per share of 66 cents for the quarter.Pfizer expects 2026 adjusted profit to come in between $2.80 and $3 per share, and revenue to total $59.5 billion to $62.5 billion. Those sales would largely be flat compared to 2025 revenue. Pfizer previously said the lackluster revenue outlook comes in part from declining sales of its Covid vaccine and antiviral pill Paxlovid, which it expects to fall by about $1.5 billion year-over-year to $5 billion. The company also pointed to another roughly $1.5 billion year-over-year expected drop in sales due to certain products losing their market exclusivity. Some blockbuster drugs, such as the company's pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, are facing more competition from rivals.In December, Pfizer CFO Dave Denton told investors there is also \"price compression and margin compression baked into\" the company's 2026 guidance as it plans to provide \"deeper discounts\" in its Medicaid business as part of a landmark drug pricing deal struck with President Donald Trump. Under that agreement, Pfizer agreed to sell its existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed countries and guarantee the same \"most-favored-nation\" pricing on its new drugs for Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payers. In return, the company will get a three-year exemption from tariffs. Pfizer's Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR, treatments for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions, were selected in January for the third round of Medicare drug price negotiations. New negotiated prices will take into effect in 2028. ",

    "body": "Packages of  Pepsi are displayed on a store shelf on Oct. 9, 2025 in San Anselmo, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesPepsiCo on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations, fueled by improving organic sales across its business.Demand for the company's snacks has been sluggish as consumers balk at higher prices. This year, Pepsi plans to lower prices on products from its North American food division to \"improve competitiveness and the purchase frequency of our brands,\" executives said in prepared remarks. Productivity savings will offset the lower prices, they said.Shares of the food and beverage giant fell more than 1% in premarket trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.26 adjusted vs. $2.24 expectedRevenue: $29.34 billion vs. $28.97 billion expectedPepsi reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to the company of $2.54 billion, or $1.85 per share, up from $1.52 billion, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring and impairment charges and other items, the company earned $2.26 per share.Net sales rose 5.6% to $29.34 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out foreign currency, acquisitions and divestitures, increased 2.1% in the quarter.\"PepsiCo's fourth quarter results reflected a sequential acceleration in reported and organic revenue growth, with improvements in both the North America and International businesses,\" CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement.However, the company is seeing volume declines, particularly for its North American businesses. The metric excludes pricing and foreign exchange fluctuations to reflect demand more accurately. Global volume for its food fell 2% in the quarter, although global volume for its drinks ticked up 1%.Pepsi's home market was once again the weak point of the quarter, although it is showing signs of improvement. Inflation-weary shoppers have been buying less of Pepsi's snacks and drinks in a sign of consumer backlash agianst higher prices.PepsiCo Foods North America, which spans brands from Quaker Oats to Cheetos, reported that volume fell 1%. PepsiCo Beverages North America, which includes Gatorade, Starry and Poppi, saw volume shrink 4%, though its organic sales rose 2%.Pepsi also reiterated the outlook for 2026 that the company provided in December. The company is projecting that organic revenue will rise between 2% to 4% and core constant currency earnings per share will increase in a range of 4% to 6%.In December, Pepsi struck a deal with activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which had revealed a roughly $4 billion stake in the company two months earlier. As part of the agreement, Pepsi said it would slash its U.S. product lineup by 20%, cut costs across its food and beverage operations and lower snack prices. Elliott did not receive any seats on Pepsi's board.As Pepsi implements that plan this year, the company is projecting that its North American business will improve, while its international divisions remain \"resilient,\" according to Laguarta.",

    "body": "Palantir surged 11% in premarket trading on Tuesday after beating Wall Street's fourth quarter estimates amid rising spending on AI tools from governments and businesses. The shares popped after it reported $1.41 billion in revenue, ahead of LSEG estimates of $1.33 billion. The earnings came after a muted end to 2025 — November was Palantir's worst month in two years amid a broader decline in software stocks over fears of an AI valuation bubble. The stock ultimately rose 135% in 2025 but, at Monday's close, was down 17% year-to-date.CEO Alex Karp told CNBC's Morgan Brennan that the earnings were \"the best results that I'm aware of in tech in the last decade.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPalantir stock over the past yearThe company creates software and data tools for businesses and government agencies like the Department of Defense, the Internal Revenue Service. and the Department of Homeland Security. Karp noted that the adoption of its tools by the U.S. government saw year-on-year 66% year-on-year revenue growth.Palantir signed a software contract worth up to $10 billion with the U.S. Army in July, and a $448 million deal with the U.S. Navy to accelerate shipbuilding production in December.\"Although Palantir's valuation is still frothy, it appears more reasonable relative to recent venture rounds for companies tied to the AI ecosystem,\" said Louie DiPalma, analyst at William Blair, in a note on Monday ahead of the earnings. DiPalma said the firm expected Palantir's operating margin to increase from 50% to 65% over the next five years as it increased government and defense contracts.The company has seen its work with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) come under scrutiny in recent weeks, after federal agents shot two protestors in Minneapolis.",

Critical Metals advanced 5%, USA Rare Earth rose 4.3%, and MP Materials gained 3.5%. Shares of Energy Fuels were 4% higher, while Idaho Strategic Resources popped 6.2% and NioCorp Developments rose nearly 3%.The moves come after Trump on Monday outlined details for Project Vault, a first-of-its-kind strategic minerals reserve designed for the U.S. private sector.The plan is set to pool $2 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, Trump said in the Oval Office. \"For years, American businesses have risked running out of critical minerals during market disruptions. Today, we're launching what will be known as Project Vault, to ensure that American businesses and workers are never harmed by any shortage,\" Trump said.\"We don't want to ever go through what we went through a year ago — although it did work out,\" he continued. \"Just as we have long had a strategic petroleum reserve and a stockpile of critical minerals for national defense, we're now creating this reserve for American industry, so we don't have any problems,\" Trump said. Rare earths have come to the fore as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies. Regional composition of rare earths and permanent magnet production in 2024, according to data compiled by the International Energy Agency.IEATo be sure, China is the undisputed leader of the critical minerals supply chain, responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing. A subset of critical minerals, rare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table that have an atomic structure that gives them special magnetic properties. These materials are vital components to a vast array of modern technologies, from everyday electronics, such as smartphones, to electric vehicles and military equipment.From an industry perspective, it is critically important to see the U.S. taking \"decisive steps\" to shore up minerals and rare earths, said Wade Senti, president of Florida-based magnet maker Advanced Magnet Lab. \"But looking ahead, what is even more critical will be putting these minerals to use in permanent magnets that power the technologies of the future—from EVs to humanoid robots,\" Senti told CNBC by email. \"Innovative permanent magnet technology can perform with a large variety of different critical minerals—not just neodymium—giving America more optionality and tools in supply chain security,\" he added.— CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersMerck on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped estimates on strong demand for its cancer immunotherapy Keytruda and some newer products. But the company posted a modest 2026 outlook that fell short of Wall Street's expectations as it prepares for a few drugs to lose patent protection later this year and face generic competition. That includes Type 2 diabetes drugs, Januvia and Janumet, and Bridion, a treatment that helps restore muscle function that was blocked during surgery. While those medicines aren't top-selling products like Keytruda, their combined lower sales will likely pressure the company. The pharmaceutical giant anticipates its 2026 revenue will come in between $65.5 billion and $67 billion. Analysts expected revenue of $67.6 billion, according to LSEG. Merck also expects adjusted earnings to come in between $5 and $5.15  per share. That compares to analysts' estimate of $5.36 per share, according to LSEG.That range includes a one-time charge of roughly $9 billion, or around $3.65 per share, related to Merck's acquisition of Cidara, a biotech company that is developing a flu prevention drug. The guidance includes \"manageable impacts\" from the drug pricing deal Merck struck with President Donald Trump in December, as well as his administration's recent move to pare back the pediatric vaccine schedule in the U.S., according to a company spokesperson.Under that \"most favored nation\" deal, Merck will voluntarily sell its existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and guarantee that pricing for new medicine, among other efforts. In exchange, Merck will get a three-year reprieve from tariffs.Here's what Merck reported for the fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $2.04 adjusted vs. $2.01 expectedRevenue: $16.4 billion vs. $16.19 billion expectedThe company posted net income of $2.96 billion, or $1.19 per share, for the quarter. That compares with net income of $3.74 billion, or $1.48 per share, for the year-earlier period. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, Merck earned $2.04 per share for the fourth quarter.Merck raked in $16.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 5% from the same period a year ago.The results come as Merck slashes $3 billion in costs by the end of 2027, and prepares to offset revenue losses from the upcoming patent expiration of Keytruda in 2028. Keytruda drives growth amid Gardasil woesMerck's pharmaceutical unit, which develops a wide range of drugs, booked $14.84 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter. That's up 6% from the same period a year earlier.Sales of Keytruda topped $8.37 billion for the quarter, rising 7% from the same period a year ago. Analysts were expecting revenue of $8.35 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates. The increase in Keytruda revenue was driven by higher uptake of the drug for earlier-stage cancers and strong demand for the treatment for metastatic cancers, which spread to other parts of the body, the company said. Sales of the more convenient subcutaneous version of Keytruda, which won approval last year, came in at $35 million during the fourth quarter. That version of Keytruda is key to Merck's efforts to offset likely declines in revenue after the original formulation of the drug, which is administered intravenously, goes off patent. Meanwhile, Merck's newer drug Winrevair, which is used to treat a rare, deadly lung condition, recorded $467 million in sales for the quarter, up 133% from the same period a year ago. Analysts had expected the medication to bring in $459 million, according to StreetAccount estimates. The growth of Winrevair, which first entered the market in mid-2024, largely reflects higher uptake in the U.S. and its early launch in some international markets.Merck continued to see trouble with China sales of Gardasil, a vaccine that prevents cancer from HPV, the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S.In February, Merck announced it would halt shipments of Gardasil into China beginning that month. In July, CFO Caroline Litchfield said the company would not resume shipments to China through at least the end of 2025, noting that inventories remain high and demand is still soft.Gardasil generated sales of $1.03 billion for the quarter, down 34% from the same period a year ago due to lower demand in China. Still, that was in line with what analysts were expecting, according to StreetAccount.Gardasil's revenue could face more pressure in 2026. As part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's changes to the pediatric vaccine schedule, the agency said that children should get one dose of the HPV vaccine instead of the two to three doses recommended on the label.Merck's animal health division, which develops vaccines and medicines for dogs, cats and cattle, posted nearly $1.51 billion in sales, up 8% from the same period a year prior. The company said that reflects higher demand across all species. ",

    "body": "Smith Collection | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPfizer on Thursday said its experimental obesity drug, which it acquired through Metsera, drove solid weight loss when taken once a month in a mid-stage trial. Patients with obesity or who are overweight lost up to 12.3% of their weight compared with placebo at week 28 in the ongoing phase two study. The injection's weight loss was up to 10.5% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations.The company said no plateau was observed after patients transitioned to monthly dosing, which suggests that continued weight loss is expected as the study continues through week 64.The data offer early evidence that the injection can be administered less frequently than existing drugs without sacrificing efficacy, which could be a major boost for Pfizer. It's trying to enter a market dominated by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk's weekly injections, with a strong new entrant in Novo's daily pill.Pfizer plans to advance 10 phase three trials on the injection, called PF'3944,  this year. \"These topline results ... reinforce the potential of PF'3944 as a monthly treatment with competitive efficacy,\" said Dr. Jim List, Pfizer's chief internal medicine officer, in a release. Pfizer announced the results on the same day it posted fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that topped expectations.The company's injection is an ultra-long-acting GLP-1 drug, meaning it is engineered to remain active in the body for longer than existing treatments like Novo's Wegovy. Pfizer is developing it as both a weekly and a once-monthly injection, as well as in combination with other treatments that target different gut hormones. In the trial, patients started on weekly injections of the drug before gradually switching to once-monthly dosing.The drug was generally well tolerated by patients, with most gastrointestinal side effects reported as mild or moderate. That's consistent with other GLP-1 drugs. Pfizer said there were no new safety issues, and only a small number of patients discontinued treatment due to side effects.In a separate mid-stage trial last year, Metsera said the highest dose of the injection demonstrated weight loss of up to 14.1% on average after 28 weekly doses.

    "body": "A guard walks past the National Stock Exchange building in Mumbai, India, on February 9, 2018.Danish Siddiqui | Reuters India's benchmark Nifty 50 stock index closed 2.5% higher on Tuesday, paring some gains from market open, after New Delhi and Washington announced a long-awaited trade deal that saw a sharp cut in U.S. tariffs on Indian exports.U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday stateside said that U.S. will cut reciprocal tariff on India to 18% from 25%. He added that India will reduce its tariff and non-tariff barriers against the U.S. to zero. The U.S. had levied 50% tariffs on India, including a 25% duty for purchasing Russian oil, but Trump's announcement only mentioned cutting \"reciprocal\" tariffs causing some confusion. Reuters, however, reported citing sources that the overall tariff had been reduced to 18%. Trump said that during his call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India agreed to stop buying Russian oil and instead \"buy much more\" from the U.S.Modi, in his post on X, said that \"made in India\" products will now face reduced tariffs of 18% in the U.S. while extending support for U.S. president's efforts to usher global peace, stability and prosperity. At the beginning of 2025, India was expected to be among the first countries to sign an agreement with the U.S. and the lack of an \"explicit deal\" created a \"rift between India's robust macros and the weak performance of different asset classes,\" Citi Research said in its report on Tuesday.The reduction in tariffs has come in \"materially better than consensus expectations,\" said Trideep Bhattacharya, president, equities, at Edelweiss Asset Management.\"When combined with the recently concluded India–EU trade agreement, this potentially represents one of the strongest external growth stimuli for the Indian economy in 2026,\" she added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNifty 50 performance so far this yearGains in the Nifty, which had opened 5% higher, were led by Adani Enterprises,  up 10.6%, and Adani Ports, up 9.2%, and Jio Financial Services, up 8.1%.  Indian equity market was among the weakest performers in emerging countries as foreign investors exited in record numbers, with the Nifty gaining a little over 10% last year. In dollar terms, given the decline in the rupee, markets underperformed even more. The MSCI India index [dollar] gained just 4.29% in 2025 as compared to MSCI Emerging Markets index that rose 33.57%. The rupee was Asia's worst performing currency in 2025, hurt by the absence of a trade deal with the U.S., India's largest export market, and persistent outflows in foreign funds. Following the announcement of the deal, the rupee strengthened 1% and was last trading at 90.26 per dollar.\"This breakthrough is unequivocally positive\" for exports, sentiments and financial markets, Radhika Rao, senior economist and executive director at DBS Banks said, adding that \"domestic markets are expected to witness a relief rally,\" as high tariffs were a key drag on sentiment in the past quarter.The Nifty Auto index ended the day 2.8% higher while the banking and information technology indices closed higher by 2.4% and 1.4% respectively. The Nifty Realty index ended up 4.8% and pharma index gained 3%. However, the fast-moving consumer goods index was up just 0.4%.",

Gold futures in New York gained more than 6%, hovering at around $4,936.60 as of 4:48 a.m. ET.Spot silver rose over 9% to settle at around $86.70 per ounce. Silver futures in New York were up 12% at $86.49. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGold and silver prices rebound after steep selloffThe moves marked a slight recovery from a decline on Monday that came after a fall of nearly 10% for gold on Friday, and a 30% collapse in silver prices that marked the metal's worst one-day performance since 1980. Mining stocks and exchange-traded funds listed across the globe also notched gains, as the metals continued to rise Tuesday. In Europe, the regional Stoxx 600 Basic Resources index — home to the continent's most valuable mining firms — jumped more than 2% on Tuesday morning. London-listed mining giants notched gains in early trade on Tuesday, with Rio Tinto up 2.2%, Anglo American up 3.8%, and Antofagasta jumping 3.5%. Fresnillo — the world's leading silver producer and the top performing stock on London's FTSE 100 in 2025 — was last seen trading 4.6% higher.In U.S. markets, the ProShares Ultra Silver ETF was last seen trading 16.1% higher ahead of the opening bell, while the abrdn Physical Silver Shares ETF gained around 8.5%. The iShares Silver Trust (SLV) — which has been at the center of a retail investment frenzy — gained 8.6% by 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning.Shares of U.S.-listed gold and silver miners were also significantly higher. Endeavour Silver jumped 9.2% in pre-market trading, while Coeur Mining added 9.4%. Hecla Mining and First Majestic Silver were both up more than 8%.Will the gold and silver rally continue?The rebound came as investors reassessed whether the rout signaled a structural turning point or an exaggerated reaction to short-term catalysts.Strategists at Deutsche Bank said history suggests it is short-term catalysts, even as the scale of the sell-off has raised fresh questions about market positioning. The bank said that while signs of elevated speculative activity have been building for months, they are insufficient on their own to explain the magnitude of last week's move.\"The adjustment in precious metal prices overshot the significance of its ostensible catalysts. Moreover, investor intentions in precious (official, institutional, individual) have not likely changed for the worse.\"The sell-off was triggered by a combination of factors, including a rebound in the U.S. dollar, shifts in expectations around Federal Reserve leadership following President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Fed chair, and position-trimming ahead of the weekend.Deutsche Bank said the broader investment case for gold and silver remains intact.\"Gold's thematic drivers remain positive and we believe investors' rationale for gold (and precious) allocations will not have changed. The conditions do not appear primed for a sustained reversal in gold prices, and we draw some contrasts between today's circumstance and the context for gold's weakness in the 1980s and 2013.\"Barclays struck a similar tone, acknowledging overheated technicals and stretched positioning, but said that the broader \"bid\" for gold can remain resilient amid geopolitical and policy uncertainties and reserve-diversification themes.Silver's whipsaw has been more dramatic, reflecting its smaller market, higher volatility and heavier retail participation. However, some analysts still maintain a bullish case for the white metal.\"Speculative positioning has definitely played a role in the short term. Silver has attracted more retail participation than gold and that makes it that much more sensitive to fast-moving sentiment and short-term trading,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro.Wong, however, added it may be \"too simplistic\" to attribute the entire move to speculation. Silver has genuine industrial demand, particularly tied to areas linked to data centers and AI infrastructure. A study published in January projected that global silver demand will surge this decade, driven largely by solar photovoltaics and the shift to more silver-intensive cell technologies. Total demand is forecast to reach 48,000 tonnes to 54,000 tonnes a year by 2030, while supply is expected to rise only to about 34,000 tonnes, meaning just 62%-70% of demand would be met.The solar sector alone is seen consuming 10,000-14,000 tonnes annually, or up to 41% of global supply.\"That demand hasn't gone away. What we're seeing here is silver running ahead of itself, which is something it has always done during strong phases,\" said Wong.",

    "body": "Michele Bullock, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), speaks during a news conference at the bank's head office in Sydney, Australia, on Tuesday, Apr. 1, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAustralia's central bank raised its policy rate by 25 basis points to 3.85% on Tuesday, marking the Reserve Bank of Australia's first rate hike since November 2023 as inflation continues to climb. The Reserve Bank of Australia's move matched expectations from economists polled by Reuters and followed data showing inflation at its highest level in six quarters.  The board voted unanimously to lift the cash rate, marking a reversal in direction after delivering three rate cuts in 2025. \"Private demand is growing more quickly than expected, capacity pressures are greater than previously assessed and labour market conditions are a little tight,\" according to the central bank's statement, noting that inflationary pressure picked up \"materially\" in the second half of last year.   \"Inflation is now expected to stay above the target band well into next year before gradually coming back down,\" said Sunny Nguyen, head of Australia economics at Moody's Analytics. Resilience in the global economy despite higher U.S. tariffs, along with export momentum from East Asian economies fueled by the artificial intelligence boom, has created a \"double-edged sword\" for the RBA, Nguyen said.The forces have reduced the drag on domestic growth, but also limited the \"natural cooling in an already overheating economy,\" she added.Australia's annual consumer inflation rose 3.8% in December, edging up from 3.4% in the prior month. Housing costs, led by electricity bills, were the largest contributor to annual inflation over the preceding 12 months, as the state electricity rebates were used up by households. watch nowSenior RBA officials have repeatedly pushed back against expectations of rate cuts. Earlier this year, Reserve Bank of Australia Deputy Gov. Andrew Hauser said the likelihood of near-term rate cuts was \"probably very low,\" citing persistently high inflation. The central bank has an inflation target of 2.5% Gov. Michele Bullock echoed that stance after the bank's rate decision on Dec. 9, saying interest rate cuts were not on the horizon for the foreseeable future.When asked at the time if the bank would consider further increases, Bullock said that the bank would assess economic data on a \"meeting-by-meeting\" basis.\"If inflation continues to be persistent and looks like it is not coming back down towards the Board's target... the Board might have to consider whether or not it's appropriate to keep interest rates where they are or in fact at some point raise them,\" she said. Australia's economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter, up from a revised 2% in the previous quarter and marking its fastest pace of expansion in about two years. ",

Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Switch has become Nintendo's best-selling console of all time, nearly nine years after its release. The device's importance to the Japanese gaming giant cannot be understated. Ahead of the Switch's release in March 2017, Nintendo was coming off the back of a flop with the Wii U, with its share price having declined in the years prior. Since the Switch's release, Nintendo has more than tripled its valuation with its brand arguably becoming more popular than ever.\"The company was in shambles after the previous console flopped hard, so the Switch marks a major turnaround in Nintendo's long history,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, told CNBC. \"It could have not come at a better time.\"The gaming giant said Tuesday that lifetime sales of the Switch now total 155.37 million units, surpassing the record of 154.02 million units that was held by the Nintendo DS, the company's most popular console. In third place sits the iconic Gameboy with 118.69 million units sold. Switch timing keyBefore the Switch came the ill-fated Wii U which Nintendo hoped would be as successful as the innovative Wii console. The Wii, released in 2006, was known for its handheld motion controllers that allowed users to mimic playing sports such as tennis.Nintendo sold more than 100 million units of the Wii. But the WiiU, released in 2012, sold just 13.56 million units. Some critics say confusing marketing over the console was to blame. Others say that it was facing intense competition from Sony's PlayStation 4. A Nintendo Wii U touch-screen controller displaying the \"Super Mario Bros.\" gameAkio Kon | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBut the Wii U gave some hint for what Nintendo was going to attempt next. The company had employed a strategy of separate handheld consoles and those that hook up to a TV. The Switch in 2017 blurred the lines. It was a console that gamers could play on a large screen, but users can also attach controllers to a portable screen and continue gaming on the go.\"What is fundamental is that with the Switch's form factor — a innovative hybrid console offering both a handheld and TV console experience — Nintendo took the decision to combine its historic dual product strategy into a single product line,\" Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at Ampere Analysis, told CNBC.\"This had the impact of combining its handheld and TV console audiences, thus laying the foundation for a new level of success from a single product.\"watch nowThe timing was important. Nintendo's base of young casual gamers was being tempted by an onslaught from popular mobile games, and the Switch enabled Nintendo to counter that.\"Switch reinvigorated Nintendo's console business after mobile gaming rose to prominence to eat 3DS and Wii U's lunch,\" James McWhirter, senior analyst at Omdia, said.  What drove Switch's popularityThe Switch was a new concept when it was launched in 2017, combining a traditional console and handheld. Nintendo's success with the Switch stemmed from its ability to leverage its in-house console design and first-party games based on its most popular franchises and characters.\"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe\" was the most popular title with more than 70 million units sold. \"Animal Crossing: New Horizons\" and a slew of games based on Super Mario and friends, Zelda and Pokemon, made the rest of the best-seller list. The Switch also saw increased interest during the Covid-19 pandemic when people were stuck at home and looking to video games for entertainment. And just when it looked like interest may fade, the Super Mario movie in 2023 helped to breathe fresh life into the console. Chris Pratt and Charlie Day voice Mario and Luigi, respectively, in Universal and Illumination's \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\"UniversalNintendo has expanded the way it spreads its intellectual property beyond the console to toys, theme parks and movies, which brought the audience back to the Switch.\"The Switch generation was also defined by Nintendo making a broad effort to expand the reach of its globally-recognisable IP via theme parks, movies, museums, and collaborations,\" McWhirter said.Nintendo is hoping to replicate that playbook with the Switch 2 which was launched last year. So far, the console has sold more than 14 million units and Nintendo said the device is its fastest-selling of all time. ",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDays before Super Bowl 60, New York Attorney General Letitia James has a message for consumers: Be careful about placing trades on prediction markets.\"New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,\" James said in a statement Monday. \"It's crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms.

Consumers can make trades on game events — similar to online sportsbooks like DraftKings or FanDuel — as well as on predetermined outcomes, such as which companies will advertise during the Super Bowl, an issue CNBC Sport reported on last week. James said the platforms' products are bets \"masquerading\" as event contracts, which are generally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi, which initially declined to comment, said in statement later Monday, \"We agree that consumers should steer clear of unregulated prediction markets. Our members' platforms are all regulated by the CFTC, similar to how the SEC regulates the stock market.

The contracts trade up or down depending on the action. In addition to contracts on Super Bowl commercials, both Polymarket and Kalshi are offering other trades related to the game, including on matters like \"What songs will be played at the halftime show?,\" \"Who will attend the big game?,\" and more traditional sportsbook \"bets\" such as \"Seattle vs. New England: Most Rushing Yards,\" as CNBC reported last week. There are laws that prohibit insider trading on prediction markets, just as on traditional financial markets. But industry experts say they're skeptical that the CFTC, recently gutted as part of widespread government cuts, has the will or the means to police those problems. Last week, CFTC Chairman Michael Selig said he had directed agency staff to withdraw a proposed rule that would have banned prediction trades on sports and politics. He said new rules would be coming.Disclosure: CNBC has a commercial relationship with Kalshi. ",

    "body": "Nintendo Co. Switch 2 game consoles at a Bic Camera Inc. electronics store in Tokyo, Japan, on Thursday, June 5, 2025. Nintendo Co. fans from Tokyo to Manhattan stood in line for hours to be among the first to get a Switch 2, fueling one of the biggest global gadget debuts since the iPhone launches of yesteryear. Kiyoshi Ota | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNintendo maintained its full-year Switch 2 sales forecast on Tuesday allaying some fears that the flagship console was losing momentum.The company maintained its November forecast for Switch 2 sales of 19 million units in the fiscal year ending March 2026. Nintendo has so far sold 17.37 million units of the Switch 2. It sold 7 million units in the December quarter alone.Nintendo said that the Switch 2 is the fastest-selling console it has ever released. \"The implosion of sales, as predicted by some investors, did not happen in the holiday quarter,\" Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, told CNBC on Tuesday.Here's how Nintendo did in its fiscal third quarter ended Dec. 31 versus LSEG estimates:Revenue: 806.32 billion Japanese yen ($5.2 billion) versus 847.73 billion yen expected.Net profit: 159.93 billion yen versus 147.3 billion yen expected.Revenue rose 86% year-on-year, while profit rose 24%. Nintendo's share price has been under pressure for the past few months. Following the launch of the Switch 2 in June, the gaming giant's shares hit a record high above 14,000 yen in August. But the stock has fallen more than 30% since then. watch nowThere was some concern ahead of the key holiday sales period in December that Switch 2 sales were struggling. However, \"Mario Kart World\" recorded sales of around 14 million units and \"Donkey Kong Bananza\" sold 4.25 million units since the launch of the Switch 2. These are Nintendo's most popular games so far for the console. Last month, market research firm Circana said the Nintendo Switch 2 was the best-selling console in December in the U.S. Memory, upgrade concerns lingerInvestors are watching several potential headwinds for Nintendo, including whether the company will be impacted by an unprecedented surge in memory prices — a key component in its consoles. Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said that memory price rises are not significantly impacting results during the financial year, but could impact profitability if the component costs remain high over the longer term, Reuters reported.\"Suppliers obviously have the upper hand with any new negotiations, so it's only a matter of time until Nintendo – and Sony and Microsoft – run through their inventory of memory and renegotiate at higher prices,\" James McWhirter, senior analyst at Omdia, told CNBC.\"Any rise in the cost of console hardware will be passed on to consumers via multiple means: directly, or via a mix of increased software, services, peripherals pricing.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNintendo shares year to dateAnother potential headwind is whether the company has a strong enough pipeline of games to support the Switch 2 and whether it can convince people to upgrade from the console's predecessor.For the Switch 2, Nintendo plans to release \"Mario Tennis Fever\" in February and \"Pokémon Pokopia\" in March — two titles from its most popular franchises.Meanwhile, \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" is slated for release in April. The first Super Mario movie, which was released in 2023, provided a significant boost to Nintendo by driving fans toward purchasing its original Switch console, which at the time was around six years old. Nintendo will be hoping for a similar effect on the Switch 2. \"2026 will be make-or-break for Switch 2's future as Nintendo transitions from selling to die-hard early adopters and toward the mass market,\" McWhirter said. \"Pricing will be a pain point — expect software bundles to return for the holiday season. Nintendo games continue to sell Nintendo hardware, but the company will need to convince players who experienced the best of what Switch 1 has to offer that its Switch 2 sequels are worth the price of entry.\" ",

    "body": "Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman with Union Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary and other officials outside the Finance Ministry prior to the presentation of the Union Budget 2026-27 at Kartavya Bhavan on Feb. 1, 2026 in New Delhi, India.Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesIndia has announced a 20-year tax exemption for hyperscalers that use data centers in the country to service global clients, in a move that could shift artificial intelligence-driven businesses to the South Asian country.According to experts, cost of data center infrastructure is already low in India and coupled with the tax holiday it will make using data centers in India for global delivery more attractive for hyperscalers, compared to competing hubs including Singapore, UAE and Ireland.Hyperscalers refer to cloud computing giants such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud that are investing heavily in data center infrastructure that power AI models. \"This proposal will significantly increase the hyperscaler demand and major foreign firms will now find India a significantly cheaper base for global workloads,\" Riaz Thingna, partner, tax, regulatory and finance consulting at Grant Thornton Bharat, told CNBC. This move positions India not just as a \"consumption market\" for data center demand but as a \"global cloud computing and AI computing hub,\" Thingna said, adding that currently hyperscalers face \"corporate income tax exposure\" if they have \"significant economic presence\" in India. Currently, data center operations of foreign hyperscalers in India are considered permanent establishment and the profits arising from these operations are taxed at 35% plus surcharge and cess, explained Kumarmanglam Vijay, partner and head of practice-direct tax at legal firm JSA Advocates and Solicitors. Now, cloud services provided by global hyperscalers using data centers owned and operated by a local developer will be exempt from tax until 2047, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said during her budget speech on Sunday, adding that it will \"boost investment in data centers.\"India's role in the global AI race has been limited so far as it lacks strong local foundational models, chip manufacturing abilities and large data center capacities as compared to the U.S. and China.The proposed tax holiday and the investment it is likely to bring could accentuate India's role in global AI race at a time when the country is seeing increasing interest from tech behemoths that have announced billions in AI-related infrastructure investments.  India's Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said at the recently concluded World Economic Forum that India was \"making very good progress\" in all the five layers of AI architecture — applications, models, chip, infra and energy.Apart from attracting hyperscalers, India has been doubling down on its AI ambitions by incentivizing semiconductor design and production companies to set up in the country. Tax holidayThe tax exemption is likely to benefit Indian IT and cloud service firms such as Infosys, Wipro, TCS, HCL Tech and Jio, according to experts, as well as local data center developers.The tax holiday is \"a positive sign for sustained, cost-effective capacity creation,\" said Raju Vegesna, chairman at Indian data center developer Sify Technologies. Google, which has entered into a partnership with AdaniConneX, to build a $15 billion data center at a new artificial intelligence hub in southern India, is likely to be among the big beneficiaries of the proposed tax holiday.Last December, in under 24 hours, Microsoft and Amazon pledged more than $50 billion toward India's cloud and AI infrastructure — details on local partners have not been shared by them.  Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for comments, while Amazon Web Services declined to comment.Data center demand globally has surged in recent years, largely driven by the explosion in AI workloads, which require vast computing power, electrical power, cooling and networking infrastructure. More than $61 billion has flowed into the data center market so far in 2025.A server room at a data center in India.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIndia opportunityIndia's current data center capacity is around 1.2 gigawatts but the market is set to more than double, crossing 3 gigawatts within the next five years. According to a January report by real estate consultancy JLL, global data center capacity was 103 GW and is expected to double to 200GW by 2030 due to the AI boom.The tax holiday for foreign cloud companies will remove \"the single biggest friction point for global hyperscalers entering India,\" said Anshuman Magazine, CEO of India, South-East Asia, Middle East & Africa at real estate consultancy CBRE.Global capital inflows in India's data center space will \"increase substantially\" he said, as the tax incentive gives a 20-year runway to earn return on investment.As markets such as Japan, Australia, China and Singapore in the Asia Pacific region have matured, with, Singapore, one of the oldest data center hubs in the region, having limited room to deploy large-scale data centers due to land availability issues, India stands to gain, experts said.The country has abundant space for large-scale data center developments. When compared with data center hubs in Europe, power costs in India are relatively low. Coupled with India's growing renewable energy capacity — critical for power-hungry data centers — and the economics begin to look compelling.The tax holiday for foreign cloud service firms could do for India's cloud and data center ecosystem what the IT services incentives did in the early 2000s said S. Anjani Kumar, partner Deloitte India, adding that it will \"catalyze large-scale global investment, expand export revenues, and lead to long-term job and capability creation.\"",

It shed 7% on Monday after reporting before the bell that its experiences division, including theme parks, resorts, and cruises, crossed over $10 billion in quarterly revenue.watch nowThe company's overall revenue was roughly $26 billion, up 5% yearly, and beating Wall Street's expectations of $25.7 billion.CEO transition is an 'overhang' on sharesThe Disney board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters.It will be the second time the company has appointed a successor for Iger. His first stint as CEO ended in 2020. Disney picked Bob Chapek to take the top position. But Chapek was fired in late 2022, prompting Iger to return.

Disney's co-chair of Entertainment, Dana Walden, is also another name in contention.

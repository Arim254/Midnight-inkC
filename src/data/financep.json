    "description": "Some renters will soon be able to pay their rent using a buy now, pay later plan through financial technology company Affirm, which offers installment",
    "body": "Some renters will soon be able to pay their rent using a buy now, pay later plan through financial technology company Affirm, which offers installment-based payment plans for consumers at a wide variety of retailers.Affirm will partner with fintech company Esusu to provide renters with \"a flexible option for managing one of their largest monthly expenses,\" an Affirm spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNBC Make It. Esusu offers memberships starting at $10 a month for services to help users build credit, including reporting rent payments to credit agencies. Eligible renters will be able to use Affirm through Esusu to pay their rent in two equal, biweekly payments with 0% interest and no late fees, the spokesperson said. The offering is rolling out through a pilot program, and the companies have not yet announced a launch date. Esusu's recently launched split pay option already allows its plus and premium membership subscribers to break up rent payments throughout the month after an initial down payment, according to its website. The partnership with Affirm will give Esusu members another option to split their rent into two payments. Plus and premium memberships, which cost $35 and $50 a month, respectively, are only available to residents at Esusu-partnered properties, according to its website.Nationally, rents in the U.S. were up about 3% in December 2025 compared with the previous year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. And nearly half of all renters spent more than the recommended 30% of their income on housing costs in 2023, according to the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates.A new payment option won't solve the 'underlying affordability issue'Some financial experts are skeptical of using buy now, pay later plans for fixed costs like monthly rent.Using a buy now, pay later plan for rent \"could be useful in a true pinch or short-term emergency,\" says Chris Jackson, a certified financial planner based in South Carolina. However, \"relying on it consistently would be a mistake, particularly for people who already struggle keeping up with rent payments.\"Borrowing to cover your rent won't solve the \"underlying affordability issue,\" he adds. Douglas Boneparth, a CFP, founder of Bone Fide Wealth and member of CNBC's financial advisor council, encourages anyone struggling to pay rent to work directly with their landlord to work out a payment agreement, rather than turning to a lender.Boneparth has previously criticized installment plans for encouraging overspending and targeting consumers \"who are most susceptible to borrowing when they shouldn't,\" he wrote on LinkedIn in 2025. Using buy now, pay later plans for rent could be a \"slippery slope\" that has consumers \"falling into traps of fiscal irresponsibility,\" he says.Outside of temporary hardships or broader socio-economic conditions, \"we have to get down to those fundamentals and put yourself in a position to afford your lifestyle,\" Boneparth says.Affirm's spokesperson said the new offer will be \"a transparent option that offers flexibility for renters to align expenses with their paychecks.\" They added, \"We underwrite every application individually and we only approve people for what we believe they can responsibly afford to repay.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

Presser was previously TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety.The U.S.-based joint venture will operate as an \"independent entity,\" TikTok said in its announcement. The joint venture will be governed by a seven-member board of directors, the majority of which are American. The new entity's board of directors include Chew, TPG Global senior advisor Timothy Dattels, Susquehanna International Group Mark Dooley, Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban, DXC Technology CEO Raul Fernandez, Oracle executive vice president Kenneth Glueck, and MGX chief strategy and safety officer David Scott.TikTok parent ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the new newly created joint venture, the company said. ByteDance was subject to a national security law, originally signed by former President Joe Biden, that required the Chinese tech giant to sell its U.S. operations or be effectively banned in the country. But that national security law was never enacted due to several executive orders signed by President Donald Trump throughout 2025.Those executive orders directed the attorney general from enforcing the national security law while the app searched for a buyer.Chew revealed the name of TikTok's U.S. entity to employees in December, CNBC reported.This news is developing, check back for updates",

    "body": "Packages of Pampers diapers are displayed at a Target store on June 05, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesProcter & Gamble is selling diapers made with silk fibers in China as part of the company's strategy to entice shoppers to spend more, even as demand for some of its products wanes.China is the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States. In both markets, P&G has turned to innovation, rather than discounts, to attract consumers who are otherwise trying to spend less at the grocery store. For example, last year, it unveiled a new formula for its liquid Tide detergent in the U.S. In China, P&G also faces another challenge: a record-low birth rate. Government data released Monday showed that births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023. For P&G, fewer babies means the company is selling fewer diapers. To boost the sales of its baby-care division, P&G is leaning into luxury.Executives touted the success of the Pampers Prestige product on the company's earnings conference call Thursday. It added silk fibers to the inside of the diaper for skin comfort and protection.\"Chinese parents want only the best for their baby,\" P&G CEO Shailesh Jejurikar said.He added that \"reframing\" the company's super-premium diaper line has fueled double-digit organic sales growth and a 3% market share increase for P&G's baby-care business in Greater China over the last 18 months. The company did not share how the pricing of Pampers Prestige compares with its other diaper lines in China.In the latest quarter, P&G's overall baby-care division reported single-digit organic sales declines, despite a 20% jump in organic sales in Greater China, according to CFO Andre Schulten.More broadly, the focus on innovation is paying off for P&G. Consumer sentiment in China is still negative, yet P&G saw 3% growth in the market in the latest quarter, Schulten said on a call with reporters on Thursday.Stateside, P&G's sales were weaker. Organic sales in North America fell 2% in its fiscal second quarter. P&G is hoping that the strategy that is working in China could soon pay off in the U.S. The current bifurcated — or \"K-shaped\" — economy has showed that wealthier Americans are still willing to flex their purchasing power, even as lower-income shoppers pull back. Shares of P&G rose more than 2% in morning trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. However, P&G's revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by weaker demand in the U.S.",

    "body": "The child of parents who both served in the U.S. Navy, much of Mikayla McGhee's early life was spent moving from military base to military base. McGhee, 30, spent most of her time living abroad in Japan, which she says led her to realize she wanted to build a life for herself outside the United States.\"I was always working towards freedom, so I never knew exactly what I was going to do, but I knew I wanted the freedom to be able to live wherever I wanted to and travel whenever I wanted to,\" McGhee tells CNBC Make It.\"Once you've experienced growing up abroad and you're exposed to that, you continue to search for it. So moving back to the States after living in Japan, I always knew I wanted to live outside of the U.S. I just didn't know how.\"One of McGhee's amenities is having someone that takes care of the pool and landscaping.Prakhar Deep Jain for CNBC Make ItIn 2020, McGhee was living in Atlanta, Georgia, and went to visit her parents in Bahrain, where her dad was stationed at the time. The country is located in the Persian Gulf and is home to the Naval Support Activity, Bahrain, a U.S. military base. McGhee stayed in the country for three months and says she fell in love with it. As soon as she got back to Atlanta, she started planning a permanent move to Bahrain. \"The culture shock was that, actually, things were better, not worse. Don't just believe what you're told or what you see in the media because it's nothing like that at all,\" she says.\"It's so calm. It's so peaceful. There was never a time where I didn't feel like I fit in or I was standing out as an expat. Every culture shock was a positive one.\"McGhee's house now is close to Bahrain's capital of Manama.Prakhar Deep Jain for CNBC Make ItIn December 2022, McGhee moved to Bahrain and lived in her parents' three-bedroom home for six months before moving out on her own. After leaving her parents' house, McGhee lived in a two-bedroom apartment in a luxury high-rise building. She lived there for over a year. Now, McGhee lives near the capital of Bahrain, Manama, in a three-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom home with a pool and one-car garage that rents for $2,200 USD a month.The house also has a laundry room and is fully fenced in. The cost of monthly rent includes what McGhee calls a \"watchman,\" or someone who comes by the house to clean the pool and take care of the landscaping. McGhee lives with her partner and she says he pays the majority of their expenses.Prakhar Deep Jain for CNBC Make ItAs a licensed realtor in Bahrain, McGhee conducted the housing search on her own and says she chose this one because of its proximity to the city center. She says she and her partner split expenses, though he pays the majority, while most of her money goes to savings and to the trips the couple take together. The couple signed a one-year lease last year and plan to renew another one-year lease this year too.McGhee works remotely as a senior performance marketing manager at an IT company, and has a dedicated space to work from home. She earns $140,000 a year, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Since McGhee earns her salary in USD, she still pays U.S. taxes. McGhee also uses the health insurance offered by her company, which allows her access to Bahrain's health-care system.McGhee's house has a private pool in the back.Prakhar Deep Jain for CNBC Make ItWhen McGhee has free time during the day, she says she likes to work out, shop for groceries and create content. She shares a lot of her life in Bahrain on TikTok to her more than 65,000 followers.\"It is my duty to make sure that Americans know how great this country is,\" McGhee says.Although McGhee isn't sure if she will stay in Bahrain long-term, she says she knows she wants to buy property around the country as a real estate investment and have a permanent place for herself there, too. \"My life is 10 times better here. My happiness has skyrocketed. Even the weather alone has increased my mood,\" she says.\"I will always want to have something that I can come back to, that I could call my home. Bahrain felt like home from the day I got here, so in order for me to leave, another place would need to do the same.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Brex co-founders Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras.BrexCapital One said Thursday that it was acquiring payments startup Brex for $5.15 billion, the latest splashy deal undertaken by the bank's CEO, Richard Fairbank.The firm, which disclosed the deal in its fourth-quarter earnings statement, said the deal is made up of 50% cash and 50% stock. Brex was previously valued at $12.3 billion. Shares of the bank fell about 3%.Under Fairbank, a rare founder-CEO of a major U.S. bank, Capital One acquired rival card firm Discover Financial last year for about $35 billion. That deal was Fairbank's crowning achievement, giving the credit card lender access to one of the only payment networks of any scale. \"Since our founding, we set out to build a payments company at the frontier of the technology revolution,\" Fairbank said in a release. \"Acquiring Brex accelerates this journey, especially in the business payments marketplace.\"Fairbank said that Brex pioneered the combination of corporate cards, banking and spend management software: \"They have taken the rarest of journeys for a fintech, building a vertically integrated platform from the bottom of the tech stack to the top.\"Still, the more than 50% decline in valuation for Brex from its 2023 level shows the headwinds that even successful fintech companies have encountered. Brex is among a class of fintech firms that rose to prominence during a period of low interest rates; it was known initially as a startup that made loans to other startups via its cards.But the company expanded beyond technology into other sectors and now services larger established firms and startups alike, including Robinhood, Zoom and Anthropic. Capital One, which has offered business credit cards for decades, became increasingly convinced that it was Brex's model that would be the winning offering, according to a person with knowledge of the lender's strategy. \"We didn't have to pursue this acquisition, our growth was incredibly strong,\" Brex CEO Pedro Franceschi told CNBC in an interview.Combining Brex's technology with Capital One's reach and resources would grow the startup's scale faster than as a standalone firm, he said.",

They would fund the departments of Defense; Health and Human Services; Homeland Security; Labor; Housing and Urban Development; Transportation; and Education. The Homeland Security bill passed 220-207, while the other three cleared 341-88 as part of a package known as a \"minibus.\"The bills represent the final quartet of 12 annual appropriations bills required to fund the government and avoid a partial shutdown on Jan. 30. The Senate still needs to approve them, along with two other House-passed funding bills, before they head to President Donald Trump's desk for a signature. The Senate does not return until next week, and a winter storm closing in on Washington over the weekend threatens to complicate those plans. House lawmakers were widely expected to pass the bills on Thursday, with lawmakers desperate to avoid another shutdown after enduring a record 43-day shutdown last year. Despite bipartisan accord on avoiding another shutdown, some of the bills still face serious hurdles in the Senate.

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's headline inflation rate slowed sharply to 2.1%, its lowest level since March 2022, down from 2.9% in November, as easing price pressures collide with political focus on living costs and a looming central bank decision.This was the 45th straight month that the inflation figure has been above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, stood at 2.4%, in line with analysts' estimates and its lowest level since October 2024. That was sharply lower than November's 3%.The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate — which strips out prices for fresh food and energy — eased to 2.9% from 3% a month earlier.Japan's full-year inflation stood at 3.2%, according to government data. Inflation hit a two-year high in January 2025, before tapering down over the course of the year.However, Japan saw rice inflation hit its highest in over 50 years in May, and rice prices soared to record highs then. Rice inflation for December came in at 34.4%, marking the seventh straight month of decline from a year ago. Despite that, rice prices in Japan remain near record levels. Data from Japan's agriculture ministry showed the average price of a 5-kilogram bag of rice was at 4,267 yen for the week ended Jan. 11. Back in 2025, soaring rice prices and careless comments cost then farm minister Taku Eto his job and reportedly prompted former prime minister Shigeru Ishiba to take personal responsibility for lowering prices as a rice shortage took hold. Snap electionThe data comes as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is set to dissolve Japan's Lower House today in preparation for a snap election on Feb. 8. Takaichi has made tackling the cost of living a priority and has vowed to suspend Japan's 8% food tax for 2 years to help households with rising living costs.Last year, her government put together a massive $135 billion stimulus package for the country, which included measures to expand local government grants, as well as provide subsidies for electricity and gas bills.Later today, the Bank of Japan will also release its policy decision, although economists polled by Reuters largely expect a hold at 0.75%. Fresh inflation and GDP forecasts will also come from the BOJ for 2026.",

    "body": "A Tesla robotaxi drives on the street along South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, on June 22, 2025Joel Angel Juarez | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday that his company is now running a small number of its Robotaxi vehicles in Austin, Texas, without a human driver or safety supervisor on board.\"Just started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car,\" Musk posted on X. \"Congrats to the @Tesla_AI team!\" Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of software, wrote in a separate post that the Austin Robotaxi service included, \"a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors.\" He said the ratio of driverless to supervised vehicles will increase over time in that market.Tesla shares rose 4.2% on Thursday to close at $449.36.Tesla lags behind several companies that are already operating commercial robotaxi services with no drivers or safety monitors present. Alphabet's Waymo leads the U.S. market, while Baidu's Apollo Go is out front in China with significant competition from WeRide.Other players are joining the fray, as Amazon's Zoox is now operating limited driverless services in the U.S., and startups like May Mobility and Nuro are developing their driverless offerings.Elon Musk waves to the crowd during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2026. Denis Balibouse | ReutersMusk said in July that Tesla would likely have \"autonomous ride hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" The company fell far shy of that goal. However, Tesla drummed up excitement with the launch of its Robotaxi ride-hailing app, and its initial services in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area.In Texas, Tesla obtained a permit to run a transportation networking company, which allowed it to use \"automated driving systems,\" or driverless vehicles, there. But in California, Tesla has yet to obtain permits that would allow it to conduct driverless testing or robotaxi rides without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Musk said, \"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point,\" adding that he expects his company's Robotaxi service will be \"very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.\" Musk is notorious for missing his self-imposed timelines for grand technical or business achievements.In 2019, he told investors that he was \"very confident\" the company would be able to turn its existing vehicles into robotaxis with a software update by the end of the following year.With its EV sales sliding, Tesla's ability to keep investors enthused may hinge on whether it can scale a driverless, ride-hailing service in the U.S. this year and upgrade the partially automated driving systems in its cars to a fully automated driving system. Today, its premium system is marketed as FSD (Supervised), and the company plans to sell an FSD Unsupervised system in the future.Surveys by the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report found a majority of U.S. consumers polled late last year did not want to ride in robotaxis, with particular concerns around safety.Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note this week that they anticipated \"muted underlying volume growth\" for Tesla and EV maker Rivian this year with \"autonomy and physical AI driving the narrative.\" They also said, \"Tesla will have to prove out FSD unsupervised and the scaling up of robotaxi (which in our view has been clearly tracking behind schedule) before garnering incremental valuation credit.\" Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Late last year, California regulators found that Tesla had engaged in deceptive marketing and false advertising around their vehicles' driverless capabilities. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is currently investigating Tesla to determine how often the company's FSD systems may have caused traffic safety violations.According to TeslaDeaths.com, which draws on NHTSA data, legal filings and press reports to track fatal Tesla collisions, 65 people have died in Tesla crashes that involved the use of Autopilot, including two in which the company's FSD systems were engaged in the seconds leading up to the crash.Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.

    "body": "Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen holds a press conference in Nuuk, Greenland, Jan. 22, 2026. Marko Djurica | ReutersGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a press conference Thursday that he doesn't know what's in the \"framework\" deal that President Donald Trump announced after meeting with NATO's leader a day earlier.But Nielsen emphasized that no deal involving Greenland can be struck without the island and its governing kingdom, Denmark, having a say.Any such deal must respect Greenland's \"red lines\" — including its sovereignty and territorial integrity, he added.\"We choose the Kingdom of Denmark. We choose the EU. We choose NATO,\" Nielsen told the press in Nuuk, Greenland. \"This is not only a situation for Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark, it's about the world order for all of us.\"The remarks echoed Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's earlier statement maintaining that Greenland's sovereignty is non-negotiable.Nielsen's comments came one day after Trump — who has spent weeks aggressively pressuring Europe over a proposed U.S. takeover of Greenland — abruptly announced that he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have forged the \"framework of a future deal.\"The announcement, delivered in a Truth Social post following a closed-door meeting in Davos, Switzerland, was light on details. In a CNBC interview, Trump called it the \"concept of a deal\" and said he would \"explain it down the line.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse. Here's why it matters for MoscowTrump's latest geopolitical gambits all lead back to ChinaTrump says anything less than U.S. control of Greenland is 'unacceptable' ahead of talksBut the agreement was apparently enough for Trump to cancel the forthcoming tariffs he had imposed on eight European countries that had come to Greenland's defense amid the president's saber-rattling.Trump suggested to CNBC that the framework involves mineral rights for the U.S., as well as the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.Meanwhile, The New York Times reported Wednesday that some NATO officials had separately discussed a possible compromise in which the U.S. would get sovereignty over \"small pockets of Greenland for military bases.\"Nielsen on Thursday rejected that proposal out of hand, while repeatedly noting that he has not been told what the Trump-Rutte framework entails.\"I don't know what's concrete in that deal,\" he said. \"But I know that we have now a high-level working group working on a solution for both parties.\"\"We have some red lines\" that cannot be crossed, Nielsen said. \"We have to respect our territorial integrity. We have to respect international law, sovereignty.\"\"Our integrity and our borders and international law is definitely, definitely a red line that we don't want anyone to cross,\" he added later in the presser. \"And I don't think that is strange at all.\"Nielsen said that he believes those red lines, which were recently relayed to Rutte from Danish and Greenlandic officials, have since \"been delivered\" to Trump.But there's been \"nothing about a deal on mineral resources or anything else,\" he said. Greenland is willing to negotiate with the U.S. on economics and other matters, \"but that's something we have to talk about in mutual respect,\" he added.Nielsen also directly criticized the Trump administration's aggression toward Greenland, including the recent flare-up in tensions that, until Wednesday, included the possibility of U.S. military action.\"No doubt, the rhetoric we have heard the last year is unacceptable for us,\" he said, adding that it is difficult to maintain a respectful dialogue when Greenland's citizens \"every night hear threats about acquiring and taking.\"\"Try to imagine how it is as Greenlanders, as people here, peaceful people in Greenland, hear and see in the media every day that somebody wants to take your freedom.\"",

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, offering a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader of one of Trump's signature policies. Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, initially praised Trump's moves to secure the borders of the world's largest economy. Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to the lowest level in 50 years for the period from October 2024 to September 2025, the BBC reported citing federal data.But Dimon, who has long advocated for immigration reform to boost U.S. economic growth, also made an apparent reference to videos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers rounding up people alleged to be undocumented immigrants.\"I don't like what I'm seeing, with five grown men beating up little women,\" Dimon said. \"So I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.\"It's unclear if Dimon was speaking about a specific incident, or more broadly about ICE confrontations.In the first year of his second term, Trump has overhauled U.S. immigration policy with a focus on mass deportations, tightened asylum access and ramped-up spending for ICE personnel and facilities. Among a torrent of new policies that changed the landscape for seeking American citizenship, the administration also rescinded guidance on where ICE arrests could happen, leading to raids at schools, hospitals and places of worship.Unlike during Trump's first term, American CEOs have mostly avoided public criticism of his policies. Wall Street analysts have speculated that business leaders fear retribution from the Trump administration, which has sued media companies, universities and law firms, and instead choose to appeal to the president out of the public spotlight.On Wednesday, Dimon said that he wanted to know more about who is being swept up in ICE raids: \"Are they here legally? Are they criminals? ... Did they break American law?\"\"We need these people,\" Dimon added. \"They work in our hospitals and hotels and restaurants and agriculture, and they're good people .… They should be treated that way.\"'A climate of fear'For years, in annual shareholder letters and media interviews, Dimon has cited an immigration overhaul as one of the main avenues to unlock higher U.S. economic growth.The veteran CEO of JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market cap, has previously supported a merit-based system for green cards as well as citizenship for people brought to America as children, and pushed back on proposals to limit H-1B visas. On Wednesday, Dimon urged Trump to allow citizenship \"for hardworking people\" and \"proper asylum\" opportunities.\"I think he can, because he controlled the borders,\" Dimon said.Later in the wide-ranging interview, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told Dimon that she was surprised at how careful he and other CEOs were in speaking about Trump.\"You are one of the more outspoken business leaders,\" Beddoes said. \"I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical. There is a climate of fear in your country.\"Dimon pushed back, saying that he let his views be known about Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and stance towards European allies. \"I think they should change their approach to immigration,\" Dimon said. \"I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?\"watch now",

    "body": "A Spirit Airlines Airbus A320 taxis at Los Angeles International Airport after arriving from Boston on September 1, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSpirit Airlines is in talks with alternative investment firm Castlelake for a potential takeover as the discount airline looks for a path out of bankruptcy, CNBC has learned.Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last August for the second time in a year after its previous turnaround plan fell flat. Fellow budget carrier Frontier Airlines had been in talks with Spirit over the years for a potential merger, including in recent months, but didn't secure a deal, according to people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity to speak about the discussions. The two had reached a deal four years ago but it was called off after a surprise all-cash offer from JetBlue Airways.\"We don't comment on market rumors and speculation,\" a Spirit spokesman said. Castlelake didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. It was not immediately clear if Spirit's bondholders and Castlelake would reach a deal or what form it could take. Minneapolis-based Castlelake has been active for years in aviation finance. In August, it announced it was launching a new aviation lending arm, Merit AirFinance, with $1.8 billion in deployable capital. Spirit in mid-December said it amended its agreement with creditors to receive another $50 million in funding immediately, a lifeline for the carrier. Additional funding would be contingent on \"further progress on a standalone plan of reorganization or a strategic transaction,\" Spirit said Dec. 15. \"Spirit is currently in active negotiations on each of these possibilities,\" the company added.In its fight for survival, Spirit has slashed flights, reduced its fleet and cut jobs to save money. Unions last year agreed to pay cuts for the carrier's pilots and flight attendants. That amounted to $100 million in concessions, the Air Line Pilots Association said in a Jan. 13 open letter, urging bondholders to support Spirit's restructuring and avoid a liquidation.Dania Beach, Florida-based Spirit for years enjoyed largely steady profitability and enviable margins in the often-rocky airline industry. But things took a turn after the pandemic, when wages and other costs soared, customer preferences changed, and an oversupply of domestic flights drove down airfare. That was especially punishing for U.S.-focused carriers that don't enjoy a buffer from plush first-class cabins and large credit card and loyalty program deals.The carrier's problems snowballed after a Pratt & Whitney engine recall grounded dozens of its Airbus aircraft starting in 2023 and the planned acquisition by JetBlue was blocked two years ago by a federal judge who ruled it was anticompetitive, leaving both carriers to fend for themselves against a backdrop where larger carriers dominate.Spirit has been trying in recent years to win over higher-spending customers by offering roomier seats or bundled fares that include seat assignments and baggage, or allow for changes, to better compete with larger rivals whose profits have been buoyed by big-spending customers post-pandemic.

    "body": "The Intel logo is displayed on a sign in front of Intel headquarters on Jan. 22, 2026 in Santa Clara, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIntel reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations but offered soft guidance for the current quarter.Shares of the company were down as much as 13% in after-hours trading. Here's how the chipmaker did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 15 cents adjusted vs. 8 cents expectedRevenue: $13.7 billion vs. $13.4 billion expectedIntel said it expected first-quarter revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and breakeven adjusted earnings per share. That came in below LSEG expectations of 5 cents earnings per share on $12.51 billion in sales. Finance chief David Zinsner told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos that the company's soft guidance in the first quarter was partially because the company doesn't have the supply it needs for seasonal demand, and that supply would improve in the second quarter this year. On a call with analysts, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that the company was looking to improve its production efficiency, called yield, in order to improve supply of the company's products. \"Our yields are in line with our internal plans,\" Tan said. \"They are still below what I want them to be.\"The company said it had a net loss of $600 million, or 12 cents per diluted share. In the year-ago period, Intel reported a net loss of $100 million, or 3 cents per share. Investor expectations were high for Intel heading into the report, with the stock up 147% in the past year. The rally has been driven by optimism that Intel may be on the cusp of securing its first major anchor customer for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies.Tan said earlier this month that the company's 18A manufacturing technology — competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 2nm technology — \"over-delivered\" in 2025. That suggests that the technology is mature enough to start volume production of products, such as Intel's own Core Ultra Series 3 central processor. In a statement, Tan said that Intel was \"working aggressively\" to increase 18A supply to meet \"strong customer demand.\"Zinsner told CNBC that customers for Intel's next-generation 14A technology would show up in the second half of the year. Zinsner added that the company was unlikely to announce customers in general. \"Once we get them, we're gonna need to start really spending capital on the 14A front, and that's how you'll know,\" Zinsner said. Intel said its foundry had $4.5 billion in revenue, although some of that is accounting for making the company's own chips. There is also optimism tied to strong sales of Intel's latest server chips, which analysts say are seeing a sales boom because of increased spending on infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Tan said in a statement Thursday that Intel's central processing units were becoming more important because of systems built for artificial intelligence. Revenue from those chips is reported as Data Center and AI sales, which totaled $4.7 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 9% on an annual basis. Chips for laptops are reported as Client Computing Group sales. The product category was down 7% on a year-over-year basis to $8.2 billion in sales. During 2025, the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia made big investments into the chipmaker, all becoming major shareholders. Intel said that its sale of stock to Nvidia worth $5 billion was completed during the quarter. WATCH: Can Intel's New Arizona Chip Fab Bring It Back From The Brink?watch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump attends a reception with business leaders during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF), in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 21, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump's latest retreat from a trade war has catalyzed an international asset rally — and revived investors' talk of \"TACO\" — \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" Speaking to CNBC's Joe Kernen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday evening, Trump said he'd walked back tariffs on European allies because he now had \"the concept of a deal\" over Greenland, after weeks of demanding to annex it for the U.S.He had threatened to impose 10% tariffs on eight European countries that opposed his push to \"buy\" the Arctic island. They would have risen to 25% from June 1.watch nowEurope vowed an \"unflinching\" response to any new tariffs and stocks, bonds and the U.S. dollar staged a steep sell-off on Tuesday, as investors panicked about the fresh possibility of a trade war. But Wall Street's major averages jumped after Trump's walk-back on Wednesday, with stock futures pointing to an extension of those gains on Thursday morning. The rebound rippled globally, with equities listed in Europe and Asia also rising when regional markets reopened Thursday. Read moreReturn of the TACO trade?  Amid the global rally, one of the key fixtures of investing in 2025 stepped into the new year: the \"TACO\" trade.The phrase refers to the president's history of threatening to leverage intense levies, only to ease, delay or cancel them. It was coined last year after Trump's \"liberation day\" announcement of tariffs in April shocked markets but investors grew skeptical of his follow-through when he eventually backed down. Market reactions to subsequent U.S. trade policy announcements were more muted or saw recoveries more quickly.Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, likened today's market moves to those seen last year. \"Donald Trump's TACO bell has rung once again, much to the joy of financial markets,\" he said in a Thursday morning note. \"Trump has form in chickening out of his threats … there are a lot of similarities with the liberation day market wobble in April 2025 and now.\"In both situations, Trump took an aggressive stance and then backed down after financial markets wobbled.\"watch nowHowever, Mould added that some signs of lingering caution remain at play, with markets appearing to be regaining balance rather than \"moving into top gear.\"\"Gold's rally paused for breath, albeit it was notable there wasn't a major sell-off in the metal,\" he said. \"That suggests investors are keen to keep some safety elements in their portfolio. Healthcare and tobacco stocks were also in vogue, which is normally what you would expect on a day of worry, not when markets rebound.\"Alan Siow, co-head of emerging market corporate debt at asset management giant Ninety One, told CNBC on Thursday that the TACO mindset was the driver of the risk asset rally seen after liberation day — and that it seemed to still be influencing markets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 price\"We don't have any evidence yet that this has changed, but over the last two days at Davos, I think we have seen from the rhetoric of global leaders that something has hardened and perhaps permanently changed at the policy level, which will then feed down into wider economy via changes in business and investment plans,\" he said.\"Even if the reality remains TACO in the near term, perhaps we will now see a lasting change in underlying behavior — but to be fair, given how fast moving the recent developments have been, it's too early to tell.\"Paul Surguy, managing director and head of investment management and proposition at London-based wealth management firm Kingswood Group, said that although markets do react negatively to certain White House policies, those reactions have generally grown more muted since liberation day. \"The initial position — a worst-case scenario is announced with the view of a more palatable deal being struck later — is exactly what we have seen with comments over Greenland,\" he told CNBC in an email. \"As yet, scant details have been released regarding the 'framework' deal. That being said, with a more conciliatory tone, markets have responded positively.\"Toni Meadows, head of investments at BRI Wealth Management, struck a more skeptical tone on the TACO trade, urging investors to wait for details on the Greenland \"deal\" — and for Europe's response.  watch nowMeadows said the markets would initially \"claim back some or all of the falls\" before Trump announced a potential Greenland deal.\"There is relief but this is just one area of many that the U.S. president is seeking to shake the tree to see what he can get for America, based on his agenda of resource imperialism,\" he added.Meadows noted that markets were also monitoring domestic White House policies like a proposed cap on credit card rates. \"Investors will [now] likely try to get back to digesting the impact of the U.S. earnings season,\" he said. \"But this will only last until Trump's next announcement.\"",

    "body": "When a child is upset, most parents reach for the same question instinctively: \"What's wrong?\"It's well-intentioned and it comes from care. But after years of teaching conscious parenting and studying over 200 kids, I've seen how often that question does the opposite of what parents hope. Instead of opening children up, it can shut them down.Emotional intelligence develops when children feel safe enough to reflect. Without that foundation, even the most caring questions can feel overwhelming in the moment.Across my research, one sentence reliably helped children pause, reflect, and communicate more openly: \"Tell me what feels hard right now.\"This magic phrase works because it matches how children actually experience emotions in real life. Rather than pushing for clarity or explanations, it creates the conditions where insight can emerge naturally.1. It reduces defensiveness before the conversation even beginsDuring meltdowns, after-school emotional releases, or moments of sudden irritability, children are already on edge. The word \"hard\" feels human and non-threatening. It signals to your child that they aren't in trouble and don't need to justify their feelings, making it easier to stay engaged instead of shutting down or pushing back.2. It allows emotional language to develop organicallyChildren don't need to label emotions precisely. They can describe a situation, a sensation, or a moment that felt overwhelming. Over time, this gently expands emotional language, allowing insight to develop naturally rather than being forced before a child has the words.3. It establishes emotional safety before problem-solvingBefore problem-solving, before advice, before correction, this phrase tells a child: \"I can handle what you're feeling.\" Emotional intelligence grows in welcoming environments where emotions are met with steadiness instead of urgency.4. It gives children agency over what they shareRather than demanding an explanation, this question invites reflection. The child decides how much to share and when, reinforcing a sense of agency over their emotional experience, which is an essential foundation for self-regulation and confidence.5. It helps calm the nervous system firstWhen children feel emotionally safe, their stress response begins to settle. This phrase is especially effective when behavior feels disproportionate or confusing because it prioritizes regulation before reasoning.6. It normalizes emotions as part of everyday lifeBy focusing on what feels hard, parents communicate that emotions can be noticed without being rushed or fixed. It teaches kids that feelings can be experienced and moved through rather than avoided or suppressed.7. It demonstrates emotional intelligence in real timeChildren learn emotional intelligence through experience, not instruction. When parents respond with calm curiosity instead of control or urgency, they model how to approach emotions with steadiness and reflection. These are skills children eventually apply to themselves.Our job as parents is to create an environment where our children feel safe sharing their inner worlds. When you adjust your language, you shape the emotional tone of your relationship. Over time, children learn that their feelings are important signals that deserve attention.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of the BOUND and FOUNDATIONS journals, now offered together as her Emotional Safety Bundle.

    "body": "Alexandr Wang, former CEO of Scale, attends an AI summit in Paris in February 2025.Getty ImagesThe founders of some of the world's most successful startups have been young: Think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom were just 19 when they launched their ventures.But with the rise of billion-dollar artificial intelligence (AI) startups comes a new trend: their founders, on average, appear to be getting younger.A new report released by global early-stage venture capital firm Antler, found that the age of founders of AI unicorns has fallen from a peak age of 40 in 2021 to 29-years-old in 2024. Antler analyzed 1,629 unicorns and 3,512 founders globally for this report. However, in other industries, founder age is actually rising. In 2014, the average unicorn founder was 30 at the time of launch, compared with 34 for those who reached unicorn status between 2022 and 2024.Several AI startups with young founders have been in the spotlight in the past year. Alexandr Wang, co-founder of $29 billion AI data labelling company Scale AI, is only 29-years-old. Wang was poached by Meta in June, in a $14.3 billion deal with the startup, to head up the tech giant's new AI research unit called TBD Labs.In fact, Meta's former generative AI team, which was headed up by 65-year-old AI godfather Yann LeCun, was reorganized after its LLama4 AI model didn't perform well. This saw Wang become LeCun's manager and signaled Zuckerberg's desire to bring on a scrappier and more entrepreneurial AI lead, so that Meta could move faster in the AI space. Meanwhile, Mercor, an AI-powered talent and recruitment platform, was also co-founded by Brendan Foody, Adarsh Hiremath, and Surya Midha, all of whom are currently age 22. It was recently valued at over $10 billion.AnySphere, an AI-assisted coding and developer platform, valued at over $1 billion, is also headed up by 20-something-year-olds. Fridtjof Berge, co-founder and chief business officer at Antler, told CNBC Make It that the key qualities in founders have shifted to being able to \"move fast and break things,\" and \"continuously iterate and test and improve.\"Berge said: \"It's perhaps even more important now to experiment ... while other things which are still important but less important now is having been in an industry for a long time or learn the playbooks for how to traditionally think about scaling a new company.\" Corporate experience 'matters less'Fridtjof explained that the expectations for industry experience in founders is now seen as less pivotal than being scrappy and entrepreneurial. \"I think that as I've been reflecting on this ... the willingness and ability to experiment in the age of AI probably counts as more important than traditional corporate experience or corporate tenure,\" he said. Fridjtoff added that it \"matters less\" to have lots of experience in traditional company building and that it can, in fact, backfire. \"You might not think with a blank-slate state,\" he said. \"I think that to be technically fluent with a lot of the really emerging latest and greatest technology, it sometimes helps to be young, because that's what you've learned recently in your training,\" he added. In fact, Antler's report found that AI startups are indeed scaling two years faster than all other industries, reaching unicorn status in an average of 4.7 years. Examples of rapidly scaling AI startups in 2025 were Mistral, Lovable, and Suno AI. And as Zuckerberg's own example proves, executing on a wild idea in a college dorm room can lead to phenomenal success.\"He was extremely young, and definitely has adapted, adjusted, and is now scaling one of the biggest companies in the world,\" Berge said. Venture Capital firm Leonis, released its Leonis AI 100 report in November, and also found that AI startup founders were a median age of 29 at founding. Most founders are in their mid-to late-20s, often coming straight from academia or research labs rather than corporate careers.Berge noted that while 20-somethings have qualities that allow companies to move quickly, leadership can often change hands as the firm matures. \"I guess it's nothing new that early or young founders start companies ... but it doesn't guarantee that all of the ones creating unicorns now will be the ones leading those companies in five to 10 years,\" He added.

    "body": "Signage at the Broadcom Inc. headquarters in San Jose, California, June 2, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesInvestors contended with bank earnings and geopolitical tensions this week, but the ongoing volatility may help uncover a few attractive stock picks.Stock ratings from top Wall Street analysts can help inform investors as they search for opportunities in the market. These experts arrive at their recommendations following a thorough analysis of the macro and micro factors affecting a company.Here are three stocks favored by some of Wall Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.BroadcomThis week's first pick is Broadcom (AVGO), a semiconductor and infrastructure software provider. The company's custom chips or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, or ASICs, are seeing strong demand amid the ongoing artificial intelligence boom.Following an investor meeting with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom's semiconductor solutions group, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon reiterated a buy rating on Broadcom stock with a price target of $475. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on AVGO stock with a price target of $393.The meeting made Rasgon conclude that investor concerns about the impact of rising competition and customer-owned tooling on Broadcom's AI positioning are \"hugely overblown and that the company is unlikely to be dethroned in the ASIC space anytime soon.\"While Broadcom acknowledges that Nvidia (NVDA) is innovating faster than anyone else, Rasgon noted that the company is confident about being the only partner that can help XPU customers keep up. With innovation related to 3D chip stacking and 400G SerDes to a massive supply chain and in-house substrate production, Broadcom is progressing in a way that no one can match, the five-star analyst noted.Broadcom is also expected to benefit from the growing demand for Alphabet-owned Google's ($GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, given its partnership with Google in developing these chips. Rasgon highlighted Kawwas' commentary about TPU v7 (ironwood) shipments rising from hundreds of thousands of units in 2025 to \"many many millions\" in 2026. He added that TPU v8 shipments are expected to touch hundreds of thousands of units per month in a few months, and millions by the end of this year. Also, Rasgon noted that the $73 billion order figure given at AVGO's earnings release is substantially higher today.Rasgon ranks No. 120 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 68% of the time, delivering an average return of 30.7%. See Broadcom Statistics on TipRanks. AirbnbTravel stock Airbnb (ABNB) is next on the list. In his research note on the outlook for the U.S. internet space, Mizuho analyst Lloyd Walmsley named Airbnb as one of the top ideas for 2026. The analyst reaffirmed a buy rating on ABNB stock with a price target of $156. TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on Airbnb stock with a price target of $153.Walmsley expects room nights (a key metric in the hospitality industry) growth to reaccelerate, driven by Airbnb's strategy to add hotels to its supply; book now, pay later expansion; and easier comparisons in the domestic market.\"We see Airbnb's forthcoming AI product as a call option and see better prospects here than with other OTAs [online travel agents] given the product-focused leadership,\" said Walmsley.The five-star analyst contends that investors are underappreciating Airbnb's prospects and its potential to reaccelerate room nights growth. Walmsley believes that the company's strength will become more evident this year when it rolls out its hotel strategy in three test markets and expands into more cities, possibly in late 2026. The analyst also expects Airbnb's decision to add hotel inventory to broaden the company's addressable market beyond traditional short-term rentals.Walmsley expects the hotel expansion, along with the book now, pay later conversion benefits, to reaccelerate growth in the second half of 2026 and lift ABNB stock's valuation multiple.Walmsley ranks No. 158 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.1%. See Airbnb Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. Meta PlatformsWalmsley also named social media giant Meta Platforms (META) as one of his top ideas in the internet space for 2026. The top-rated analyst reiterated a buy rating on META stock with a price target of $815. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on META stock with a price target of $753.Walmsley expects META stock to rise from current levels, given that Wall Street's estimates have already priced in the company's high costs and capital spending. He expects upside in revenue and the company's progress on the AI front to reduce investors' fears about elevated spending.\"We believe Meta shares work on positive revisions and multiple expansion as the company better demonstrates returns on its massive AI investment,\" Walmsley said.The analyst highlighted that his industry contacts indicated better advertising ROIs, or return on investment, on the platform. Moreover, Walmsley is optimistic about Meta Business AI and the monetization of WhatsApp. Also, he sees strength in AI/ML, or machine learning, engagement and ad targeting benefits to bolster revenue growth in 2026.Walmsley expects Meta Platforms to roll out improved quality for large language model and product capability, which he believes will quell investors' concerns about the company's high investments. The analyst is also encouraged by the company's cost management efforts and focus on optimizing Reality Labs expenses.See Meta Platforms Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett is used to giving advice. For decades, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman has sat before a packed arena during his company's annual shareholder meetings, fielding investor questions on everything from artificial intelligence to the ins and outs of the insurance business to marriage advice. In \"Warren Buffett: A Life and Legacy,\" which airs on Jan. 18 at 3 p.m. E.T. on CNBC, Becky Quick asks the Oracle of Omaha about some of the toughest questions and best advice he's ever given. Buffett eventually arrives at a challenge he used to pose to college students. Buffett would ask the students to consider a scenario in which, given a class of 300 or so of their peers, they could receive 10% of the lifetime earnings of five of them. Who would they choose — and why? And who would they sell short? The people you chose, he says, wouldn't necessarily be the best looking or the smartest or the most athletic. \"Of course, I explained at the end, you can be the person that you would buy,\" Buffett says. \"There is nothing impossible. Because it isn't whether you can throw a football 60 yards, and it … isn't the one with the highest IQ. You can be one of the five.\" How to get on the listSo what could get you on the list of someone with high expected lifetime earnings? \"It's luck, a lot of it. If you choose the right parents, you're rich when you come out,\" Buffett says. \"You've won the lottery — the ovarian lottery.\"But Buffett told students they could still be one of the people in the room their classmates should bet on. \"You can do it by being a good person, by reading a lot, by spending less than you take in,\" he says. \"I just told them you can spend 110% of what you earn once, and then you used it up. The rest of your life you're underwater.\"Buffett makes sure to emphasize the latter point. While certain types of loans, such as a mortgage, may make sense in some instances, you generally want to avoid going into debt, Buffett says. \"Beyond a certain point, if you get in a hole or anything, it is difficult to dig out,\" he says. \"It isn't that it's impossible, and I give credit to people to do it. But do it the easy way.\"Of course, you're not going to end up being one of the top earners among your peers if you don't work hard and focus on self-improvement, Buffett says. He recalls longtime partner Charlie Munger's habit of \"selling himself\" his most productive hour of the day — spending one hour each morning focusing exclusively on improving his mind and selling the rest of his working ours to clients.\"That's not crazy,\" Buffett says. \"Your future is your future, and you can't expect anybody else to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Bozoma Saint John doesn't shrink away from the spotlight.Saint John, 48, was Netflix's first Black C-level executive as their chief marketing officer. She became Uber's first chief branding officer tasked with rehabbing the rideshare company's image. And she made headlines in 2016 when she shook up the stage at Apple's annual conference despite not looking like a typical \"Apple fan boy,\" she says.Saint John's career moves are as as bold as her personal style. And she has what she considers some well-meaning but misguided advice to thank for that.\"An early manager told me never to wear red lipstick or red nail polish,\" Saint John tells CNBC Make It when asked about the best career advice she's ever gotten.\"She did it with good intention, like, 'You walk into a room and you don't want to be too bold. You don't want people to make opinions of you before you even open your mouth,'\" Saint John says. But \"that made me question my appearance in rooms. Being a Black woman who's quite tall and bold in her wardrobe, I found that it really shrank me.\"Saint John says she decided to ignore that advice and flip it on its head to \"be the most colorful, the boldest, the sharpest, the wittiest in a room, and feel very confident in it.\"\"I've been able to be successful because I didn't take that advice,\" she says.Saint John continues to go after big changes in her career, becoming a first-time CEO for her own hair and beauty brand, Eve by Boz, and most recently adding \"reality TV star\" to her resume a cast member of Bravo's \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" and as co-host of NBC's \"On Brand with Jimmy Fallon.\"And she wants you to go after your big career swings, too.With people approaching a new year with new work goals, Saint John says it's a good time as any to go after what you really want in your career. \"That the pivot can happen any moment,\" she says.Here, Saint John draws on her own career and experience managing thousands to share the signs it's time to quit a job, how to shape your professional brand, a major red flag when interviewing with companies, and more.When you know it's time to quit a jobMy advice is usually if you get the Sunday scaries, you're definitely in the wrong place. If you are coming back from the holiday and you feel the ache in your stomach that you don't want to go back to your job, or you're dreading it so much so that you can barely sleep, then I think that's a pretty big indication that you've got to go now.The big mistake people when going after a raise, promotion or quittingIf you want a promotion or more experiences within your job, set a timeline by which you can hit that goal or decide it's time to leave. Create a timeline with your boss.A lot of times people approach that promotion or the raise conversation from a very self-centered standpoint. What the company and your manager wants to hear is how it's going to help the company and the wider community of your colleagues.So if you position it as: \"By March 1, I want to be promoted to X position, and this is how I'm going to execute my job to get take on more responsibility or help the company achieve X, Y and Z goal,' that gives you some building blocks and a timeline to get to March 1. When you're mid-career trying to get to the next step, you should absolutely have a plan to make sure that you're talking to your boss with a timeline in mind.It's such a mistake to think that this is all you, that you've got to put in the ideas for how you're going to get ahead. If you don't include your manager in your timeline, they have no idea what what goal you're trying to hit.Lay the groundwork so that by the time you have that conversation, everybody is well aware that either you've hit the goal to get that raise or promotion, and if you do your part and don't have it by March 1, everybody's on the same page: 'I'm quitting.'How to be in control of your own professional brandRegardless of if you're on TV or you're sitting in a cubicle, I believe your personal brand  is important, and to some degree you don't have control. So you have to take as much control as possible. If you're sitting a cubicle in an open floor plan and somebody doesn't appreciate your work, your responsibility is to make sure that the brand narrative about yourself is that you're hardworking or that you're creative or that you're a problem solver. Do as much as you can to communicate that brand the same way that you would in front of a camera.The No. 1 quality she hires forThis is the No. 1 thing: Bring your full self. Don't try to cut down the edges of yourself so that you can fit in better. The way that you make yourself memorable is to actually be memorable. There are so many beautifully unique things about each of us, our experiences, the history that we come with, that weaving that into your answers and into the conversation that you're having is actually what's going to make somebody remember you.We often think that as human beings, we have to have similar interests or similar tastes with somebody so that they get along with us and want to hire us. And I think it's actually quite the opposite. Curiosity, wanting to know somebody because you're like, 'They're from this place, or they've had this experience, and that could add to the job because I don't have that experience' is actually how you want to be perceived in an interview. Her biggest red flag to look for when interviewing with a companyIf you're in an interview, and the person who's talking to you makes it sound as if they're looking for somebody who's just like them, run. Run fast, far and away.You want to be in a place that is going to appreciate and love the unique contribution that you're bringing to the job. And it's not just about your business experience.

    "body": "Everyday living costs play a major role in how much money you need to retire.A new state-by-state analysis from personal finance website GOBankingRates shows that the estimated total savings needed to retire at 65 can differ by as much as $1.46 million depending on where you live.In Hawaii, retirees need about $2.2 million to stop working at 65 and cover essential living expenses for 25 years, including housing, groceries, transportation, utilities and health-care costs. That is the highest estimated minimum of any state. By comparison, Oklahoma has the lowest estimated total, at $735,284, to cover the same basic costs.The analysis is based on the average living costs for retirees 65 or older in each state, drawn from the latest data published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. From there, GOBankingRates subtracted average Social Security payments and estimated the savings needed to cover the remaining expenses using an annual 4% withdrawal rate. The resulting figures represent a baseline for covering essential costs and don't factor in discretionary spending such as travel, dining or entertainment. Additionally, the estimates don't account for factors such as inflation, lifestyle changes or unexpected costs.Housing is the biggest factor in annual retirement costs, as it varies by roughly $30,000 annually between states. Utilities and health-care costs can range by as much as $5,000 annually, the study finds.Here's a look the minimum amount of savings needed to retire at 65 in each state, in alphabetical order.AlabamaAnnual cost of living: $53,999Savings you need to retire: $789,037AlaskaAnnual cost of living: $78,449Savings you need to retire: $1,400,286ArizonaAnnual cost of living: $66,838Savings you need to retire: $1,110,019ArkansasAnnual cost of living: $54,859Savings you need to retire: $810,538CaliforniaAnnual cost of living: $83,978Savings you need to retire: $1,538,508ColoradoAnnual cost of living: $63,091Savings you need to retire: $1,016,336ConnecticutAnnual cost of living: $70,094Savings you need to retire: $1,191,417DelawareAnnual cost of living: $63,152Savings you need to retire: $1,017,871FloridaAnnual cost of living: $61,125Savings you need to retire: $967,190GeorgiaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933HawaiiAnnual cost of living: $110,393Savings you need to retire: $2,198,902IdahoAnnual cost of living: $60,818Savings you need to retire: $959,511IllinoisAnnual cost of living: $58,913Savings you need to retire: $911,901IndianaAnnual cost of living: $55,657Savings you need to retire: $830,504IowaAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896KansasAnnual cost of living: $54,613Savings you need to retire: $804,395KentuckyAnnual cost of living: $56,456Savings you need to retire: $850,469LouisianaAnnual cost of living: $56,947Savings you need to retire: $862,756MaineAnnual cost of living: $70,155Savings you need to retire: $1,192,953MarylandAnnual cost of living: $73,043Savings you need to retire: $1,265,135MassachusettsAnnual cost of living: $92,639Savings you need to retire: $1,755,055MichiganAnnual cost of living: $58,176Savings you need to retire: $893,472MinnesotaAnnual cost of living: $57,869Savings you need to retire: $885,793MississippiAnnual cost of living: $52,524Savings you need to retire: $752,178MissouriAnnual cost of living: $54,674Savings you need to retire: $805,931MontanaAnnual cost of living: $67,452Savings you need to retire: $1,125,377NebraskaAnnual cost of living: $56,272Savings you need to retire: $845,862NevadaAnnual cost of living: $60,572Savings you need to retire: $953,368New HampshireAnnual cost of living: $67,084Savings you need to retire: $1,116,163New JerseyAnnual cost of living: $70,401Savings you need to retire: $1,199,096New MexicoAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684New YorkAnnual cost of living: $77,773Savings you need to retire: $1,383,392North CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $59,835Savings you need to retire: $934,938North DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,087Savings you need to retire: $841,254OhioAnnual cost of living: $57,009Savings you need to retire: $864,291OklahomaAnnual cost of living: $51,849Savings you need to retire: $735,284OregonAnnual cost of living: $68,681Savings you need to retire: $1,156,093PennsylvaniaAnnual cost of living: $59,650Savings you need to retire: $930,331Rhode IslandAnnual cost of living: $69,664Savings you need to retire: $1,180,666South CarolinaAnnual cost of living: $56,825Savings you need to retire: $859,684South DakotaAnnual cost of living: $56,395Savings you need to retire: $848,933TennesseeAnnual cost of living: $55,473Savings you need to retire: $825,896TexasAnnual cost of living: $55,780Savings you need to retire: $833,575UtahAnnual cost of living: $60,879Savings you need to retire: $961,047VermontAnnual cost of living: $69,848Savings you need to retire: $1,185,274VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $61,493Savings you need to retire: $976,405WashingtonAnnual cost of living: $69,971Savings you need to retire: $1,188,345West VirginiaAnnual cost of living: $54,122Savings you need to retire: $792,109WisconsinAnnual cost of living: $60,019Savings you need to retire: $939,546WyomingAnnual cost of living: $58,545Savings you need to retire: $902,686Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "U.S.President Donald Trump arrives at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, in Michigan, U.S., January 13, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEight NATO members' goods sent to the U.S. will face escalating tariffs \"until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\" President Donald Trump announced Saturday.The tariffs targeting Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will start at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The tariffs will shoot up to 25% on June 1, the president said.The penalties would presumably stack on top of the existing U.S. tariffs already levied on goods from these countries.Tariffs imposed by the U.S. on its allies already average about 15% on goods from the European Union countries in Trump's crosshairs and roughly 10% on imports from the United Kingdom, with rates varying by sector. In sensitive areas such as metals and certain autos, stacked measures have already pushed effective tariffs into the mid-teens to mid-20% range.The imposition of tariffs on one or more members of the EU, which comprises 27 nations, means the new tariffs would apply to all. Trump's demands now threaten the EU-U.S. trade agreement struck in August. Manfred Weber, a senior member of the European Parliament (MEP), said the EU trade deal with the U.S. is \"not possible at this stage.\"\"The EPP is in favour of the EU-U.S. trade deal, but given Donald Trump's threats regarding Greenland, approval is not possible at this stage,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"The 0% tariffs on U.S. products must be put on hold.\"Ambassadors from the EU will convene for an emergency meeting on Sunday, Reuters reported. Cyprus, which holds the six-month rotating EU presidency, called the meeting, which is set to start at 5 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET).Tariff strategyTrump's post suggested that the new tariffs on European allies are being imposed in response to the countries' moving troops to Greenland. They took that step as the Trump administration has floated utilizing the U.S. military as part of its ramped-up efforts to acquire the Danish territory.The eight countries \"have journeyed to Greenland, for purposes unknown,\" Trump wrote. \"This is a very dangerous situation for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Planet.\"A day earlier, Trump hinted that he may pursue a tariff strategy on Greenland similar to the one he used to force foreign countries to lower drug prices.\"I may do that for Greenland too. I may put a tariff on countries if they don't go along with Greenland, because we need Greenland for national security,\" he said at the White House on Friday.While the president did not cite specific legal statutes in his Truth Social announcement for his latest moves, it appears to mirror his controversial use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law that grants the president broad powers during an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"The Supreme Court could rule as soon as next week on whether to strike down the tariffs imposed under that law and could immediately imperil this new tranche, effectively daring the judiciary to intervene in a fresh trade war.Scott Lincicome, a trade policy scholar at the Cato Institute, warned Saturday that the new threat exposes the fragility of relying on unilateral deals rather than binding treaties.\"Trump's tariff announcement confirms... that his trade deals can be changed on a whim and are unlikely to constrain his daily tariff impulses,\" Lincicome said in a statement. \"Today's threat underscores the empty justifications for Trump's so-called 'emergency' tariffs, which reveal the economic and geopolitical problems that unbounded executive power creates.\"Military personnel believed to be from the German armed Forces Bundeswehr disembark a charter plane upon arrival at Nuuk international airport on Jan. 16, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland, the day after it arrived transporting Danish military personnel.Alessandro Rampazzo | AFP | Getty ImagesEuropean responseAcross Europe, the targeted nations responded with condemnation, characterizing the tariffs as a hostile act against close military allies that threatens the very fabric of the trans-Atlantic partnership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spearheads the bloc's trade policy, issued a sharp rebuke to the White House's ultimatum, framing the tariffs not just as a trade dispute but as a test of Western values.\"We choose partnership and cooperation,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post on Bluesky shortly after the announcement. \"We choose our businesses. We choose our people.\"Likewise, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told MS Now Saturday that Trump's move came as a \"surprise,\" citing a recent \"constructive meeting\" with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Frederiksen pushed back on Trump's claims regarding troop movements, stating the increased presence is strictly to \"enhance security\" in an Arctic region that is \"no longer a low tension area,\" and was done in \"full transparency\" with U.S. allies.Other European leaders were equally firm. European Council President Antonio Costa said Saturday that the bloc is \"coordinating a joint response\" to the threat.\"The European Union will always be very firm in defending international law, wherever it may be,\" Costa said at a press conference Saturday following the signing of a trade agreement between the EU and South American nations in Paraguay.French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in, posting on X that \"no intimidation nor threat will influence us.\" Macron warned that \"stabilizing forces have awakened\" and vowed that France would stand firm alongside its neighbors.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson sternly rejected Trump's tariff threats.\"We will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed,\" he wrote on X, adding that \"only Denmark and Greenland decide on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\"EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned that the new tariffs play right into the hands of China and Russia. \"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies,\" she wrote in a post on X. \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO.\"A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersNATO strain and legal battlesTrump's latest move puts further strain on NATO, the 32-member military alliance established after World War II. The cornerstone of the alliance is an agreement that an attack on any single member is considered an attack on them all.European leaders have warned that any attempt by the U.S. to take Greenland by force could spell the end of NATO.Trump's tariff announcement could signal he is dropping the threat of military action to achieve his longtime goal of taking over the island. But it nevertheless ratchets up pressure on Denmark and the rest of Europe, which have flatly stated that Greenland is not for sale.Some cautioned European leaders to avoid reacting hastily to Trump's tariff threat.\"Just ignore it and wait and see,\" Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING Research, told Reuters. \"Europe has shown that it will not accept everything, and so the tariffs are actually already a step forward compared to the threatened military invasion.\"Lawmakers push for de-escalationAs the White House ramped up pressure, a bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation in Copenhagen pushed back against Trump's narrative.\"There are no pressing security threats to Greenland,\" Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters Saturday morning.Coons and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, led the trip to \"restore a sense of trust\" with Greenland, Coons said. The two senators disputed Trump's characterization of European troop movements as a conspiracy to block U.S. acquisition of the island, instead praising the deployments as NATO partners \"stepping up,\" Coons said, to secure the High North against Russian aggression.\"Seeing active training and deployments into one of the harshest, most remote places on Earth... we should take as an encouraging signal,\" Coons said.Murkowski emphasized that despite the president's attacks, support for Denmark remains strong across party lines. \"You cannot allow this to become a partisan matter,\" she said. \"Support for our friends and allies... should not be.\"Likewise, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C., both members of the Bipartisan Senate NATO Observer Group, warned that threatening tariffs on NATO would raise costs for U.S. families while benefiting adversaries like Russia and China. In a joint statement, the lawmakers said: \"Continuing down this path is bad for America, bad for American businesses and bad for America's allies… At a time when many Americans are already concerned about the cost of living, these tariffs would raise prices for both families and businesses.\"The lawmakers said Danish and Greenlandic officials want to \"partner with the United States,\" urging the administration to \"turn off the threats and turn on diplomacy.\"— Terri Cullen contributed to this report.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week.

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Prime Minister Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region. CNBC has reached out to the White House and the Treasury Department to clarify what statute Trump is using to impose the new European tariffs.This story is developing.

    "body": "Coolpicture | Moment | Getty ImagesAs you gauge how much income you'll need to pay for your living expenses in retirement, don't forget to consider how you'll cover unexpected costs.More than 8 in 10 retiree households — 83% — will face unplanned outlays in any given year, according to new research from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. Among households that do experience unexpected expenses, the average annual amount spent across retirement is $6,000. Measured another way, the typical household will spend an amount equivalent to 10% of its yearly income.Yet many households don't have that available in emergency savings, according to the research. While roughly 58% have enough cash to cover unplanned costs for a single year, around 16% would have to tap their 401(k) or other retirement accounts and the rest — about 27% — would fall short even after using all their cash and retirement assets.\"About 40% of [retired] households do not have enough cash to cover even a single year [of unplanned expenses], let alone their whole retirement,\" the research notes. The research uses data from 3,427 retired households that have been part of the 2000-2020 Health and Retirement Study and the Consumption and Activities Mail Survey, both from the University of Michigan.It's important to have some cash savingsWhile experts generally recommend nonretirees have three to six months of living expenses set aside as emergency savings in case of job loss or other financial shocks, that amount may look different for retirees — who must figure out how to stretch their savings across what may be a decades-long retirement.As many retirees struggle to keep up with prices that continue to rise, considering unexpected expenses is an important part of evaluating retirement readiness.\"That helps you plan for liquidity versus your income needs,\" said Anqi Chen, co-author of the report and associate director of savings and household finance at the Center for Retirement Research.While some households may struggle to set aside money, \"even small amounts of savings will help provide some sort of buffer for when these events occur,\" Chen said.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

For example, about 45% of households with less than $50,000 in income face a rainy day or health-care shock in a given year, compared with 80% of those with $100,000 or more in income.\"This finding highlights the fact that households have some control over when and how much they spend,\" the report notes.Think in terms of 'access to cash for surprises'So how much should you have set aside? Depending on a retiree's individual situation, financial advisors may recommend anywhere from three or six months' worth of expenses to a couple of years — or a variation of those parameters. Much of it will depend on your individual situation.\"What we usually tell clients is to think less in terms of months of expenses and more in terms of access to cash for surprises — health-care costs, home repairs or family needs,\" said certified financial planner Joon Um, a tax advisor with Secure Tax & Accounting in Beverly Hills, California.\"For many retirees, that ends up being one year of core expenses, adjusted for guaranteed income like Social Security or pensions,\" Um said.The right amount depends on health, housing, income stability and how flexible other assets are, Um said.\"Retirees with steady income and liquid portfolios may need less cash, while those with higher medical risk or less flexibility need more,\" Um said. \"The goal isn't to maximize cash. It's to have enough on hand to avoid selling long-term investments at the wrong time.\"In other words, if you don't have enough cash set aside, you could be put in a position of selling investments when the market is down.Avoid having too much in cashHowever, having too much in cash comes with its own risks, said Peter Lazaroff, a chartered financial analyst and CFP, and the chief investment officer at Plancorp in St. Louis.\"Any time a retiree has more than two years of expenses in cash, it's too much,\" Lazaroff said. \"From purely a mathematical standpoint, you're giving up too much of a return.\"The biggest risk to your cash is inflation, he said. The latest reading of the consumer price index showed an annual inflation rate of 2.7% in December. \"Your cash just becomes less valuable every year,\" he said. \"You're putting your purchasing power at risk.\"He recommends stashing your cash in a high-yield savings account — which right now generally earns more than 3% in interest, according to Bankrate — to help minimize the impact of inflation.",

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Education Department announced on Friday that it will delay the implementation of wage garnishment and other involuntary collection efforts affecting defaulted student loan borrowers.The department said the delay affects involuntary collections on federal student loans through wage garnishments and the Treasury Offset Program, which is used to seize some or all of borrowers' payments from the government, including tax refunds and Social Security benefits.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageUnexpected expenses take 10% of retirees' income, on average, research showsMore employers worry about workers' financial wellbeing, research showsRepublicans want to end the 'marriage penalty' for this childcare tax creditEducation Department to delay collections on defaulted student loansTrump pitches direct payments for health care.

Before that announcement, collections had been paused since 2020 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Student loan borrowers who fail to make on-time monthly payments for more than 270 days are typically considered in default on their loans. At that point, the federal government has the right to seize up to 15% of borrowers' after-tax wages — as well as a portion of their Social Security income and entire tax refunds, where applicable — to repay the debt. Roughly 5 million borrowers were in default, and that number was expected to grow to nearly 10 million in the coming months, the Department of Education said in April. Around 9 million people are currently in default on their education debt, according to a recent estimate by Protect Borrowers, an advocacy organization.After the initial announcement about collection efforts, the agency has changed course on the policy several times. In June, it paused the plan to garnish Social Security payments.Then in December, the department confirmed around 1,000 borrowers would receive notification of intent to garnish wages during the week of Jan. 7, with more notices to follow. On Jan. 7, Protect Borrowers sent a letter to McMahon cosigned by the NAACP, American Federation of Teachers and several other organizations, urging the department to \"immediately halt its plan to resume garnishment of millions of struggling borrowers' wages.\"\"After months of pressure and countless horror stories from borrowers, the Trump Administration says it has abandoned plans to snatch working people's hard-earned money directly from their paychecks simply for falling behind on their student loans,\" Aissa Canchola Bañez, policy director at Protect Borrowers, said in a statement.— CNBC reporter Annie Nova contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Recently the Australian Senate passed a law to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X. Matt Cardy | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAustralia's social media ban for children under the age of 16 has grabbed global attention, and governments worldwide are considering implementing similar policies, with the U.K. seen as likely to be next. The Australian government's Online Safety Amendment Act came into effect on December 10, and included major social media platforms, including Reddit, X, Meta's Instagram, Alphabet's YouTube, Bytedance's TikTok. The platforms were forced to implement age verification methods to ensure under-16s are unable to create an account, and the companies can face fines up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) for not complying. Although teenagers, tech giants, and experts have had mixed reactions since the ban came into force, governments globally are drafting bills to implement an Australia-style ban. \"This is a global issue, and governments everywhere are under pressure to respond,\" Daisy Greenwell, co-founder of U.K.-based Smartphone Free Childhood, told CNBC. SFC is a grassroots campaign urging parents to delay giving children smartphones and social media access.\"We're already seeing countries move in this direction, and as confidence builds and evidence accumulates, more will follow. No one thinks the status quo is working for children, parents, or society – and this is one of the clearest policy responses currently on the table,\" Greenwell added. Other countries that are considering an under-16s social media ban include the U.K., France, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Italy and Greece. The U.S. is trailing behind on this front with a national ban being unlikely, however there is certainly state and local interest, according to Ravi Iyer, a managing director of the University of Southern California Marshall School's Neely Center. Iyer has worked closely with social psychologist Jonathon Haidt who wrote the renowned book The Anxious Generation, about the harmful impacts of social media and smartphones on children and teens. \"It's really hard to predict Federal policy, but it is one of the few bipartisan issues left, so it certainly is possible,\" Iyer said in emailed comments. \"I'm more confident at the state level and I believe we will see a few U.S. states enact such a policy in the next couple years.\"Lawmakers in California and Texas are looking at bringing in state-level bans in 2026. But governments looking to implement such bans could face resistance from the tech giants. Following Australia's move, community-focused forum Reddit launched a lawsuit, arguing that the new law goes too far by restricting political discussion online. Facebook and Instagram owner Meta urged Canberra to reconsider the ban. And in a statement to users explaining how the restrictions work, Elon Musk's X said: \"It's not our choice – it's what the Australian law requires.\"U.K. set to vote on social media ban Meanwhile, calls for a social media ban for under-16s in the U.K. have grown rapidly at the beginning of this year. The U.K.'s House of Lords is expected to vote this week to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to include a social media ban for under-16s. Greenwell's SFC launched an email campaign this week, which saw more than 100,000 emails sent to local U.K. lawmakers. The SFC template email urged the government to set \"reasonable, age-appropriate boundaries that protect children's wellbeing.\" \"We consistently see that the more time children spend on smartphones and social media, the worse their mental health outcomes tend to be. If these platforms are no longer available, the network effects collapse – and young people can reconnect with each other and with the real world,\" Greenwell told CNBC. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has even backed the idea saying \"we need to better protect children from social media\" and that he's studying Australia's ban. \"All options are on the table in relation to what further protections we can put in place - whether that's under-16s on social media or an issue I am very concerned about, under fives and screen time,\" Starmer said last week. \"Children are turning up age four at reception [the first year of school] having spent far too much time on screens,\" he added.Meanwhile, U.K. health secretary Wes Streeting asked The Anxious Generation author Haidt to address his officials at an event to push for stricter limits on young people. France is also a strong contender as it debates two bills, one backed by French President Emmanuel Macron, to prevent social media access for under 15s, France24 reported last week. France's public health watchdog ANSES outlined that social media's negative effects are \"numerous\" and well documented. USC's Iyer said that if a teen ban becomes a global norm, it alleviates the pressure on young people to self-police. \"One of the primary goals of the law is to change the norm, such that teens don't feel pressure to use social media because all their friends are doing so\" Iyer said. \"It's not really a realistic choice to abstain if you feel that all your friends are using a particular platform. If we can solve that problem and the majority of teens are off of social media, we'll have done a lot of good,\" he added. Read more",

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, on Feb. 3, 2025.Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesIn November, following Nvidia's latest earnings beat, CEO Jensen Huang boasted to investors about his company's position in artificial intelligence and said about the hottest startup in the space, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"While it's true that Nvidia maintains a dominant position in AI chips and is now the most valuable company in the world, competition is emerging, and OpenAI is doing everything it can to diversify as it pursues a historically aggressive expansion plan. On Wednesday, OpenAI announced a $10 billion deal with chipmaker Cerebras, a relatively nascent player in the space but one that's angling for the public market. It was the latest in a string of deals between OpenAI and the companies making the processors needed to build large language models and run increasingly sophisticated workloads. Last year, OpenAI committed more than $1.4 trillion to infrastructure deals with companies including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom, en route to commanding a $500 billion private market valuation. As OpenAI races to meet anticipated demand for its AI technology, it has signaled to the market that it wants as much processing power as it can find. Here are the major chip deals that OpenAI has signed as of January, and potential partners to keep an eye on in the future. Nvidia Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesSince its early days building out large language models, long before the launch of ChatGPT and the start of the generative AI boom, OpenAI has relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units. In 2025, that relationship went to another level. Following an investment in OpenAI in late 2024, Nvidia announced in September that it would commit $100 billion to support OpenAI as it builds and deploys at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems. A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration. Huang said in September that 10 gigawatts will equate to between 4 million and 5 million GPUs. \"This is a giant project,\" Huang told CNBC at the time. OpenAI and Nvidia said the first phase of the project is expected to come online in the second half of this year on Nvidia's Vera Rubin platform. However, during Nvidia's quarterly earnings call in November, the company said there is \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI will progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. Nvidia's first investment of $10 billion will be deployed when the first gigawatt is completed, and investments will be made at then-current valuations, as CNBC previously reported.AMDLisa Su, chair and chief executive officer of Advanced Micro Devices Inc., displays an AMD Instinct MI455X GPU during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn October, OpenAI announced plans to deploy six gigawatts of AMD's GPUs across multiple years and multiple generations of hardware. As part of the deal, AMD has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of AMD common stock, which could amount to a roughly 10% stake in the company. The warrant includes vesting milestones tied to both deployment volume and AMD's share price.The companies said they plan to roll out the first gigawatt of chips in the second half of 2026, and added that the deal is worth billions of dollars, without disclosing a specific amount. \"You need partnerships like this that really bring the ecosystem together to ensure that, you know, we can really get the best technologies, you know, out there,\" AMD CEO Lisa Su told CNBC at the time of the announcement.Altman planted the seeds for the deal in June, when he appeared on stage alongside Su at an AMD launch event in San Jose, California. He said OpenAI planned to use AMD's latest chips. Broadcom Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersLater that month, OpenAI and Broadcom publicly unveiled a collaboration that had been in the works for well over a year.Broadcom calls its custom AI chips XPUs, and has thus far relied on a few customers. But its pipeline of potential deals has sparked so much enthusiasm on Wall Street that Broadcom is now valued at over $1.6 trillion.OpenAI said it's designing its own AI chips and systems that will be developed and distributed by Broadcom. The companies have agreed to deploy 10 gigawatts of these custom AI accelerators.In the October release, the companies said Broadcom will aim to begin deploying racks of the AI accelerator and network systems by the second half of this year, with a goal to complete the project by the end of 2029.But Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told investors during the company's quarterly earnings call in December that he doesn't expect much revenue from the OpenAI partnership in 2026.\"We appreciate the fact that it is a multiyear journey that will run through 2029,\" Tan said. \"I call it an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed.\"  OpenAI and Broadcom did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.  Cerebras Andrew Feldman, co-founder and CEO of Cerebras Systems, speaks at the Collision conference in Toronto, June 20, 2024.Ramsey Cardy | Sportsfile | Collision | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Wednesday announced an agreement to deploy 750 megawatts of Cerebras' AI chips that will come online across multiple tranches through 2028. Cerebras builds large wafer-scale chips that can deliver responses up to 15 times faster than GPU-based systems, according to a release. The company is much smaller than Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom.OpenAI's deal with Cerebras is worth more than $10 billion, and it could be a boon for the chipmaker as it weighs a potential debut on the public markets. \"We are delighted to partner with OpenAI, bringing the world's leading AI models to the world's fastest AI processor,\" Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman said in a statement. Cerebras sorely needs marquee customers. In October, the company withdrew plans for an IPO, days after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round. It had filed for a public offering a year earlier, but its prospectus revealed a heavy reliance on a single customer in the United Arab Emirates, Microsoft-backed G42, which is also a Cerebras investor.Potential partners Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO, speaks during a media tour of the Stargate data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025. Stargate is a collaboration of OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank, with promotional support from President Donald Trump, to build data centers and other infrastructure for artificial intelligence throughout the U.S.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhere does that leave Amazon, Google and Intel, which all have their own AI chip plays?In November, OpenAI signed a $38 billion cloud deal with Amazon Web Services. OpenAI will run workloads through existing AWS data centers, but the cloud provider also plans to build out additional infrastructure for the startup as part of the agreement. Amazon is also in talks to potentially invest more than $10 billion in OpenAI, as CNBC previously reported. OpenAI could decide to use Amazon's AI chips as part of these investment discussions, but nothing official has been determined, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential. AWS announced its Inferentia chips in 2018, and the latest generation of its Trainium chips in late 2025. Google Cloud also supplies OpenAI with computing capacity thanks to a deal that was quietly finalized last year. But OpenAI said in June that it has no plans to use Google's in-house chips called tensor processing units, which Broadcom also helps produce.  Intel has been the biggest AI laggard among traditional chipmakers, which explains why the company recently took massive investments from the U.S. government and Nvidia. Reuters reported in 2024, citing people with knowledge of the discussions, that Intel had a chance to invest in OpenAI years earlier and potentially make hardware for the then-fledgling startup, offering it a way to avoid reliance on Nvidia.Intel decided against the deal, according to Reuters.In October, Intel announced a new data center GPU that it's codenamed Crescent Island and says is \"designed to meet the growing demands of AI inference workloads and will offer high memory capacity and energy-efficient performance.\" The company said \"customer sampling\" is expected in the second half of 2026.   Wall Street will hear updates on Intel's latest AI efforts when the company kicks off tech earnings season next week. — CNBC's Kif Leswing, MacKenzie Sigalos and Jordan Novet contributed to this report.WATCH: Breaking down AI chips, from Nvidia GPUs to ASICs by Google and Amazonwatch now",

    "body": "World Economic Forum security badgesLeonie Kidd | CNBCDavos SeasonI have been going to the World Economic Forum since 2009, when I was a young news assistant on \"Squawk Box Europe\" and had no idea what I was getting into. Back then, and still now, it is CNBC International's biggest outside broadcast of the year, and it's still thrilling to attend. The heady combination of world leaders, the most powerful players in business and a splash of celebrity — all navigating the snowy streets of Alpine ski resort Davos — makes for a unique experience. CNBC International Team at the World Economic ForumLeonie Kidd | CNBCMany faces of Davos Over the years, I have seen many versions of Davos: the fall-out from the Great Financial Crisis and European debt crunch; the trading scandal that rocked French banking giant Societe Generale; the surge of the Arab Spring; the rise and fall of Russia; the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic and now the upending of the world order that has been in place since the end of the Second World War. Everyone has an opinion about this meeting, but one thing is true — it is never dull. And 2026 will certainly be no different. 'The Spirit of Dialogue' meets rough rhetoricThe tension between countries that call themselves allies is palpable going into this meeting. U.S. President Donald Trump has started 2026 by shocking the international community with a series of actions that challenge sovereignty and alliances that have been in place for decades. His latest threat to impose fresh tariffs on European countries for not supporting his advances on Greenland has drawn sharp criticism from Brussels to Paris, and from Copenhagen and Nuuk. The move will sharpen what was already set to be a tense week in Davos as he will cross paths with European leaders in the hallways of the Congress Centre. He will speak at the Forum on Wednesday, as the global community struggles to assess the impact of his action in Venezuela, his hardline stance towards Iran and slow progress toward a peace deal for Ukraine. The World Economic Forum designated this year as \"The Spirit of Dialogue,\" but the organization itself has warned in its latest Global Risk Report that \"rules and institutions that have long underpinned stability are under siege in a new era in which trade, finance and technology are wielded as weapons of influence.\"watch nowWhat's at stake?Ahead of Trump's speech, we will hear from a number of other world leaders on the first full day of the Forum. This includes European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. It is likely that all three will urge the importance of the role of NATO as it faces the most significant challenge since it's inception. President Trump's threats of military force in Greenland have put what was previously inconceivable — the end of the NATO alliance — on the table. Reports suggest the G7 could convene on the side-lines of the event, ostensibly to progress a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but the tensions with NATO will inevitably be debated. Tuesday will also see Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng speak, as a tentative trade truce seems to be holding with Washington D.C, despite recent data showing China recording the world's largest ever trade surplus for 2025, topping $1 trillion. Corporate leaders with significant interests in China, like Nvidia boss Jensen Huang, will also speak at the Forum as they look to navigate an increasingly political business landscape. Declaration of IndependenceOutside of geopolitics, the debate over the independence of central banks is set to heat up the frosty peaks of Davos. Central bankers across the globe were outraged by the announcement of the Department of Justice launching a criminal probe into Federal Reserve Bank Chair Jerome Powell. In a statement, Powell said the probe \"is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates... or whether monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\" His peers from across the globe issued an astonishing letter of support, including signatures from ECB President Christine Lagarde and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, alongside others. Former ECB boss, Jean-Claude Trichet told Squawk Box Europe that markets were not taking the threat seriously enough, calling the situation \"extremely grave.\"watch nowMy take, for what it's worthIf I had told my 20-something year old self back in 2009 that in 2026 these would be the big debates for Davos, I'm sure I would not have believed it. Today, the influence of the G20 and G7 have been tested, making the World Economic Forum an even rarer occasion for face-to-face diplomacy. As someone who values diplomacy in all aspects of my life — at work, at home, in the content I consume and the people I am influenced by — I hope that cooler heads can prevail in the Alps.Swiss alpine town of DavosLeonie Kidd | CNBCKey speeches this week:Tuesday: European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen; Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, French President Emmanuel MacronWednesday: U.S. President Donald TrumpThursday: Israeli President Isaac Herzog; German Chancellor Friedrich Merz",

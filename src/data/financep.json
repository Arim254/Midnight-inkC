    "body": "PayPal CEO Alex Chriss speaks at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai, India, on Oct. 7, 2025.Indranil Aditya | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPayPal said Monday that it has applied for approval to form PayPal Bank, which would be able to offer loans to small businesses.\"Establishing PayPal Bank will strengthen our business and improve our efficiency, enabling us to better support small business growth and economic opportunities across the U.S.,\" PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said in a statement.The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will review an application proposing the establishment of PayPal Bank, along with Utah's Department of Financial Institutions, PayPal said. The company, which owns popular payment app Venmo, hopes to also offer interest-bearing savings accounts to its customers, the statement said. PayPal already makes credit lines available to consumers and has been trying to expand its roster of banking-like services as it competes with a growing number of fintech companies that are aiming to take business from traditional brick-and-mortar banks.Shares of PayPal rose 1.5% in extended trading following the announcement. In October, PayPal said quarterly revenue increased 7% year over year to $8.42 billion, more than analysts had expected. But in 2025 the stock has slumped about 29%, while the S&P 500 index has gained almost 16% in the same period.WATCH: E-commerce consumption could bump 20% because of agentic AI, says Mizuho's Dan Dolevwatch now",

    "body": "Piotr Swat | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesKorea Zinc shares plunged over 13% on Tuesday, as its largest shareholder is reportedly opposing plans to create a U.S.-backed joint venture that will see a dilution of its equity stake in the South Korean company.  Shares of the world's largest zinc smelting company had climbed over 26% on Monday, before paring gains to 5%, as it announced a $7.4 billion mineral smelter project in Tennessee. The company's largest shareholder alliance is opposing the move and would seek a court injunction to stop the company from issuing new shares.  The Korea Times reported that the alliance, made up of private equity firm MBK Partners and conglomerate YoongPoong, said the plan was designed for company Chairman Choi Yun-beom to hold on to management control.Under the deal, a joint venture company will be set up to build the smelter in Tennessee, with the Pentagon having a 40% stake in the JV. As part of the project, Korea Zinc will sell new shares worth $1.9 billion to this joint venture controlled by the U.S. government and certain U.S.-based strategic investors that have not been named, effectively giving the group 10% stake in the South Korean company. South Korean media outlet Business Korea said that issuing 10% of new shares will reduce the combined Yoong-Poong-MBK stake ratio from about 44% to the \"high 30% range\" while allowing friendly stakes from Choi and the U.S. government to rise to the 40% range. Early Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a post on X that \"Starting in 2026, the United States will have priority access to Korea Zinc's expanded global production, putting American security and manufacturing FIRST.\"The Tennessee project seeks to build an integrated smelter producing base metals as well as critical and strategic minerals, with phased commercial operations targeted for 2029, Korea Zinc said in a statement.The planned critical minerals smelting and processing facility could produce 540,000 tons of materials in the U.S. per year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department, and comes as the U.S. seeks to form critical mineral partnerships that are not dependent on China.",

    "body": "watch nowKevin Hassett's candidacy for the Federal Reserve chair, once seen by the market as almost a sure thing, has received some pushback by high-level people who have the ear of President Donald Trump, according to sources familiar with the matter.There's concern that the National Economic Council director is too close to the president, the sources said, something that ironically made him the frontrunner to replace current chair Jerome Powell in the first place. The pushback could help explain why interviews with candidates were cancelled in early December and then, at least for Warsh, rescheduled for last week.After telling reporters that he knew who he was going to pick for Fed chair, Trump surprised investors Friday when he told the Wall Street Journal in an interview that former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh had moved to the top of the Fed candidates list alongside Hassett. The comments sent Hassett's odds diving on the Kalshi prediction markets.\"I think the two Kevins are great,\" said Trump.Hassett remains the favorite on Kalshi Monday with a 51% chance, although that's down from a high above 80% earlier this month. Warsh's odds are currently 44%, up from around 11% to start December.The pushback has taken more of the form of promoting Warsh, rather than criticizing Hassett. On Thursday at a JPMorgan event, CEO Jamie Dimon spoke favorably of both Hassett and Warsh, but made some comments that made those in the audience believe that Dimon favored the former Fed governor.Bloomberg News reported at the end of November that Hassett had emerged as the frontrunner to replace Powell, whose term ends in May. But as December wore on, according to several sources, Hassett's candidacy received some resistance, with worries growing that the bond market could revolt over time if it sees him as too much in the pocket of Trump. That view could end up having the opposite effect Trump wants, with long-term yields eventually rising on concern Hassett wouldn't do enough to contain inflation should it ever rebound down the road. Perhaps in response to some of this criticism, Hassett was more firm on the question of Fed independence in an interview with CBS News this past weekend. Trump \"has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be,\" said Hassett on \"Face the Nation,\" according to a transcript.When asked if the president's view would carry the same weight as a voting central bank member, Hassett said: \"No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data.\"",

    "body": "Forget toys and collectibles, crypto might be a hot ticket item this holiday season. In the U.S. 45% of Gen Z adults aged 18 to 28 said they would be excited to receive cryptocurrency as a holiday gift this year, according to a global survey of 1,000 adults conducted by payment technology company Visa in October.How wise it is to gift crypto is a separate matter, and the expert advice varies.Given how volatile and speculative cryptocurrencies are, they can be risky and are ill-advised if you're looking to gift an asset that will grow in value, says Flavio Landivar, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor at Evensky and Katz/Foldes Wealth Management in Coral Gables, Florida.Unlike publicly traded stocks or exchange-traded funds that represent ownership of a tangible asset like a business, cryptocurrencies have no \"real, underlying intrinsic value,\" Landivar says.\"It's to be determined exactly how that plays out into the future, but for the time being, it's basically worth what somebody else is willing to pay for it,\" which can lead to erratic changes in value and sudden drops in price that may be unlikely to rebound, Landivar says. Use the gift as a teaching momentIf you decide to give crypto, \"any gift should be positioned as a long-term, educational experience rather than a stable investment,\" says Ashton Lawrence, a CPF and director and senior wealth advisor at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina. If you're looking for an investment that has a higher likelihood of growing over time, stick to exchange-traded funds that track a wide range of equities, he says.Gifts of around $50 during birthdays and holidays are a \"great place to start\" giving crypto, says Mike Casey, a CFP, early bitcoin adopter and president of American Executive Advisors in McLean, Virginia. \"We're not talking about thousands and thousands of dollars.\"Casey recommends gifting bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies since it has the most global adoption and a fixed supply — meaning its value could one day behave as if it were a physical metal, he says. It's also the oldest cryptocurrency, and historically, every time bitcoin has fallen from a high, the value of the currency has rebounded and grown even more, Casey says. In the past five years, the price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars is up nearly $74,000, an increase of just over 400%. The cryptocurrency was trading around $86,000 Monday, 32% down from its all-time high of $126,000 in October. While many gifts can help build financial awareness, Casey says bitcoin's volatile nature makes it uniquely suited to teach the importance of disciplined investing. Tracking that initial gift year over year can help young investors grow comfortable with the natural ups and downs that come with investing, he says.\"This is what investing is all about,\" Casey says. \"We want to have a long-term goal. They're learning that a little bit of volatility is actually OK.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

The word has previously been used primarily to connote a \"product of little value\" or \"food waste fed to animals\" Mainstream social networks saw a flood of AI-generated content, including what 404 Media described as a \"video of a bizarre creature turning into a spider, turning into a nightmare giraffe inside of a busy mall,\" that the publication reported had been viewed more than 362 million times on Meta apps. In September, Meta launched Vibes, a separate feed for AI-generated videos. Days later, OpenAI released its Sora app. Those services, along with TikTok, YouTube and others, are increasingly rife with AI slop, which can often generate revenue with enough engagement. Spotify said in September that it had to remove over 75 million AI-generated, \"spammy tracks\" from its service, and roll out formal policies to protect artists from AI impersonation and deception. The streaming company faced widespread criticism after The Velvet Sundown racked up 1 million monthly listeners on without initially making it clear they produced their songs with generative AI. The artist later clarified on its bio page that it's a \"synthetic music project.\"According to CNBC's latest All-America Economic Survey, published Dec. 15, fewer respondents have been using AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, in the last two to three months compared to the summer months. Just 48% of those surveyed said they had used AI platforms recently, down from 53% in August. WATCH: OpenAI's Sora 2 sparks AI 'slop' backlashwatch now",

Santiago | Getty ImagesNew York Attorney General Letitia James accused delivery giant UPS of cheating seasonal holiday workers out of millions of dollars in legally owed wages, according to a new lawsuit filed Monday.James' office said that an investigation \"found that for years, UPS has shortchanged seasonal workers who keep the company running during peak holiday demand by failing to record all hours worked, requiring widespread off-the-clock labor, and manipulating timekeeping systems to reduce paid hours.\"The suit in Manhattan Supreme Court, filed 10 days before Christmas, alleges that UPS failed to pay seasonal workers minimum wages, promised wages, and overtime wages, in violation of state and federal labor law.\"Each year, UPS commits wage theft against these workers in myriad ways,\" the civil complaint says.The suit notes that during its peak season, which runs from October to January, UPS hires thousands of temporary workers at at least 55 facilities in New York state.UPS, in a statement, said, \"We are aware of the lawsuit by the New York Attorney's General Office. UPS takes all accusations of wrongdoing seriously and denies the unfounded allegation of intentionally underpaying UPS employees.\"\"We offer industry-leading pay and benefits to our more than 26,000 employees in New York, and we remain committed to following all applicable laws,\" the company said.The lawsuit seeks a finding that UPS repeatedly violated wage and labor laws, an injunction barring the company from engaging in the alleged illegal practices, and monetary awards.\"UPS built its holiday business on the backs of workers who were not paid for their time and labor,\" James said in a statement.\"UPS's seasonal employees work brutal hours in the cold to deliver the holiday packages families across the country count on.

    "body": "Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot Corp., speaks during a Prime Air delivery drone reveal event in Las Vegas, June 5, 2019.Joe Buglewicz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesColin Angle, co-founder and former CEO of iRobot, on Monday said the company's move to declare bankruptcy was \"profoundly disappointing\" and \"nothing short of a tragedy for consumers.\"The robotic vacuum pioneer announced Sunday that it filed for bankruptcy and will be taken private by Shenzhen Picea Robotics, a lender and key supplier, following years of financial struggles.\"Today's outcome is profoundly disappointing — and it was avoidable,\" Angle told CNBC in a statement. \"This is nothing short of a tragedy for consumers, the robotics industry and America's innovation economy.\"In a Sunday court filing, iRobot said it had between $100 million and $500 million of assets and liabilities. The company said it owes almost $100 million to its new owner Picea, more than $5.8 million to GXO Logistics and roughly $3.4 million to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for unpaid tariffs, among other liabilities.Shares of iRobot plunged more than 72% on Monday.watch nowFounded in 1990 by Angle and two other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, iRobot got its start making military and defense tech for the government before launching its flagship Roomba product in 2002 that cemented it as an early leader in the robotic vacuum cleaner market. The company's future has remained uncertain after Amazon abandoned its planned $1.7 billion acquisition of the company in January 2024, citing regulatory scrutiny from the European Union and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Afterward, iRobot laid off 31% of staff and Angle announced he would step down as CEO and board chair. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called regulators' efforts to block the deal a \"sad story\" and said it would've given iRobot a competitive boost against rivals. The Amazon acquisition was \"the most viable path\" for iRobot to compete globally, Angle said Monday. He added that iRobot's bankruptcy serves as a \"warning\" for competition watchdogs. Helen Greiner, one of iRobot's co-founders, said in a Monday LinkedIn post that the company's restructuring plan under a Chinese owner isn't good for \"consumers, employees, stockholders, Massachusetts or the USA.\" The company had been facing growing competition from cheaper, rapidly growing rivals, such as China-based Anker, Ecovacs and Roborock. Supply chain constraints in recent years added further strain to iRobot's business, as it struggled to navigate shipping and inventory delays, which dented its revenue.Its financial outlook darkened significantly after the Amazon deal fell apart, and in October, iRobot said it would be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if it failed to secure more capital or find a buyer.Gary Cohen, iRobot CEO, said in a statement Monday that the restructuring plan would help secure the company's \"long-term future.\" The bankruptcy proceedings aren't expected to disrupt its products' functionality or customer support, iRobot said. The company's third-quarter sales came in at $145.8 million, down almost 25% from $193.4 million one year earlier, and iRobot has about $190 million in debt. ",

The deal comes as the U.S. seeks to form critical mineral partnerships that are not dependent on China.Reuters said that Korea Zinc will sell new shares worth $1.9 billion to a joint venture controlled by the U.S. government and unnamed U.S.-based strategic investors. The government and investors would then control 10% of Korea Zinc, according to the news outlet.\"The United States hasn't built a large-scale zinc smelter like this since the 1970s — a fact that reflects how decades of poor leadership imperiled our national and economic security,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CNBC on Monday.\"Thanks to President Trump, that's now changing with Korea Zinc's ... investment in Tennessee,\" Desai said. \"The Trump administration will continue to leverage every tool at our disposal to end America's foreign dependence for critical minerals and restore working-class prosperity.\"The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"These minerals power the technologies that matter most for our future: defense systems, semiconductors, AI, quantum computing, autos, data centers, and advanced manufacturing,\" the Commerce Department said in a post on X Monday.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $5 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationThe Commerce Department said that in addition to the smelter, the U.S. would have priority access to Korea Zinc's global production. The deal \"strengthens our national security, rebuilds our industrial base, and ends our dependence on foreign supply chains,\" the post states.The Korea Zinc deal follows an $8.5 billion \"framework\" agreement between the U.S. and Australia in October to increase rare earth and critical mineral investment between the two countries.Rare earths are a type of critical minerals that can be used in the development of weapons, semiconductor manufacturing, robotics and electric vehicles. China currently dominates the rare earths supply chain.As part of the agreement with Australia, the Pentagon agreed to invest in building a gallium refinery in western Australia, the White House said at the time.  The Pentagon in July became the largest shareholder in the rare earth miner MP Materials after agreeing to buy $400 million of its preferred stock. ",

Frontier said Biffle would stay on in an \"advisory capacity\" until the end of the year.Biffle had been Frontier's chief executive since March 2016 and has a more than three-decade career in airlines, including at the country's longtime top budget carrier, Spirit, which is currently in its second bankruptcy in less than a year.Frontier lost $190 million in the first nine months of the year, compared with net income of $31 million a year earlier.Frontier had been in talks to merge with Spirit several times since early 2022, but none have solidified thus far.watch nowSmaller budget airlines like Frontier have struggled to produce steady profits in the wake of the pandemic, as higher labor and other costs, consumer tastes shifting to international travel and higher-end seats, and an oversupply of domestic capacity have hurt financial results.Biffle led some of Frontier's initiatives in recent months to cater to customers seeking more space on board. Frontier's shares are down nearly 19% so far this year, while the NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks mostly U.S. airlines, is up more than 6%.",

American officials said any such assurance from the U.S. would require congressional approval.\"We believe the Russians, in a final deal, will accept all these things, which will allow for a … strong and free Ukraine,\" one official said.

Lee previously led corporate development for Google Cloud and Google DeepMind. He worked on several of Google's high-profile acquisitions, including its $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz, which the company announced in March. In his new role, Lee will have broad visibility across OpenAI as the company focuses on strategic investments and M&A in its next phase of growth, the spokesperson said. His hiring signals that OpenAI will continue to hunt for targets that can help it gain an edge over rivals like Google and Anthropic.OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but its valuation has ballooned to $500 billion since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. The AI lab has made multiple acquisitions this year. Most recently, OpenAI earlier this month announced a definitive agreement to acquire Neptune, a startup that helps with AI model training. The companies did not disclose the terms.OpenAI also bought a small company called Software Applications Incorporated for an undisclosed sum in October, the product development startup Statsig for $1.1 billion in September and former Apple designer Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for more than $6 billion in May.Lee is the latest of several executives to join OpenAI as the company looks to fill out its leadership bench. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced Slack CEO Denise Dresser will serve as its chief revenue officer. In May, the company announced it hired Fidji Simo, who was then CEO of Instacart, as the head of the AI lab's applications business.The Information was first to report Lee's departure from Google.WATCH: OpenAI unveils GPT-5.2, its strongest AI model for professional usewatch now",

John Lamparski | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump slammed Rob Reiner on Monday morning, a day after the famed Hollywood director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found brutally slain in their Los Angeles home.Trump's social-media screed against Reiner, who was a staunch critic of the president, came as the Reiners' 32-year-old son Nick was arrested and held on $4 million bond, according to LA County Sheriff's Department jail records. Nick Reiner was booked on suspicion of murder.Trump suggested that the couple was killed because of \"the anger\" Rob Reiner caused in other people due to his opposition to the Republican president. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case, and the police have not provided any motive.Trump, during comments to reporters later, doubled down and expanded on criticism of Reiner, even after a number of Republicans said that he was wrong to do so.\"He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned,\" Trump said.The president accused Reiner of promoting \"the Russian hoax,\" saying \"that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia.\"\"He was one of the people behind it,\" Trump said. \"So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all in any way, shape, or form.

This is NOT the appropriate response.\"\"The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death,\" Ellis wrote. \"This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\"Rep. Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, told CNN, \"I'd expect to hear something like this from a drunk guy at a bar, not the president of the United States. Can the president be presidential?\"Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, also called out Trump for his post.\"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,\" Massie wrote on X.\"I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it,\" he added.Massie has been targeted by Trump for months after co-sponsoring a petition in the House that led to passage of a law directing the Justice Department to release its investigative files about notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump, who was previously friends with Epstein, had opposed that law until the last minute.U.S. President Donald Trump looks on before departing for the Army/Navy football game in Baltimore, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 13, 2025.

There will be committee chairs  who will be able to hold meetings, and this is the last thing he  wants.\"Reiner's movies included \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"He first gained fame as playing the son-in-law of Archie Bunker on the classic television show \"All in the Family.\"",

    "body": "watch nowDETROIT — Ford Motor expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments, the company announced Monday.The Detroit automaker said most of those charges will occur during the fourth quarter. That will be followed by $5.5 billion in cash to be charged through 2027, and the majority of that chunk will be paid next year, Ford said.The charges will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings. The automaker said Monday it was increasing its guidance of adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to about $7 billion in 2025. That's in line with a target from earlier this year, before the company lowered expectations to between $6 billion and $6.5 billion in adjusted EBIT in October.The charges announced Monday, including $8.5 billion in write-downs of EV assets, are connected to major changes to Ford's business plans. The new plans include refocusing investments on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models rather than pure EVs; canceling a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller, more affordable EVs; and a rebalancing of its investments in core products such as trucks and SUVs.The changes are the latest under Ford CEO Jim Farley and his \"Ford+\" restructuring plan that has taken on many different forms since he initially announced it as an EV growth plan in 2021. \"We evaluated the market, and we made the call,\" Farley told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" on Monday. \"We're following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be, but where it is today.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFord, GM and Stellantis stocks.The EV segment has experienced a sales slump domestically after the Trump administration put an early end in September to a $7,500 federal tax credit previously available for EV buyers in the U.S. Farley said on CNBC that policy \"wasn't the only reason why we made this choice,\" but he acknowledged it did play a role. Ford also said Monday that its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup will transition to an extended-range EV, or EREV, that includes an electric powertrain as well as a gas-powered generator, and it announced plans to use battery plants in Kentucky and Michigan for a new stationary energy storage business.\"The last couple of months have been really clear to us,\" Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau. \"The very high-end EVs — the $50,000, $70,000, $80,000 vehicles — they just weren't selling.\"Ford said the changes are expected to provide \"a path to profitability\" for its Model e electric vehicle business by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The automaker also said it expects the changes to improve profits in its traditional Ford Blue unit and Ford Pro commercial and fleet business \"over time with early signs of benefits in 2026.\"The automaker said it expects approximately 50% of its global volume by 2030 will be hybrids, EREVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.\"These are big decisions that we believe will pay off for years to come for our customers, our employees, American jobs and manufacturing,\" Andrew Frick, president of the Model e and Blue businesses, said Monday during a media call. \"Ford is following the customer. We are looking at the market as it is today, not just as everyone predicted it to be five years ago.\"Ford said it will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform that's expected to underpin a \"high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles.\"The first vehicle from the new platform will be a \"fully connected midsize pickup truck\" assembled at the company's Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.The company also expects its new storage business to be producing and shipping units by 2027 for things such as \"data centers, the electric gird and much more,\" Frick said.\"This is a compelling opportunity. It's a market with huge potential and strong demand,\" he said. \"We will have 20 gigawatt hours of annual capacity for this market.\"Ford stock rose about 2% in after-hours trading Monday.Shares of Ford closed Monday at $13.65, down less than 1%. Ford stock as of Monday's close was up nearly 40% this year.",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersIn at least one corner of the artificial intelligence market, sentiment has turned decidedly negative. Broadcom, CoreWeave and Oracle, three companies intimately tied to the AI infrastructure buildout, all had another rough day on Wall Street on Monday after selling off sharply last week. While the three stocks are all still solidly up for the year — CoreWeave held its market debut in March — the most recent trend suggests that investors are concerned about whether the returns on investment will ever justify the level of spending taking place. \"It definitely requires the ROI to be there to keep funding this AI investment,\" Matt Witheiler, head of late-stage growth at Wellington Management, told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" on Monday. \"From what we've seen so far that ROI is there.\"Witheiler said the bullish side of the story is that, \"every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute I can make more revenue.\"Still, the market was displeased last week with quarterly earnings reports from chipmaker Broadcom and cloud infrastructure supplier Oracle, even though both companies beat on revenue and issued forecasts showing that AI demand is soaring.watch nowOracle, which is now heavily reliant on the debt markets to fund its data center development, provided scant details about how it will continue to finance its commitments. The company said it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia.It's also ratcheting up leases. As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years. That's up 148% from the end of August.Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said he expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, driven by both custom chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.However, as the company spends heavily on more parts to produce server racks, investors are going to have to stomach a hit to profits. CFO Kirsten Spears said on Broadcom's earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of the company's AI chip systems.Broadcom shares fell 5.6% on Monday following an 11% slump on Friday, leaving them 18% below their record high reached on Wednesday.Oracle dropped  2.7% on Monday and is now down 17% in the past three trading days. The company has lost 46% of its value since Sept. 10, when the stock had its best day since 1992 following disclosure of a massive AI backlog.  Venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz, who focuses on enterprise software and AI, wrote in a Monday blog that Oracle's recent fundraising binge has left it with a debt-to-equity ratio of 500%, \"dwarfing its cloud computing peers.\" Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google all have ratios between 7% and 23%, he wrote. Tunguz, founder of Theory Ventures, said the other company with a notably high ratio, at 120%, is CoreWeave, which provides cloud computing services built largely around Nvidia's graphics processing units. CoreWeave shares fell about 8% on Monday after dropping 11% last week. The company has lost more than 60% of its value from its high in June. WATCH: Oracle financing in questionwatch now",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesA former Instacart employee running for Congress alleges in a lawsuit that the company fired her out of concern that her Democratic political views could lead to backlash from the Trump administration. Elizabeth Vedernikova Khanna, a candidate for Virginia's 1st Congressional District, worked as chief of staff to Instacart's chief corporate affairs officer since early 2023 and was terminated in June, according to the suit filed Sunday in San Francisco Superior Court.Khanna, who goes by Lisa, accuses the grocery delivery giant of reversing its initial approval for her congressional bid after reviewing a copy of her campaign website's policy positions, \"specifically support for abortion rights and gun control.\"Instacart suddenly determined \"that the potential risk of Republican backlash to the company outweighed Ms. Khanna's right to run for public office,\" alleges the lawsuit, which was first reported by The Washington Post earlier Monday.Hours after that review took place, the San Francisco-based company \"prohibited Ms. Khanna from running for Congress while keeping her job, ostensibly enforcing company rules and policies,\" according to the suit.\"Less than two weeks later it terminated her because of her stated policy positions,\" Khanna's attorneys allege.An Instacart spokesperson, in an emailed statement to CNBC, said, \"Khanna's claim that her separation from Instacart was somehow politically motivated is flat out false.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $5 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing;

Those actions included sending a congratulatory gift to Ivanka Trump and having the company donate $100,000 to Trump's inaugural fund, while seeking meetings with high-level administration associates, according to the lawsuit.Khanna accuses Instacart of violating rules against blocking employee's political activities, and of wrongfully firing her \"in violation of the fundamental public policy of the State of California.\"She is asking for a jury trial and seeks both punitive and compensatory damages, \"including emotional distress damages and economic damages.\"She is also asking a judge to order Instacart to \"provide mandatory and meaningful training to all executives, managers, and employees regarding the laws prohibiting interference with and retaliation against employees for their political actions and political activities.\"",

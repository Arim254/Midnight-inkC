    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks with the press as he meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025. Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesIn a sign of easing pressure on India, U.S. President Donald Trump said that trade talks with New Delhi were going well, and he could visit the country next year.Trump who was speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday said India \"has largely stopped buying oil from Russia,\" and if Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended him an invite, he would visit the country in 2026.Evoking memories of his last visit to India, Trump called Modi \"his friend\" and a \"great man.\"In the last few months, India and U.S. relations have been under stress, with experts warning of missing chemistry between the two leaders, leading to a disconnect between India-US ties.Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan and India's purchases of Russian crude are among issues that have led to a deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.India currently faces 50% tariffs on it exports, higher than the 47% duties on China.\"Negotiations between New Delhi and Washington D.C. are ongoing and both sides appear optimistic about trade deal being reached by the end of the year, possibly even in the next few weeks,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research of Oxford Economics.The tariff rate on Indian goods could be cut to 20% from 50% currently, putting India in comparable level to its Asian peers such as Vietnam, Thailand, or the Philippines, she said.Hermann added that the baseline tariff on India \"may not fall to Japan and South Korea's level of 15%\" due to sticking points around purchases of Russian oil, agricultural imports, and limited scope to commit to sizable investments in the U.S.Last month, the U.S. imposed sanctioned on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil, which will come into force from Nov 21. As a result Indian and Chinese refiners have started to cut down imports of Russian oil.According to a Reuters report on Thursday, Russian oil is trading at its steepest discounts to Brent in a year in Asia, as major Indian and Chinese refiners reduce purchases.India's Petroleum and Natural Gas ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's query on the country cutting Russian oil imports.\"Over the long term, completely phasing out Russian oil isn't realistic for India,\" said Prateek Pandey head of APAC oil and gas research at Rystad Energy, adding that as Russian crude becomes available at a sharper discount \"New Delhi's approach of \"economics first\" will be tested more than ever.",

    "body": "A Peloton stationary bicycle inside a store in Palo Alto, California, US, on Monday, Aug. 5, 2024. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPeloton on Thursday posted its second profitable quarter in a row as it released strong guidance for the crucial holiday shopping season, banking on its relaunched product assortment to drive growth. The connected fitness company posted a surprise net income of $13.9 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $900,000 a year earlier. For the current quarter, Peloton's strongest for hardware sales, the company is expecting revenue to be between $665 million and $685 million, a slight increase from the year-ago period and largely better than Wall Street expectations of $665 million, according to LSEG. Peloton also raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA outlook and is now expecting it to be between $425 million and $475 million, up $25 million from its previous outlook on both ends. Much of that forecast is ahead of analyst expectations of between $400 million and $450 million, according to StreetAccount. Shares jumped about 11% in extended trading Thursday.Despite the good news, Peloton is still dealing with issues from its past. Earlier on Thursday, it said it was initiating yet another recall from its early product lineup. The Consumer Product Safety Commission said the company was recalling 833,000 of its original Bike+ devices after receiving reports that the seat post can break and detach during a ride – the same issue that prompted a recall of its base Bike model in 2023. \"We have received a small number of reports of an original series Bike+ seat post breaking during use. As of today, we are aware of three such incidents,\" Peloton CEO Peter Stern said on the company's earnings call Thursday.Peloton's latest recall cost the company $13.5 million during the quarter reported Thursday, contributing to a 0.3 percentage point decline in its gross margin.For its first fiscal 2026 quarter reported Thursday, Peloton beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom lines. Here's how the fitness company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 3 cents vs. 0 cents expectedRevenue: $551 million vs. $540 million expectedSales dropped to $551 million, down about 6% from $586 million a year earlier. Under the direction of Stern, who took the helm in January, the connected fitness company has been finalizing its cost cuts and turning its attention back to growth now that it's back to regularly generating free cash flow and operating profitably. \"Our intent is to go well beyond [cardio connected fitness]... we've got strength, we've got mental, mental wellbeing, nutrition and hydration and sleep and recovery,\" Stern said. \"We are focused on growth, but the growth needs to be profitable … both in top line growth as well as increased margins associated with that business as well.\"Last month, Peloton relaunched its product assortment, introduced a commercial equipment line and raised prices for both subscriptions and hardware ahead of the holiday shopping season. The revamped assortment, touching its bike, rowing machine and treadmill products, features an AI-powered tracking camera, speakers, a 360-degree swivel screen and hands-free control, among other new features. \"Our launch of an entirely new product lineup with the cross training series, is a great reason for us to talk to our members and nonmembers alike,\" Stern said.Peloton is betting consumers will be willing to spend big on the products for flashy holiday gifts, either for themselves or a loved one. But just over a month into the launch, it remains unclear how they're performing. The company's first fiscal quarter ended the day before the new products were launched. Across the retail industry, the personal electronics category has been under pressure. While Peloton operates in a category of its own, shoppers have been pulling back on other big-ticket items and being more careful about where their dollars are going in an unsteady economic environment. After Peloton's last recall, the company said at the time that it saw higher-than-expected membership churn and costs as a result.– CNBC's Luke Fountain contributed to this report",

    "body": "The Omada Health logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesVirtual care company Omada Health on Thursday said it will start prescribing GLP-1s and other obesity drugs and helping patients manage those medications.Omada plans to expand the offerings under its weight management program as its membership grows to more than 800,000.The announcement comes as digital health companies increase their presence in the blockbuster market for GLP-1s to treat obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions – a space that could be worth roughly $100 billion by the end of the decade, according to some analysts. Several digital health companies similarly offer prescriptions for GLP-1s, and the manufacturers of those drugs, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, are taking steps to make their treatments more accessible while also developing new ones for patients.\"The announcement is in response to our belief that access to GLP-1s will grow pretty significantly over time,\" Omada co-founder and CEO Sean Duffy said in an interview. He said Omada recognizes that the market will expand beyond GLP-1 injections to pills and other \"next-generation\" treatments that work in different ways, underscoring the need to help patients manage their medications. Programs from companies like Omada aim to support lifestyle and behavioral changes for patients on those drugs, offering nutrition guidance, education and a team of health coaches and exercise specialists, among other resources, that can help people stay on the drugs longer. But Omada is now tapping licensed providers trained in obesity care to prescribe medications and help patients manage the drugs. The new offering will allow the company to support patients as they receive a prescription and through the time they spend on a GLP-1. That kind of support is crucial, as GLP-1 injections can be complicated for patients to use properly and often come with gastrointestinal side effects that force some people to stop treatment.\"If you need to go up in dose, down in those, switch medications – you name it. We'll be able to support you through this experience,\" Duffy said.Omada, which partners with national and regional health plans and employers, also said the new offering is an add-on for customers to better support their workers' health needs while controlling costs and improving results from obesity treatments. Also on Thursday, Omada Health reported quarterly earnings for the second time since its initial public offering in June.The company, founded in 2011, offers virtual care programs to support patients with chronic conditions such as prediabetes, diabetes and hypertension. Omada describes its approach as a \"between-visit care model\" that is complementary to the broader health-care ecosystem.",

U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro's prosecutors previously failed to get a grand jury in D.C. to indict the 37-year-old on a felony assault charge. Pirro's office then filed a misdemeanor charge against him, which went to trial this week. Jurors began deliberations on Wednesday.Dunn was charged in connection with tossing a sandwich at Customs and Border Protection Officer Greg Lairmore on on Aug. 10 along the U Street nightlife corridor in Washington.Lairmore and other federal authorities were deployed in D.C. by President Donald Trump in response to what the president claimed was rampant crime in the capital city.\"F--- you! You f---ing fascists! Why are you here? I don't want you in my city!\" Dunn allegedly shouted at a group of federal officers before hurling the sandwich at one of them. Dunn was fired by the DOJ, where he worked in the criminal division's international affairs section, after his arrest.A person walks past art work depicting former DOJ employee Sean Charles Dunn is displayed against a restaurant wall on August 17, 2025 in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington. Tom Brenner | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesDunn's attorney, Sabrina Shroff, during closing arguments on Wednesday said that the confrontation was the result of his \"strongly held feelings\" about immigration enforcement, NBC News reported.Shroff also told jurors that \"you are the ones impacted by the executive orders\" issued by Trump which put federal law enforcement officers on the streets of D.C., NBC reported.\"You are the ones impacted by the executive orders … there was and remains a huge law enforcement presence in the district,' Shroff said.The defense attorney also argued that the, \"The sandwich did not impede Officer Lairmore's duties that night ....  A footlong from Subway could not and certainly did not inflict bodily harm,\" NBC reported.Shroff also noted that Lairmore had received two \"gag gifts\" from co-workers, a plush sandwich and a patch featuring a cartoon of Dunn throwing the sandwich with the words \"Felony Footlong,' according to the outlet.\"If someone assaulted you, if someone offended you, would you keep a  memento of their assault? Would you stick it on your daily lunchbox and carry it with you day in and day out?\" she asked.",

    "body": "Wegovy injection pens arranged in Waterbury, Vermont, US, on Monday, April 28, 2025. Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of their blockbuster weight loss drugs. Under the agreements, the monthly out-of-pocket cost of popular injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has, Trump administration officials said. Existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly's obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's competitor Wegovy, carry list prices above $1,000 a month, which has prevented many patients from taking them. Both companies have introduced lower cost options for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites.But the deals with Trump, as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy, take those efforts to expand access even further. Here's how much weight loss drugs could cost for patients under the new agreements, based on the details shared so far.Medicare Medicare has covered GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and some other medical conditions: for example, Wegovy for slashing cardiovascular risks. But under the new deals, Medicare will start covering the drugs for obesity for the first time starting in mid-2026, which could allow more seniors to qualify for them and spur more private insurers to cover them.Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment. But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Patients are eligible if they fall into these three cohorts:The first includes those who are overweight — with a body mass index greater than 27 — or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.The second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure.The third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35.Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk voluntarily agreed to reduce the prices the government pays for existing GLP-1 drugs already approved for diabetes and other uses to $245 a month, across all non-starting doses. Savings generated by those price reductions will allow Medicare to start paying that same price point for GLP-1s for patients with obesity and a high metabolic or cardiovascular risk. Direct-to-consumerThe agreement will also allow patients to get GLP-1s on direct-to-consumer platforms at steeper discounts than they already receive through drugmakers' existing sites.On TrumpRx – the government's direct-to-consumer platform for buying prescription drugs with cash expected to launch next year – the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior administration officials.Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $145 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid. Under the deals announced Thursday, the drugmakers will get fast-track reviews of their forthcoming pills. Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. Eli Lilly's pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per monthMedicaidState Medicaid coverage of GLP-1 drugs for obesity is spotty. But Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly agreed to extend lower government pricing for their GLP-1 drugs – $245 per month across all other non-starting doses – to all 50 Medicaid programs for all covered uses. States will have to opt into those prices, meaning some may not. Check with your state government about coverage.",

    "body": "The logo of SoftBank is displayed at a company shop in Tokyo, Japan January 28, 2025. Issei Kato | ReutersShares of Japan's SoftBank Group resumed their slide on Friday, following a broader slump in AI-related stocks as investors once again grew wary of the sector's lofty valuations.The group, which holds a wide range of AI investments across infrastructure, semiconductor, and application companies, saw shares close 6.87% lower, recouping some losses from earlier in the session.This comes after SoftBank gained nearly 3% in the previous session, having plunged 10% on Wednesday to clock its worst day since April. It saw almost $50 billion in market cap wiped out this week and its worst weekly loss since March 2020, down nearly 20%.\"SoftBank Group's shares are falling as many bought it as the only listed proxy for OpenAI,\" said David Gibson, senior research analyst at financial services firm MST Financial.The pullback reflects growing caution around the AI sector and a realization that many of OpenAI's partnerships are still potential rather than confirmed, with funding prospects uncertain, he told CNBC.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman reportedly said the company has spoken with the U.S. government about potential federal loan guarantees to encourage chip factory construction. His comments came after OpenAI's CFO suggested the firm hoped for federal help in securing chip financing.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of SoftBank Group fall following renewed pressure on AI-linked stocksSoftBank holds a controlling stake in U.K.-based semiconductor designer Arm Holdings, whose chips help power mobile and AI processors globally. Shares of Nasdaq-listed Arm slid 1.21% overnight.Separately, Bloomberg recently reported citing people familiar with the matter that the group considered acquiring U.S. chipmaker Marvell Technology Inc. earlier this year.Broader declineOther Japanese tech stocks also declined. Semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest dropped 5.5%, chipmaker Renesas Electronics fell nearly 4%, Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, declined 1.35%.Shares of the world's largest chipmaker, TSMC, fell 0.34%.Nvidia-supplier SK Hynix was down 2.2% and South Korean peer and memory chipmaker Samsung fell 1.3%.The declines in Asian tech stocks also come after AI-related companies in the U.S. fell overnightQualcomm dropped almost 4%, despite strong quarterly results, after warning it could lose future Apple business. AMD, a strong performer Wednesday, slipped 7%, while Palantir and Oracle were down about 7% and 3%, respectively. Nvidia and Meta Platforms also finished lower.The excitement surrounding AI has raised worries that markets might be experiencing a tech bubble. Some experts argue that the valuations of AI companies are starting to resemble the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, with stock prices rising well beyond realistic profit forecasts.The economic impact of artificial intelligence is undeniable and market bumps are inevitable, said Laura Cooper, global investment strategist at Nuveen.\"Still, it's too soon to call a bubble. Today's AI capex is being funded largely by cash-rich firms with solid balance sheets, not cheap credit or speculation,\" she said. \"The greater risk isn't a bubble bursting, but valuation fatigue — investors tiring of paying ever-richer premiums for AI returns that don't materialize quickly enough.\"",

    "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk says the company will likely need to build a \"gigantic\" semiconductor fabrication plant to keep up with its artificial intelligence and robotics ambitions.\"One of the things I'm trying to figure out is — how do we make enough chips?\" Musk said at Tesla's annual shareholders meeting Thursday.Tesla currently relies on contract chipmakers Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Samsung Electronics to produce its chip designs. Musk said he was also considering working with U.S. chip company Intel. \"But even when we extrapolate the best-case scenario for chip production from our suppliers, it's still not enough,\" he said.Tesla would probably need to build a \"gigantic\"  chip fab, which Musk described as a \"Tesla terra fab.\" \"I can't see any other way to get to the volume of chips that we're looking for.\" Microchips are the brains that power almost all modern technologies, including everything from consumer electronics like smartphones to massive data centers, and demand for them has been surging amid the AI boom.Tech giants, including Tesla, have been clamoring for more supply from chipmakers like TSMC — the world's largest and most advanced chipmaker. According to Musk, Tesla's potential fab's initial capacity would reach 100,000 wafer starts per month and eventually scale up to 1 million. In the semiconductor industry, wafer starts per month is a measure of how many new chips a fab produces each month.For comparison, TSMC says its annual wafer production capacity reached 17 million in 2024, or around 1.42 million wafer starts per month.While Tesla doesn't yet manufacture its own microchips, the company has been designing custom chips for autonomous driving for several years.It is currently outsourcing production of its latest-generation \"AI5\" chip, which Musk said will be cheaper, power-efficient, and optimized for Tesla's AI software.The CEO also announced on Thursday that Tesla will begin producing its Cybercab — an autonomous electric vehicle with no pedals or steering wheel — in April.Musk's statements underscore Tesla's shift into AI and robotics — industries the CEO sees as the future of the global economy. \"With AI and robotics, you can actually increase the global economy by a factor of 10, or maybe 100. There's not, like, an obvious limit,\" Musk said at the shareholder meeting. ",

    "body": "Shoppers carry bags at Broadway Plaza in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Monday, Dec. 16, 2024. The Bureau of Economic Analysis is scheduled to release personal spending figures on December 20. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHoliday hiring by retailers is expected to total between 265,000 and 365,000 roles this year, the lowest number of seasonal workers in at least 15 years, the National Retail Federation said Thursday.NRF CEO Matthew Shay said on the retail trade group's conference call on that those hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market.\" It's a significant drop from a year ago, when retailers hired 442,000 seasonal workers, the retail trade group said.Some companies may have hired seasonal workers early to support sales events in October, but retailers have largely tried to limit their spending as they manage higher costs from tariffs, NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said.The major industry group's prediction offers the latest glimpse into the jobs market as the record government shutdown stretches on and leads to fewer government reports on economic data, such as unemployment and inflation. That's caused companies and economists to rely on data from private companies or organizations instead.Earlier Thursday, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas said layoff announcements soared in October to 153,074, a 183% jump from September and 175% surge from the same month a year ago. That marked the highest level for any October since 2003, and 2025 has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009.On the other hand, payrolls processing firm ADP reported net job growth in October of 42,000, reversing two consecutive months of losses in the private sector.Higher spending, lower hiringEven with the lower levels of seasonal staffing, the NRF is optimistic holiday spending will be strong. It said it expects holiday spending to hit a record of between $1.1 trillion to $1.2 trillion from Nov. 1 through Dec. 31, the first time the total would top $1 trillion.That would represent 3.7% to 4.2% year-over-year growth from the previous holiday season, a slight decrease from last year's 4.3% holiday sales growth rate. NRF's forecast excludes auto dealers, gas stations and restaurants.Even with low consumer sentiment, a prolonged government shutdown, \"on-again-off-again tariffs\" and price sensitivity because of inflation, Shay said consumers have defied expectations and kept spending.\"In fairness, that's been somewhat of a surprise based on where we thought we might be way back in April,\" he said.He said the trade group anticipates that dynamic will persist during the key holiday shopping season. Households typically cut back during other parts of the year or on other parts of the budget to make it a festive time, he said.Even as consumers continue to spend, the retail industry has taken a cautious stance on hiring — a fact reflected in NRF's predictions for seasonal workers. It is the fourth slowest year for retail hiring on a year-to-date basis since at least 2000, behind only 2009, 2010 and 2012, several of the years following the Great Recession.Mathews told CNBC in an interview that the slow hiring environment all comes down to one word: uncertainty.\"The one thing you know businesses do when they are in uncertain environments is they put things on hold,\" he told CNBC in an interview.On NRF's conference call on Thursday, Mathews said the U.S. economy doesn't need the same level of job creation as it used to because of demographic and policy shifts, including the retirement of Baby Boomers and President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration.Still, he said, the level of hiring and investment by companies will be an important indicator to watch in the coming year.Right now, he said, a flood of investment in artificial intelligence has been \"a huge boon for the economy.\" But he added \"that may be covering up a few cracks.\"\"We need to keep a close eye on on how businesses are feeling and what remains an uncertain environment,\" he said.",

    "body": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks to media following a Q&amp;A at the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Shelby Tauber | ReutersOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Thursday that the artificial intelligence startup is on track to generate more than $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate this year, with plans to grow to hundreds of billions in sales by 2030.The company has inked more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure deals in recent months to try and build out the data centers it says are needed to meet growing demand. The staggering sum has raised questions from investors and others in the industry about where OpenAI will come up with the money.\"We are trying to build the infrastructure for a future economy powered by AI, and given everything we see on the horizon in our research program, this is the time to invest to be really scaling up our technology,\" Altman wrote in a post on X. \"Massive infrastructure projects take quite awhile to build, so we have to start now.\"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but has become one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet following the launch of its chatbot ChatGPT in 2022. The startup is currently valued at $500 billion, though it's still not profitable.In September, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar told CNBC that OpenAI was on track to generate $13 billion in revenue this year.Friar caught the attention of the Trump administration this week after she saying at at event that OpenAI is looking to create an ecosystem of banks, private equity and a federal \"backstop\" or \"guarantee\" that could help the company finance its investments in cutting-edge chips. She clarified those comments late Wednesday, writing in a post on LinkedIn that OpenAI is not seeking a government backstop for its infrastructure commitments.\"I used the word 'backstop' and it muddied the point,\" Friar wrote. \"As the full clip of my answer shows, I was making the point that American strength in technology will come from building real industrial capacity which requires the private sector and government playing their part.\"Venture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar, said Thursday that there will be \"no federal bailout for AI.\" He wrote in a post on X that if one frontier model company in the U.S. fails, another will take its place.Altman said Thursday that OpenAI does \"not have or want government guarantees for OpenAI datacenters.\" He said taxpayers should not bail out companies that make poor decisions, and that \"if we get it wrong, that's on us.\"\"This is the bet we are making, and given our vantage point, we feel good about it,\" Altman wrote. \"But we of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.\"WATCH: Trump AI czar David Sacks says ‘no federal bailout for AI’ after OpenAI CFO’s commentswatch now",

Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMcDonald's leadership is urging operators to stay the course on value offerings as the competition for consumers plays out across the restaurant space. In a memo to U.S. operators following the company's third-quarter earnings, McDonald's U.S. President Joe Erlinger said the brand was \"moving in the right direction\" as it continues a more-than-yearlong push on value.\"Amid industry pressures, dynamic change, and aggressive competition, winning the fight for contracting traffic means staying customer-obsessed,\" Erlinger wrote in the memo, which was viewed by CNBC. The company did not immediately respond to request for comment.On Wednesday, McDonald's reported earnings per share and revenue that came in below Wall Street expectations, but its same-store sales were a bright spot, posting positive growth across all segments. U.S. same-store sales increased more than anticipated, up 2.4%, thanks to a boost from the $2.99 Snack Wrap launch and the introduction of its Extra Value Meals, which Erlinger said drew week-to-week growth.\"While we maintained a positive comp guest count gap, overall [guest counts] continue to decline-- underscoring the need for disciplined pricing, value, and affordability,\" he wrote in the memo.Erlinger said the company has \"the right plan in place\" and said it was poised for a strong fourth quarter, including the benefit of annual comparisons to last year's E. coli outbreak that dented burger sales. \"We still need to keep our foot on the gas-- staying focused on the customer and what we can control,\" he said. CEO Chris Kempczinski told analysts this week that the fast-food chain is seeing signs of a bifurcated consumer base among quick-service restaurants. He noted \"QSR traffic from lower-income consumers declining nearly double-digits in the third quarter, a trend that's persisted for nearly two years. \"In contrast, QSR traffic growth among higher-income consumers remains strong, increasing nearly double-digits in the quarter. We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets, and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" he said.In a separate memo to global operators, Kempczinski said the brand will continue to focus on \"sharpening value leadership to meet evolving consumer expectations and increase traffic.\"He added McDonald's will be \"investing in high-potential menu categories-- especially Chicken and Beverages-- to stay competitive and drive growth.\"McDonald's is currently testing beverages in 500 restaurants across Wisconsin and Colorado that draw on learnings from its now-shuttered beverage concept, CosMc's.watch now",

It could be equities, it could be rates, it could be foreign exchange,\" DBS CEO Tan Su Shan told CNBC, adding that she expects that volatility to continue.Tan, who took over the helm of DBS from longtime CEO Piyush Gupta in March, said that investors were particularly worried about the lofty valuations of artificial intelligence stocks, especially the so-called \"Magnificent Seven.\"The Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — are some of the major U.S. tech and growth stocks that have driven much of Wall Street's gains in recent years.\"You've got trillions of dollars tied up in seven stocks, for example. So it's inevitable, with that kind of concentration, that there will be a worry about. 'You know, when will this bubble burst?'\"Earlier this week, at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong,  it was likely there would be a 10%-20% drawdown over the next 12 to 24 months.Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick said at the same summit that investors should welcome periodic pullbacks, calling them healthy developments rather than signs of crisis.Tan agreed. \"Frankly, a correction will be healthy,\" she said.Recent examples include Advanced Micro Devices and Palantir, both of which posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, yet their shares — and the wider Nasdaq — fell.Her remarks follow similar warnings by the International Monetary Fund and central bank chiefs Jerome Powell and Andrew Bailey, who have all cautioned about inflated stock prices.Singapore as diversification playTan advised investors to diversify rather than concentrate holdings in one market. \"Whether it's in your portfolio, in your supply chain, or in your demand distribution, just diversify.\"Tan, who has over 35 years of experience in banking and wealth management, noted that Asia could attract more investment from the U.S.—and that it's not a bad thing.Singling out Singapore and the country's central bank's efforts to boost interest in the local markets, Tan described the city-state as a \"diversifier market.\"\"We've got rule of law. We're a transparent, open financial system and stable politically. We're a good place to invest....

    "body": "The Ford Lightning is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025.Danielle DeVries | CNBCDETROIT — Ford Motor is reportedly considering ending production of its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck amid mounting losses and more challenging market conditions for EVs.The Wall Street Journal first reported the talks Thursday, adding they are ongoing and nothing has been finalized. A source familiar with Ford's product strategy confirmed to CNBC that the company has been evaluating its future EVs amid the company's losses and changing market conditions.\"What I can say is that F-150 Lightning is the best-selling electric pickup truck in the U.S. — despite new competition from CyberTruck, Chevy, GMC, Hummer and Rivian — and delivered record sales in Q3. Right now, we're focused on producing F-150 ICE and Hybrid as we recover from the fire at Novelis,\" a Ford spokesman said in an emailed statement Thursday, declining to comment on the discussions.Ford previously confirmed it paused production of the Lightning amid supply chain disruptions related to a fire at an aluminum plant for Novelis, a main supplier for the pickup truck.Ford President Kumar Galhotra, when asked last month by media about Lightning production potentially ending, said the company's main priority was gas-powered models. He said F-150 Lightning production could restart whenever the company would like but declined to give a timeframe.The F-150 Lightning, which Ford once said was as important to the company as founder Henry Ford's Model T, never lived up to internal or external expectations. The pickup initially received more than 200,000 nonbinding reservations that failed to convert to sales.F-150 Lightning sales this year through October are roughly level compared with a year earlier at only 24,577 units. Since going on sale in 2022 in the U.S., Ford has sold less than 100,000 F-150 Lightning models.The Lightning is produced at a facility connected to a large F-150 production plant in metro Detroit.Ford's EV operations, including the Lightning, have lost the company billions of dollars annually in recent years.The U.S. EV market has faced daunting changes in regulations under the Trump administration this year, including the end of consumer credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV.The reported discussions at Ford follow crosstown rival Stellantis deciding to end plans to produce an all-electric Ram 1500 pickup as well as General Motors significantly scaling back its plans for electric trucks.",

    "body": "Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda gets out of a Tesla Motor's Roadster electric car with Tesla Motors Chief Exective Officer Elon Musk (behind car) upon their arrival at a news conference in Tokyo November 12, 2010.Issei Kato | ReutersEight years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk promoted a next-generation Roadster, basing the name of the sports car on the company's debut electric vehicle from 2008.The updated version has yet to hit production. But Musk is again promising that a new one is on the way.In a discussion with podcaster Joe Rogan that was published on Friday, Musk was asked about the long-delayed vehicle. He provided a sense of timing but declined to share updated technical or design details.\"I can't do the unveil before the unveil,\" Musk said. As he's said before, Musk claimed the new Roadster \"has a shot at being the most memorable product unveil ever.\"Tesla is aiming to show off the updated Roadster to fans and investors \"hopefully before the end of the year,\" Musk said.Musk's comments come a day after former close friend Sam Altman, OpenAI's CEO, posted on X that he tried to cancel his Roadster reservation from 2018 and get his deposit refunded. He shared a screenshot showing that his email to the company had bounced back.\"I really was excited for the car!\" Altman wrote. \"And I understand delays. But 7.5 years has felt like a long time to wait.\"Musk, who helped start OpenAI in 2015, is in a heated legal dispute with Altman and now runs competing artificial intelligence startup xAI.Patrick George, editor-in-chief at InsideEVs and a long-time industry observer, told CNBC on Friday that the Roadster \"has been MIA for years.\"\"The only thing I can think of that would make Musk start talking about this again is that Sam Altman at OpenAI, who is sort of his arch-rival, just said recently that he was trying to cancel his Roadster reservation which he has held since 2018,\" George said.Earlier this year, the popular gadget and autos reviewer Marques Brownlee discussed the arduous process of cancelling his own Roadster reservation in an interview with Waveform Podcast.The Roadster is a high end, low-volume model, something meant to challenge vehicles like BYD's YangWang U9 Xtreme, which was recently crowned the world's fastest production car.Musk faces a major Tesla shareholder vote next week, as he and the board are asking investors to approve a massive pay package.The pay plan would net Musk nearly $1 trillion in Tesla stock and would grow his stake to around 25%, depending on the company hitting various market valuations and other growth milestones.WATCH: CNBC's interview with Tesla Chair Robyn Denholmwatch now",

    "body": "A cargo ship loaded with foreign trade containers heads towards Qingdao Port in Qingdao City, Shandong Province, China, on November 5, 2025.  Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's exports in October declined for the first time in nearly two years due to a high base effect and as businesses' front-loading momentum tapered off ahead of meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders.Outbound shipments dropped 1.1% in October in U.S. dollar terms from a year earlier — their first contraction since March 2024, when exports shrank by a staggering 7.5%.Exports decline was unexpected as economists had anticipated a 3% growth, according to a Reuters survey, and compared with a six-month high growth of 8.3% in September.Imports rose 1% last month, missing the estimates for 3.2% growth, as a prolonged housing market downturn and weak job market conditions continued to weigh on consumer demand. They had jumped 7.4% in September.\"It seems the frontloading finally faded in October,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, expecting China's exports to normalize as trade curbs have been put on hold for one year.Chinese exporters and American buyers breathed a sigh of relief last week after U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, struck a deal during their meeting in South Korea, de-escalating a situation that had threatened to plunge bilateral relations into a full-blown trade war.China's exports to the U.S. declined 25% in October from the same month a year earlier, marking the seventh consecutive month of double-digit declines, according to customs data. Imports decreased by nearly 23% last month. The two countries agreed to roll back a range of punitive measures, including steep tariffs, export controls for critical minerals and advanced technology, while Beijing committed to buying more U.S. soybeans and working with Washington to crack down on fentanyl flows.Following the trade truce, the effective U.S. tariff rate on Chinese exports dropped to 31%, according to Macquarie Group's estimates.The sharp slowdown last month was in part due to the high base in October 2024, when exports grew at their fastest pace in more than two years.Over the first 10 months this year, Chinese shipments to the U.S. declined 17.8%, while inbound goods dropped 12.6%, narrowing the trade surplus by 20% from a year earlier to $233 billion.Despite the drop in U.S.-bound goods, China's overall exports grew 5.3% this year as of October, as Chinese exporters sought out alternative markets or re-routing goods indirectly into the world's biggest economy.Exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the European Union and Africa surged 14.3%, 7.5% and 26.1%, respectively in the first 10 months.watch nowChina has racked up a trade surplus of over $964.8 billion in the first 10 months of this year, 23% higher than that during the same period of 2024.Oxford Economics raised its forecast for Chinese exports to grow at 3.5% to 5% annually in real terms, according to a report on Thursday, buoyed by Beijing's push to deepen industrialization in its next five-year development plan and Chinese exporters' efforts to diversify into regional and emerging markets.The research firm improved its forecast for China's real GDP growth to 4.5% for 2026 and 4.4% for 2027.\"Now that export momentum weakens, China needs to rely more on domestic demand,\" Zhang added, anticipating policymakers to unleash more supportive fiscal measures in the first quarter next year.Echoing that sentiment, Larry Hu, chief China economist at Macquarie Group, said that Beijing would turn to boost domestic demand as the main growth driver to achieve the annual GDP target \"at some point between 2026 and 2030.\"Beijing will likely maintain the growth target of \"around 5%\" in 2026 and calibrate stimulus to neither miss nor over-achieve that goal.Falling prices and cutthroat price competition has prompted Beijing to step up efforts to rein in industrial overcapacity in recent months. Profits at the major industrial firms rose 3.2% in the first nine months.Economic data for October suggested that manufacturing activity had contracted for seven consecutive months, as trade tensions with Washington had reignited.",

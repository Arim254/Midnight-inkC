    "body": "Americans are more anxious about the holidays this year, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Healthy Minds Poll.Forty-one percent of U.S. adults say they anticipate more stress related to the holidays this year than last year, compared to 28% in 2024 and 29% in 2023. They list numerous reasons including missing someone in their life, dealing with the cost of holiday gifts, navigating challenging family dynamics and being lonely.If you're stressed out this time of year, there are tactics you can try to make the holidays more pleasant. Here's what Sabrina Romanoff, New York–based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily, recommends.Try 'muting accounts on social media that are really making you feel awful'Americans spend a lot of time on social media. Thirty-seven percent of U.S. adults visit Facebook several times a day, according to the Pew Research Center.  With so much time spent looking at other people's lives, it's easy to compare what your holidays look like to what theirs do.Making this season more pleasant \"can mean muting accounts on social media that are really making you feel awful, making you feel not good enough,\" says Romanoff. You can block them or unfollow them altogether.In December, as in any time of the year, \"it's really important to be intentional about what you are seeing and consuming,\" she says, \"because that's going to change the lens through which you see your own life.\"Choose to participate in whatever way 'makes your life more comfortable'If you're nervous about some of the people you'll be spending time with this season, you can also tailor your experience accordingly.That could mean, \"I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable to make Aunt Karen comfortable when she asks her intrusive questions,\" says Romanoff. \"I'm going to let there be silence.\" It could also mean giving yourself breaks during gatherings that feel overwhelming and going to another room for a few minutes. It could even mean deciding that there are certain celebrations you're going to skip altogether — and replace with get-togethers with your chosen family.Ultimately, making this time of year happier and less stressful \"means really showing up in a way that makes your life more comfortable for you,\" she says.

    "body": "With any credit card, there's typically a limit to how much you can spend. And experts say choosing the right limit can play an important role in maintaining good credit health.Set based on factors like your income, credit history and ability to repay, your credit limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow on a credit card or account. \"Generally speaking, more credit is better, as long as you don't use it as a crutch to overspend and take on too much debt,\" says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. Experts often recommend seeking out a limit that's well above how much you'll spend in a month to maximize your credit score. Your \"ideal\" credit limit will depend on your personal spending habits and preferences, Rossman says.The best limit for your credit scoreToo keep your credit score high, it's best to use only 10% to 30% of your available credit and pay your statements off in full every month, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.The percentage of your available credit that you're using is a metric known as credit utilization. Keeping utilization low shows lenders you manage credit responsibly, which helps improve your credit score, while hitting that limit every month signals to lenders that you may be over-reliant on credit and a higher lending risk, thus lowering your score, says Rossman.Working backward from the an ideal credit utilization of 10% to 30%, if you typically spend around $5,000 a month on your card, you should have a limit of $50,000, Tsantes says. By the same metric, if you typically spend around $2,500 on your card, $25,000 could be a good limit, he adds. \"The idea is that you'll never be close to hitting that limit,\" Tsantes says. Having a seemingly high limit is there not as money available to use, but as a buffer to keep your balance well below your maximum and your credit utilization low.It may also be smart to consult a trusted financial professional who can help you determine the amount of credit that makes sense for you.It's OK to stick to a more practical limitCredit card debt can be costly and hard to pay off. So, if you know you're likely to view your credit limit as the amount you can spend each month, it may be wiser to stick to a limit that covers just the essentials with a small buffer, Rossman says.\"You definitely don't want to be hitting or approaching that limit or spending more than you can afford to pay back,\" he says. \"Even though it's good for your credit score to have more credit, if you're going to use that as a way to overspend, that could be a danger.\"However, even with a lower limit, it's still possible to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, Rossman says. If your line of credit is just enough to cover your essentials and you're getting close to your limit every month, there are \"workarounds\" to lower your utilization, like making extra payments throughout the month to keep your usage under 30%.How to increase your credit limitTo increase your credit limit, you can either request a credit limit increase for an existing card or open a new card with a new line of credit, Rossman says. Start by checking with your existing credit card issuer to see if requesting a credit limit increase will trigger a hard or soft credit inquiry, he says. Hard inquiries can cause a small, temporary dip in your credit score, while a soft inquiry is a routine or informational check that does not affect your credit score. If your issuer will use a soft inquiry, increasing the limit on an existing card can boost available credit and lower your credit utilization without hurting your score, Rossman says.If your issuer is going to run a hard inquiry, it may be more strategic to open a new credit card with a different set of rewards and benefits, Rossman says. That way, you can have more options to maximize benefits across your cards, he says.Although increasing your credit limit can raise your spending power, avoid treating that extra credit as more money or an emergency fund for \"desperate times,\" Rossman says. Spending more than you can afford on a credit card can lead to high-interest debt that becomes difficult to repay, he says, especially if your financial situation is already strained.\"Having a credit card with a $5,000 limit — yes, that could help you in a pinch — but that's not the same as having $5,000 in the bank,\" Rossman says. \"This is debt. It can be very expensive debt.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

    "body": "The AI market is tipped to splinter in 2026. The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. \"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. watch now\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

    "body": "People gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington, U.S., June 29, 2024. Kevin Mohatt | ReutersThe Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt a rare blow to President Donald Trump by rejecting his bid to overrule a lower court order and allow the deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area over the objections of local and state leaders.The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the case in October after a District Court judge blocked the president's plans to send troops to aid in an immigration crackdown. The court on Tuesday declined Trump's request.\"Today is a big win for Illinois and American democracy,\" Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said in a post on X.\"This is an important step in curbing the Trump Administration's consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump's march toward authoritarianism,\" Pritzker continued.U.S. presidents can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, but guardsmen are typically not permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. Trump's attempts to send troops to mostly blue cities to fight crime have tested the bounds of presidential authority and led to a series of lawsuits. Citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement unless explicitly authorized by the Constitution or Congress, the court found Trump lacked the authority to deploy troops to Illinois in this case.\"At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,\" the unsigned order states.The order is not final, but for now bars the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops to Chicago.Justices Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch offered dissenting opinions. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion.Trump has sent National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Portland in recent months, despite objections from local leaders. Those deployments have resulted in several lawsuits, including a legal challenge from California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and Trump foil, and local officials in D.C.\"The President promised the American people he would work tirelessly to enforce our immigration laws and protect federal personnel from violent rioters,\" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement on Tuesday.\"He activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property,\" Jackson continued. \"Nothing in today's ruling detracts from that core agenda. The Administration will continue working day in and day out to safeguard the American public.\"",

    "body": "A Waymo car is halted on the road amid a power outage in San Francisco, California, U.S., December 20, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video.dReutersThree days after a blackout in San Francisco caused Waymo to pause its driverless car service, the Alphabet-owned company said it's updating its fleet so its vehicles are better prepared to respond during future outages. \"We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails,\" the company said in a blog post late Tuesday. Power outages began early afternoon on Saturday in San Francisco and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power. PG&E said a fire at a substation resulted in \"significant and   extensive\" damage.With stoplights and traffic signals not functioning, the city was hit with widespread gridlock. Videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in various neighborhoods. \"We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves,\" Waymo said in Tuesday's blog post. \"This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.\"San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in an update on X Saturday evening that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.Waymo said that it's analyzing the event, and is taking three \"immediate steps.\" The first involves \"fleet-wide updates\" to give vehicles \"more context about regional outages,\" so cars can take more decisive actions at intersections. The company said it's also improving its \"emergency response protocols,\" and is coordinating with Mayor Lurie's team in San Francisco to better collaborate in emergency preparedness. Finally, Waymo said it's updating its first responder training \"as we discover learnings from this and other widespread events.\" In addition to the Bay Area, Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in and around Austin, Texas, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The company recently crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and said in December it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.\"Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a record of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors,\" the company said in Tuesday's blog.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "A fire engulfing a residential building complex at Wang Fuk Court in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhat a year this has been. Understandably for many, it could not be over soon enough. From the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs to natural and man-made disasters across Asia. To new leaders breaking glass ceilings and old leaders whisked off to The International Criminal Court, or even sentenced to death in absentia. Missiles fired across borders. Terrorist attacks in South Asia and the Pacific. Enduring corruption challenges and real estate woes. And people scammed and enslaved. As 2025 comes to a close, we look back and see who had it bad and who had it good. Worst year: Asia's cyber scam victimsThe year saw a growing tsunami of cybercrime sweeping across the globe, emanating from Southeast Asia. Criminal gangs largely operating out of Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia defrauded billions of dollars from victims worldwide.The \"perpetrators\" are also the victims. Hundreds of thousands of individuals enticed with fake employment offers to these nations, many transiting via Thailand, then held against their will, enslaved to work in these scam centers.The year saw a growing tsunami of cybercrime sweeping across the globe, emanating from Southeast Asia. Sarayut Thaneerat | Moment | Getty ImagesThe kidnapping of Chinese actor Wang Xing, who was lured by a fraudulent acting gig, then forced to work in one operation in January 2025, brought heightened attention to this growing crisis. Even the Trump administration took notice. \"The scam centers are creating a generational wealth transfer from Main Street America into the pockets of Chinese organized crime,\" said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. Weak governments and corruption allow these multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprises to function, despite high-profile efforts to free captives and close compounds that have operated with near impunity in Southeast Asia. Unless stopped, these operations will only grow more sophisticated as they begin to use AI and deepfakes to perpetrate their crimes. Asia's enslaved cyber scam victims earn the distinction of having the worst year in Asia, with sadly far too little hope for escape and rescue in sight. Bad year: casualties of earth, wind, water and fireThe death count across large swaths of Asia seemed to accelerate by the year's end. Throughout all of 2025, too many people fell victim to natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods, seemingly made worse by human corruption or ineptness. A March 28 earthquake in Myanmar killed more than 3,600, displaced some 200,000 and even brought down a skyscraper under construction across the border in distant Bangkok, killing dozens more. From Sri Lanka to Thailand to Indonesia to Vietnam to Malaysia and the Philippines, floods, mudslides and typhoons combined to impact millions and kill more than 1,600. Add fire to the mix. The year closed with the horrific Wang Fuk Court apartment complex fire in Tai Po, Hong Kong. Televised scenes of towering infernos were seen worldwide. Inoperable fire alarms and below-grade construction materials reportedly contributed to the heartbreaking tragedy, with at least 160 people dead —  making it one of the deadliest fires in the city's history. Mixed Year: Gen Z uprisingsArmed with memes, hashtags and reels and some waving the Jolly Roger Flag popularized by the Japanese anime and manga series \"One Piece,\" Gen Zers hungering for change had a mixed year in 2025.  Many in this cohort of young people born between 1997 and 2012 took to the streets, including in Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines, the Maldives and even in the new ASEAN member state Timor-Leste, to protest corruption, nepotism and economic inequality. The results were decidedly mixed though their frustrations seemed all too common in Asia. The Gen-Z group escalates their ongoing demonstrations, confronting police outside the Prime Minister's official residence in Kathmandu, Nepal, on November 26, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThese \"digital natives\" succeeded in bringing down Nepal's government. Last year, this generation had played a key role in toppling the government of Bangladesh. In other countries, small concessions were achieved in 2025. Yet, at year-end, the question remains whether Gen Z — the first generation to fully grow up in the internet era — is able to maintain momentum and turn these uprisings into a viable movement for constructive change. The shared hope remains for a political force that can reform entrenched and corrupt systems, alleviate the youth's deep frustration with the status quo and bring about more economic opportunities. To quote Monkey D. Luffy from \"One Piece,\" \"If you don't take risks, you can't create a future.\" Good Year: Asia's 'Bamboo Economic Tactics' Resilience was in full display across Asia's slowing but still growing economies at year-end. Leaders across the region adopted flexible strategies — akin to bamboo bending in high winds — to navigate Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. Indeed, it proved a good year for \"bamboo economic tactics\" as the region's reputation for pragmatism held and countries were able to manage the new global economic reality. This approach led to reduced U.S. tariffs — down from duties proposed initially — and revamped trade configurations and new economic strategies.Asian countries were able to manage the new global economic reality, entering into deals that cut U.S. tariffs. Ignatiev | E+ | Getty ImagesOne example is the India, Canada and Australia cooperation agreement on technology and innovation, underscoring Asian nations' own \"Art of the Deal.\" Recalibrating economic approach allowed developing Asia to achieve growth hovering around 5% for the year, according to the Asian Development Bank. This also kept Asia on track overall as the world's fastest-growing region in the world. Best Year: Chinese Soft PowerIf tech and creative content are the new soft power, this past year showed that \"Made In China\" could be a contender, with Beijing joining the ranks of the United States and Korea as a soft-power giant.  The year began with the January surprise: the launch of DeepSeek'a low-cost AI model in a world once-enamored by ChatGPT and American tech prowess. By year-end, the \"ugly-cute\" Pop Mart collectible, Labubu, had taken the world by a storm, even appearing in New York City's iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Labubu is part of a larger group of characters called \"The Monsters,\" created by Hong Kong artist and author Kasing Lung.The Friends-giving in POPCITY float is prepared on the eve of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade 2025 on Manhattan's upper west side in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersFrom BYD electric vehicles to the biggest animated film in the world ever — Ne Zha 2 that reportedly grossed more than $2 billion — to Li-Ning sneakers appearing on NBA courts and Luckin Coffee shops opening at a rapid pace throughout Asia and the United States, Chinese soft power was clearly on the rise in 2025, and so receives the distinction for having the best year in Asia.

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confer during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing titled Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request for The Environmental Protection Agency, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

    "body": "watch nowU.S. shoppers are willing to spend this holiday season — despite falling consumer confidence and anxiety over prices — but only if the deals are there, Tanger CEO Stephen Yalof told CNBC on Tuesday.\"Retailers are discounting to meet the consumer, and the consumer is responding by shopping,\" Yalof said on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" Yalof said Tanger tries to offer shoppers access to premium brands at prices that feel consistently compelling. Retailers across the company's outlet portfolio leaned heavily into promotions during the holidays, helping sustain traffic and sales.Customers are \"looking to come into a space where they can buy products at full price, maybe above the price point they want to spend, but they can embrace that price point because they know it's value priced every day,\" Yalof said.He described holiday traffic at Tanger's outlet centers as strong, citing full parking lots and steady activity through November and December.\"I feel like the customer is very resilient,\" he said. \"They're looking to spend.\"Yalof's comments come on the heels of fresh data showing that consumers are spending more than their confidence levels might suggest.U.S. retail spending rose 4.2% year over year during the holiday season, before adjusting for inflation, according to preliminary data from Visa released Tuesday. The report, which tracks payments activity beginning Nov. 1, found that in-store shopping accounted for 73% of spending, while online sales drove growth, rising 7.8% from a year earlier.At the same time, sentiment remains subdued. Consumer confidence weakened in December as Americans grew more anxious about persistently high prices and the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1, down from an upwardly revised 92.9 in November and nearing the 85.7 level seen in April, when the administration rolled out broad import duties on U.S. trading partners.Likewise, the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, released last week, found that 41% of Americans planned to spend less this holiday season, up 6 points from a year ago, as higher prices continued to shape where and how shoppers spend. Looking ahead, Yalof said retailers appear confident about demand in 2026.\"Retailers want stores. They love bricks and mortar,\" Yalof said, adding that brands are increasingly looking to control their own physical retail presence as department stores continue to consolidate.",

The company has been on an acquisition spree in 2025 as it sought to accelerate growth, McDermott  said. ServiceNow announced a deal for AI agent platform Moveworks for $2.85 billion in March, and at the beginning of December, said it would acquire identity security platform Veza.\"ServiceNow will have the only AI control tower that drives workflow, action and business outcomes across all of these environments,\" McDermott added.

    "body": "Annealed neodymium iron boron magnets sit in a barrel at a Neo Material Technologies Inc. factory in Tianjin, China on June 11, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRare earth magnet makers are having a moment as Western nations scramble to build domestic \"mine-to-magnet\" supply chains and reduce their dependence on China.A turbulent year of supply restrictions and tariff threats has thrust the strategic importance of magnet manufacturers firmly into the spotlight, with rare earths surging toward the top of the agenda amid the U.S. and China's ongoing geopolitical rivalry. Magnets made from rare earths are vital components for everything from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones to medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications, and precision weaponry.It's in this context that the U.S., European Union and Australia, among others, have sought to break China's mineral dominance by taking a series of strategic measures to support magnet makers, including heavily investing in factories, supporting the buildout of new plants, and boosting processing capacity.The U.S. and Europe, in particular, are expected to emerge as key growth markets for rare earth magnet production over the next decade. Analysts, however, remain skeptical that Western nations will be able to escape China's mineral orbit anytime soon.\"Frankly, we were the solution to the problem that the world didn't know it had,\" Rahim Suleman, CEO of Canadian group Neo Performance Materials, told CNBC by video call. Photo taken on Sept. 19, 2025 shows rare-earth magnetic bars at NEO magnetic plant in Narva, a city in northeastern Estonia. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\"The end-market is growing from the point of physics, not software, so therefore it has to grow in this way,\" he continued. \"And it's not dependent on any single end market, so it's not dependent on automotive or battery electric vehicles or drones or wind farms. It's any energy-efficient motor across the spectrum,\" Suleman said, referring to the demand for magnets from fast-growing industries such as robotics. His comments came around three months after Neo launched the grand opening of its rare earth magnet factory in Narva, Estonia. Situated directly on Russia's doorstep, the facility is widely expected to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China. European Union industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, for example, lauded the plant's strategic importance, saying at an event in early December that the project marked \"a high point of Europe's sovereignty.\" watch nowNeo's Suleman said the Estonian facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond.\"Globally, the market is 250,000 tons and going to 600,000 tons, so more than doubling in ten years,\" Suleman said. \"And more importantly, our concentration is 93% in a single jurisdiction, so when you put those two factors together, I think you'll find an enormously quick growing market.\"'Skyrocketing demand'To be sure, the global supply of rare earths has long been dominated by Beijing. China is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency.A recent report from consultancy IDTechEx estimated that rare earth magnet capacity in the U.S. is on track to grow nearly six times by 2036, with the expansion driven by strategic support and funding from the Department of Defense, as well as increasing midstream activity. Magnet production in Europe, meanwhile, was forecast to grow 3.1 times over the same time period, bolstered by the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's demand by 2030.  Regional composition of rare earths and permanent magnet production in 2024, according to data compiled by the International Energy Agency.IEAJohn Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based rare earth magnet producer, told CNBC that the company is seeking to scale up as fast as possible \"so that this fundamental supply chain doesn't hold America back.\" Vulcan Elements is one of the companies to have received direct funding from the Trump administration. The magnet maker received a $620 million direct federal loan last month from the Department of Defense to support domestic magnet production.\"Rare earth magnets convert electricity into motion, which means that virtually all advanced machines and technologies—the innovations that shape our daily lives and keep us safe—require them in order to be operational,\" Maslin told CNBC by email. \"The need for high-performance magnets is accelerating exponentially amid a surge in demand and production of advanced technologies, including hard disk drives, semiconductor fabrication equipment, hybrid/electric motors, satellites, aircraft, drones, and almost every military capability,\" he added. Read moreSeparately, Wade Senti, president of Florida-based magnet maker Advanced Magnet Lab, said the only way to deliver on alternative supply chains is to be innovative.\"The demand for non-China sourced rare earth permanent magnets is skyrocketing,\" Senti told CNBC by email. \"The challenge is can United States magnet producers create a fully domestic (non-China) supply chain for these magnets. This requires the magnet manufacturer to take the lead and bring the supply chain together – from mine to magnet to customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "Jonathan Ross, chief executive officer of Groq Inc., during the GenAI Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, May 30, 2024. David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it's \"entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology,\" without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said \"GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.\"The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.\"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,\" Huang wrote. Huang added that, \"While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.\"Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. watch nowNvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, AI model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X \"moonshot factory.\" Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering \"at this time,\" but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an IPO in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

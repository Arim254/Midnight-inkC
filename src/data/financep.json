    "body": "Around 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026, new LinkedIn research finds. Filadendron | E+ | Getty ImagesArtificial intelligence could be something of a game changer for recruiters as firms continue to be inundated with job applications, according to one LinkedIn executive.Janine Chamberlin, LinkedIn's U.K. country manager, told CNBC Make It in an interview that AI will be a \"critical part of how hiring is done in 2026,\" as it speeds up processes. \"Last year was the year of experimentation and companies and professionals taking their first steps. 2026 is the year of more widespread adoption of AI tools, particularly in hiring,\" she said. AI can help recruiters speed up manual tasks such as going through very high volumes of applications and sifting through resumes and cover letters to find the right skills for a job. \"We've heard from 60% of recruiters that AI is helping them to find what they would call a 'hidden gem' talent — so people that they would have, in their manual search, overlooked, but actually AI is surfacing that as a candidate that is a good match for a specific job, because it can look very specifically at those skills so critically important to do it well,\" Chamberlin said. The job market has been rough for both employers and professionals as widespread layoffs dominate headlines and professionals face intense competition for jobs. Over 1 million job cuts were announced in the U.S. in 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, according to data from consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Meanwhile, the number of applications per role have skyrocketed, making it difficult for employers to respond quickly to applications. In fact, new Linkedin research finds that U.S. applicants per open role have doubled since the spring of 2022.Chamberlin said this is creating an overwhelming cycle in the job market that is difficult for both job seekers and recruiters to handle. \"The job search is tougher right now, because what we are seeing is that there's such a high volume of applications for each role that there is available. So, if I'm a job seeker, I'm applying to lots of roles. On the flip side, there's companies recruiters who are receiving lots of applications.\"Companies are finding it hard to filter through these applications quickly enough to find people with the right skill set for the jobs that they're hiring for. And the job seeker on the other side of that is waiting to hear back from companies whilst getting increasingly anxious because they might not be hearing back,\" Chamberlin said. The anxious job seeker then goes and applies to more roles to increase their chances of getting a job, continuing the cycle. Chamberlin says AI is a \"big part of the solution,\" with 93% of recruiters planning to increase their use of AI in 2026, per the LinkedIn research. Avoid sending generic applications The start of the new year typically brings an influx of new job openings and motivated job seekers. However, as AI becomes central to hiring, many professionals are rethinking how to navigate the job market. LinkedIn's global research, which surveyed 19,000 respondents globally, including from the U.K, U.S., France, Germany and Australia, found that 80% of workers feel unprepared for the job hunt in 2026 and nearly two-thirds feel that the job search has become more challenging. Chamberlin advised tailoring applications and to avoid mass-applying with generic cover letters, as AI is now often the first to review a job application. It's important to \"be targeted\" when crafting your resume and cover letter. \"Applying for roles that genuinely match your skills will always outperform sending lots of generic applications, for both AI and for humans,\" she said. Chamberlin said that using AI can help make your application more succinct as it can identify where you're not highlighting the skills you need for a particular job.\"In an AI-driven job market, clarity is key,\" she said. \"If you can make sure that your skills are highlighted very clearly on your resume, on the cover letter, on your LinkedIn profile, naturally, I think that's what's really going to help you stand out.\"Finally, Chamberlin suggested prioritizing simple formats and to avoid overly stylistic templates as it can be confusing to read for AI.",

    "body": "Farcia Harvey considers herself to be pretty well traveled. The 27-year-old has crossed off New York City, New Orleans for Mardi Gras, Barcelona and Madrid from her travel bucket list. But one of her favorite trips was her 2024 birthday trip to Cincinnati, of all places.\"I think about that trip to Cincinnati genuinely all of the time,\" Harvey tells CNBC Make It, saying she wanted somewhere not too far from her home at the time in Nashville, but not a staycation either. \"It's one of the best memories I have for my birthday, and it's something that to this day, me and my friends still talk about.\"Some of her highlights were hitting the Somerset outdoor bar, Brown Bear Bakery, the Riverfront's walking paths and the city's free streetcar downtown — simpler and slower luxuries that bigger cities may not offer.Her social media posts hyping Cincinnati and under-the-radar cities last summer went viral with over 1 million views on Instagram and Tiktok, prompting thousands of comments shouting out other secondary cities worth a visit.Harvey's love of hidden gem travel is part of a bigger trend where vacationers are seeking slower, more enriching trips away from the busyness of big-city destinations.\"A lot of people truly believe in order to be well traveled, they have to see Europe, they have to see Africa, all of these other places,\" Harvey says. That may be true for some, but not all, she says: \"You can have a great time in the middle of nowhere.\" Farcia Harvey says a birthday road trip from Nashville to Cincinnati was the most memorable vacation she's taken, despite having traveled to major cities around the world.Kaitlyn FitzpatrickSlow travel meets the farmFarm-stay vacations, in particular, are seeing a boom: 84% of travelers said they're interested in staying on or near a farm, according to a recent report from Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo. Interest in rural escapes has boomed for Gen Z travelers over the past two years, with a 300% spike year-over-year in guest reviews mentioning farms on Vrbo.Even life milestone celebrations are getting the slow travel treatment. Aricka Giglia, 28, gathered 10 of her best girlfriends for her bachelorette at a farm outside Dallas last spring.The LA resident wanted her bachelorette to feel more like a wellness retreat than a typical party weekend. But finding the right venue was the challenge.Aricka Giglia of LA hosted her bachelorette on a farm outside Dallas last spring.Courtesy of Aricka GigliaShe ended up booking a three-night stay at Lavender Hill Farmhouse, drawn to its features of a chicken coop, fields with cows and horses, a pond with paddle boats, an outdoor grill where they hosted a hibachi dinner, and a big kitchen where they invited a private chef for another.\"I don't think any of us have traveled intentionally to be with nature,\" Giglia says. \"If it's nature, it's tropical, but it's never a farm.\"\"It's this slow travel movement. People just want a break from the hustle and bustle of everyday life,\" says Melanie Fish, travel expert for Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. \"Specifically they're looking for access to nature walks, hiking, but then, very specific to farm stays, they want a chance to interact with farm animals.\"The unconventional stay was also affordable, Giglia says, estimating her guests paid about $250 each for the weekend — a steal compared to her husband's bachelor party in Los Cabos, Mexico, that ran about $800 per head.Going big on reading retreatsGroup trips at under-the-radar cities have become a big part of Mackenzie Newcomb's business running the Bad Bitch Book Club from New York City.The club, started in 2018, launched its annual summer camp trip for readers to meet in-person in July 2021. About 28 people showed up at the Northern Outdoors campgrounds in Forks, Maine. It was such a hit that the club now hosts reading trips across the U.S. once a month that cost between $900 to $1,500 for basic room packages and a weekend of meals and activities. Last year, BBBC hosted three weeks of summer camp; 400 people applied for 200 spots, Newcomb, 32, says.The Bad Bitch Book Club's annual summer retreat attracts hundreds of people for a weekend of reading and socializing.Courtesy of Mackenzie NewcombDemand is likely to grow: 91% of travelers saying they're interested in taking a trip centered around reading, relaxation and quality time, according to Expedia's travel trends report. Mentions of reading-related terms in Vrbo guest reviews has surged 285% year-over-year, and searches for \"book retreats\" and \"book club retreat ideas\" are up on Pinterest.\"I'm going to credit Booktok with the dramatic rise in what Vrbo is calling 'readaways,'\" says Fish, the travel expert. \"Groups are headed to these serene destinations, coastal homes, country retreats, or just cozy, multi-bedroom getaways with a porch swing that they're dying to curl up in, and their goal is to read.\" There has to be a strong relaxation element and a great view.Mackenzie NewcombCEO and founder of the Bad Bitch Book ClubWhen choosing the right location for a reading retreat, splashier cities aren't always the best move, Newcomb says.Newcomb's least favorite retreats were in Nashville and New Orleans, great cities in their own right, but not good for a reading trip \"because it's all about exploring and not at all about relaxing,\" she says. \"There has to be a strong relaxation element and a great view. When I'm looking for homes, I tend to look for places that people would be just as happy just being in that rental house the entire weekend reading as they would going out and exploring the area.\"To that end, some of her favorite lit trips have taken place in Santa Fe, New Mexico; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Savannah, Georgia; Door County, Wisconsin; Holland, Michigan; The Berkshires in Massachusetts; and Mount Snow, Vermont.Hocking Hills, Ohio, about an hour south of Columbus, is \"a strong contender for a future trip,\" Newcomb says, adding that members have been \"vouching very strongly\" for a book club retreat there for years. \"And of course I'm like, 'I don't want to go to Ohio,' but they insist that it's going to be the place to go.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi speaks to the media after a telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, at her residence in Tokyo, Japan, Jan. 2, 2026. Kyodo | Via ReutersJapan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party is planning to dissolve the country's Lower House later this month and opt for a snap election likely in February, according to public broadcaster NHK. This comes as reports over the weekend from Japanese media said that the LDP was looking to capitalize on Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's high approval ratings to stabilize the ruling coalition.NHK said Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications had instructed the election board in each prefecture to prepare for possible general elections. Takaichi's approval ratings are at a historic 75%, according to a Nikkei survey, marking the third straight month of ratings above 70%.The high ratings come at a time when Tokyo has been locked in a diplomatic spat with Beijing over comments from Takaichi in November about Chinese military action against Taiwan possibly triggering an intervention by Japan's Self-Defense Forces.The snap election, if called in February, would be just about four months into Takaichi's term as prime minister, and would be the first election that the LDP would run with its junior coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party.  Reuters on Monday reported that JIP leader Hirofumi Yoshimura had spoken to Takaichi, and said that the prime minister's view on the timing of the election had shifted to a \"new stage,\" without giving more details.The LDP and the JIP hold 230 seats in the Lower House, and with three independents joining, the ruling coalition now holds a slim majority in the 465-seat chamber. However, the coalition is in the minority in Japan's Upper House, holding only 119 of the 250 seats. Opposition vows change of governmentSeparately, Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan leader Yoshihiko Noda vowed to oust the ruling coalition in an NHK interview, while raising expectations of an alliance with Komeito, the LDP's former coalition partner. The CDP, Japan's largest opposition party, holds 148 seats in the Lower House, with Komeito controlling 24 seats. Komeito had dropped out of the ruling coalition over \"illegal political financing practices\" from the LDP as  Takaichi was running for prime minister in October 2025, ending a partnership that had been in place since 1999. Since taking office, Takaichi has had to contend with a weakening yen, above target inflation, and a weak economy.The yen is currently at its weakest level against the dollar in a year, hitting a low of 158.19 against the greenback on Monday. Inflation in Japan has ran above the Bank of Japan's target for a 44th straight month. Japan's revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed the economy contracted more than initially estimated, shrinking 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from members of the media during a meeting with oil and gas executives in the East Room of the White House on Jan. 9, 2026 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Friday signed an executive order that aims to block the seizure of Venezuelan oil revenue held in U.S. Treasury accounts.The executive order states that the revenue, which is held in foreign government deposit funds, are \"held solely for sovereign purposes\" and that any court attempt to seize the funds will \"materially harm the national security and foreign policy\" of the U.S. The order, which declared a national emergency, said the funds are the sovereign property of Venezuela held in U.S. custody for governmental and diplomatic means, and are not assets subject to private claims. Any use of judicial process against the funds will interfere with efforts to \"ensure economic and political stability in Venezuela,\" the order says.Trump signed the order nearly one week after U.S. military forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, in Caracas. Both were indicted on drug-trafficking charges and have pleaded not guilty. Since the military operation, Trump has said that both nations \"are working well together\" on rebuilding Venezuela's oil and gas infrastructure and that American oil giants will invest at least $100 billion in the South American country.Trump met with major oil industry executives on Friday afternoon in an effort to get U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela. In that meeting, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Trump that right now Venezuela is \"uninvestable.\"ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil exited Venezuela after its government, under President Hugo Chávez, nationalized the country's oil sector along with several other key industries. Both companies have filed arbitration cases against Venezuela seeking billions of dollars in compensation for assets that were expropriated by the government.Chevron is the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela through a special license issued by the Trump administration.In his Friday order, Trump cited the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act and the 1976 National Emergencies Act as legal justification for safeguarding Venezuelan oil revenue in U.S. accounts. The White House did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.",

    "body": "The US Capitol in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 11, 2025. Daniel Heuer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesLawmakers this week plan to revisit efforts to pass a market structure bill that will determine the crypto industry's future in the U.S. — reviving legislative efforts that stagnated last year.On Thursday, the Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to hold hearings on their respective parts of the crypto bill, where they might revise the text. This will lay the groundwork for establishing legislative guardrails for digital assets in the U.S. — a potential watershed moment for the crypto industry. This is what you need to know about the market structure bill and efforts to pass it. The bill's objectiveThe so-called Clarity Act aims to provide legislative guardrails for the multitrillion-dollar crypto market and big digital asset firms — which could accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology and crypto in the U.S. It seeks to clarify the Securities and Exchange Commission's and Commodities Futures Trading Commission's roles in regulating cryptocurrencies, in addition to creating more well-defined token classifications. It also aims to outline registration and compliance standards for a wide range of crypto brokerages, exchanges and other entities, enabling them to operate more easily in the U.S. Those guardrails could help the U.S. court more digital assets companies to set up shop stateside, stimulating the economy and boosting the crypto market, according to Summer Mersinger, CEO of crypto trade group Blockchain Association.\"We've seen this massive movement of companies and activity back on shore because there is a friendly administration to crypto,\" Mersinger said. But, without a market structure law, \"that could all go away, especially if there's a change to an unfriendly administration.\"That said, the bill's implications for digital asset companies, crypto holders and other investors won't be 100% clear until the draft legislation's language is finalized. What's happening this weekLawmakers will attempt to hash out three key issues this week: stablecoin-linked rewards; the treatment of decentralized finance platforms and their developers; and the matter of blocking elected officials such as President Donald Trump from profiting off of crypto ventures. Trump-affiliated entities have launched both a memecoin and nonfungible token in the past. The stablecoin issue is \"the biggest outstanding issue\" for negotiations on the Hill, said Cody Carbone, CEO of crypto trade association Digital Chamber.\"Stablecoin rewards, interest, yields, whatever you want to call it, will be addressed in the bill,\" Carbone said. \"Both Republicans and Democrats have come to that conclusion.\"In early January, the American Bankers Association's Community Bankers Council wrote to Senate members, asking them to prevent stablecoin issuer affiliates from offering rewards to customers. The stablecoin products, they said, exploit a loophole in the stablecoin-centric Genius Act passed last year that prohibits dollar-pegged tokens that offer yields to holders — which pose an attractive alternative to high-yield savings accounts and other traditional products. On the DeFi front, crypto advocates are fighting to ensure developers do not face prosecution when their technology is used for illicit activities like money laundering. \"We're very conscious of how illicit finance is treated in the bill… but we need to make sure that there are not obligations put on codes instead of person, or make sure that there isn't some inadvertent way that the technology is burdened in a way that it can't comply,\" DeFi Education Fund chief legal officer Amanda Tuminelli told CNBC. DeFi advocates also want to ensure the market structure bill contains language allowing individuals to self-custody their crypto. In addition, they want provisions from the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act that call for software developers and blockchain service providers who do not control or custody customer funds to be exempt from registering as money-transmitting businesses. Finally, some lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) want to prevent public officials from profiting off of digital asset ventures while they serve. \" It's a really hard issue,\" Mersinger said. \"They ended up kind of punting [on] it in the House because it was really difficult to put on the bill. A lot of Senate Democrats have said, 'We're not going to punt on this issue.'\" 'Key window'The Senate Agriculture and Banking Committees are expected to put out new drafts of the market structure bill, with the aim of discussing and revising details of the proposed legislation Thursday at markup, according to Mersinger. Later, they will join the two documents to create one big crypto bill. That draft will go to the Senate floor, where discussions could take several weeks, before potentially making its way through the rest of the lawmaking process to become law. Crypto proponents want to see the bill passed before the 2026 midterm elections in case some of the industry's allies are unseated in November and to avoid losing momentum on the Hill, Mersinger told CNBC. \"There's a lot of other priorities Congress has on the books for this year, and so this is kind of the key window that they see to get something to move out of committee onto the floor and have the time that's needed to get it done,\" Mersinger said. ",

    "body": "US President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he departs from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 9, 2026.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is weighing options to take action against Iran, according to multiple reports on Sunday.The president has been shown potential plans, ranging from possible military strikes to action that doesn't include the military, according to MS Now and other media outlets, citing U.S. officials. Trump aides are set to brief the president Tuesday on measures, including military, cyber and economic, to follow through on his threats, according to reports.  Trump has threatened to intervene in Iran in recent days, warning its leaders against using force against protestors. On Saturday, the president said the U.S. is \"ready to help.\"The White House and U.S. Defense Department did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The discussion of possible intervention comes as Iran's clerical leadership is facing the biggest anti-government protests since 2022. More than 500 people have been killed amid a third week of protests and an ongoing economic crisis, according to human rights agencies. Iran's government has intensified its crackdown on protestors, including a reported internet blackout.Iran has been an Islamic Republic since 1979, after the U.S.-backed Shah was deposed by Ayatollah Khomenei. His protégé, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also known as the Supreme Leader, is now in charge. With an inflation rate above 50%, Iran — a country of 92 million people — has one of the highest inflation rates in the world.Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseTrump earlier this week threatened military intervention if Iran moves to crush the protests. Tehran warned on Sunday that it would retaliate against Israeli and U.S. military bases in the event of U.S. strikes on Iran. Some U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle expressed skepticism about the prospect of the U.S. intervening with Iran.\"I don't think it's the job of the American government to be involved with every freedom movement around the world,\" Republican senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said Sunday on ABC News' \"This Week.\" Paul argued that bombing Iran risks rallying its citizens to the government's side. Senate Intelligence Vice Chair Mark Warner, D-Va., said on \"Fox News Sunday\" that history shows the dangers of U.S. intervention, arguing the U.S.-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government triggered a series of events that eventually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime in the 1970s.Others were more hawkish, arguing it is in the U.S.'s best interests to act.On Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., urged Trump to \"embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the regime.\"\"If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people,\" he said.This story is developing.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal prosecutors are conducting a criminal investigation of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell focused on the $2.5 billion renovation to the central bank's headquarters in Washington, D.C., and his related testimony to Congress, he said on Sunday evening.Powell said the probe is the result of longstanding frustration by President Donald Trump over the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates as quickly and as much as the president has demanded. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a video statement tweeted by the Fed's X account.The chairman warned that the outcome of the investigation will determine the future of the central bank's decisions.\"This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation,\" Powell said. Stock futures fell on the heels of Powell's statement.Powell said the Department of Justice on Friday served the Fed \"with grand jury subpoenas threatening a criminal indictment related to my testimony before the Senate Banking Committee last June.\"\"That testimony concerned, in part, a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" he said.The threat of indictment, Powell said, \"is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings.\"U.S. President Donald Trump looks at Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holding a document during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Reuters\"It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project,\" he said. \"Those are pretexts.\"\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy,\" Powell said in his statement. \"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"\"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike,\" Powell said. \"In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment,\" he said. \"Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageNew cellphone video of Minneapolis ICE shooting incident revealedIran's leader accuses protesters of acting for TrumpTrump suggests U.S. military will hit cartels on 'land' in MexicoPortland: Border Patrol agent shoots 2 after ICE killing in MinneapolisTrump 'instructing' his 'Representatives' to buy $200B in mortgage bondsEpstein files: Reps ask judge to appoint special master for document releaseThe New York Times first reported the probe, citing officials briefed on the matter. The probe came to light nearly six months after Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., first said she had referred Powell to the DOJ for the potential crimes of perjury and false statements to federal officials in connection with his testimony about the renovation project for the Fed's headquarters.\"I laid out, in detail, how Jerome Powell lied under oath to Congress and misrepresented facts in official communications to senior administration officials, including OMB Director Russell Vought,\" Luna said in a tweet on Sunday. \"Unelected bureaucrats do not get a free pass. This is exactly why oversight exists, and I am thankful the @DOJ  is taking this seriously. No one is above the law.A person familiar with the investigation told CNBC that they would not dispute the idea that the probe of Powell is related to the building renovation and his testimony to Congress.The investigation is being overseen by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia, according to the newspaper. That office is led by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a former New York state prosecutor and Fox News host, who was appointed to her post by Trump.Trump, in an interview with NBC News on Sunday evening, said, \"I don't know anything about it,\" referring to the criminal probe of Powell.\"But he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" Trump told the news outlet.Trump has repeatedly blasted Powell for the Fed not cutting interest rates as much and as quickly as the president has demanded since entering the White House in January 2025.But the president told NBC on Sunday that the DOJ's subpoenas do not have anything to do with interest rates, according to the outlet.\"No. I wouldn't even think of doing it that way,\" Trump said. \"What should pressure him is  the fact that rates are far too high. That's the only pressure he's  got.\"U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media during a tour of the Federal Reserve Board building, which is currently undergoing renovations, in Washington, D.C., U.S., July 24, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersA DOJ spokesperson, in a statement to CNBC, without saying the comment was about Powell, said, \"The Attorney General has instructed her US Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars.\"Trump has made no secret of his intention to remove Powell as chair after his term expires in May. The two leading contenders are believed to be former Fed Gov. Kevin Warsh and Kevin Hassett, the current director of the National Economic Council.Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, blasted the investigation of Powell and said that he would oppose the nomination of Powell's replacement by Trump, and any other Fed Board nominee, \"until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" the senator said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Trump's \"assault on the Fed's independence continues,\" adding that the president is threatening the strength and stability of the U.S. economy.\"This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,\" Schumer said in a statement. \"Jay Powell and the Fed aren't the reason Trump's economy and his poll numbers are in the toilet. If he's looking for the person who caused that he should look in the mirror.\"Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, echoed Tillis.\"As Donald Trump prepares to nominate a new Fed Chair, he wants to push Jerome Powell off the Fed Board for good and install another sock puppet to complete his corrupt takeover of America's central bank,\" Warren said in a statement.\"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends,\" Warren said. \"This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.\"Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management, in a note to clients on Sunday, wrote, \"President Trump is trying to bring criminal charges against Powell related to his testimony before Congress about the Fed's headquarters renovation.\"\"Powell may protest by staging a sit-in. His term as Chair is up in May, but his term as a governor isn't up until January 2028,\" Jacobsen wrote.\"With the political pressure on the Fed, he may choose to stay on as a governor out of spite. It would deprive President Trump of the ability to stack the board with another appointee,\" Jacobsen wrote. \"Stephen Miran's term is up in January 2026 and that may be the only vacancy Trump gets to fill. It would be unconventional for Powell to stay on, but everything these days is unconventional.\"Trump nominated Powell to the Fed chair position in 2017; he was confirmed in 2018.But almost from the onset of Powell's term, Trump has repeatedly badgered the Fed chair about interest rates. At various times, Trump has called Fed officials \"boneheads\" and once referred to Powell as a golfer who cannot putt.Those criticisms intensified during Trump's second term, as he hectored the central bank to cut rates for months, even after it implemented three consecutive quarter-percentage-point reductions beginning in September.During that time, Trump installed his handpicked choice, Miran, as a Fed governor and has sought to remove another governor, Lisa Cook, from the board over allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.Cook denies those claims, which were made in the form of criminal referrals to the DOJ by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has been an attack dog against perceived enemies of Trump, who appointed Pulte to his post.The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on a case challenging Cook's removal later in January.Krishna Guha, vice chairman of Evercore ISI and head of its Global Policy and Central Bank Strategy Team, in a note to clients on the probe of Powell, said, \"We are stunned by this deeply disturbing development which came out of the blue after a period in which tensions between Trump and the Fed seemed to be contained.\"\"We expect the dollar, bonds and stocks to all fall in Monday trading in a sell-America trade similar to that in April last year at the peak of the tariff shock and earlier threat to Powell's position as Fed chair, with global investors applying a higher risk premium to US assets,\" Guha said. \"Gold and other safe havens should rally.\"— CNBC's Jeff Cox, Eamon Javers, and Garrett Downs contributed to this article",

    "body": "Mornings are one of the most underestimated aspects of a relationship. For many working couples, they're something to rush through on the way to the day ahead. Alarms go off, phones come out, coffee is gulped down, and before either partner is fully awake, they're already headed into separate days.But as a psychologist who studies couples, and as a husband, I've seen that the happiest couples use their mornings productively to make sure they leave the house knowing they're on the same team. Here's what they do differently that most neglect.1. They resist the urge to rush past each otherYour partner shouldn't be seen as an obstacle you have to get around in the morning. Even on busy days, happy couples make a point to acknowledge one another before shifting into work mode.That often means making eye contact when saying \"good morning\" or sharing coffee or tea together without distractions. These moments may seem mundane, but research shows relationships thrive on small \"bids\" for attention that signal recognition and care.Skipping them entirely can leave partners feeling emotionally invisible before the day has even begun.2. They sync before they speakMornings aren't ideal for heavy conversations. Cortisol levels are naturally elevated upon waking, meaning your body is already primed for stress. Trying to tackle nuance or conflict too early can activate that response even more.The happiest couples understand this intuitively. Before diving into logistics or complaints, they take a moment to sync: sitting quietly together, sharing coffee on the couch, or simply standing side by side while doing their morning routines.Even a few moments of silent togetherness can regulate the nervous system and make the day feel more manageable.3. They exchange one honest sentence about how they're feelingRather than full emotional check-ins, happy couples keep morning communication light, but still honest. Each partner shares one sentiment regarding their current feelings:\"I'm feeling a bit anxious about today.\"\"I'm excited but exhausted.\"\"I'm not fully awake yet.\"They're not revolutionary, but they're necessary for giving context to moods and behavior the other will see later on. It's much easier to understand your partner's short temper when you remember that they had a stressful meeting that day.4. They keep one small morning ritual sacredThis could be five minutes of cuddles before getting up, walking the dogs together or cooking breakfast while listening to their song. The point is for it to be simple enough for you to repeat daily without struggle.Having habits like these — routines or rituals that you can call \"our thing\" — can serve as surprisingly strong reaffirmations of your identity as a couple.5. They use touch to regulate, not just to say goodbyeIn many relationships, physical affection in the morning gets reduced to a rushed goodbye kiss on the cheek, if that. But happier couples don't budge on this. They use touch intentionally to ground themselves.Spooning, long hugs, proper kisses or simply just leaning into each other for a moment before leaving — regardless of what suits you, any kind of physical contact like this can activate oxytocin and calm the nervous system, which helps both partners feel steadier as they separate.6. They treat mornings as a shared system, not a solo sprintMornings can get messy if one partner is expected to bear the brunt of the household's mental or physical load.Happy couples reduce this by treating mornings as a shared operation. If there are tasks that have to get done before work, like prepping lunch, feeding pets, or getting the kids ready, they divide them up mindfully and adjust when one partner is struggling. It doesn't have to look like perfect fairness every day. Just ensuring that no one's plate is too full goes a long way in protecting goodwill.7. They send each other into the day feeling supportedBefore parting ways, the happiest couples will always offer at least one small yet specific gesture of support:\"Good luck with your presentation today.\"\"You've got this.\"\"Text me if you need a pep talk.\"While they won't change the day's demands, they can make the demands feel easier to manage. More importantly, they show your partner that you're emotionally attuned to the things that matter to them, even if you're physically present.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

    "body": "watch nowSAN FRANCISCO — Daniela Amodei has an energy that's hard to place — warm, unhurried, immediately present. She swept into a sunlit room on the ground floor of Anthropic's headquarters in December, sat down, and immediately apologized for her mug.\"Is my, like, gigantic novelty mug going to be distracting if I have it?\" she said. \"I'll defer to the wise camera people in terms of what's in the shot.\"It was a disarming kind of normal for someone operating at this level.Five years ago, she and her brother, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, led an exodus from OpenAI.They took a core group of senior researchers and started Anthropic with a contrarian bet: That safety and business success weren't in tension, that the real money wasn't in viral consumer products, and that the artificial intelligence race would be won by the company that knew when to slow down.\"We really just felt more like we were running towards something than running away from something,\" Daniela said of the decision to leave. The co-founders had known each other for years before OpenAI. Her brother and co-founders Tom Brown and Chris Olah worked together at Google Brain. Others overlapped at various labs. watch nowAnthropic's headquarters is on \"AI Alley\" in San Francisco, a 230,000-square-foot glass high-rise in the shadow of Salesforce Tower. The neighborhood is a corridor of startups and tech giants reshaping the American economy from a handful of downtown blocks.Anthropic is now valued at $183 billion and on track to nearly double that, according to a newly signed term sheet, with Microsoft and Nvidia joining its cap table. Revenue has grown ten times annually for three consecutive years, thanks in large part to the fact that the company's AI assistant, Claude, has become the model of choice for enterprises that care about reliability as much as capability.Daniela Amodei mentioned, almost in passing, that Claude once helped diagnose her with a bacterial infection after multiple doctors missed it.With her human-scale, here-and-now energy, she is by most counts the opposite of the AI founder archetype personified by OpenAI's Sam Altman and Tesla/xAI CEO Elon Musk.Even her brother is a version of the technical visionary who speaks in timelines to superintelligence and treats interviews like TED talks.But Daniela Amodei is different.If her brother is the one looking for a path to the horizon, she is pouring the foundation that lets him get there.watch nowAnthropic vs. OpenAIIn November 2022, OpenAI fired the starting gun in the AI race. ChatGPT, a free chatbot anyone could talk to, went viral instantly, hitting 100 million users in two months. Google scrambled. Microsoft went all in. The entire tech industry lurched into motion.But Anthropic didn't sprint. From the start, Anthropic was defined by a contrarian posture toward OpenAI: move slower, ship later, and optimize for trust.While ChatGPT became a flashy consumer toy, the Amodeis made a different bet. They believed that the real money wasn't in viral moments, but in the less glamorous enterprise buildout behind them. It was in Fortune 500 contracts, developer tools, and APIs sold to companies where reliability, security, and compliance are mission critical.\"I wouldn't necessarily say that we knew for sure,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC about the enterprise bet. \"Anthropic, as an organization, is well suited to be a B2B company. We really care about things like reliability and security and safety. That's baked into our DNA.\" Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, said the AI frontier has shifted toward real work — coding, math, science — the kinds of tasks companies will actually pay for. \"The frontier isn't about making our chat better,\" he said, pointing to Anthropic's strength with developers, where Claude has built a reputation as a top-tier programming model, outpacing key rivals in many users' workflows.watch nowEven back in 2020, Daniela Amodei said the team could see a future where Claude would handle many of the high-intelligence tasks humans do at work. \"And we thought, that's a pretty big market.\"Anthropic said its business customer base has grown from under 1,000 to more than 300,000 in two years, and nearly 80% of Claude activity now comes from outside the United States. The customer list reads like a who's who of global enterprise, with Novo Nordisk, the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund — the world's largest — plus Bridgewater, Stripe, and Slack, all running Claude at scale.Sameer Dholakia, a partner at Bessemer Ventures who invested in Anthropic, said the bet made sense for one simple reason: enterprise customers don't churn the way consumers do. \"We really love the focus that they had, and candidly, the focus of Anthropic on safety and trust, we knew was going to play really well with the enterprise buyer, and that's proven to be true.\"While OpenAI still leads in scale and cultural cachet, with ChatGPT a household name boasting nearly 900 million weekly active users, Anthropic is closing the gap fast — and in some areas is already ahead.Today, Anthropic's revenue is roughly 85% business. OpenAI is more than 60% consumer.\"One of the values and the things that we talk about a lot internally is just how not to believe the hype,\" Daniela Amodei told CNBC. \"For us, it's never been about seeking attention or sort of being in the headlines. We're really here to do the work.\"watch now\"As Anthropic goes, so goes generative AI,\" said Alex Kantrowitz, founder of the independent publication Big Technology. \"They have the most pure bet on this technology working. If Anthropic is able to make it work, all of GenAI is going to work. And if not, we're going to have some serious problems.\"Anthropic's lead in enterprise is proving durable. And it's a lead the Amodei siblings have built together.\"It's genuinely a privilege to run Anthropic with my sibling,\" Daniela Amodei said. \"We've known each other our whole lives — or my whole life, at least. He had four years without me, poor guy.\"\"Dario and I really help each other,\" she added. \"He's great at pushing me to think about the big picture... I am helpful in thinking about, like, how do we build an organization that is enduring, that's sustainable, that's filled with great people who really want to do the type of work that we set out to do five years ago.\"watch nowThere's always more work to do, Amodei said, and the models are getting exponentially smarter.She framed it as a lesson from the last generation of tech: If social media companies could go back in time, knowing what their platforms would unleash, would they have done anything differently? Anthropic, she said, is trying to answer that question now: \"To talk about the risks and try to mitigate them\" while it still can.Daniela Amodei is betting it can. She's built her whole company around that conviction.Watch the video to learn more. ",

    "body": "Eugene Mymrin | Moment | Getty ImagesAll computing devices require a part called memory, or RAM, for short-term data storage, but this year, there won't be enough of these essential components to meet worldwide demand.That's because companies like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Google need so much RAM for their artificial intelligence chips, and those companies are the first ones in line for the components. Three primary memory vendors — Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics — make up nearly the entire RAM market, and their businesses are benefitting from the surge in demand. \"We have seen a very sharp, significant surge in demand for memory, and it has far outpaced our ability to supply that memory and, in our estimation, the supply capability of the whole memory industry,\" Micron business chief Sumit Sadana told CNBC this week at the CES trade show in Las Vegas. Micron's stock is up 247% over the past year, and the company reported that net income nearly tripled in the most recent quarter. Samsung this week said that it expects its December quarter operating profit to nearly triple as well. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is considering a U.S. listing as its stock price in South Korea surges, and in October, the company said it had secured demand for its entire 2026 RAM production capacity. Now, prices for memory are rising. TrendForce, a Taipei-based researcher that closely covers the memory market, this week said it expects average DRAM memory prices to rise between 50% and 55% this quarter versus the fourth quarter of 2025. TrendForce analyst Tom Hsu told CNBC that type of increase for memory prices was \"unprecedented.\" Three-to-one basisChipmakers like Nvidia surround the part of the chip that does the computation — the graphics processing unit, or GPU — with several blocks of a fast, specialized component called high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, Sadana said. HBM is often visible when chipmakers hold up their new chips. Micron supplies memory to both Nvidia and AMD, the two leading GPU makers. Nvidia's Rubin GPU, which recently entered production, comes with up to 288 gigabytes of next-generation HBM4 memory per chip. HBM is installed in eight visible blocks above and below the processor, and that GPU will be sold as part of single server rack called NVL72, which fittingly combines 72 of those GPUs into a single system. By comparison, smartphones typically come with 8 or 12GB of lower-powered DDR memory.Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang introduces the Rubin GPU and the Vera CPU as he speaks during Nvidia Live at CES 2026 ahead of the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Jan. 5, 2026. Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBut the HBM memory that AI chips need is much more demanding than the RAM used for consumers' laptops and smartphones. HBM is designed for high-bandwidth specifications required by AI chips, and it's produced in a complicated process where Micron stacks 12 to 16 layers of memory on a single chip, turning it into a \"cube.\"When Micron makes one bit of HBM memory, it has to forgo making three bits of more conventional memory for other devices.\"As we increase HBM supply, it leaves less memory left over for the non-HBM portion of the market, because of this three-to-one basis,\" Sadana said. Hsu, the TrendForce analyst, said that memory makers are favoring server and HBM applications over other clients because there's higher potential for growth in demand in that business and cloud service providers are less price-sensitive. In December, Micron said it would discontinue a part of its business that aimed to provide memory for consumer PC builders so the company could save supply for AI chips and servers. Some inside the tech industry are marveling at how much and how quickly the price of RAM for consumers has increased. Dean Beeler, co-founder and tech chief at Juice Labs, said that a few months ago, he loaded up his computer with 256GB of RAM, the maximum amount that current consumer motherboards support. That cost him about $300 at the time. \"Who knew that would end up being ~$3,000 of RAM just a few months later,\" he posted on Facebook on Monday.watch now'Memory wall'AI researchers started to see memory as a bottleneck just before OpenAI's ChatGPT hit the market in late 2022, said Majestic Labs co-founder Sha Rabii, an entrepreneur who previously worked on silicon at Google and Meta.Prior AI systems were designed for models like convolutional neural networks, which require less memory than large language models, or LLMs, that are popular today, Rabii said.  While AI chips themselves have been getting much faster, memory has not, he said, which leads to powerful GPUs waiting around to get the data needed to run LLMs. \"Your performance is limited by the amount of memory and the speed of the memory that you have, and if you keep adding more GPUs, it's not a win,\" Rabii said. The AI industry refers to this as the \"memory wall.\" Erik Isakson | Digitalvision | Getty Images\"The processor spends more time just twiddling its thumbs, waiting for data,\" Micron's Sadana said.More and faster memory means that AI systems can run bigger models, serve more customers simultaneously and add \"context windows\" that allow chatbots and other LLMs to remember previous conversations with users, which adds a touch of personalization to the experience. Majestic Labs is designing an AI system for inference with 128 terabytes of memory, or about 100 times more memory than some current AI systems, Rabii said, adding that the company plans to eschew HBM memory for lower-cost options. Rabii said the additional RAM and architecture support in the design will enable its computers to support significantly more users at the same time than other AI servers while using less power.Sold out for 2026 Wall Street has been asking companies in the consumer electronics business, like Apple and Dell Technologies, how they will handle the memory shortage and if they might be forced to raise prices or cut margins. These days, memory accounts for about 20% of the hardware costs of a laptop, Hsu said. That's up from between 10% and 18% in the first half of 2025. In October, Apple finance chief Kevan Parekh told analysts that his company was seeing a \"slight tailwind\" on memory prices but he downplayed it as \"nothing really to note there.\"But in November, Dell said it expected its cost basis for all of its products to go up as a result of the memory shortage. COO Jefferey Clarke told analysts that Dell planned to change its mix of configurations to minimize the price impacts, but he said the shortage will likely affect retail prices for devices. \"I don't see how this will not make its way into the customer base,\" Clarke said. \"We'll do everything we can to mitigate that.\"Even Nvidia, which has emerged as the biggest customer in the HBM market, is facing questions about its ravenous memory needs — in particular, about its consumer products.At a press conference Tuesday at CES, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was asked if he was concerned that the company's gaming customers might be resentful of AI technology because of rising game console and graphics cards prices that are being driven by the memory shortage. Huang said Nvidia is a very large customer of memory and has long relationships with the companies in the space but that, ultimately, there would need to be more memory factories because the needs of AI are so high.\"Because our demand is so high, every factory, every HBM supplier, is gearing up, and they're all doing great,\" Huang said. At most, Micron can only meet two-thirds of the medium-term memory requirements for some customers, Sadana said. But the company is currently building two big factories called fabs in Boise, Idaho, that will start producing memory in 2027 and 2028, he said. Micron is also going to break ground on a fab in the town of Clay, New York, that he said is expect to come online in 2030.But for now, \"we're sold out for 2026,\" Sadana said. ",

    "body": "watch nowLeading U.S. oil executives told President Donald Trump at the White House on Friday that Venezuela will need major reforms to attract investment. Trump said Friday the industry would invest at least $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector with U.S. security guarantees. But the CEOs of big oil companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips did not commit at the meeting to quickly re-enter Venezuela. Exxon CEO Darren Woods told Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state. Venezuela seized Exxon's and Conoco's assets in 2007, and Caracas owes the companies billions of dollars in outstanding claims from arbitration cases.\"We've had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen here,\" Woods told Trump at the White House. \"If we look at the legal and commercial constructs and frameworks in place today in Venezuela today, it's uninvestable.\" Exxon is prepared to send a technical team to evaluate the current state of Venezuela's oil industry and assets, Woods said. ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance congratulated Trump on ousting former President Nicolás Maduro. He said the banking sector will need to help restructure Venezuela's debt and provide billions of dollars in financing for the restore the country's infrastructure. Lance also called for the restructuring of state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA).\"As we think that big and bold, we need to be also thinking about even restructuring the entire Venezuelan energy system including PDVSA,\" Lance told the president. Trump told the Conoco CEO that the U.S. government is not looking at recovering the assets the company lost during the 2007 nationalization. \"We're not going to look at what people lost in the past, because that was their fault,\" Trump said. \"That was a different president. You're going to make a lot of money, but we're not going to go back.\"Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with PDVSA. Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said Chevron has a way forward to rapidly ramp up its production, which currently stands at about 240,000 barrels per day. \"We have a path forward here very shortly to be able to increase our liftings from those joint ventures 100% essentially effective immediately,\" Nelson told Trump. \"We are also able to increase our production within our own disciplined investment schemes by about 50% just in the next 18 to 24 months.\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated Thursday that the U.S. might rely more on smaller oil companies, rather than the majors, to invest in Venezuela. \"The big oil companies who move slowly, who have corporate boards, are not interested,\" Bessent said Thursday at the Economic Club of Minnesota. \"I can tell you that the independent oil companies and individuals, wildcatters – our phones are ringing off the hook,\" Bessent said. \"They want to get to Venezuela yesterday.\"",

The deal includes $400 million of Sun Country's net debt.Sun Country and Allegiant each focus on vacationers, particularly to sun-and-beach and other leisure destinations.The deal will test the Trump administration's appetite for an airline merger. Allegiant's Anderson expressed confidence that the agreement would be approved, noting that the two carriers have little network overlap. The airlines expect the deal to close in the second half of this year.Allegiant approached Sun Country in late fall, Anderson said. If the deal is approved by regulators, Anderson would become CEO of the combined airline.

    "body": "A Walmart sign hangs on the exterior of the store on Nov. 20, 2025 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWalmart and Google said Sunday that shoppers will soon be able to use Google's artificial intelligence assistant Gemini to more easily discover and buy products from the retail giant and its warehouse club, Sam's Club.Incoming Walmart CEO John Furner and Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that the companies have teamed up on stage at the National Retail Federation's Big Show, an annual industry conference held at New York City's Javits Center. The CEOs did not say when the new feature will launch or share financial terms. The company said the experience will start first in the U.S. and then expand internationally.With the Google deal, Walmart is boosting its effort to keep up with customers who are using AI chatbots to save time or look for inspiration. Walmart announced a deal with a rival to Gemini, OpenAI's ChatGPT, in October to allow shoppers to make purchases with \"Instant Checkout,\" a feature that allows them to buy an item without leaving the AI chatbot. OpenAI recently launched that feature with Walmart and it has Instant Checkout deals with other retailers, including Etsy and several Shopify merchants like Skims, Vuori and Spanx.Walmart also has its own AI chatbot, a yellow smiley-faced assistant on its app called Sparky.\"The transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" Furner said in a news release. \"We aren't just watching the shift, we are driving it.\"In his remarks on stage, Furner, who will step into Walmart's top role on Feb. 1, said Walmart is \"rewriting the retail playbook\" and, with AI, it's \"trying to close the gap between I want it and I have it.\"Pichai said that Google is excited to work with Walmart and described the adoption of AI as a \"transformative\" moment.For Walmart, the evolution of customers' shopping habits — such as searches that start in an AI chatbot rather than its own app or website — is reshaping the retailer's digital strategy. In a statement, David Guggina, Walmart U.S.'s chief ecommerce officer, said agentic AI \"helps us meet customers earlier in their shopping journey and in more places.\" \"Over time, these agents will make it easier for customers to find what they need, want and love,\" he said.Walmart leaders have also been vocal about how AI will change the workforce and employees' roles, comments that carry additional weight as the company is the largest private employer in the U.S.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who is retiring and will be succeeded by Furner, has spoken about the sweeping impact of the technology, saying that \"it's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe booming GLP-1 space was built on weekly injections. In 2026, new obesity pills will push the market into its next chapter.Patients are already getting their hands on the first GLP-1 pill for obesity from Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk — a once-daily drug that shares the same brand name as its popular injection Wegovy. A GLP-1 pill from the company's chief rival Eli Lilly isn't far behind, with a U.S. approval expected within months. For some people, pills may serve as a more convenient — and potentially cheaper — alternative to today's blockbuster injections. The cash prices of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy pill range from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose, which is slightly less than the newly lowered cash prices of injections. While the pills aren't expected to bring more weight loss than weekly shots, based on separate clinical trials, some health experts say expanding the range of treatments could still be a major win for patients.Pills could attract new patients to seek obesity treatment for the first time, expanding the broader weight loss and diabetes drug market and potentially boosting sales for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. The new users may include people who are afraid of needles, as well as patients who could benefit from existing injections but don't view their condition as severe enough to warrant a weekly shot.\"I think that there are a lot of people out there who have never tried these GLP-1 drugs and are maybe waiting for the pills to come out,\" said Dr. Eduardo Grunvald, medical director of the UC San Diego Health Center for Advanced Weight Management. \"It's kind of a natural preference for some people and even some prescribers.\" \"Secondly, if you have to pay out of pocket, the pills are going to be a bit less expensive than the injections, so that's another reason,\" he said. The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Denmark, Nov. 24, 2025. Tom Little | ReutersIt's unclear exactly how many people are currently using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.Now, pills are emerging as the next battleground for Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which established the GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth almost $100 billion by the 2030s. In August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills could capture roughly 24% — or about $22 billion — of the global weight-loss drug market by 2030.Here's how obesity pills could reshape the space. Pills could expand the market Oral drugs may pull new patients into the obesity treatment market.\"I believe that this will quite a bit expand the market,\" Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC in late December. \"We know from our own family members and circles of friends that there are many people who still would not rather take an injection ... for this group of people, having a pill option is important.\" Pills could prompt some people to start obesity treatment because \"they think it's somehow more acceptable or approachable\" than an injection, said Dr. Caroline Apovian, co-director of the Center for Weight Management and Wellness at Brigham and Women's Hospital. watch nowThat doesn't mean a pill will be the best fit for everyone. But once patients enter the health-care system for treatment, doctors can guide them through all options – whether that's an injection, metabolic surgery, or structured diet and exercise programs, Apovian said.UCSD's Grunvald said uptake of obesity pills is likely to be driven by primary care physicians, who treat the majority of eligible patients and may be more comfortable prescribing an oral drug.Grunvald said obesity medicine specialists, who care for only about 5% to 10% of eligible patients, are more likely to continue favoring injections, which appear more effective than pills based on separate clinical trials.Deborah, a 53-year-old librarian in St. Louis, Missouri, said she is curious about the new Wegovy pill in part because of its convenience factor. She declined to provide her last name due to concerns about stigma associated with GLP-1s.Deborah said she would consider an oral GLP-1 because she is already accustomed to taking pills for other prescriptions. She said an oral drug would also bring other benefits, like making travel easier because it won't require refrigeration, like injections do. She said she is also interested in the potentially lower costs of pills. Deborah has been taking weekly injections of Wegovy since June, and was paying $449 per month in cash before Novo Nordisk lowered that price to $349 per month. Pills cost slightly lessCost could be a factor for other patients, too.Novo Nordisk's pill appears to have among the lowest cash prices in the market, at $149 per month for the starting dose and $299 per month for the two highest doses. Eli Lilly's rival pill is expected to have similar pricing for cash-paying patients. Those users will also be able to access the starting dose of both pills for $149 per month through President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal both companies struck with his administration in November. Obesity injections have long been hard for patients to get, due in part to spotty insurance coverage and list prices of roughly $1,000 per month. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have moved to address those concerns by cutting cash prices for their injectable drugs to less than half that amount.A combination image shows an injection pen of Zepbound, Eli Lilly's weight loss drug, and boxes of Wegovy, made by Novo Nordisk. Hollie Adams | ReutersEli Lilly in December said the highest doses of single-dose vials of Zepbound will cost $449 per month for cash-paying patients, while Novo Nordisk in November said nearly all doses of Wegovy will cost $349 per month in cash. Those prices are closer to the cost of Novo Nordisk's pill, which may still be expensive for some. But Grunvald said the roughly $150 monthly difference between the highest doses of Zepbound and Novo's pill \"could be a big difference for many people\" willing to pay out of pocket.Patients with insurance coverage for Novo Nordisk's oral drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. But pills likely won't move the needle to boost insurance coverage of GLP-1s for obesity in the U.S. The direct-to-consumer cash prices of Novo Nordisk's oral drug are likely \"significantly less\" than what employers and middlemen called pharmacy benefit managers would pay to cover the drugs, said John Crable, senior vice president of Corporate Synergies, an insurance and employee benefits brokerage and consultancy.Crable said it is unclear how much the pill will ultimately cost payers such as employers since those prices are not publicly disclosed. But if they mirror injection costs — often higher than $1,000 per month — employers may be reluctant to add the drug to their formularies, he said. Some companies that already offer coverage of obesity injections could add the pills this year. But Crable said some employers have actually dropped coverage of GLP-1s for obesity in 2026 due to their high costs.\"I don't see employers being highly motivated to add what is probably going to be another high volume, very high cost drug to their formulary when the direct-to-consumer pricing for it is so much cheaper,\" Crable said. Injections are here to stay Drugmakers have tried to make a case that patients using injections can switch easily to oral drugs. Eli Lilly in December released data showing that patients who initially took Wegovy or Zepbound shots maintained the majority of their weight loss after switching to the company's pill. But Apovian, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, said cost would be the only real reason to move patients who are doing well on injections to a pill.\"If the [cash price] is similar, I always prefer the injectables because I believe that the weight loss is better and the side effects are less,\" she said.Apovian said she wants to see real-world data on how pills perform compared with injections, but separate late-stage trials already offer some clues.Zepbound has shown average weight loss of more than 20% in late-stage studies. That's higher than results seen with both the Wegovy injection and pill as well as Eli Lilly's oral drug in separate trials. In those same studies, about 7% of patients or less stopped treatment due to side effects from the Zepbound and Wegovy injections.The Wegovy pill showed similar discontinuation rates, while about 10.3% of patients taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly's oral drug stopped treatment because of side effects.Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said patients with obesity who need to lose a larger percentage of their body weight will likely stick with injections, unless they have a fear of needles.Pills, he said, could primarily attract new patients who are overweight or mildly obese and want to achieve only \"modest\" weight loss.Some patients currently using weekly injections may try pills, Risinger added, though not all will find a daily oral option more convenient.That includes Karen Galante, 42, of Horsham, Pennsylvania, who is taking a compounded version of semaglutide – the active ingredient in Wegovy – which she said is priced similarly to Novo Nordisk's new pill.Galante said she does not plan to switch.\"It's hard enough for me to remember to take my vitamins every day,\" she said. \"I like the set-it-and-forget-it of taking one shot a week.\" More than enough room for Novo, LillyRisinger said he expects both pills from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly to \"take off like a rocket\" this year. He noted that uptake will be greater for the Wegovy pill initially since Eli Lilly's drug, orforglipron, is likely still months away from entering the market. But Risinger said he believes Eli Lilly's pill will ultimately generate higher sales because patients could consider it more convenient.Eli Lilly's orforglipron is a small-molecule drug that is absorbed more easily in the body and doesn't require dietary restrictions like Novo Nordisk's pill, which is a peptide medication. Patients are supposed to drink no more than four ounces of water with the Wegovy pill and must wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking anything else each day. But Novo Nordisk's CEO Doustdar has argued that those dietary requirements won't hinder uptake. He told CNBC in December it has not been an issue for the more than a million people who are taking the lower-dose version of the pill for diabetes, marketed as Rybelsus, which entered the market in 2019. \"Simply sip and go, and you're going to be fine,\" Doustdar said. \"These people are waking up in the morning and taking their pill with a glass of water, and then they do their normal daily routine half an hour later and move on with their life.\"He also called the company's drug the \"most efficacious pill,\" saying that no other products in development have been able to show its same level of weight loss in a late-stage trial. The highest dose of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy pill helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average at 64 weeks in one late-stage study. That's comparable to the injectable form of the drug. There are no head-to-head studies directly comparing that pill with Eli Lilly's. In one of Eli Lilly's late-stage trials, the highest dose of its pill helped patients lose 12.4% of their body weight on average at 72 weeks. Despite that difference in efficacy, Risinger said the two pills are viewed as promoting roughly similar levels of weight loss. Some patients may also not need to take the highest dose of either pill, he added. In an August note, Goldman analysts said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment. The analysts said they expect the remaining 19% slice to go to other emerging pills.More competitors emergeOther drugmakers are racing to bring their own oral options to the market, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics. Risinger highlighted Structure's daily oral GLP-1, which will enter phase three trials later this year. Shares of Structure soared more than 100% on Dec. 9 after it released midstage data showing that its pill, aleniglipron, helped patients with obesity lose more than 11% of their weight at 36 weeks, when adjusted for placebo. Additional trial data showed that a higher dose of the pill could deliver greater efficacy – more than 15% weight loss – surpassing the results seen with the highest dose of Eli Lilly's orforglipron. Still, the tolerability data, or how well patients tolerated Structure's treatment, appeared to be worse than that of Eli Lilly's pill. In a release at the time, Structure CEO Raymond Stevens said the pill could be \"potentially best-in-class\" for an oral small-molecule GLP-1. Risinger said he expects that pill and another oral GLP-1 from AstraZeneca could launch as soon as late 2028. He said potential pills that are taken weekly, as opposed to daily, and have \"compelling profiles could tilt the balance more towards orals\" in the market. Risinger pointed to privately held Verdiva Bio, which is developing several oral peptide treatments designed to be taken once a week. That company has an ongoing phase two trial on an oral GLP-1. ",

Mattias Balk | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesIn a time of geopolitical tensions and macro uncertainty, dividend-paying stocks can offer investors some steady portfolio income.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive stocks of companies that generate solid cash flows to support continued dividend payments.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Permian ResourcesWe start this week with Permian Resources (PR), an independent oil and natural gas company with assets in the Permian Basin, with a concentration in the core of the Delaware Basin. At a base dividend of 15 cents per share (an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share), PR stock offers a dividend yield of 4.3%.In a recent research report, Siebert Williams analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Permian Resources stock with a price forecast of $19, saying, \"Extending track record of operational execution with a near-term focus on 4Q25, where the implied oil production guidance midpoint is ~187.4 Mbbls/d on a capex of $484.6 mn.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on PR stock with a price target of $16.Sorbara noted that Permian is sticking to its plan to reward shareholders through a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share and opportunistic stock buybacks. Notably, the company has a $1 billion buyback authorization with no end date. The five-star analyst expects Permian to raise its dividend next year and beyond. Meanwhile, Sorbara expects the company to release its 2026 outlook in February once it finalizes a plan that fits the commodity price and service cost backdrop. The analyst expects Permian to benefit from several positives in 2026, including lower drilling costs, an increased production base in the second half of last year, steady operational strength, and better pricing from recent deals. Sorbara expects these tailwinds to drive efficiency in production, capital spending and free cash flow.Additionally, Sorbara noted Permian's efforts to further strengthen its balance sheet, aiming for a long term net-debt/EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) target of 0.5x-1.0x. Also, the $500 million to $1 billion of cash on hand gives the company flexibility to execute capital allocation options like acquisitions, buybacks, and debt reduction even at West Texas Intermediate crude prices in the range of $35 to $40/bbl.Sorbara ranks No. 522 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.4%. See Permian Resources Ownership Structure on TipRanks.International Business MachinesTech giant IBM (IBM) is this week's second dividend pick. The company returned $1.6 billion in dividends to shareholders in the third quarter of 2025. With a quarterly dividend of $1.68 per share (annualized dividend of $6.72 per share), IBM offers a yield of 2.2%.Recently, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill upgraded IBM stock to buy from hold and raised the price target to $360 from $300, citing \"a clearer path to software acceleration, improving fundamentals, and valuation not yet fully reflecting the software premium.\" TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on IBM stock with a price target of $354.The five-star analyst noted management's more favorable outlook across key growth areas, with tech transformation and rapid AI adoption fueling broad-based demand. Thill noted that improving regulatory and tax policies, solid organic software growth, synergies from recent mergers and acquisitions and key wins in generative AI consulting are also supporting management's optimism.Notably, synergies from the HashiCorp acquisition and the pending Confluent (CFLT) deal are expected to drive accelerated software growth in 2026 compared to just under 10% exiting 2025. Thill also expects IBM to deliver consistently improving margins (estimates pretax margin of 21% in 2027 compared to 19% in 2025), driven by a growing software mix and operational discipline.With IBM trading at 26x 2027 P/E multiple, compared to the large-cap software peer average of 35x, Thill finds the stock's valuation attractive and contends that it still has upside as the software reacceleration expectation is not priced in.Thill ranks No. 539 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 11%. See IBM Statistics on TipRanks. Kinetik HoldingsKinetik Holdings (KNTK) is a midstream energy company focused on the Delaware Basin in the Permian. With a quarterly cash dividend of 78 cents per share (an annualized dividend of $3.12 per share), KNTK stock offers a yield of 8.5%.On Jan. 5, Raymond James analyst Justin Jenkins upgraded Kinetik stock to buy from hold with a price target of $46. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating with a price target of $34.\"The stock is down ~38% TTM, and the magnitude of that reset is a core component of our thesis as investor focus shifts toward 2026-27, where operational visibility improves while valuation continues to reflect meaningful skepticism,\" said Jenkins.Jenkins believes that KNTK's risk-reward is getting more attractive, with the earnings outlook for 2026 to 2027 becoming clearer. The improving earnings expectations are backed by more meaningful full-year contributions from the Kings Landing project and better system connectivity as the ECCC pipeline moves toward its Q2 2026 start-up.The analyst's optimism is also backed by its acid-gas injection project, planned for late 2026, which will open access to more sour gas and ease utilization constraints in the Delaware system. Jenkins also expects several macro and operational factors that affected 2025 performance to improve into mid-2026, including Waha price conditions and additional volumes tied to Permian dry gas expansion.Trading at about 8x 2027 EV/EBITDA, at the low end of the midstream peer group valuation range of 8x to 12x, Jenkins finds KNTK stock attractive, with the balance sheet getting stronger after the divestiture of its equity interest in EPIC Crude Holdings, LP. Interestingly, Jenkins sees the possibility of KNTK being a buyout target for midstream companies that want to combine more Permian NGL (natural gas liquids) volumes.Jenkins ranks No. 63 among more than 10,400 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 74% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.1%. See Kinetik Holdings Financials on TipRanks. ",

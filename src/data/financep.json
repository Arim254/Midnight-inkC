    "body": "Paris Hilton is successful many times over. The reality TV star turned entrepreneur is the founder and CEO of 11:11 Media, a global entertainment company she aims to become \"the next Disney\" that combines her passions in music, beauty, fashion and philanthropy.But people haven't always believed in her business savvy.\"For a long time, I felt like people had an idea of who I was that didn't reflect the real me,\" Hilton told CNBC Make It over email following an appearance at the American Express Leadership Academy. \"Early in my career, I leaned into the character I created on 'The Simple Life,' but behind the scenes, I was laser-focused on building my brand.\"Now, the multi-hyphenate and CNBC Changemaker says she's been able to \"take back my narrative\" through career achievements like launching her company in 2021 and using her platform to advocate for kids in what's known as the \"troubled teen industry.\"\"I've learned that the best way to overcome being underestimated is to let your work speak for itself and to show up authentically,\" Hilton said.The businesswoman said authenticity is a key trait in the people she decides to work with, in addition to being passionate and creative. \"And kindness is non-negotiable for me,\" Hilton added. \"It shows people's true character, and I want my brand and everyone who represents it to lead with kindness.\"Authenticity also guides her philanthropy. \"Every cause I champion comes from my lived experience, and I would never fight for something I didn't believe in wholeheartedly,\" she said.In recent years, Hilton has used her spotlight to advocate for children harmed by America's child welfare, juvenile justice, education and health-care systems. Last year, she appeared before Congress and helped to pass the bipartisan Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act.Hilton encouraged other young entrepreneurs to meaningfully integrate philanthropy into their work. \"Impact shouldn't be an afterthought; it should be part of your mission from the very beginning,\" Hilton said, adding that the second hire she made for her company was 11:11 Media's head of impact Rebecca Grone.\"I'd also encourage young entrepreneurs to think creatively about impact and truly listen to the communities they want to serve,\" Hilton said. \"When you have a platform or influence, you can inspire your audience to take action alongside you, and that's a powerful way to create lasting change.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A street sign is seen near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., August 7, 2025.  Eduardo Munoz | ReutersNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams met with Wall Street's dealers last week about a key lending facility, the Financial Times reported, citing three individuals familiar with the matter.The meeting, which took place on the sidelines on Wednesday at the Fed's annual Treasury market conference, included representatives from many of the 25 primary dealers of banks that underwrite the government's debt, according to the report. The meeting participants were members of banks' teams that specialize in fixed income markets, the report said.CNBC has confirmed the meeting took place.Williams sought feedback from these dealers on the use of the Fed's standing repo facility — a permanent lending tool that allows eligible financial institutions to borrow cash from the central bank in return for high-quality collateral such as Treasury bonds. The tool would allow institutions to sell securities to the Fed with an agreement to repurchase them at a later time, essentially acting as a backstop for markets.\"President Williams convened the New York Fed's primary trading counterparties [primary dealers] to continue engagement on the purpose of the standing repo facility as a tool of monetary policy implementation and to solicit feedback that ensures it remains effective for rate control,\" a spokesperson for the New York Fed told the Financial Times, which reported the news on Friday.The meeting took place amid brewing concerns about stress in parts of the U.S. financial system and signs of tighter market liquidity.Roberto Perli, who manages the Fed's System Open Market Account, which is the central bank's bonds and cash holdings, said Wednesday that firms in need of the central bank's standing repo facility should \"be used whenever it is economically sensible to do so.\"The New York Fed did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read the complete Financial Times report here.",

    "body": "A SK Hynix Inc. 12-layer HBM3E memory chip displayed at the Semiconductor Exhibition in Seoul, South Korea. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChipmakers and analysts are warning of a memory chip shortage that could hit the consumer electronics and automotive industries next year, as companies prioritize massive demand from the artificial intelligence boom. In an earnings call on Friday, the CEO of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest contract chipmaker, said that fears of a memory chip shortage were prompting its customers to hold back orders for other types of chips used in their products.\"Everyone is hesitant to place too many orders or ship too much in the first quarter of next year because they don't know how many mobile phones, cars, or other products [the memory chip industry] can supply,\" said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-CEO, according to a Google translation. Analysts say these supply constraint concerns come as chip manufacturers focus on advanced memory chips used in artificial intelligence computing, with less focus on production needed for consumer products. \"The AI build-out is absolutely eating up a lot of the available chip supply, and 2026 looks to be far bigger than this year in terms of overall demand,\" Dan Nystedt, vice president of research at TriOrient, told CNBC. AI servers primarily run on processors from chip designers like Nvidia. These AI processors heavily rely on a type of memory known as High-Bandwidth Memory or HBM, which has proven extremely lucrative for memory companies like SK Hynix and Micron to pursue. Memory suppliers have been chasing as much of this AI demand as possible thanks to typically high margins, Nystedt said, noting that AI server companies are willing to pay top dollar for premium chips. \"It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,\" he said. Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that the memory industry suffered some severe downturns in 2023 and part of 2024, leading to under-investment in the industry. \"They're building new capacity now, but it will take time to get running.\"Broader impacts In the face of supply constraints, memory companies have reportedly been raising prices of their chips. Just last Friday, Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics had quietly raised prices on select memory chips by as much as 60% compared to September. Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \"With memory prices rising and availability shrinking, concerns about production bottlenecks are gaining traction,\" M.S. Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. \"Supply tightness is already hitting low-end smartphones and set-top boxes, but we think the risk could broaden,\" he added. China is \"feeling the pinch more acutely\" due to high reliance on low-cost devices, but Hwang cautioned that the supply constraints were a global problem.  In the meantime, consumers could pay the price of memory shortages. In a report on Monday, tech-focused market intelligence and consulting firm TrendForce predicted that the memory industry has begun a \"robust upward pricing cycle,\" which could force downstream brands to hike retail prices, adding pressure on the consumer market.As a result, the research group predicted increased price and demand pressures for consumer products like smartphones and notebooks. ",

    "body": "Visitors in front of the Cinderella Castle at Tokyo Disneyland in Tokyo, Japan on Jan. 17, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan on Monday said it dispatched a senior foreign ministry official to China to ease rising tensions, public broadcaster NHK reported, as tourism-exposed stocks in Tokyo slumped amid the diplomatic feud.Masaaki Kanai, a director-general at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is expected to meet his counterpart Liu Jinsong on Tuesday, according to media outlet Kyodo.Japan's tourism-exposed stocks fell Monday after Beijing issued a travel and study alert for its citizens considering going to Japan.Beauty and cosmetics firm Shiseido, which relies heavily on Chinese spending, plunged 9.08%. Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings, the parent company of the Mitsukoshi and Isetan department-store chains, lost more than 11%.Oriental Land, operator of Tokyo Disney Resort, declined 5.68%. Shares of airline operator ANA Holdings fell 3.35%. Hankyu Hanshin Holdings, a rail, retail and hotel operator, was 1.99% lower.China on Thursday accused Japan of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks \"egregious\" and demanded a retraction.Takaichi has refused to walk back her comments, although she acknowledged she would adopt a more cautious tone when addressing such matters in parliament.Beijing on Friday issued a travel advisory, saying Takaichi's remarks had raised risks for Chinese nationals in Japan. Chinese airlines responded by offering full refunds or free itinerary changes for flights to Japan.China's foreign ministry said Takaichi's remarks amounted to a provocation. \"These actions by Japan have inevitably raised strong questions and concerns among its Asian neighbors and the international community,\" China's Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lin Jian said, according to a Google translation of his Mandarin remarks.Japan was the fourth-most popular outbound destination for Chinese travelers in the first 11 months of 2024, accounting for more than 5% of all overseas trips, according to a Citibank report, citing data from the China Tourism Academy. Almost one-fifth of international visitors to Japan in 2024 came from China, or around 7 million people, according to provisional data from the Japan National Tourism Organization.Tokyo on Saturday urged Beijing to keep its response measured, Japan's top government spokesperson, Minoru Kihara, was quoted by Kyodo as saying, adding that China should take \"appropriate measures,\" without offering details.These flare-ups come amid a history of nationalist-driven backlash against Japanese businesses in the mainland. In 2023, Chinese consumers, angered by Japan's release of treated Fukushima nuclear-plant wastewater, mounted a boycott of Japanese cosmetics and household-goods brands.",

    "body": "Tokyo, Japan skyline with the Tokyo TowerChunyip Wong | E+ | Getty ImagesJapan's economy contracted by a smaller-than-expected 1.8% in the third quarter on an annualized basis, with growth in private and government consumption limiting the decline.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4%, government data released Monday showed.The fall in growth, however, was softer than Reuters poll estimates of a 2.5% annualized contraction and a 0.6% sequential drop.Public demand grew 2.2% annualized, supported mostly by government consumption, while private demand fell 1.8%, dragged lower by a more than 32% drop in residential investments.Exports shrank 4.5% in the third quarter on an annualized basis and 1.2% compared to the second quarter when they had risen by 2.3%.The yen weakened marginally against the dollar, while the Nikkei 225 was down 0.29%. Yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds inched up 3 basis points to 1.73%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan's exports had seen contractions for four straight months since May as U.S. tariffs hurt shipments, although September saw a rebound to growth. Tokyo in July clinched a trade deal with Washington, bringing down tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from 25%, effective Aug. 7.Domestic consumption helped slow the economic contraction, with government and private consumption up 0.5% and 0.1%, respectively, compared to the second quarter. Public demand was a bright spot, growing 0.5% quarter on quarter and contributing 0.1 percentage point growth to the Japanese economy.Private demand proved to be the largest drag on GDP this quarter, declining 0.4% compared to the quarter before and pulling the economy down by 0.3 percentage point, as residential investments plunged 9.4%.Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said he expects GDP growth to rebound going forward, adding that the impact of new housing rules is expected to diminish. In 2024, Japan mandated stricter energy conservation standards for all new projects starting April 1 this year.Taguchi said that easing uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariffs, as well as the agreement between Washington and Beijing to lower reciprocal duties appear to be influencing orders from Japan positively.The weak quarterly growth is likely to bolster Japan's newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's plans to stimulate the economy.Japan's government has reportedly called for \"bold and strategic\" investment in crisis management and growth areas in its upcoming stimulus package by Takaichi's administration.Citing a draft, Reuters reported that \"Japan's government will pledge to increase spending 'without hesitation' to support an economy on the cusp of emerging from stagnation.\" The government will also promote investment in \"key growth areas,\" including artificial intelligence, semiconductors and shipbuilding.Earlier this month, Nikkei reported that the package was over 10 trillion yen ($64.63 billion), including subsidies for electricity and gas bills, as well as help for small and medium companies to help increase wages.",

    "body": "Adriana Kugler testifies before a Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to be a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2023. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersFormer Federal Reserve Board Gov. Adriana Kugler last year broke the central bank's rules barring trading of individual stocks and executing financial transactions close to meetings where interest rates are set, actions that led up to her abrupt resignation, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics released Saturday.The report comes three months after Kugler mysteriously left from the Fed's Board of Governors without giving a reason. Kugler joined the Fed in September 2023 after being appointed by then-President Joe Biden.Kugler's resignation came after she requested and was denied a waiver by Chair Jerome Powell on a disclosure form that showed she had impermissible holdings, Fed officials familiar with the matter told CNBC.com.An official said that concerns related to trading activity by Kugler or her husband date to at least September 2024, when she began working with ethics officials to resolve violations of trading policies.A financial disclosure report that Kugler filed with the OGE this year on Sept. 11 — which contains details of securities transactions by either her or her husband — notes that an Ethics Office official declined to certify the report.In a note on Friday's disclosure, an Ethics official says, \"Matters related to this disclosure were referred earlier this year\" by the office to the independent Office of Inspector General for the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. An inspector general is an internal ethics watchdog for federal departments and agencies.Another note on the report says, \"Consistent with her September 15, 2024, disclosure, certain trading activity was carried out by Dr. Kugler's spouse, without Dr. Kugler's knowledge and she affirms that her spouse did not intend to violate any rules or policies.\"Troubles with tradesKugler is married to Ignacio Donoso, who is an immigration lawyer.Her disclosure shows two kinds of violations of Fed rules regarding financial transactions by senior officials at the central bank: purchases of stock shares of individual companies, as opposed to mutual funds; and purchases of securities during so-called \"blackout periods\" leading up to and after meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee.The FOMC meetings set key interest rates. Speculation about those meetings and their actual outcome can significantly affect the prices of stocks and bonds.Kugler's violations were related to purchases of stock in companies including Apple, Southwest Airlines, Caterpillar and Cava Group, the report indicates.Kugler participated in FOMC meetings during her tenure at the Fed. But she missed the FOMC's meeting this past July due to what the Fed had publicly said was a personal matter.Shortly before the July meeting, Kugler requested a waiver of the Ethics disclosure filing deadline to address the issue of impermissible holdings within her investment portfolio, according to Fed officials who spoke with CNBC.Two months earlier, she had asked for and received a standard extension for filing annual ethics disclosures, officials said.Powell, given the repeated efforts to deal with Kugler's issues, denied her request for another waiver, which led to her not participating in the FOMC meeting in July.Shortly afterward, on Aug. 1, Kugler announced her intention to resign on Aug. 8In another disclosure filed in October 2024, Kugler likewise pointed a finger at her husband Donoso for four stock purchases — three of Apple shares in July that year, and one of Cava shares that September — which violated Fed trading rules.\"These four purchases were carried out by my spouse, without my knowledge, and I affirm that my spouse did not intend to violate any rules,\" Kugler said at the time.\"Upon learning about the purchases, I immediately notified ethics officials, and at their direction, I initiated divestiture of these assets as soon as possible under FOMC ethics policies.\"CNBC has reached out to Kugler for comment on the new Ethics disclosure report, which also discloses that Kugler received more than $41,000 worth of \"pro bono legal services\" from the law firm Arnold & Porter.Pro bono means for free.CNBC has also requested comment from Donoso.Rule changesAfter she resigned from the Fed, Kugler returned to Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where she is a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and Economics.In early 2022, the Fed adopted new rules that banned officials from trading in individual stocks and bonds, as well as cryptocurrencies.That move came after revelations that then-regional Fed presidents Eric Rosengren of Boston and Robert Kaplan of Dallas traded stocks and stock funds shortly before the central bank adopted broad measures to support the U.S. economy during the first weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic.Rosengren and Kaplan were cleared of any legal wrongdoing, but both of them left their positions amid questions about the propriety of Fed officials possibly using privileged information for financial gain. Other trades from Fed officials, including Powell, also faced scrutiny and drew intense criticism from the public and on Capitol Hill.Kugler's surprise resignation allowed President Donald Trump to appoint Stephen Miran to replace her for the remainder of her term on the Fed Board of Governors.Miran, whose current term ends on Jan. 31, took an unpaid leave of absence as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors.In 2024, the Fed's inspector general found that Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, who is retiring in February, violated trading rules.",

    "body": "I'd imagine people usually feel anxious about making a drastic life change like picking up and moving to a new country. But I remember sitting in the airport in Los Angeles, Tony Tony Chopper water bottle in hand, feeling excited and eager to start my new life. All I could think about was finding a favorite matcha cafe to spend my mornings in after touching down in Tokyo. Growing up in Southern California, I had always been interested in Japanese culture and cuisine. During the pandemic, I became obsessed with anime: the characters who never gave up, the friendships, the quiet slice-of-life moments. I was infatuated with the sound of the language and the minimalist aesthetic. The shows made me want to experience it all for myself. In January 2025, a little less than a year after I graduated from UC Irvine, I boarded that flight to move to Japan. Escaping financial pressureI've never been someone who followed the \"safe path.\" Even in college, where I studied business administration and management, I avoided internships that would lead to a 9-to-5 corporate career. Deep down, I knew I wanted more freedom than that.But freedom is expensive in America. I was working four jobs after graduation — as a full time visual merchandiser at Lululemon, owner of a small sticker business, real estate sign manager, and organizational manager at a lacrosse club. I felt weighed down by the financial pressure of just existing. It felt impossible to be able to afford rent, health care, and other basics without getting a corporate job.So when I stumbled across an ad in June 2024 about teaching English in Japan with an Eikaiwa, or conversation school, I applied on a whim. I went through an all-day interview process and got the job. I didn't hesitate. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItAlthough they were supportive, everyone around me thought I was crazy for leaving behind a seemingly stable life in California. Why wouldn't I want to be close to family and a long-term boyfriend? But Japan had been calling me for years, and this felt like my chance. Six months of paperwork, packing, and goodbyes later, I was on my way. Living in JapanWhen I arrived in Japan, something about it immediately felt right. Best of all, I could afford to live alone. For 74,460 yen (or $483 a month), I ended up in an apartment in Nakahara-ku, which is part of Kawasaki City and about 15 minutes by train to Tokyo. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItMy apartment has plenty of natural light and even a tatami room (a traditional room with straw mat flooring for tea ceremonies), just like the ones I'd seen in anime. In the U.S., I'd never be able to afford something like this on my own. In Japan, it felt attainable, even comfortable, on my 277,500 yen (about $1,800) a month teaching salary.The cost of living surprised me in other ways, too. A filling meal in Tokyo — like a traditional teishoku (meal set) with a beef rice bowl, miso soup, eggs, and a drink  — could cost just 1,000 yen (about $6), compared to the $20 I was used to paying in California. My company covered my commuting costs and groceries didn't break the bank. For the first time, my basic needs were covered without me constantly worrying. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItTeaching was never my passion, though. It was an \"in\" that allowed me to move to Japan, and for that I'll always be grateful. But after about six months, I realized I wanted something different.Now I make social media content for a language app for $175 a week and work as a freelance digital marketing assistant for $25 an hour. The number of hours for the latter has varied so far from about 50 in August to three in September when we were in between clients to 22 in October, since I traveled to Hawaii and Okinawa that month.Being here has freed up not just money, but mental space. I can focus on pursuing hobbies like creating content about moving abroad, going to the gym, studying Japanese, and connecting with locals, instead of always stressing about how to make ends meet.Dealing with downsidesMoving hasn't been without challenges. Sometimes the language barrier feels frustrating and overwhelming, like when I need to go to the bank or post office, call my phone carrier, or navigate a doctor's appointment. I often rely on AI to translate or ask a friend to help. This, in part, is what motivates me to learn the language better. Marc Aziz Ressang for CNBC Make ItAnd I miss my friends and family back in California. There are days when I feel the sting of loneliness despite being surrounded by millions of people. I'm an extrovert, but even for me it can get tiring to go out of my way to overcome the language barrier and make friends. These struggles have made me more independent and patient, though. And when I slide the door shut on my tatami room and step out of my apartment each morning, I feel a mix of belonging and gratitude. This is my chance to live the life I dreamed about while watching anime as a teenager. I don't know how long I'll stay in Japan. But for now, I'm cherishing every moment. I feel like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.Ashley Peters is a digital creator and marketing assistant based in Japan, sharing stories about life abroad, language learning, and creative growth.

    "body": "The exterior of the main entrance of Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordDEARBORN, Mich. — Ford Motor is swapping its 1950s \"Glass House\" headquarters for a new, modern industrial facility to promote collaboration and better appease thousands of employees who have returned to offices in recent years after remote working.The new 2.1-million-square-foot facility in Dearborn, Michigan, is ceremoniously opening Sunday, although construction is expected to continue into 2027.It replaces a 12-story, rectangular-shaped headquarters roughly three miles away in the city that is expected to be demolished. The new building marks Ford's sixth headquarters since its founding in 1903.Currently nicknamed \"The Hub,\" the new headquarters will consolidate thousands of employees and several prior locations under one — albeit very large — roof. It is eventually expected to be home to up to 4,000 executives and employees involved with daily business operations, design and product development.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordFrom an operational basis, the new headquarters is roughly split evenly between office functions and design and industrial operations. Design includes massive studios with hidden courtyards and a large showroom. The other half is set to be used for general business operations such as executive offices and common work and meeting areas.There are very few actual offices outside of those for top executives, according to the company. The idea is for employees to be able to work as they choose in different areas, or \"neighborhoods,\" depending on what they're working on that day, officials said. Domain staking, where employees attempt to make a space their permanent workplace, will be discouraged, said Jennifer Kolstad, global design and brand director for Ford Land, the automaker's property management group.\"It's not just a building. This is a space that is a tool for our employees to be more productive, to be more collaborative, and really help deliver the Ford+ plan,\" said Jim Dobleske, Ford Land chair and CEO, during a tour of the building.The Ford+ plan was introduced by CEO Jim Farley as a turnaround and efficiency plan for the automaker in 2021.A coffee bar in Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordAs of the end of last year, Ford employed roughly 30,500 white-collar salaried workers in the U.S. The company continues to own or utilize other properties throughout the U.S., including large bases in Dearborn and surrounding areas.Many salaried employees are expected in offices at least four days a week, as of earlier this year, after many of them had a more loose hybrid office-home schedule following the end of the pandemic.\"We're inviting them back into a space that is a tool to help them do their best work. And that best work tends to come with collaboration with other teams,\" Dobleske said.Scratch kitchensSome of that collaboration is expected to occur over food.The new headquarters includes a 160,000-square-foot dining area with eight \"kitchen concepts\" that will feature rotating menus as well as take-home options such as pizza and $6 whole rotisserie chickens, decadent desserts and a juice bar complete with a herb garden.A worker takes out a batch of rotisserie chickens inside Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025, in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBC\"We have guests coming in from all over the world, so we wanted to make sure we have designed our menus to kind of play homage to that diversity,\" said Grant Vella, executive chef for the new ]headquarters. \"We wanted to do something different, push the boundary of business dining.\"Outside of the kitchens and dining areas, vegetation and outdoor spaces are meant to make for a more walkable-friendly campus compared with the automaker's prior, largely street- and parking lot-locked facility.\"This headquarters is the cornerstone of our campus redevelopment, but there's been a tremendous amount of work that we have done throughout the campus to really connect it and make it much more walkable for our employees,\" Dobleske said, pointing to several facilities and areas, including a test track and 18-acre \"Horsepower Park,\" surrounding the building.An herb garden inside the dining and kitchen area of Ford Motor's new world headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.Michael Wayland / CNBCInside the building are six courtyards, including a dual-level one at the center of the company's new design studios to allow designers to take products outside to view them outdoors in natural light. Those design courtyards are exclusive areas that can only be viewed by the surrounding, private studios.Most of the four-story building features outside natural light from the exterior glass walls as well as skylights and other windowed areas.Ford Motor's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, which will function as corporate offices as well as a design and product development center.FordHidden designsIn addition to making a more walkable exterior campus, Ford wants employees to use purposefully designed stairs rather than elevators and escalators that are the primary modes of transportation in its most-recent 12-story headquarters.Craig Dykers, founding partner of Norwegian architectural firm Snøhetta that worked on the building, said each staircase in the building, especially in its 14 different arrival areas, are prominent and meant to be inviting to use.\"Obviously people don't naturally want to climb a stair, so you have to design it very carefully so that people feel good about using the stair,\" he said. \"Part of the trick is that as you go up one flight, you don't necessarily see the next flight, so it's kind of a journey.\"Stairs inside the main lobby of the building are extremely wide and feature seating areas alongside the actual low-rise stairs. There's also a coffee bar on a large landing above the main lobby.Ford Bronco parts painted white in the American Road Lobby of the automaker's new world headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.FordThe coffee bar overlooks a white artwork that features vehicle parts — one of many prominent pieces of art Ford purchased or has curated for the new facility. Others are photos or drawings of vehicles, while some are simply non-automotive artistic pieces.Inside the company's design operations are large studios with advanced clay milling machines, a spacious showroom that will operate as a modern design dome and a 64-foot screen showing virtual reviews and testing.What employees will not see much of is the company's logo, the well-known blue oval surrounding the \"Ford\" name. There will be a massive Ford blue oval logo on the outside of the building but not on its interior. Unless you look closely.On some exterior glass walls, such as the company's design operations, there's a glass pattern that features the ovals accompanied by hidden numbers that represent Ford patents.Ford's signature blue oval design can be seen in glass on the outside of its new world headquarters, in addition to numbers representing patents held by the company.FordFord declined to discuss the capital spent to build its new headquarters and design center, which was part of a previously announced $1 billion campus transformation that began under former CEO Jim Hackett, who previously led furniture company Steelcase.Here's a look inside the new world headquarters:Workers prepare to raise a large Ford Motor blue oval onto the company's new headquarters on Nov. 10, 2025 in Dearborn, Michigan.

    "body": "2025 Jeep Cherokee SUVStellantisAUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Jeep is betting Americans still love a good comeback story.It's a mantra that's reverberating through the quintessential SUV brand — from its CEO to a marketing campaign with LL Cool J — following yearslong sales and market share declines that have taken a toll on Jeep and its parent company, Stellantis.\"This isn't just a comeback. This is the Jeep brand reclaiming a segment we invented and defined,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf said during a recent media event.Jeep has been in a rut this decade, despite the brand's well-known off-road capabilities that have carried it for most of the past century. It has experienced six consecutive years of U.S. sales declines amid a leadership carousel, dearth of new products and a failed premium pricing strategy to boost profits.But now, the coveted SUV brand has realigned pricing across its lineup, scored its best quarterly sales gain in more than two years and is in the midst of its largest mainstream product blitz this decade.\"We're going to grow, grow and grow,\" Broderdorf told CNBC sitting in a redesigned 2026 Jeep Grand Wagoneer at the company's design dome in suburban Detroit. \"That's the mission. And do it in a healthy way.\"Then-head of Jeep North America Bob Broderdorf speaks during the Stellantis press conference at the AutoMobility LA 2024 auto show at the Los Angeles Convention Center on November 21, 2024.Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesThe redesigned Grand Wagoneer is symbolic of the brand's troubles and comeback attempt. It was Jeep's foray into luxury — topping $111,000 fully loaded in 2021 — that was relatively overpriced and overcomplicated compared with its peers and experienced several production and quality issues.The redesigned model lineup is less expensive, simpler and better positioned against other large American SUVs rather than foreign competitors such as Land Rover. Its production issues also have eased.\"We confused our buyers. We confused our dealers,\" Broderdorf said at the media event. \"I'm here to tell you we got the message. We're fixing it.\"But some things take longer than others to fix in the automotive world. The brand's sales remain significantly lower than expectations, and Jeep's overall quality problems remain a work in progress after the realignment of its vehicles and pricing strategy.\"This is one of the areas that needs to improve. We have been improving, but proof is in the pudding,\" Broderdorf told CNBC.Among 32 major automotive brands, Jeep ranked last in Consumer Reports' annual grading last year that includes a combination of road-test scores, safety ratings and predicted reliability and owner satisfaction data.Most recently, the brand announced a recall of more than 320,000 plug-in hybrid Wrangler and Jeep Grand Cherokee models due to a risk of fire. The company filed a recall late last month with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but no remedy has been released.The company said a solution involving a software update to the high-voltage battery pack control module of the vehicles to improve diagnostic capability for early detection of internal battery damage is expected in December.Jeep ReconThe recall comes at an inopportune time, as Jeep launches a Wrangler-inspired, all-electric SUV called the Recon. The vehicle will be revealed this week ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show after first debuting as a concept vehicle in 2021.The Recon was initially hailed as key to the Jeep brand's future, with executives saying it would help the company become a leader in all-electric vehicle sales, including a prior plan for the brand to achieve 50% EV sales in the U.S. by 2030.Electric Jeep Recon SUV.JeepBut expectations have diminished as Stellantis appointed a new CEO and demand for EVs slowed amid regulatory changes, including the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives in September to purchase a plug-in electric vehicle.Broderdorf said the end of federal incentives are expected to impact sales across the industry, including with the Recon, but the new SUV functions as an EV \"bookend\" alongside the sportier Wagoneer S for the Jeep brand's electric portfolio.\"I'm not going to just chase volume just to chase volume,\" he said during a recent media call. \"I want to sell cars in the right way. Everybody who wants a [battery-electric vehicle], Recon, I want to make sure that we're there for them. After that, it doesn't really matter to me.\"The Recon is being produced at Stellantis' Toluca Assembly Plant in Mexico alongside the Wagoneer S, Jeep Compass and the new Jeep Cherokee, which is being offered exclusively as a hybrid vehicle.Broderdorf, who started leading the brand in February, said the plant can easily adjust to produce the higher-volume Compass and Cherokee depending on demand for EVs. Both gas-powered vehicles also are expected to be produced in the U.S. in the coming years for additional flexibility.Several automakers reported major declines in their EV sales in October following the end of the federal incentives as well as the Trump administration eliminating fuel economy and emissions fines, which EVs helped offset.Electric Jeep Recon SUVJeepJeep has released few details about the Recon other than it will be a \"brother\" to the Wrangler — Jeep's iconic, off-road and open-air SUV. Jeep previously touted a smaller concept version of the vehicle achieving 0-60 miles per hour in roughly 2 seconds.The Recon is the last of four new vehicles Jeep is revealing in four months. It started with the crucial new Cherokee SUV, followed by updated versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer.Prior to the Jeep Wagoneer S last year and upcoming Recon, Jeep was focusing on electrified sales of plug-in hybrid electric versions of its Wrangler and Grand Cherokee rather than all-electric vehicles.American comeback?Part of Jeep's \"comeback\" has included an aggressive push in new marketing and advertising campaigns that have included actor and musician LL Cool J and a raunchy ad campaign featuring comedian Iliza Shlesinger for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer.The campaigns, led since June by Jeep's new vice president of marketing and communications Wendy Orthman, are consistent with Broderdorf's comeback mantra, including featuring LL Cool J's \"Mama Said Knock You Out.\"\"Don't call it a comeback. I been here for years,\" the iconic rapper and actor says in the song featured in the ad campaign, calling Jeep \"the original influencer.\"The marketing and advertising efforts help, but the most important thing for the company remains new products, specifically the Jeep Cherokee that competes in the highly popular compact/midsize SUV markets, industry watchers said.\"They're still trying to fix things, getting the pricing right, getting the product right,\" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. \"But there's a lot of potential, especially with the Cherokee coming back. There's a lot still coming on in the pipeline, and I think it'll position them in a good space.\"The company axed a prior version of the Cherokee as well as a smaller SUV called the Renegade amid profit pressures under former CEO Carlos Tavares in 2023.Jeep's sales through the third quarter of this year were up less than 0.5% compared with a year earlier. Jeep's U.S. market share has fallen from 5.4% in 2019 to 3.7% since 2024, according to Cox Automotive.Jeep's been dealing with a spiraling sales decline that started after the brand reached an all-time high of more than 973,000 SUVs sold in 2018. The brand's sales have fallen 40% since then to less than 590,000 units last year in the U.S.As sales plummeted, Jeep's average transaction prices, or ATPs, were around $54,000 during 2023-24 — well above the industry average of roughly $48,500 or less during that time period, according to Cox Automotive.Jeep's ATPs through the third quarter of this year were less than $49,800, according to Cox. That remains a premium over the average industry of $48,588 but is far lower than prior years.One thing that hasn't been declining this year for Jeep is its inventory levels, according to Cox Automotive. Jeep had the highest days' supply of any major brand other than Ford's Lincoln at 146 days in October. The industry average for days' supply, which calculates the amount of days of inventory dealerships have based on recent sales, was 88 days, Cox reports.\"Looking at mainstream brands, recent inventory trends reveal that some manufacturers may be edging toward overstocked territory as consumer demand shifts,\" Erin Keating, Cox Automotive executive analyst, said in a blog post Thursday, citing Jeep specifically.Jeep's comeback plan started with Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who previously led the brand. It has accelerated, with the Filosa's support, under Broderdorf.\"It's not like '26 is going to be a 1-million-unit year because they're fixing things. Once you kind of get off track, getting back on track can take a little bit of time as well, but it starts with product,\" Brinley said. \"And that's what they have coming in 2026.\"",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during an announcement from the State Dining Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 23, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday exempted key agricultural imports like coffee, cocoa, bananas and certain beef products from his higher tariff rates.The move comes as Trump faces political blowback for high prices at U.S. grocery stores. Some distributors of beef, coffee, chocolate and other common food items have raised prices as Trump's tariffs took hold this year, adding to pressure on household budgets created by decades-high inflation in recent years.Trump's action Friday also exempts a range of fruits including tomatoes, avocados, coconuts, oranges and pineapples. Along with coffee, the tariff reductions extend to black and green tea, and spices like cinnamon and nutmeg.The move marks a reversal for Trump, who has insisted tariffs are necessary to protect U.S. businesses and workers. He has contended U.S. consumers will not ultimately pay for the higher duties.The exemptions come just a day after Trump reached trade framework agreements with four Latin American countries – including 10% tariffs on most goods from Argentina, Guatemala, and El Salvador, and 15% from Ecuador. It also removes duties specifically on products not grown or produced in the U.S. in sufficient quantities, like bananas and coffee.Rising food prices have hampered U.S. households for several years. Consumer Price Index data show food-at-home prices increased approximately 2.7% year-over-year in September. (More recent data was delayed because of the government shutdown).The tariff exemptions aim to help moderate these grocery price increases, although experts caution that other factors such as global supply shortages also influence prices, especially for coffee and beef.Here's more background on how industries like beef, coffee and cocoa have reacted to tariffs and rising prices.BeefA customer shops for meat at a Costco store on Nov. 11, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe tariff exemption for beef comes after months of rising prices tied in part to Trump's own tariff policy.Over the past year, the U.S. imposed steep duties on major suppliers including Brazil, Australia, New Zealand and Uruguay. Brazil – the world's second-largest beef producer – has faced effective tariff rates topping 75%, driving down imports into the U.S. just as the cattle herd in the country hit a near 75-year low.Ranchers have struggled to rebuild herds amid drought, higher feed costs and tariffs on fertilizer, steel and aluminum that have made equipment and repairs more expensive.The supply squeeze has fueled a spike in prices at the grocery store: uncooked beef products rose 12% to 18% year over year in September, according to the most recent consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Producers told CNBC earlier this month that policy whiplash, from changing tariff rates to the recent expansion of Argentina's beef quota, has further chilled long-term investment, keeping supplies tight and sentiment fragile.CoffeeCoffee beans are displayed at a grocery store on Nov. 13, 2025 in San Anselmo, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesGround roast coffee prices in the U.S. reached $8.41 per pound in July, a record high and a 33% increase from the prior year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Trump's 50% tariff on Brazilian coffee –  which supplies roughly a third of U.S. imports – drove up costs across the roasting and retail supply chains. Vietnam, Colombia and other major exporters have also been swept up in the administration's food tariffs.Roasters and cafés say they have no way around the duties because the U.S. produces none of the beans it consumes, leaving importers exposed to higher costs regardless of origin. The September CPI report found that coffee prices climbed nearly 21% in August from the prior year. That was the largest jump since the 1990s.Retailers have warned the impact could have spread if tariffs stayed in place. The Tax Foundation estimated in August that 74% of U.S. food imports faced tariffs, already hitting tea, spices and other products that, like coffee, have no domestic supply chain.Many of those products that have little or no U.S. production were on the list of items Trump exempted from higher tariffs Friday.Global coffee prices are hovering near a 50-year high reached in February.CocoaCocoa has faced similar price pressures.Even after a sharp selloff this fall, futures are still more than double pre-pandemic levels, costing roughly $5,300 today, following tariffs and three years of weather-driven crop failures in the Ivory Coast and Ghana.In October, Hershey executives said they expected $160 million to $170 million in tariff expenses this year, on top of record-high bean costs that pushed retail chocolate prices nearly 30% higher from the prior year heading into Halloween, according to research firm Circana.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang attends a reception for the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, at St James' Palace in London, Brirain, Nov. 5, 2025.  Yui Mok | Via ReutersNvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed in October that his company has $500 billion in orders, in 2025 and 2026 combined, for its chips that are at the heart of the AI boom.For a company that has seen its quarterly revenue grow nearly 600% over the past four years, Huang's statement was a sign that Nvidia is confident of another year of strong — but slowing — growth for its next cycle of chips, implying that the AI boom still has room to run.\"This is how much business is on the books. Half a trillion dollars worth so far,\" Huang said at the company's GTC conference in Washington.Huang included 2025 revenue so far, sales of Nvidia's current Blackwell graphics processing units and next year's Rubin GPUs and also related parts like networking. After parsing through the details of Huang's remarks, analysts concluded that the statement signaled a meaningfully higher year by revenue in 2026 than Wall Street had previously expected.\"NVDA's disclosures suggest clear upside to current consensus estimates,\" wrote Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso in a November note. Caso estimated that Huang's data point suggested data center sales that could be $60 billion over prior calendar 2026 estimates. He has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.But Nvidia stock is trading 5% under where it was when Huang called Nvidia's shot on Oct. 28.It's a reflection of the continued debate among investors about the AI boom, and whether a handful of big cloud companies called hyperscalers and AI labs are overspending on infrastructure.When Nvidia reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, analysts polled by FactSet are expecting $1.25 in earnings per share on $54.83 billion of sales, which would be a 56% increase on a year-over-year basis. They're also looking for guidance in the January quarter of $61.88 billion, which would indicate a re-acceleration of growth.Nvidia doesn't provide more than one quarter of forward-looking guidance at earnings. But anything Huang says about the company's sales backlog and outlook for calendar 2026 will be scrutinized not just for Nvidia's outlook but also that of the broader tech industry. Analysts polled by FactSet currently expect $285 billion in sales for Nvidia in 2026.'Insatiable AI appetite'At the Washington conference, Huang said the company has \"visibility\" into that revenue. That's not surprising — Nvidia counts nearly every multi-trillion dollar tech company as a customer, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta.During October earnings, all of those companies said they were boosting their capital expenditures spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure, which means Nvidia chips.Hyperscalers' rising capex reflects \"insatiable AI appetite,\" wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer in a note earlier this month. He has a buy rating on Nvidia stock.Nvidia has also been an aggressive dealmaker during the quarter, and analysts will want to hear from Huang about the details of these partnerships.The biggest deal was Nvidia agreeing to invest up to $10 billion in OpenAI equity in exchange for the AI startup buying between 4 million and 5 million GPUs over a period of years. Nvidia also agreed to invest $5 billion in former rival Intel. That deal would see the two chipmakers team up to enable Intel chips to work better with Nvidia GPUs.After the October quarter ended, Nvidia took a $1 billion stake in Nokia to team up to integrate its GPUs into cellular network hardware of the Finnish company. Nvidia also continued investing in various startups.Citi analyst Atif Malik said in a November note that the deal with OpenAI, in particular, will be an investor focus on Wednesday.\"Although concerns around the mix of debt and circular financing around AI capex froth exist, we fundamentally see AI supply below demand,\" Malik wrote. He has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.Nvidia has over 90% of the market for AI GPUs. But some of its customers — including Amazon with its Tranium chips, Google with its TPU chips and OpenAI with forthcoming chips made in partnership with Broadcom — have promoted their custom semiconductors, or ASICs, increasingly over the past three months.Huang often speaks generally about Nvidia's views on an earnings call with analysts and could elaborate about how the company sees rising competition, which investors would welcome, according to Citi.All of these projections are without any China sales. The company's Chinese-oriented chip, called the H20, was effectively restricted from being exported earlier this year before Huang made a deal with President Donald Trump in August to get export licenses in exchange for the government getting 15% of China sales.But since then, Nvidia representatives have made gloomy comments about the possibility of significant sales to China, and the company hasn't announced a successor chip to the H20, which is getting old by AI chip standards. Schafer, the Oppenheimer analyst, said he believes China could represent an over $50 billion annual revenue opportunity.When asked by CNBC in late October whether he wants to sell current Blackwell-generation chips to China, Huang said: \"I hope so. But that's a decision for President Trump to make.\"WATCH: It's unlikely that we're in an AI bubble as the market is still behaving rationally: JPM AMwatch now",

Roberto Schmidt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday called on Republicans in Congress to vote to release files related to deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, a sharp reversal from previous resistance within his inner circle.\"House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files, because we have nothing to hide,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social account. \"And it's time to move on from this Democrat Hoax perpetrated by Radical Left Lunatics in order to deflect from the Great Success of the Republican Party, including our recent Victory on the Democrat 'Shutdown',\" he added. The president went on to say that the Department of Justice has already turned over \"tens of thousands of pages\" to the public on Epstein, and that officials were examining \"various Democrat operatives,\" such as former President Bill Clinton and his former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.A Clinton spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, following Trump's late-night Truth Social post.Trump's statement comes as he faces growing pressure regarding his past ties to Epstein, who died by apparent suicide in August 2019 after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.The full House of Representatives is set to vote on a measure — pushed by Republican representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democrat Ro Khanna of California — demanding the release of criminal investigative files about Epstein, which is reportedly set to occur on Tuesday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov.

Nancy Mace, R-S.C., and Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., to force a vote on the measure.Former Trump ally and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has also signed the petition and criticized Trump's reluctance to release more Epstein case materials, leading to a major rift with the president over the weekend.In his latest message on Truth Social, Trump argued that some \"members\" of the Republican Party were being \"used,\" and that the party needed to \"get BACK ON POINT.\"In a separate post late Sunday, Trump singled out Greene, referring to her as a \"Traitor.\" On Saturday, Greene had accused the president of attacking her as part of efforts to \"make an example\" of her and \"scare all the other Republicans\" ahead of the House vote on the Epstein files.Trump has denied having known about Epstein's decades-long sexual abuse of underage girls and young women and has stated the two had a falling out in the early 2000s.However, the House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of emails that showed Epstein and others talking about Trump. Epstein did not explicitly accuse Trump of any wrongdoing or illegal activity in the email files.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins and Dan Mangan contributed to this report.Clarification: This story has been updated to clarify that reports indicate the vote is planned for Tuesday, but has not been officially scheduled.",

    "body": "A Swiss national flag on a ferry on Lake Geneva in Geneva, Switzerland, on Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025. The Swiss president dashed to the US capital Tuesday in a last-minute attempt to prevent her American counterpart from imposing the highest tariff of any developed nation on Switzerland.  Photographer: Andrew Kravchenko/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSwitzerland's fledgling trade deal with the U.S. is dividing opinion as government and business leaders welcome a \"restart\" for the country, while critics caution it amounts to a sellout to the White House.The trade deal, announced on Friday, saw duties on Swiss exports to the States slashed from 39% to 15% and Swiss companies pledge to make $200 billion in investments in the U.S., including promises to increase manufacturing Stateside.Switzerland had launched a charm offensive ahead of the deal, sending a group of top Swiss CEOs — including the heads of luxury goods giants Rolex and Richemont — to the States in early November, bearing gifts for U.S. President Donald Trump, including a gold Rolex watch and specially-engraved gold bar.While Switzerland's lobbying helped it secure its new framework trade agreement with the U.S., the deal drew criticism over the weekend.The Greens, for example, called the deal a \"surrender agreement\" with party leader Lisa Mazzone reportedly saying the \"the Swiss economic elite and the Federal Council are bowing down to Donald Trump\" with Swiss consumers and farmers likely to pay the price.The party also questioned the involvement of business execs, saying the government had bought the deal with \"questionable methods and gifts of gold.\"Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin rejected criticism that the deal amounted to a capitulation to Trump, and also defended the use of business leaders to woo the White House.\"We haven't sold our soul to the devil,\" Parmelin said in an interview with the Tagesanzeiger newspaper this weekend, adding that he was \"satisfied\" with the agreement and suggested it could still be tweaked and improved.\"I would be proud if we were back to zero percent tariffs. It's been a long road, and the result is the best we could achieve. Above all, it gives us a starting point for the next negotiations,\" he told the paper in comments translated by Google.Parmelin said business execs who had travelled to Washington were only there to \"explain their position\" and how tariffs were affecting trade. He conceded, however, that the trip had had a positive impact on talks.\"But it's true: they have influence because they have many good contacts in the U.S. — and not just with the Trump family. Some are friends with him because they play golf with him. I don't play golf, that's perhaps my handicap — but that's life,\" Parmelin said.'Restart,' but a hit anyway?Swiss industry leaders are certainly relieved that a framework agreement has been reached but it will take time to implement. Question marks remain over some of the details, such as whether Switzerland will have to accept U.S. meat imports like chlorinated chicken or hormone-treated beef, which are controversial in Europe, as part of the duty-free bilateral tariff quotas that have been agreed in principle.The framework agreement is non-binding too, with more talks set to take place to finalize details within the deal which will ultimately need the Swiss parliament, and potentially a public vote, to approve it.The U.S. was upbeat about the deal on Friday, with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer telling CNBC that the Swiss' $200 billion investment in the States would boost the domestic economy.watch now\"They're going to send a lot of manufacturing here to the United States — pharmaceuticals, gold smelting, railway equipment — so we're really excited about that deal and what it means for American manufacturing.\"Swiss manufacturers are also relieved about the deal, according to Stefan Brupbacher, chief executive of Swissmem, an association which represents mechanical and electrical engineering industries who, he said, had seen a 15% drop in exports to the U.S. since August, with machine exporters hit even harder.\"For our members, there is great relief, because first of all, coming down from 39 to 15% puts us at par with our main competitors from Europe and Japan, and hence why we suffered enormously over the past three months with a slump of exports to the U.S. between 15% and 40%,\" he told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition.\"watch now\"This 15% tariff rate puts us at par with our main competitors, and that is a basis on which we can restart,\" he said.Flash data released by the Swiss economy ministry on Monday showed the economy shrank by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2025. The contraction, the ministry said, was \"driven by a sharp decline in value added in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector, industry as a whole recorded negative growth.\"Alessandro Bee, economist at UBS, said in analysis Monday that despite the framework deal between the U.S. and Switzerland, UBS' base case scenario was that the Swiss economy would see GDP growth of around 1% in 2026, which, it noted, \"is noticeably below the average growth of 1.9% over the past 15 years.\"\"Growth should be supported by the domestic economy, while we do not expect any significant impetus from foreign trade,\" Bee said, cautioning that despite the reduction in trade duties, \"tariffs on exports to the U.S. remain substantial and are likely to markedly slow export growth to the U.S. compared to the previous year.\"Noting that around half of Swiss exports to the U.S. are made up by the pharmaceutical industry, which was never affected by the 39% tariff, Bee said that any relocation of some pharma manufacturing to the States — which some Swiss pharma companies have flagged — could dent the economy further.\"Nonetheless, Swiss pharmaceutical companies have indicated they are prepared to relocate production for the American market to the U.S., and this newly reached deal is unlikely to change these plans. We expect relocation of pharmaceutical production will weigh on Swiss growth in the medium term.\"",

    "body": "At ThredUp's 600,000-square-foot warehouse in Suwanee, Georgia, roughly 40,000 pieces of used clothing are processed each day. The company's logistics network — four facilities across the U.S. — now rivals that of some fast-fashion giants.\"This is the largest garment-on-hanger system in the world,\" said Justin Pina, ThredUp's senior director of operations. \"We can hold more than 3.5 million items here.\"Secondhand shopping is booming. The global secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, growing almost three times faster than the overall apparel market, according to GlobalData.President Donald Trump's tariffs were billed as a way to bring manufacturing back home. But the measures hit one of America's most import-dependent industries: fashion.About 97 percent of clothing sold in the U.S. is imported, mostly from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh and India, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.For years, Gen Z shoppers have been driving the rise of secondhand fashion, but now more Americans are catching on.\"When tariffs raise those costs, resale platforms suddenly look like the smart buy. This isn't just a fad,\" said Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable. \"Tariffs are accelerating trends that were already reshaping the way Americans shop.\"For James Reinhart, ThredUp's CEO, the company is already seeing it play out.\"The business is free-cash-flow positive and growing double digits,\" said Reinhart. \"We feel really good about the economics, gross margins near 80% and operations built entirely within the U.S.\"ThredUp reported that revenue grew 34% year over year in the third quarter. The company also said it acquired more new customers in the quarter than at any other time in its history, with new buyer growth up 54% from the same period last year.\"If tariffs add 20% to 30% to retail prices, that's a huge advantage for resale,\" said Dylan Carden, research analyst at William Blair & Company. \"Pre-owned items aren't subject to those duties, so demand naturally shifts.\"Inside the ThredUp warehouse, where CNBC got a behind-the-scenes look. automation hums alongside human workers. AI systems photograph, categorize, and price thousands of garments per hour. For Reinhart, the technology is key to scaling resale like retail.\"AI has really accelerated adoption,\" said Reinhart. \"It's helping us improve discovery, styling, and personalization for buyers.\"That tech wave extends beyond ThredUp. Fashion-tech startups Phia, co-founded by Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni, is using AI to scan thousands of listings across retail and resale in seconds.\"The fact that we've driven millions in transaction volume shows how big this need is,\" Gates said. \"People want smarter, cheaper ways to shop.\"ThredUp is betting that domestic infrastructure, automation, and AI will keep it ahead of the curve, and that tariffs meant to revive U.S. manufacturing could end up powering a new kind of American fashion economy.\"The future of fashion will be more sustainable than it is today,\" said Reinhart. \"And secondhand will be at the center of it.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

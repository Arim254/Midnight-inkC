    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "As news spread Saturday of President Donald Trump's removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a split screen emerged in Congress: Republicans largely celebrated the military operation, while Democrats condemned the president's actions and questioned their legality. After months of pressure on Maduro, Trump announced on Truth Social that the U.S. had assisted in a \"large scale strike\" against the country and its leader, who was captured along with his wife, Cilia Flores, and is being brought to the U.S. \"Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,\" Sen.

The War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 in response to the Vietnam War, limits the president's ability to take military action unilaterally and requires the president to consult with Congress when troops are deployed.But lawmakers said the president did not seek approval and did not brief Congress on his plans.Trump is expected to meet with House Republicans on Tuesday at the Kennedy Center, MS NOW reported, citing two sources. Trump will reportedly make an appearance at the gathering and it is unclear how long he will stay, MS Now reported.The lawmakers had already been scheduled to meet at the center for a policy forum to discuss the agenda for the second half of the 119th Congress, according to an invitation obtained by MS NOW. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement, called the decision to take military action in Venezuela without congressional authorization \"reckless.\"\"The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela. Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans,\" Schumer said.Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told MSNOW that he had \"no briefing or heads up. I received all information from the news media at this point.\" And Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee, was among those who cheered the capture of Maduro, but said Congress had not been given any forewarning.\"And that's probably one reason why it didn't leak over these four days,\" Cotton said, in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" on Saturday. \"Congress isn't notified when the FBI is going to arrest a drug trafficker or cyber criminal here in the United States. Nor should Congress be notified when the executive branch is executing arrests on indicted persons.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi on Saturday said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife have been indicted in the Southern District of New York.They have been charged with conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of weapons and destructive devices, and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices against the U.S., according to Bondi's post.Trump seemed to shrug off concerns about the constitutionality of the attack during a call-in to \"Fox & Friends.\"\"The Democrats, maybe they'll take a shot... all they do is complain,\" Trump said. \"They should say, 'great job.' They shouldn't say, 'Oh gee, maybe it's not constitutional.' You know, the same old stuff that we've been hearing for years and years and years.\" The president also said that the attack originally had been planned for earlier in the week but was rescheduled due to weather. No U.S. soldiers were killed in the operation, he said.During a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said members of Congress were called immediately after the mission, which he said was \"largely a law enforcement function.\" Notifying members ahead of the action could have jeopardized the mission, he said.\"This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission... it's just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, 'Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,\" Rubio said. \"Congress has a tendency to leak. This would not be good. If they leaked... I think it would have been maybe a very different result,\" Trump said at the press conference. \"Congress will leak, and we don't want leakers,\" he continued.The Trump administration has ramped up pressure on the Venezuelan government in recent months, alleging that Maduro is the head of a narco-terror organization. He recently ordered a complete blockade on sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country and has been targeting alleged Venezuelan drug boats.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement that he had spoken \"in the last several hours\" with Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and that the White House was working to schedule briefings with members when Congress is back in session next week.\"President Trump is putting American lives first, succeeding where others have failed, and under his leadership the United States will no longer allow criminal regimes to profit from wreaking havoc and destruction on our country,\" Johnson said.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the operation an \"important first step to bring [Maduro] to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States.\" Neither Thune nor Johnson, through their offices, responded to requests for comment on whether Republican leaders had been briefed ahead of the attack.\"I spoke to Secretary Rubio early this morning, and I look forward to receiving further briefings from the administration on this operation as part of its comprehensive counternarcotics strategy when the Senate returns to Washington next week,\" Thune said.As news of the attack on Venezuela broke early Saturday, there was at least some Republican skepticism.\"I look forward to learning what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, posted to X.Hours later, and after a phone call with Rubio, Lee had changed his tune.\"This action likely falls within the president's inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect U.S. personnel from an actual or imminent attack,\" Lee said in a subsequent post.Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., the former Trump ally who had a falling-out with the president and is resigning from Congress on Jan. 5, was part of a small group within the GOP who questioned the attack. \"(W)hy is it ok for America to militarily invade, bomb, and arrest a foreign leader but Russia is evil for invading Ukraine and China is bad for aggression against Taiwan? Is it only ok if we do it? (I'm not endorsing Russia or China),\" Greene posted to X on Saturday.And Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a frequent foil to Trump, questioned the constitutionality of Trump's removal of Maduro.\"If this action were constitutionally sound, the Attorney General wouldn't be tweeting that they've arrested the President of a sovereign country and his wife for possessing guns in violation of a 1934 U.S. firearm law,\" Massie posted to X.Democrats, meanwhile, called for more answers and questioned what might come next for Venezuela, where Maduro has ruled for more than a decade.\"Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, but I have seen no evidence that his presidency poses a threat that would justify military action without Congressional authorization, nor have I heard a strategy for the day after and how we will prevent Venezuela from descending into chaos,\" Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., ranking member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement.\"Secretary Rubio repeatedly denied to Congress that the Administration intended to force regime change in Venezuela. The Administration must immediately brief Congress on its plan to ensure stability in the region,\" Himes continued.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in a statement on Saturday, also said Trump did not properly notify Congress of the military action. He questioned how many American troops would remain on the ground and who would run Venezuela now that Maduro has been deposed.\"Pursuant to the Constitution, the framers gave Congress the sole power to declare war as the branch of government closest to the American people,\" Jeffries said. \"The House and Senate must be briefed immediately and compelling evidence to explain and justify this unauthorized use of military force should be presented forthwith.\"",

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

    "body": "File: President Donald Trump looks on after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on April 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesA company controlled by a Chinese national was ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday to unwind a $2.9 million acquisition of chip assets from a U.S. manufacturer, citing national security concerns.The White House said in an executive order that HieFo Corporation, incorporated in Delaware, was \"controlled by a citizen of the People's Republic of China.\"HieFo acquired the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses of New Jersey-based Emcore on April 30, 2024, which included a semiconductor manufacturing facility, the Treasury Department said in a separate statement.The potential diversion of the supply of indium phosphide chips manufactured by Emcore's digital chips business away from the U.S. was also identified as a national security risk, the Treasury Department added.HieFo and Emcore did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The Global Times, a Chinese government mouthpiece, citing an expert, said the divestment order \"reflects Washington's anxiety over technology competition with China\" as it was made without a convincing rationale.The Treasury Department said the deal was not notified to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, prompting a review by its non-notified transactions team.\"CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from the transaction relating to potential access to EMCORE's intellectual property, proprietary know-how, and expertise,\" the Treasury Department said.HieFo was ordered to divest all acquired assets within 180 days and to immediately restrict access to Emcore's technical information.In a statement dated Sept. 2, 2024, HieFo said the deal would allow operations to continue at Emcore's facility in Alhambra, California, and that it had \"successfully engaged\" nearly all key scientists, engineers and operational staff.HieFo was founded by Genzao Zhang and Harry Moore through a management buyout of wafer fabrication and chip-related assets from Emcore. Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

Rodriguez Carrillo | Afp | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines, Delta Air Lines and other carriers began restoring flights to Puerto Rico and other parts of the Caribbean early Sunday after U.S. aviation authorities lifted temporary airspace restrictions imposed following U.S. strikes on Venezuela.The temporary restrictions were set to expire at midnight Eastern time, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X, clearing the way for airlines to resume most scheduled service on Sunday. \"Airlines are informed, and will update their schedules quickly,\" Duffy said.Thousands of travelers at the end of the New Year holiday period were affected after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered commercial aircraft to avoid parts of the region on Saturday, triggering hundreds of flight cancellations.President Donald Trump said Saturday the strikes resulted in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.United Airlines said it would restart service beginning with flights to San Juan and planned additional departures on Sunday to accommodate disrupted passengers. Delta Air Lines said it was resuming Caribbean service and working to rebook affected customers as schedules normalize.Frontier Airlines also confirmed with CNBC that it has resumed normal operations.Other airlines impacted by the temporary restrictions included American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.Carriers waived change fees and fare differences for customers affected by the closures if they rebooked flights later in the month. More than a dozen airports in the region were included in the waivers.The brief shutdown underscored how quickly military action can disrupt civilian air travel, forcing airlines to suspend operations well beyond the immediate conflict zone.Major U.S. airlines have not served Venezuela directly for years. American Airlines was the last major carrier to halt flights to the country in 2019 amid unrest.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "21 December 2025, Venezuela, Puerto Cabello: View of the El Palito refinery of the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA from the El Faro district.Jesus Vargas | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro in oil-rich Venezuela is unlikely to shock energy markets in the near term, analysts told CNBC on Saturday. While the scale of the U.S. attack was unexpected, markets had already priced in a conflict with Venezuela that would disrupt oil exports, said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at A/S Global Risk Management.Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. But the South American nation currently produces less than a million oil barrels a day, which is less than 1% of global oil production, according to Rasmussen. It exports just about half its production, or some 500,000 barrels, Rasmussen said. The conflict also comes as the global oil market is oversupplied and demand is relatively weak, a pattern that is customary in the first quarter of the year, he said.Rasmussen estimated that Brent crude prices will only rise by about $1 to $2, or even less, when futures trading opens on Sunday night. He projected that Brent will edge lower next week than where it closed on Friday, which was $60.75.\"Despite this being a huge geopolitical event that you would normally expect to be positive or push up oil prices,\" he said, \"the bottom line is there's still too much oil in the market, and that's why oil prices will not go ballistic.\"Analyst Bob McNally of Rapidan Energy said he was advising clients before the weekend that about a third of Venezuela's oil production was at risk. While he does not predict that all of Venezuela's output would be cut off, he told CNBC that it would not pose a meaningful risk to oil markets in the short term. The oil market in 2025 posted its biggest annual decline in five years. The global benchmark Brent fell about 19% last year, while U.S. crude oil lost nearly 20%.The market has been under pressure as OPEC+ ramped up production after years of output cuts. The U.S. also produced at a record level of just over 13.8 million barrels per day.Oil prices may decline further as the regime overthrow raises the possibility of eventually boosting oil production in Venezuela, analysts told CNBC. Saul Kavonic, head of energy research at MST Financial, estimated that exports could approach 3 million barrels in the medium term if a new Venezuelan government led to the lifting of sanctions and the return of foreign investors. \"If anything, the future of Venezuela will have a bearish impact on the market, because there's really nowhere to go but up,\" said energy industry consultant David Goldwyn, a former top State Department energy official in the Obama administration.Currently, the embargo on Venezuelan oil is still in effect, Trump said during a press conference Saturday. He also said that U.S. oil companies will invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. Trump did not provide details on which companies would invest or how, nor did he clarify how the U.S. would temporarily run Venezuela \"with a group.\"Goldwyn said it is hard to predict whether U.S. oil companies will invest, given the uncertainty about the interim and future governments in Venezuela. \"Everything we have learned about government transitions from Iraq, from Afghanistan, from other countries, is that transitions are hard,\" he said. \"No company is going to want to commit to invest billions of dollars for a long-term operation until they know what the terms are. And they can't know what the terms are until you know what the government is going to be.\"Goldwyn added that companies, including Exxon Mobil, are still waiting to collect on debt owed by Venezuela's national oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). Rapidan Energy's McNally said it is a complicated proposition for U.S. oil companies. Oil producers have not forgotten being kicked out of Venezuela in the early 2000s, when the country expropriated the assets of foreign oil companies, he said. That said, accessing the world's largest oil reserves would be \"tantalizing\" to U.S. oil companies if sanctions were lifted, he added.But it would take decades of investment and billions of dollars, McNally said. Whether it's worth it comes down to one central question, he said: Does the world need that much oil?\"Until late last year, the market consensus had been that demand for oil is going to stop growing in four years. It's over because of EVs and fuel efficiency policies and climate change policies,\" McNally said.But as the U.S. and other nations, including China and Canada, weaken their climate policies and sales of electric vehicles fall, the prospect of investing in Venezuela has become much more attractive. \"All of a sudden you're starting to say: \"Whoa, we're going to need more oil,\" he said. — Additional reporting contributed by CNBC's Victor Loh",

    "body": "Wayfair store in Wilmette, Illinois.Courtesy: WayfairStock Chart IconStock chart iconRH and Wayfair, 1-dayTrump on Wednesday issued a yearlong pause on increased levies on upholstered furniture, along with kitchen cabinets and vanities. Instead, the duties on upholstered furniture will remain at 25% — the level Trump set in September.Before Trump's 11th-hour reversal, the levies for this furniture type were slated to rise 30% with the start of 2026. He pointed to ongoing trade discussions as the reason for pushing back tariff increases.Trump called tariffs an \"overwhelming benefit\" to the U.S. and said in a Friday morning social media post that the country losing its ability to place duties on others would be a \"terrible blow.\" His comments come as the White House awaits a decision from the Supreme Court about the legality of many of Trump's new levies.Furniture suppliers have been under Wall Street's scrutiny as Trump's focus on broad and steep levies on imports has raised concerns about rising costs. But stocks in the sector fared vastly differently as investors determined how trade policy changes and other variables would affect each business.Wayfair surged more than 125% in 2025 as value-focused retailers gained traction among consumers. On the other hand, West Elm and Pottery Barn parent Williams-Sonoma slid more than 3% last year. RH — whose chief executive garnered attention in April as he reacted live to the stock tanking — ended the year down more than 50%.\"Oh, sh--,\" RH CEO Gary Friedman said on the California-based company's earnings call in April.\"It got hit when, I think, the tariffs came out,\" Friedman added. \"Everybody can see in our 10-K where we're sourcing from, so it's not a secret, and we're not trying to disguise it by putting everything in an Asia bucket.\"",

    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs.

    "body": "watch nowThe Russian-U.S. national who hacked crypto exchange Bitfinex and stole nearly 120,000 bitcoin said he has been freed from prison early thanks to the bipartisan prison-reform law signed by President Donald Trump.Ilya Lichtenstein, 38, had been sentenced in November 2024 to five years in prison after pleading guilty to a money laundering conspiracy charge and admitting to the hack of crypto assets now valued in the billions of dollars.But late Thursday night, a post on Lichtenstein's official X account declared, \"Thanks to President Trump's First Step Act, I have been released from prison early.\"Courtroom sketch of Ilya \"Dutch\" Lichtenstein while pleading guilty to laundering the stolen bitcoin in federal court in Washington.Artist: William Hennessey\"I remain committed to making a positive impact in cybersecurity as soon as I can,\" Lichtenstein's post said. \"To the supporters, thank you for everything. To the haters, I look forward to proving you wrong.\"A Trump administration official told CNBC on Friday morning that Lichtenstein \"has served significant time on his sentence and is currently on home confinement consistent with statute and Bureau of Prisons policies.\"Attorneys for Lichtenstein did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his release.Lichtenstein's wife, Heather Morgan — who also pleaded guilty to helping launder the stolen funds — shared Lichtenstein's message on her own X account, saying, \"The best New Years present I could get was finally having my husband home after 4 years of being apart.\"Morgan's tweet, posted two minutes after Lichtenstein's, included a photo of the couple smiling for a selfie.Lichtenstein's sentence included credit for time he already served in custody following his arrest in 2022, more than five years after Bitfinex was hacked.As of Friday morning, a search for Lichtenstein's name using the federal government's inmate locator website returned one result showing Lichtenstein is scheduled to be released on Feb. 9.The Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Booking photos for Heather Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein.Courtesy: Alexandria Adult Detention Center.Morgan, 35, a rapper who releases music under the name \"Razzlekhan\" and also went by \"The Crocodile of Wall Street,\" was sentenced to 18 months' incarceration shortly after Lichtenstein received his prison sentence.She entered prison in February. But on Oct. 26, Morgan posted a video of herself saying she had been released early.She also thanked Trump.\"Why hello Razzlers, I have missed you,\" Morgan said in the clip, in which she appears in a bathtub wearing only a hair towel.\"It is very good to be back, and I want to give a shout out to Papa Trump for making my 18-month sentence shorter,\" she said.

The legislation aimed to reduce the size of the federal prison population through a series of reforms, including by establishing a \"a risk and needs assessment system\" that gives some inmates the chance of early release into home confinement.It is unclear whether Trump or the White House had any direct involvement in Lichtenstein or Morgan securing an early prison release. But the announcements from the bitcoin hacker and his wife follow a number of high-profile cybercrime-related pardons and commutations that have been doled out by the crypto friendly president since his return to office.One day after his inauguration, Trump pardoned Ross Ulbricht, founder of the infamous dark web marketplace Silk Road.In October, Trump pardoned Changpeng Zhao, the founder of major crypto exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering on the platform.",

    "body": "It's one of the most important questions surrounding the Federal Reserve in 2026, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pointedly mum.\"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair,\" Powell said at the December press conference. \"I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"The question: whether Powell will remain on the Fed once his chairmanship ends in May. He will have two years left on his term as governor and Powell himself has invited the speculation by repeatedly refusing to answer the question.It's a question being asked on Wall Street as Fed watchers try to game out the makeup of the rate-setting Open Market Committee and whether appointees of President Donald Trump will have control of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. And it's being asked in the Treasury Department and the White House, where they are trying to figure out how many slots on the board Trump will have to fill this year, who might fill them and when those slots will be available.It's a question that has not been asked in decades because prior chairs, like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, slid quietly off the board into other government positions, retirement or the private sector with time remaining on their governor terms. That the question about Powell is even unclear is a sign of the times with a president who, in unprecedented ways, openly seeks control of Fed policy and a Fed chair who has defiantly resisted that encroachment and tried to protect the Fed's independence.Fed observers interviewed by CNBC said they see it as a wrenching decision for Powell that pits the personal against the professional. A golfer, avid guitar player and relatively new grandfather, Powell is thought to be more than ready for civilian life after 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair. For much of those eight years, Powell endured withering public criticism from the president, who named him as chair.But after that lengthy tenure, Powell also holds deep loyalty to the institution and concern about its fate under the challenges posed by a president who has virtually eliminated the independence of multiple government entities. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower rates and made clear that his nominee needs to agree with him or they \"will never be Fed Chairman.\"Most of those interviewed by CNBC, who said they had no personal knowledge of what Powell would decide, said they believe Powell will likely leave the Fed when his term as chair ends in May. None, however, would rule out some possibility that Powell would decide to stay, perhaps for a short time. Only former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles stayed on as a governor when his 14-year tenure as chair ended in 1948. As a governor, Eccles was instrumental in striking the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord that ended the Fed's obligation to keep rates low and helped establish the modern notion of Fed independence. The Trump administration wants to lower rates, in part, to reduce the cost of servicing the U.S. debt.On one level, the decision for Powell is a simple one of math. Three Trump appointees currently sit on the seven-member board of governors. If Powell leaves that would immediately hand the president the majority of the board. If they voted as a bloc — an uncertain assumption — it could go a long way toward delivering the president his call for ultra-low interest rates.Of more concern, the Federal Reserve Act appears to give the board's majority the ability to fire individual bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. There is some doubt about whether the firing could be done without cause, but Powell's continued presence on the board, even if he were in the minority, could help stave off such extreme outcomes.Among those interviewed by CNBC, some suggested the outcome of Fed Gov. Lisa Cook's case could weigh on Powell's decision. Trump fired Cook amid an allegation of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Courts have stayed the firing and allowed Cook to remain in office. The Justice Department has not brought charges against Cook.But the Supreme Court will hear the case on January 21 with a decision sometime after that. If Cook is removed, that would immediately give Trump the majority. The question is whether it comes with broad authority from the Supreme Court for the president to remove other board members. In that case, Powell would likely be next on the president's attack list.Much of the concern, however, assumes a worst-case scenario that might not be warranted. There is no guarantee that governors appointed by the president will do his bidding. For example, all three Trump-appointed governors just voted to reappoint all 12 district bank presidents to new five-year terms, though the board would still have the power to remove them individually.One area of speculation is whether Powell is attempting to exercise leverage over the administration. By not revealing his choice, Powell could be sending a message that he would stay if the president nominates extreme candidates but would go if he deems them reasonable. There is no evidence that Powell is actually thinking that way. Powell has remained generally apolitical on fiscal issues during his tenure and has not responded publicly to the president's frequent insults.All of which leads several Fed observers to believe Powell will ultimately leave when his tenure as chair is up. Staying would be on overtly political move, one that would buck recent institutional tradition and open the Fed to even greater political criticism. Powell would then be undermining the very institution he was trying to preserve by staying.Another theory: Powell's refusal now to say what he will do could be considered a simple, symbolic exercise of independence, reiterating that it's his legal right to decide when he leaves and he will announce his intentions when he's ready.",

(Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP via Getty Images)Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that if Iran \"violently\" intervenes with peaceful protests, then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"Unrest has been growing in Iran since last week, as protests erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices. Annual inflation hit 42.2% in December, with food prices jumping 72%. The protests turned violent this week as local media reported the death of at least six civilians.\"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" he added.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani responded by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region on Friday, in comments reported by Reuters.watch nowSuzanne Maloney, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, previously said that the Iranian people were calling for not just a fix to the economy, but for regime change. She added that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been in power for 36 years.\"We're hearing cries of Death to the dictator. We're hearing slogans that juxtapose the regime's support for militia groups across the region with the real interests and demands of the Iranian people,\" Maloney told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on the country. Last year in June, U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites escalated tensions, pulling Washington into Israel's war with its longtime regional rival.Earlier this week, Trump threatened additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said on Monday.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded on Tuesday in a post on X, saying that the response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any \"oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable.\"  Foreign policy has dominated Trump's schedule in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced sanctions on a group of 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela that are allegedly linked to the weapons trade between the two countries.— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

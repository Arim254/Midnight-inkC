    "body": "The cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people has declined for the third straight year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.The \"classic\" meal — a 16-pound turkey and sides like stuffing, rolls, sweet potatoes, peas, cranberries and pumpkin pie ingredients — costs an average of $55.18 nationwide, new data from AFBF finds. The estimates come from the farm advocacy group's annual price survey, conducted in the first week of November and based on volunteer shoppers in all 50 states checking grocery store prices for the same Thanksgiving staples each year.The biggest cost is the turkey at an average of $21.50. Other items include 30-ounce pumpkin pie mix at an average cost of $4.16, three pounds of sweet potatoes at $4, one gallon of whole milk at $3.73 and 14 ounces of stuffing mix at $3.71, according to the data.Prices also vary by region, with the classic meal averaging a high of $61.75 in the West and a low of $50.01 in the South.The cost of the classic dinner is down 5% from 2024 and well below the record high of $64.05 reached in 2022. But it's still higher than its 2020 level, when the same meal averaged $46.90. However, with inflation factored in, 2025's price is roughly in line with what the 2020 dinner would cost today.Here's a look at the average price for the last 10 years, according to AFBF's annual survey. Figures are not adjusted for inflation.2015: $50.112016: $49.872017: $49.122018: $48.902019: $48.912020: $46.902021: $53.312022: $64.052023: $61.17 2024: $58.08 Retailers may help keep turkey prices downAt an average price of $21.50, turkey makes up nearly half the cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner, according to AFBF data. But even though wholesale turkey prices are up about 75% from last year due to avian flu and higher production costs, shoppers aren't necessarily seeing that increase at the register, according to researchers at Purdue University.That's because grocers often mark down whole frozen turkeys in November, treating the bird as a \"loss leader\" to draw customers into stores for other, higher-margin items, reports industry trade publication Grocery Dive.And those discounts can be steep. Purdue's analysis shows retailers are selling birds well below typical seasonal prices. Walmart, for example, is offering whole turkeys for $0.98 per pound, less than half of Purdue's estimated average retail price for November.Prices for sides are more mixed. Wheat-based items like dinner rolls and stuffing are cheaper, on average, in 2025, while fresh vegetables and sweet potatoes rose sharply due to weather issues and regional supply disruptions, according to AFBF.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Steve Sonnenberg credits his entrepreneurial \"superpower\" with helping him turn a side hustle into a company that's now valued at $1 billion, he says.The key to his success, he says: He's not fazed by the risk of launching a new venture, or by the inevitable setbacks that follow. \"When it comes to entrepreneurship, my superpower is all about just beginning. It's very easy for me to start, because that's just who I am,\" says Sonnenberg, 44, the co-founder and CEO of employee rewards platform Awardco. And when he experiences obstacles with his business, \"I just pivot really fast, because I know it's going to work,\" Sonnenberg says. \"You just have to have that level of confidence.\"Founded in 2011, Awardco was most recently valued at $1 billion following a $165 million funding round in May. Clients like AT&T and Hertz use its platform, which gives employees reward points they can redeem for millions of items on Amazon Business' marketplace.Sonnenberg started working on Awardco after his previous company WholesaleMatch, which he'd started in college, was named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit brought by the Federal Trade Commission. The lawsuit primarily concerned one of WholesaleMatch's clients, and Sonnenberg's assets were frozen during the legal proceedings. He filed for bankruptcy, shuttered his business and \"had nothing left\" to support his family with four young kids, he says.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at workYet he already knew his next step, he says: Start building his next company, even though he didn't have a fully-formed idea for it yet. He put $5,000 he didn't have on a credit card to buy the Awardco.com domain from its previous owner, he says. \"What does any crazy entrepreneur do? You always have another [idea] on deck,\" says Sonnenberg.As he turned to other jobs to make money — first as a freelance web designer, then working for business software company Qualtrics — Sonnenberg built Awardco on the side with his cousin Mike Sonnenberg and Qualtrics colleague Tanner Runia. His idea shifted from a physical store selling trophies to wholesale rewards for corporations before landing on Awardco's current business model, he says.Amazon initially balked at partnering with the then-unknown platform, says Sonneberg. The rejection could've pushed him to give up or move onto a different idea. Instead, Sonnenberg made cold calls to sign corporate clients up anyway, and when employees placed orders on Awardco's platform, his wife manually ordered the corresponding products on Amazon for them, he says.In 2015, Amazon invited Awardco to partner with its Amazon Business marketplace, automating the ordering process, Sonnenberg says.\"Start, [then] pivot, pivot, pivot, pivot: That's the story of Awardco, with my back against the wall,\" says Sonnenberg.Successful entrepreneurs 'don't get in the way of themselves'Building something successful after suffering a major failure typically takes resilience and confidence. \"I just keep going. I don't know what it is, but anything I've ever done, it's been successful, but it's failed [first]. It's the consistency of keeping it on the track,\" Sonnenberg says.Entrepreneurs frequently discuss the importance of simply taking the jump to start a new venture — anticipating that you'll need to weather any initial setbacks, and learn from those failures to increase your chances of future success.\"Entrepreneurship is really hard. There's no instant success ... You just have to be ready to fail,\" Dayu Dara Permata, the co-founder and CEO of Indonesian property transaction platform Pinhome, told CNBC Make It in May. \"Fail fast, learn fast.\"Of course, you shouldn't try to fail simply for the sake of failing, according to Harvard Business School professor of leadership Amy C. Edmondson. Thoroughly research each new opportunity to minimize risk and ensure that any failure is an \"intelligent failure,\" Edmondson recommended in December 2023.Sonnenberg had a leg up on his Awardco research, he says: His father made awards and plaques for large organizations like McDonald's. \"I just knew the space. I knew that this industry is old school [and] ripe for disruption. I was 100% confident that we were going to find success,\" he says.His confidence is partially a result of being \"a bit [of] a naive entrepreneur,\" he adds. \"And I think that's a trait of successful entrepreneurs: They don't get in the way of themselves.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Oil drilling rigs and support equipment stand on the tundra in Deadhorse, Alaska, on Friday, Sept. 5, 2025. Nathaniel Wilder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration unveiled plans Thursday for a huge oil drilling expansion off the coasts of Alaska, California and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior proposed 34 lease sales to drill in those waters through 2031, a big expansion compared to the Biden administration program that allowed just three lease sales and only in the Gulf. The Trump program would include lease sales in 21 areas off Alaska's coast, six off the Pacific coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico. It would mark the first time since 1984 that Interior has allowed a new lease in the Pacific, according to the Congressional Research Service.  Interior's proposal is not a final program. It still must undergo further review. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum accused the Biden administration \"crippling the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production\" by slamming the brakes on oil and gas leasing. More than 100 Democratic lawmakers expressed their opposition to the plan in an Oct. 30 letter addressed to President Donald Trump and Burgum. \"Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines,\" the lawmakers wrote. The Natural Resources Defense Council condemned the Trump plan as egregious and reckless in a post Thursday. \"The proposal would open up untouched waters of Alaska to drilling, attempt to resurrect the offshore oil and gas industry in California, and offer up waters off the coast of Florida that haven't been put up for leasing in decades — in addition to adding even more leasing in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the NRDC said. \"This plan would damage these places, and the people who rely on them, for generations,\" the environmental group said.

    "body": "Customers check out vegetables and other groceries at a supermarket in Tokyo on June 20, 2025.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's core inflation in October rose at its sharpest rate since July, in line with market estimates on Friday, supporting the case for interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan.Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, came in at 3% as expected by economists polled by Reuters. The headline inflation rate rose to 3%, marking the the 43rd month in a row that it has run above the BOJ's 2% target. The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate, which strips out prices of fresh food and energy, crept up to at 3.1%, compared to 3% in September. Rice inflation continued to ease for a fifth month in a row, dipping to 40.2% from 49.2% in the month before. Japan's Nikkei 225 was trading 1.58% lower, while the yen weakened marginally to 157.5 against the dollar.The data comes as BOJ governor Kazuo Ueda reportedly had his first bilateral meeting with newly elected  Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi earlier this week.During the meeting, Ueda told Takaichi the central bank was \"gradually raising interest rates to guide inflation smoothly towards its 2% target and ensure the economy achieves sustainable growth,\" Reuters reported. Takaichi has been an advocate of loose monetary policy, and had said on Nov. 12 to the country's parliament that she hopes that the BOJ \"conducts policy appropriately\" so that the 2% inflation target is achieved by wage gains instead of cost-push factors.\"The type of inflation we're seeing now is not good,\" Takaichi reportedly said. The BOJ governor also said that Takaichi did not make any request related to monetary policy.The central bank is currently caught between a rock and a hard place, with inflation running above target and GDP growth figures weakening as Japan takes a hit from U.S. tariffs.Japan's GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4% sequentially, and dipping 1.8% on an annualized basis.",

    "body": "Sale signs inside the Bath and Body Works store in Edmonton. On Thursday, January 6, 2022, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Artur Widak | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works Inc. stock plunged Thursday after the company reported \"disappointing\" third-quarter earnings and slashed its full-year outlook, citing \"macro consumer pressures.\"Shares sank nearly 25% on Thursday and hit a new 52-week low. The stock has plunged more than 50% this year.CEO Daniel Heaf announced a turnaround plan for the company, with expectations of $250 million in cost savings by 2027, aimed at attracting younger consumers and recentering the company's focus to its core products.\"Our third quarter results were below expectations, and we are lowering our outlook for the remainder of the year reflecting current business trends and continuation of recent macro consumer pressures,\" Heaf said in a statement. \"While this is disappointing, we are acting swiftly and decisively to position the business for sustainable, long-term growth.\"Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 35 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents expectedRevenue: $1.59 billion vs. $1.63 billion expectedBath & Body reported net income of $77 million, or 37 cents per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 1 compared with $106 million, or 49 cents a share, last year. Adjusting for one-time items including pretax gains, the company reported earnings of 35 cents a share.The company also slashed its yearly guidance due to \"current business trends.\" It also expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down in the high single digits compared with Wall Street estimates of an increase of 1.5%. The guidance, pulling on \"recent negative macro consumer sentiment\" and tariff impacts, also revised net sales guidance for the full year to low single digits.Heaf said the company is reorienting its strategy to focus once again on core products like body care, fragrances and soaps. The plan, called the \"Consumer First Formula,\" includes four strategic priorities: creating disruptive and innovative products, reigniting the brand, winning in the marketplace and operating with speed and efficiency.The company had previously toyed with introducing other products like laundry detergent and shampoo, but Heaf said on a call with analysts Thursday that its efforts have not delivered promising results or attracted younger consumers.Heaf said the company will be exiting certain categories like haircare and men's grooming as it refocuses its priorities.\"Over the years, consumers have evolved. They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, emotive storytelling and elevated multi-channel experiences,\" Heaf said. \"Our competitors have risen to meet those needs. We have not.\"Heaf said on the call that the company is also recruiting influencers to \"ignite social buzz\" around the company's products in an attempt to garner attention from new consumers. Bath & Body Works also plans to revamp its app and website to increase engagement and aid in product discovery. The company will also lower its free shipping threshold in early 2026.",

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOdds of a December rate cut remained low following the release of delayed jobs data. Markets were last pricing about a 35% chance of a quarter-point cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.The target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.   Those expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. However, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it's been since October 2021. \"All those numbers suggest an economy that's still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other,\" Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don't think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other.\" To be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight. \"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate,\" wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Weak hard data and close-to-target inflation look set to drive policy going forward, despite recent hawkish noises.\" \"The setup is in place for Powell to continue his risk-management approach to the labor market before his term as Chair expires in May,\" Haigh continued.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on artificial intelligence at the \"Winning the AI Race\" Summit in Washington D.C., U.S., July 23, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersAn executive order that could soon be signed by President Donald Trump would thwart states' artificial intelligence laws by launching legal challenges and withholding federal funding, according to a draft of the order obtained by CNBC on Wednesday.The draft surfaced shortly after Trump publicly called for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"The draft order would give Attorney General Pam Bondi 30 days to establish an \"AI Litigation Task Force\" whose sole task is to challenge state AI laws.Those challenges would be issued \"on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General's judgment,\" the draft says.The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to notify states with contested AI laws that they are ineligible for funds under the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. BEAD is a more than $42 billion program that has allocated funding to all U.S. states and territories.The order, which was first reported by The Information, is not yet finalized. A White House official told CNBC that any discussion around it is just speculation until it is officially announced.As written, the EO would be a major win for the burgeoning AI industry, whose leaders — including Sam Altman's OpenAI, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and other Silicon Valley titans — oppose an inconsistent state-by-state policy approach.It would be just as big a blow to state lawmakers across the country who have sought to pass bills that would place guardrails on the nascent technology.New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, who co-sponsored a state AI safety bill, in a statement to CNBC called the draft EO \"a blank check to Donald Trump's tech billionaire backers who've already made a fortune on — and now stand to profit exponentially more from — allowing unconstrained AI to wipe out jobs, destroy our kids' brains, and drive electricity bills through the roof.\"Bores, a Democrat who is running for Congress, this week became the first target of a well-funded super PAC backed by AI industry leaders.GOP mulls AI moratorium The White House is also working with a group of Republican lawmakers to see if a moratorium on certain state AI laws could be included in one of the major must-pass bills that Congress is working on. That language is still being drafted, but it would likely block states' abilities to regulate on issues like how AI is developed, according to four sources familiar with the discussions. States would likely still be able to craft policy on other AI-related matters such as fraud, consumer protections and images depicting the sexual abuse of children, the sources said.A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill,\" but cut out before Trump signed it in July.The current draft proposal could have no expiration date, including to one source familiar with the discussions. \"You're seeing China move very aggressively,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"AI is the wave of the future, but we want America to be dominant in it and we want our policies to reflect that.\"There is bipartisan support for new federal AI policy — even from those supporting state-level action.\"Let's be clear: we need a federal solution. But we need one that's crafted by experts and doesn't sell you out to the highest bidder. Until then, states must act,\" Bores said in an X post Thursday.But there is also bipartisan opposition to boxing out the states.\"There should not be a moratorium on states rights for AI,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., wrote on X. \"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state.\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also shot down the idea of a state-level AI moratorium. \"That provision doesn't appear to have a lot of support amongst Democrats and Republicans in the Congress,\" he told CNBC in a brief hallway interview. \"So I don't know why Donald Trump is bringing it back up at this time.\"Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday morning that he is open to a single national pre-emption.  but it would be a mistake to block states for acting until one is ready. \"If we take away the pressure from the states, Congress will never act,\" Warner said. \"Let's look at the fact we never did anything on social media. If we make that same response on AI and don't put guardrails, I think we'll come [to] rue it.\"— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "watch nowImprovement in mortgage rates at the end of the summer boosted home sales, but that gain may be short-lived.Sales of previously owned homes in October rose 1.2% from September to 4.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were up 1.7% year over year. This count is based on home closings, so contracts likely signed in August and September. While contract signings would not be impacted by the government shutdown that started in October, closings, especially those requiring flood insurance or government-backed rural home loans, could be.During that contract-signing period, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage came down for a bit but then moved up again. The popular 30-year rate started August at 6.63%, fell steadily to 6.13% by mid-September, and then came back up to 6.37% by the end of the month, according to Mortgage News Daily. It now stands at 6.36%.The inventory of homes for sale has also come down. After gaining for much of this year, supply fell to 1.52 million units, down 0.7% from September, although still nearly 11% higher than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.4-month supply, still considered lean.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.And that's why prices are still gaining. The median price of a home sold in October was $415,200, an increase of 2.1% from October 2024 and the 28th consecutive month of annual gains. \"Looking ahead, home shoppers in today's market face some advantages from falling mortgage rates and seasonally slower competition,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"At the same time, a lack of housing affordability continues to be a challenge keeping home sales in their historically low level.\"Homes are staying on the market longer, at an average of 34 days last month compared with 29 days last October. First-time buyers made a comeback in the market, representing 32% of sales, up from 27% a year ago — but not all regions are equal. \"First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.\"Sales growth continues to be strongest on the high end of the market. Homes priced above $1 million saw sales up more than 16% from a year ago, and those priced between $750,000 and $1 million saw a gain of 10%. Meanwhile sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 were up just about 1%, and homes priced below $100,000 saw a drop in sales of nearly 3%. ",

    "body": "watch nowNvidia on Wednesday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that beat expectations, and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter.Wall Street welcomed the report, and Nvidia stock rose after the release and during the conference call. Other stocks in the so-called artificial intelligence trade also saw a boost.A closer look at Nvidia's report shows that the company continues to dominate the market for AI chips called graphics processing units, or GPUs. CEO Jensen Huang also sounded confident in the company's products and bullish on the company's outlook during a call with analysts. Nvidia said it expects about $65 billion in sales in the current quarter, which ends in late January. That would represent 65% growth on an annual basis. Here are three key takeaways from Nvidia's earnings:Nvidia rejects bubble talkOn Wednesday's earnings call with analysts, Huang began his comments by rejecting the premise of an \"AI bubble\" held by some investors who are concerned about the billions of dollars being spent on Nvidia chips and potential return on investment. \"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Huang said. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"Huang said there were three different kinds of uses for AI that are currently growing and that all three are contributing to the boom in infrastructure investments.He said that non-AI software, like software for data processing, was increasingly being run on the company's GPUs; that AI will create new kinds of apps; and that \"agentic AI,\" which doesn't need user input, will require additional computing power. Huang said that people will soon start appreciating what's happening underneath the surface of the AI boom, versus \"the simplistic view of what's happening to capex and investment.\"Bernstein analysts said in a note that Huang's comments helped settle investor fears of a bubble after a recent pullback in AI names, saying \"perhaps the AI trade is not yet dead after all.\"\"More than just good numbers, we believe investors needed some hand-holding from Jensen which he provided in spades,\" the analysts wrote.'Half a trillion' forecast is on trackLast month, Huang said at a conference in Washington, D.C., that his company had orders for $500 billion in AI chips in 2025 and 2026.On Wednesday, Nvidia said that the forecast was still on track. Any long-term outlook from Nvidia is important to the technology industry because Nvidia counts many of the most powerful technology customers as customers. Nvidia said on Wednesday that its order backlog didn't even include a few recent announcements, like the company's deal with Anthropic or the expansion of a deal with Saudi Arabia this week. \"The number will grow,\" CFO Colette Kress said on the call, saying the company was on track to hit the forecast. \"We'll probably be taking more orders.\"\"We see the opportunity to grow for quite some time,\" Huang said. Several analyst notes on Thursday called attention to the $500 billion forecast and the addition of the recently announced deals.Jefferies said Nvidia \"answered the bell\" in its earnings report and said the numbers should help steady the AI trade into the end of the year.\"We don't expect every AI bear to be satisfied, but these results and added context from management around demand outlook should offer some near-term reprieve,\" the analysts wrote.'Insignificant' China ordersNvidia fought over the summer to gain licenses to export its H20 chip — a slowed-down version of 2022 technology — to China. Some analysts projected the China business could be worth $50 billion per year to Nvidia. The company eventually got the licenses this summer after Huang personally met with President Donald Trump and struck a deal to give the U.S. government 15% of China sales. But it turns out that H20 chip sales during the quarter were \"insignificant.\" Kress told analysts that the company recorded $50 million in H20 sales during the period. \"Sizable purchase orders never materialized in the quarter due to geopolitical issues and the increasingly competitive market in China,\" Kress said. Nvidia has argued that the U.S. government should allow exports of the most advanced chips because it's better for national security if Chinese developers get used to Nvidia technology, rather than being forced to use Chinese chips and make them better.The H20 is old technology, but Nvidia wants to gain approval to send a version of its current-generation Blackwell chip to China. \"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the U.S. and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said.Analysts at Melius said Thursday that the lack of China sales made the numbers \"all the more extraordinary\" and projected Nvidia would generate nearly $400 billion in free cash flow over the next nine quarters.\"Currently Nvidia isn't delivering to China and we are not counting on this situation to get straightened out,\" the firm said.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia earnings takeaways: Bubble talk, 'half a trillion' forecast and China ordersNvidia says there's 'no assurance' of final agreement with OpenAI despite $100 billion pactMeta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to create his own startupBlock's stock pops 9% on gross profit forecast, 3-year financial outlook— CNBC's Samantha Subin contributed to this story.",

    "body": "Four men have been indicted on federal criminal charges related to a plot to export Nvidia chips worth millions of dollars to China and Hong Kong in violation of tight U.S. restrictions, court documents show.The chips are highly restricted from exports because of their use in artificial intelligence and supercomputing applications, according to the indictment unsealed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Tampa, Florida.One of the defendants, Brian Curtis Raymond, a 46-year-old resident of Huntsville, Alabama, was identified last week as the chief technology officer of an artificial intelligence cloud company in Virginia that announced plans for a merger that would allow its stock to be publicly traded. That company is not implicated in the case, and told CNBC that his job offer has been rescinded.Raymond and the other three defendants, all of whom were born in China or Hong Kong, are charged with conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 in connection with the export and attempted export of the Nvidia chips to end users in China and Hong Kong, after first shipping the chips to Malaysia and Thailand. The defendants had not obtained a license or authorization for such exports from the Commerce Department, according to the indictment.The indictment was first reported by CourtWatch, the court document aggregation news site founded by counterrorism researcher Seamus Hughes.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida, which is prosecuting the case, said that 400 Nvidia A100 chips were exported to China as part of the scheme from October 2024 and January in two separate shipments. \"The third and fourth exports to [China] were disrupted by law enforcement and therefore not completed,\" the office said. \"These attempted exports related to ten Hewlett Packard Enterprises supercomputers containing NVIDIA H100 GPUs and 50 separate NVIDIA H200 GPUs.\"The indictment notes that China \"is rapidly developing exascale supercomputing capabilities and has announced its intent to be the world leader in AI by 2030.\"\"These capabilities are being used by the PRC [People's Republic of China] for its military modernization efforts and in connection with the PRC's weapons design and testing, including for weapons or mass destruction,\" the indictment says.Raymond owned a technology products distributor company in Huntsville, which was \"licensed to sell Nvidia GPUs [graphics processing units], among other products,\" the indictment says. Raymond's LinkedIn page says his company, Bitworks, is or was a \"Nvidia Cloud Partner delivering H100, H200, and coming Blackwell / NVL72 clusters for customers.\"Raymond and another co-defendant in the case, Mathew Ho, would \"cause freight forwarded to chip Nvidia GPUs to third countries, knowing that the GPUs were ultimately destined for and would be transhipped to the\" People's Republic of China,  the indictment alleges. Ho, a 34-year-old who was born in Hong Kong, is a U.S. citizen who lives in Florida. He is also known as Hon Ning Ho.Ho was the registered agent of a company in Tampa called Janford Realtor, which, despite its name, was never involved in any real estate transactions, but instead \"served as an intermediary for several unlawful and unlicensed exports to\" China of the advanced and highly-controlled chips, the indictment says.As part of the alleged conspiracy, Ho and Raymond would submit documents related to the shipments that contained false information about the ultimate cosignors for the chips, the value of the chips and the licenses required for their export, the indictment says.Raymond was arrested on Wednesday and later appeared in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. His wife declined to comment.Raymond's lawyer, Tae Lee, declined to comment on the charges.On Nov. 10, three days before the indictment was filed in Tampa, Raymond was identified in a press release issued by Corvex, an Arlington, Virginia-based AI cloud company, as its chief technology officer.The press release said Corvex and Movano Health, a publicly traded company that sells medical wearables, had agreed to a merger that would enable Corvex to become publicly traded. A Corvex spokesperson, in a statement to CNBC after being asked about Raymond, said, \"Corvex had no part in the activities cited in the Department of Justice's indictment.\"\"The person in question is not an employee of Corvex. Previously a consultant to the company, he was transitioning into an employee role but that offer has been rescinded,\" the spokesperson saidIn addition to the top count of conspiracy, Raymond is charged with two counts of violations of the Export Control Reform Act in connection with an attempt to export 50 Nvidia H200 GPUs to China through Thailand earlier this year, and the attempted export of about 10 HP supercomputers containing Nvidia H100 GPUs to China through Thailand earlier this year.

    "body": "Shoppers walk past a GAP fashion retail store on Oxford Street on October 30, 2025 in  London, United Kingdom.  John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesApparel retailer Gap said Thursday its comparable sales rose 5% during the fiscal third quarter, driven by strong revenue at its namesake brand after its viral \"Better in Denim\" campaign with girl group Katseye. Putting aside pandemic-related spikes, the rise in comparable sales is the strongest growth for Gap since its fiscal 2017 holiday quarter and is well ahead of Wall Street expectations of 3.1%, according to StreetAccount. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Richard Dickson said the company hasn't needed to discount as often to sell products, it's winning customers from all income cohorts and it's seeing a \"great start\" to the holiday shopping season. \"While external data points to macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are finding our price value, [and] our styles are breaking through the competitive landscape,\" said Dickson. \"Our product is resonating. So we're very confident as we head into the holiday season.\" Shares of Gap rose 5% in extended trading Thursday. Here's how the largest specialty apparel company in the U.S. performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $3.94 billion vs. $3.91 billion expectedThe company's net income during the three months ended Nov. 1 declined nearly 14% to $236 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with $274 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.94 billion, up 3% from $3.83 billion a year earlier. For Gap's fiscal year, which is slated to end around early February, the company is now guiding to the high end of its previously released sales forecast, expecting sales to rise between 1.7% and 2%, in line with analyst expectations. It previously expected sales to rise between 1% and 2%.The company is now expecting its full-year operating margin to be around 7.2%, compared to its previous range of between 6.7% and 7%. The forecast includes the impact of tariffs, estimated to be between 1 and 1.1 percentage points. Comparable sales across Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic, have been positive now for seven straight quarters. Under Dickson, the company has been as focused on boosting profitability and fixing operations as it has been on reigniting cultural relevance, which has led to sustained sales growth across the portfolio. Gap's profitability had been growing, too, as a result, but now that it's facing tariffs, the retailer's gross margin and net income are both taking a hit. During the quarter, Gap's gross margin fell 0.3 percentage points to 42.4% but still came in higher than expectations of 41.2%, according to StreetAccount. The 14% decline in Gap's net income was primarily related to tariffs, finance chief Katrina O'Connell said in an interview. Gap's better-than-expected results come as apparel sales remain generally soft across the industry and consumers pull back on nice-to-have items like new clothes in favor of necessities. Aside from clear value players like Walmart and TJX Companies, earnings so far this season have been muted, with some companies blaming macroeconomic conditions and expressing caution about the holiday season. Dickson said Gap's varied portfolio gives it a hedge in uncertain economic times because it can capture shoppers in a variety of different places. \"Our portfolio appeals to a wide range of consumers, which is giving us great flexibility in today's environment,\" said Dickson. Here's a closer look at how each of the company's brands performed: Gap Gap's namesake brand has been the focus of Dickson's turnaround strategy since he took the helm as CEO just over two years ago. During the quarter, comparable sales rose a staggering 7% – more than double the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Revenue rose 6% to $951 million. During the quarter, Gap released its viral \"Milkshake\" campaign, featuring the early-aughts Kelis song and members of the Katseye pop group. The campaign helped sales, but Dickson said Gap brand's growth is \"a story about consistency\" and a mix of better product, marketing and partnerships. Old Navy Sales at Old Navy, Gap's largest brand by revenue, rose 5% to $2.3 billion with comparable sales up 6%, far better than the 3.8% that analysts surveyed by StreetAccount expected. The company said it saw growth in key categories like denim, activewear, kids and baby. Banana Republic The elevated, work-friendly brand is still in turnaround mode but saw sales grow 1% to $464 million during the quarter with comparable sales up 4%, better than the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. This was the second quarter in a row Banana reported positive comparable sales, which the company attributed to better marketing and product. Athleta Both revenue and comparable sales at Athleta were down a whopping 11% to $257 million, an eyesore on Gap's otherwise better-than-expected results. Dickson has repeatedly said Athleta is in a reset year, but how long that reset will take remains unclear. \"We have been disappointed in the trend. We understand there's a lot of work to do, but I really do believe in the brand,\" said Dickson. \"I believe in the leadership and we will continue to build this brand for the long term. It does deserve it.\"",

    "body": "watch nowCleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack on Thursday gave indications that she thinks the central bank could be nearing the end of what could be a brief rate-cutting cycle.The policymaker told CNBC that she thinks the current level of interest rates is \"barely restrictive, if at all\" when it comes to the economic impact. Restrictiveness is a key metric for Fed officials, who are divided ideologically over whether labor market weakness or inflation is a bigger threat. Hammack has been more in the hawkish camp when it comes to inflation, preferring higher rates and more restrictive policy as a bulwark against another surge in prices.\"I think that we need to maintain a modestly, somewhat restrictive stance of policy to make sure that we are continuing to bring inflation back down to our 2% objective,\" she told CNBC's Steve Liesman on \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"Right now, to me, monetary policy is barely restrictive, if at all, and I think we need to make sure that we're maintaining that somewhat restrictive stance to bring monetary to bring in place.\"Hammack added that she thinks the current federal funds rate, targeted in a range between 3.75%-4%, is \"right around a neutral rate,\" indicating it does not need to come down much further.Hammack will be a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee next year. The Fed next meets Dec. 9-10, and market expectations have swung from a near-certainty that the committee would approve a third consecutive quarter percentage point reduction to now pricing in about a 60% probability that the committee will stand pat, per the CME Group's FedWatch tracker of futures prices. Minutes from the October meeting, released Wednesday, detailed the sharp divide among committee members.While focused on inflation, Hammack expressed concern over current price levels, noting that interviews she and her staff have conducted around the Cleveland area indicate labor market pressures as well as inflation concerns that are causing difficulty for households to make ends meet.\"What we hear from the workers is that they're holding on to their jobs for dear life, if they have them,\" she said. \"We are in this slow,  this low-hiring, low-firing environment. But what I also heard ... was that the money that they have coming in is just not stretching as far as it used to. What used to cost $30 now costs $50, and so ... that inflationary pressure is still very salient for them.\"Addressing the September nonfarm payrolls report released Thursday, Hammack called the picture \"mixed\" as it showed both higher-than-expected payrolls growth and a tick up in the unemployment rate. Correction: Cleveland Federal Reserve President Beth Hammack will be a member of the FOMC next year. An earlier version of this story misstated when she would serve on the rate-setting committee. The story also misstated a number. Hammack had said, \"What used to cost $30 now costs $50...\" watch now",

    "body": "An electric air taxi by Joby Aviation flies near the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 12, 2023.Roselle Chen | ReutersAir taxi maker Joby Aviation in a new lawsuit accused competitor Archer Aviation of using stolen information by a former employee to \"one-up\" a partnership deal with a real estate developer.\"This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,\" Joby said in the lawsuit filed Wednesday in a  California Superior Court in Santa Cruz, where the company is based.The lawsuit alleges that Joby's then-U.S. state and local policy lead, George Kivork, downloaded dozens of files and sent some content to his personal email two days before he resigned in July to take a job at Archer, which had recruited him. By August, Joby said a partner that worked with Kivork said it had been approached by Archer with a \"more lucrative deal.\" Joby alleges that the eVTOL rival's understanding of \"highly confidential\" details helped it leverage negotiations. Joby also said the developer attempted to terminate the agreement, citing a breach of confidentiality.Archer called the suit \"baseless litigation\" meant to slow its leading competitor in a statement to CNBC.\"Joby's case is entirely without merit,\" said Eric Lentell, Archer's chief legal & strategy officer. \"The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation.\"Archer said it has rigorous employee onboarding procedures that are meant to prevent the kinds of actions Joby has accused it of.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia earnings takeaways: Bubble talk, 'half a trillion' forecast and China ordersNvidia says there's 'no assurance' of final agreement with OpenAI despite $100 billion pactMeta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to create his own startupBlock's stock pops 9% on gross profit forecast, 3-year financial outlookA hearing is scheduled for March 20, 2026. Joby said Kivork refused to return the files when approached by the company after an investigation, according to the suit. The company also said Archer denied wrongdoing, and would not disclose how it learned about the terms of the agreement or provide results from an internal investigation it allegedly undertook.Prior to joining Joby, Kivork worked as senior public policy manager at Lyft. He also served as an attorney within the U.S. Commerce Department's Office of the General Counsel. In that role, Kivork worked on rules to \"protect U.S. manufacturers and exporters against unfair trade practices,\" according to his LinkedIn.The lawsuit comes during a busy period for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology as companies race to gain Federal Aviation Administration certification to start flying commercially. 'The sector has also benefitted from President Donald Trump's newly minted eVTOL pilot program.Joby argued in the complaint that it's \"imperative\" to protect Joby's work \"from this type of espionage\" to promote the sector's success and ensure fair competition.Last week, Joby said it completed its first test flight for a hybrid aircraft it's working on with defense contractor L3Harris. This month, Amazon-backed Beta Technologies, another electric flight company, also went public on the New York Stock Exchange.Joby shares have more than doubled over the last year, while Archer is up about 36%.In August 2023, Archer settled a previous legal dispute with Boeing-owned Wisk Aero over the alleged theft of trade secrets. As part of the deal, Archer agreed to use Wisk as its autonomous tech partner.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJoby and Archer year-to-date stock chart.",

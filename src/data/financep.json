    "body": "A decade ago, I boarded a one-way flight from Houston to Madrid with a suitcase and a rough plan to teach English for a year. I was 35, and I knew I needed a change.As the daughter of Colombian and Iranian immigrants growing up in Texas, I never quite felt like I belonged anywhere. That changed when I moved to Spain in 2015. I've built a life here centered around community, freedom, and balance.Along the way, I figured out the logistics, visas, and mindset shifts it takes to start over abroad. Now, through my platform She Hit Refresh, I help other women over 30 figure out their own moves.I still visit the U.S. often, and there's plenty I love about coming back, including family, friends, and my annual TJ Maxx run. But after 10 years in Europe, there are quite a few things I don't miss about life in America.1. Just 10 days of PTOWhen I first moved to Spain, I couldn't believe how normal it was for people to actually use their vacation days. Here, full-time employees are legally entitled to 22 working days of paid leave, plus 14 national holidays. And no one feels guilty about taking them! Offices slow down in August, families head to the beach, and it's completely accepted that you'll be out for a few weeks to rest and reset.Back in the U.S., I used to hoard my 10 precious PTO days like gold. Asking for time off felt like letting my coworkers down. I'd sometimes end up leaving days unused or checking emails during vacation.The lack of freedom wore me down. I became a chronic job hopper in my 20s, quitting every nine months or so just to travel for the summer. It wasn't sustainable, but it was the only way I could see the world.2. Car dependencyWhen I lived in Texas, I couldn't survive without my car. Grocery store? Drive. Gym? Drive. Life revolved around traffic, parking, and gas prices. I didn't realize how exhausting it all was until I left.Madrid, where I first lived, and Málaga, where I am now, are incredibly walkable. Most of what I need is within a 20-minute stroll, including markets, cafes, and my coworking space. When I can't walk, I take the bus or metro, which are clean, reliable, and inexpensive. For longer trips, the high-speed trains make it so easy to explore the rest of the country, even if you're on a budget.Cepee Tabibian in Budapest.Courtesy of Cepee TabibianWalking everywhere has done wonders for my stress levels. Instead of sitting in traffic, I get to start and end my day with fresh air and sunshine. I feel more connected to my neighborhood — I know the baker, the grocer, and even the street cats. Plus, I hit my step count without even trying.3. GoFundMe-style healthcareThe U.S. healthcare system used to be one of my biggest stressors. Every doctor's visit felt like spinning a roulette wheel; you never knew what surprise bill you'd get. Finding a primary care doctor meant endless calls, and I constantly worried about what would or wouldn't be covered.In Spain, it's the complete opposite. Healthcare is affordable, accessible, and straightforward. I book appointments through an app, wait times are short, and I pay about $76 a month for private coverage as a healthy 45-year-old.4. A sense of danger in public placesAs a woman, I feel safer walking home at night in Spain. Spanish cities are denser, well-lit, and full of life late into the evening with families strolling, people dining outdoors, and kids playing in the plazas.In the U.S., I was always on alert. Whether it was walking through a parking lot after dark or attending a crowded event, there was a constant, low-level anxiety around harassment and gun violence. Spain's strict gun laws help. Automatic weapons are prohibited and firearm ownership is tightly controlled. The Global Peace Index ranks Spain among the 25 most peaceful countries in the world, while the U.S. doesn't even crack the top 100.5. Tipping guilt Every time I visit the U.S., I'm shocked at how out of control tipping has become. Even if you're grabbing a cookie at a bakery or using self-checkout, the screen flips around with options sometimes starting at 20%!Cepee Tabibian in Cádiz, Spain.Courtesy of Cepee TabibianIn Spain, where service staff earn fairer wages, rounding up or leaving a few coins at restaurants is a small token of appreciation, not an expectation. And you'll never be asked for a tip for your morning pastry.6. Extreme patriotism and polarizationOne thing I see more clearly since leaving the U.S. is how surrounded Americans are by intense political division. Don't get me wrong, Spain has its own complexities — different regions with their own identities, languages, and politics — but the overall energy feels less combative.There's less of that \"best country in the world\" mentality that often comes from people who've never actually seen the world. The U.S. does many things well, but so do plenty of other countries, Spain included.7. Pressure to follow a traditional timeline As a woman in the U.S., I felt the societal expectation that by 35, I was supposed to be married with kids. I wasn't, and that made me feel like I was behind.In Spain, where the average age to get married is 38.8 (compared to 30.8 in the U.S.), it's completely normal to be single and childfree in your 30s and 40s. It's great to go out and see plenty of people your age and older at social events, bars, and more. When I moved here in my mid 30s, I felt far less judgment for being unattached and not having children.Of all the things I don't miss, this might be the most impactful one. Letting go of that pressure to follow a traditional timeline gave me the freedom to build a life I love.Cepee Tabibian is the founder of She Hit Refresh, a community and resource platform that helps women aged 30+ move abroad.

    "body": "Among Americans' favorite romantic comedies are \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" according to a series of 2023 YouGov polls.In those and the many romcoms like them, the plot is fairly simple: The female lead pines after a man, they end up together, often after a series of kooky encounters. The end. The trope echoes a long-held belief about male-female dynamics.\"There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men,\" says Justin Lehmiller, senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute, \"and that women would be more inclined to commit faster to a relationship.\"But a recent DatingNews.com and Kinsey Institute study of 2,000 U.S. singles refutes that claim.More than a quarter, 28.6% of men would speed up their move-in timeline in a relationship and 18.8% would marry sooner, according to the study. That's as compared to 18.8% of women who'd move in faster and 13.7% who'd marry sooner.According to Kinsey's findings, their motivating factor is financial: More men would speed up these milestones to save money.And that should come as no surprise, given the current economic climate, with job openings and hiring slowing and tariffs pushing prices higher. But, experts say there's more to it.There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men.Justin LehmillerSenior research fellow, Kinsey InstituteFor heterosexual men in particular, \"romantic relationships really become their primary source of social and emotional support,\" says Lehmiller. \"And so when men don't have that in their lives, we see that their levels of psychological well-being are lower.\"It's a trend Geoff MacDonald, scholar of singlehood and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, knows well. MacDonald's MacLab focuses on wellbeing in singlehood and has found that women are more likely to be happy single than men.\"Women are just better at getting that kind of support through their friendships and through their family relationships,\" MacDonald says. \"Men tend to struggle with that more on their own.\"That could be as a result of cultural pressure, Lehmiller says.Traditional notions of masculinity \"restrict when and how men are able to express their emotions,\" he says. \"So they don't tend to get as close to their male friends or to have other people in their lives that they have close intimate relationships with.\"Romantic relationships help men meet those needs.Researchers aren't the only ones seeing men's eagerness to couple up. Kyle Scheinkman has been working at relationship coaching company Relationship Hero since 2018, first as a coach to clients and now as the director of coaching. The company's 100 or so coaches primarily offer services within the romantic relationship context, from relationship strengthening to help for those looking to find a partner.\"Generally speaking, men are more likely to sign up for coaching,\" he says. \"They're more likely to have more sessions and to spend more on coaching in the long run.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "More travelers are heading to the mountains: Big Sky, Montana was named the top trending travel destination for 2026, according to a new report from Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo.The report ranks 10 global destinations on the rise based on increased flight and accommodation searches on Expedia from 24,000 global travelers over the last year.Big Sky, the Rocky Mountains town an hour's drive from Yellowstone, may seems like it \"came out of nowhere,\" but it's \"long been known for world-class outdoor recreation, skiing and snowboarding in the winter and hiking, mountain biking and rafting in the summer,\" says Melanie Fish, travel expert for Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. Also adding to its charm are an evolving dining scene, growth in family-friendly offerings, community events and cultural activities, she tells CNBC Make It.Here are the top 10 hotspots for travelers in the coming year and how much search interest has risen from 2024:Big Sky, Montana, USA: 92% increaseOkinawa, Japan: 71% increaseSardinia, Italy: 63% increasePhu Quoc, Vietnam: 53% increaseSavoie, France: 51% increaseFort Walton Beach, Florida, USA: 45% increaseUcluelet, Canada: 44% increaseCotswolds, U.K.: 39% increaseSan Miguel de Allende, Mexico: 30% increaseHobart, Australia: 25% increaseOkinawa, a chain of islands with a subtropical climate in southern Japan, is the No. 2 trending destination for 2026, per Expedia searches.Travel to Japan surged in recent years thanks to a weak yen and lifted Covid restrictions, but some cities like Kyoto have introduced so-called tourist taxes to curb overcrowding. Meanwhile, Expedia recognized Okinawa for meeting its \"Smart Travel Health Check\" framework, aligned with World Travel and Tourism Council principles, for the region's efforts to offer cultural and natural experiences without the overcrowding seen in many major global cities.\"Expedia doesn't feel like it should or could be the arbiter of where travelers should visit or should want to visit, but we do play a role in informing travelers of what's happening in the places that they're making plans to travel to,\" Fish says about recognizing places that support sustainable travel practices.Kabira Bay, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan. The bay forms part of the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park.Sean Pavone | Istock | Getty Images\"What we see in Okinawa is that they are taking proactive environmental measures like coral reef restoration, they're moving towards a decarbonized economy by using renewable energy sources,\" Fish says. \"They're celebrating local heritage and making sure visitors have educational opportunities.\"Rounding out the top three is Sardinia, another rising destination beyond hotspots like Rome, Florence or Venice. The island is the Mediterranean's second-largest after Sicily and is sometimes referred to as \"the Maldives of Europe\" because of its beaches.Parts of the region are considered a \"Blue Zone,\" an area of the world where people tend to live exceptionally long lives, thanks to healthy lifestyle habits, access to fresh food, and focuses on strong social ties and spirituality.\"Sardinia is going to take a little bit more effort to get to than the destinations that we are so familiar with, like Rome and Florence,\" Fish says, but travelers are finding it worthwhile to enjoy the island's beaches, food and diverse landscapes.\"There are beautiful coastlines, but then there's a mountainous interior, and then those charming towns,\" she says. \"That's really the trifecta of what travelers are looking for.\"Photo taken in Bosa, Oristano, Sardinia, Italy.Ellen Van Bodegom | Moment | Getty Images",

IDR plans set a borrower's monthly bill at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, usually 20 years or 25 years.The Education Department under Trump said that a court order that halted the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan — a Biden administration era program — had implications for other IDR plans.Consumer advocates had argued that that was too broad a reading of the court order. And it left borrowers with just one repayment plan available that led to student loan cancellation: the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR. For a period, the Trump administration also paused IBR loan cancellation, though it has since resumed processing that aid.In the agreement with the AFT, the Trump administration also clarified that borrowers who become eligible for student loan forgiveness in 2025 won't owe federal taxes on the relief. A law that provides tax-free treatment on the federal level for canceled education debt expires at the end of this year.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed threat to impose a 100% tariff on all movies produced outside of the country could upend the global industry — and deliver a heavy blow to Britain's already fragile sector.The White House leader first announced duties on movies produced outside the U.S. in May this year. He than reiterated the issue in September, writing in a post on social media that other countries have \"stolen\" the movie-making business from the U.S.The U.K.'s film industry has already faced multiple challenges in recent years from Box Office sales struggling to recover their pre-pandemic levels to rising competition from streaming platforms, the SAG AFTRA strikes and now the threat of film tariffs.Gurinder Chadha, director of blockbuster movies \"Bend it Like Beckham\" and \"Bride & Prejudice,\" is set to release a new film this Winter called \"Christmas Karma,\" based on Charles Dickens' classic, \"A Christmas Carol.\"  The director told CNBC it's a \"miracle\" that she's been able to make the film, given the challenges faced by the industry.  \"I'm not sure that tariffs are practical, but I think we have to look at the message behind that, which is that every country is trying to protect its own film industry,\" she said.Audience members wear 3D spectacles to watch a movie.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStill, the British film and TV sector is a bright spot for the economy, contributing billions of pounds through production spending, which reached £5.6 billion ($7.5 billion) last year, according to the British Film Institute (BFI).\"We know that it's worth — about 126 billion pounds a year — our creative industries. Quite often, people think about film and television as being things that make you feel good, things that entertain you, but actually they create thousands and thousands of jobs and huge amounts of inward investment across the U.K.,\" said Caroline Dinenage, a member of parliament and chair of the U.K.'s Culture Media and Sports Committee.U.S. dependencyFrom Pinewood to Shepperton, U.K. studios depend heavily on U.S. partnerships. Last year, 65% of total U.K. production spend on film came from U.S. studios and streaming platforms, per a BFI report.Without this stateside contribution, it would be more difficult to make British movies, according to film director Howard Berry. \"We are quite reliant on the U.S. investing into the U.K. to make films. We have to wait for them to say we're going to make a film, and then we scramble around to make it happen,\" he said.\"We're not so great at having a pot of money for the U.K. to say we're going to make U.K. films. And so if that money doesn't happen anymore, we're kind of stuck. We don't have that huge amount of investment to make our own films.\"Modern filmmaking is a collaborative process, with scripting, filming, post-production, and music development often worked on across different countries. This makes it difficult to enforce tariffs, according to the Vue CEO Tim Richards.\"I think because of the complexities, because there are other ways of actually implementing and getting to the same place, through tax credits, even what Gavin Newsom has been proposing as well in California, that there are other means of achieving the same goals without having the impact on the industry,\" Richards said, referring to California Governor Gavin Newsom.This summer, Newsom increased the total film and TV tax credit to $750 million in California, nearly doubling the previous cap, in a bid to encourage more productions to film in Los Angeles.\"How do you define what is going to be actually hit by these tariffs? That's what everyone's really been focusing on,\" he added.watch nowZygi Kamasa, CEO of British-based theatrical distributor True Brit Entertainment, said that U.S. movie tariffs could result in the U.K. collaborating more with other nations.\"A lot of our films that we made over the years, that we made in Britain, travel very well to Europe and Asia. And I think we'd look at co-production opportunities more out of the European territories to bolster the financing opportunities.\"For now the cameras keep rolling – but many within the industry are hoping the U.K. government will take action.When Trump first called for 100% tariffs on movies, a spokesperson from the U.K. government told local media that it was not in the national interest to provide a \"running commentary\" on trade matters with the U.S. They added that the British film industry is \"world-class.\"\"It's a really important thing for our prime minister to be discussing with the U.S. government, and I think it should definitely be front and center of any future trade discussion,\" said Dinenage.",

    "body": "In 2011, I walked away from a six-figure law career and retired at age 41. I thought I was prepared financially. But emotionally? Not so much.After decades of working, I was used to the sense of purpose that came with a career, and I assumed I'd have to give that up once I stopped working. My biggest fear took the form of one major uncertainty: What would I do with all that unstructured time?Fast forward 14 years later, and my days are anything but idle. My wife and I now live in Portugal, the No. 1 country Americans want to move to. I spend my free time enjoying local food with friends and hiking the wildflower-dotted coastal trails. Retiring early is one of the best decisions I've ever made ... but I remember how overwhelming it felt at the start.Here's what I've learned so far in early retirement, and why I don't regret it.1. Uncertainty is an opportunity, not an obstacleI followed a predictable path for most of my adult life: law school, summer associate gigs, and eventually a stable legal career. Then came the 2008 financial crisis. The firm I worked for collapsed — and with it, my sense of direction. I couldn't picture myself doing anything other than practicing law.I could've stayed in the industry. But instead, I chose the unknown. Most people think early retirement is about not working anymore. But it's about redefining your identity without a roadmap. That required a mindset shift: I had to become an explorer.Ocean fog envelopes Sintra forest, within Portugal's Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, near Lisbon.Alex TriasThat mindset brought us to Portugal, a country where we didn't speak the language, didn't know anyone, and had no idea what to expect day-to-day. It was disorienting at first. But the uncertainty became our motivation to grow, learn, and build a fulfilling life from scratch.If you're delaying retirement because you don't know what comes next, that might be exactly why it's worth doing. Uncertainty could be your opportunity to travel down paths you've never imagined.2. You can still get ahead financially, even without a paycheckWhen we first retired, my wife and I assumed we'd gradually draw down our savings over time and hope it would last. But something surprising happened: Our net worth kept growing.A major reason is that living in Portugal drastically reduced our expenses. Here's what we save annually compared to our old life in Washington, D.C.:$15,000 on state income taxes$25,000 on health insurance and deductibles$14,000 on property taxes$20,000 on food, entertainment, and daily costsIn total, we estimate that we save about $5,000 per month just by living abroad.We follow the same financial strategy we did while working: We live below our means, reinvest the difference, and let compounding do the work. The only difference is that now, instead of salaries, our income comes from investments.Retirement doesn't have to be the end of building wealth. It can even be the beginning of a more sustainable, intentional version of it.3. Finding purpose in retirement is just as important as finding it in your careerWhether you're working or not, most of us want the same thing: to feel like we matter and are making a contribution.Coastal event collides against the rocks at Guincho beach, located on Portugal's Estoril coast.Alex TriasWhen we first retired, we had a built-in sense of purpose as parents to a young child. We joined school activities, studied the local language, and built a new life in Lisbon.But when our daughter went off to college, we were back to square one. Our schedules emptied out, and we faced the same question we did in 2011: What do we do with all this time?Before diving into hobbies or commitments, we made a plan. We identified six core priorities that bring meaning to our lives:Building and strengthening friendshipsPersonal care and physical healthQuality time as a coupleTravelVolunteer work and giving backLearning new skillsOnce we had those priorities in place, it became easier to build a routine that felt fulfilling.Today, my wife volunteers at our tennis club, takes pottery and Dutch lessons, and plays sports. I'm focused on writing, freelance retirement coaching, and helping a local nonprofit as a consultant. We host dinner parties, explore new recipes, and take short trips around Europe.With the right mindset, early retirement can be the perfect new starting point. You just have to be willing to embrace it.Alex Trias is a retired attorney. He and his wife have been living in Portugal since 2015.

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesA judge ordered that X and xAI's lawsuit accusing Apple and OpenAI of trying to maintain monopolies in artificial intelligence markets must remain in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, despite \"at best minimal connections\" to that geographic area by any of the companies.Judge Mark Pittman, in a sharply ironic four-page order on Thursday, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, given their preference for the antitrust lawsuit to be heard there.In a footnote, he even flagged the companies to the website of the Business Services unit of the City of Fort Worth \"to get the process started\" of relocating there.Pittman's order implicitly aims at the tendency of some plaintiffs of a conservative bent to file lawsuits in the Fort Worth division of the U.S. Northern District of Texas courts to increase their chances of winning favorable rulings from the two active judges there, both of whom were appointed by Republicans.Those plaintiffs have included X and Tesla, both controlled by mega-billionaire Elon Musk, who, until earlier this year, was a top advisor to President Donald Trump.Pittman was appointed by Trump, but has been critical of the practice of targeting lawsuits to specific judicial districts, known as forum-shopping.In his order on Thursday, Pittman said that the Fort Worth division's docket is two to three times busier than the docket of the Dallas division, which has more judges.Pittman's order noted that neither Apple nor OpenAI has a strong connection to Fort Worth, other than several Apple stores.\"And, of course, under that logic, there is not a district and division in the entire United States that would not be an appropriate venue for this lawsuit,\" Pittman wrote.X Corp. is headquartered in Bastrop, Texas — roughly 200 miles south of Fort Worth — while both Apple and OpenAI are headquartered in California. Musk's xAI acquired his social media company X in March in an all-stock transaction.\"Given the present desire to have venue in Fort Worth, the numerous high-stakes lawsuits previously adjudicated in the Fort Worth Division, and the vitality of Fort Worth, the Court highly encourages the Parties to consider moving their headquarters to Fort Worth,\" the judge wrote.\"Fort Worth has much more going for it than just the unique artwork on the fourth floor of its historic federal courthouse,\" Pittman said.The judge had asked the three companies to explain why the case belonged in the Fort Worth court.But neither Apple nor OpenAI requested that the case be moved before the judge's Oct. 9 deadline, Pittman noted in the order.Read more CNBC politics coverageX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

This case contains at best minimal connections to the Fort Worth Division of the Northern District of Texas,\" Pittman wrote. \"Possibly one of the strongest points made by Plaintiffs is the mere fact that 'Apple sell[s] iPhones [in this Division] (and many other products) and OpenAI offer[s] ChatGPT nationwide.'\"\"After more than a decade of service presiding over thousands of cases in three different courts, the undersigned continues to feel strongly that '[v]enue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a Plaintiffs' whim where and how a lawsuit is filed,'\" the judge sniped.But Pittman noted that he had little, if any, choice in the decision to keep the suit in his courthouse.The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes federal courts in Texas, has raised \"the standard for transferring venue to new heights,\" Pittman wrote.Last year, the 5th Circuit twice slapped down orders by Pittman to transfer to Washington, D.C., a lawsuit by trade groups representing large banks challenging a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which capped credit card late fees at $8 per month.The 5th Circuit said Pittman's court \"clearly abused its discretion\" in trying to move the case.OpenAI declined to comment to CNBC, referring a reporter to its public filings in the lawsuit. X and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Musk's X and xAI sued Apple and OpenAI in August, alleging the companies of an \"anticompetitive scheme\" to maintain monopolies in artificial intelligence markets.The lawsuit accused Apple of favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store rankings and deprioritizing other competitors, such as xAI's Grok.Earlier this month, a judge in Washington, D.C., blocked Musk's request to move the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit over his alleged improper disclosure of his stake in Twitter to Texas. Musk renamed Twitter to X after purchasing the company.",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

    "body": "Last month, J.D. Power released its annual North American Airport Satisfaction Study for 2025.Mega airports are defined as those with 33 million or more passengers per year. The study measured overall passenger satisfaction by examining their experiences across seven core dimensions in order of importance:Ease of travel through airportLevel of trust with airportTerminal facilitiesAirport staffDeparture/to airport experienceFood, beverage and retailArrival/from airport experienceThe 2025 study is based on 30,439 completed surveys from U.S. or Canadian residents who traveled through at least one U.S. or Canadian airport and covers both departure and arrival experiences (including connecting airports) during the past 30 days. The study was conducted from July 2024 through July 2025.\"While the annual growth rate in passenger volume seems to be leveling off, we're still seeing record numbers of travelers pass through the nation's airports, and, for the most part, they are enjoying the experience,\" Michael Taylor, practice lead for the airport study at J.D. Power, stated in a press release.Just like 2024, the top three airports remain the same, which isn't surprising, Taylor tells CNBC Make It.\"The three airports that won performed solidly in what I call blocking and tackling. It's about getting to the airport, is the bathroom clean? Is the TSA quick? That kind of thing and then the most important part is the food, beverage and retail which is the biggest swing factor in the study usually,\" he says.With the government shutdown still ongoing, air travel is being affected but hasn't changed the satisfaction rankings of the mega airports in this year's report yet, Taylor says.His biggest piece of advice during this time is that travelers should be prepared to not go anywhere.\"Prepare not to be in the air and seeing more delays,\" he said. \"People will react negatively to that, which will affect satisfaction, but it's generally fairly episodic. It doesn't last forever and we haven't seen a huge impact.\"Minneapolis-Saint Paul International is the best 'mega airport' in North America — againThe Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport ranked No. 1 on the list, scoring 660 out of 1,000.The airport is ideally located between Minnesota's two major cities, Minneapolis and St. Paul.\"From start to finish, Minneapolis has a really good relationship with its state's Department of Transportation because signage is very critical to have a good airport experience,\" Taylor says. \"They have actual highway signs that tell you which terminal you're going to. That's kind of unusual in the United States. They do a really good job of bringing Minnesota into the airport itself.Minneapolis-Saint Paul International AirportStar Tribune Via Getty Images | Star Tribune | Getty ImagesThe airport served more than 37 million travelers in 2024, making it the 18th busiest in North America in terms of the number of passengers served annually, according to MSP's website.In 2023, the airport ranked as the world's most punctual, according to a report from the travel data analytics firm Cirium.The 10 best 'mega airports' in North AmericaMinneapolis-Saint Paul International AirportDetroit Metropolitan Wayne County AirportPhoenix Sky Harbor International AirportDallas/Fort Worth International AirportHarry Reid International AirportJohn F.

    "body": "George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives, arrives for the sentencing in his criminal corruption charges at Central Islip Federal Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, U.S., April 25, 2025.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday evening said he has commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, releasing the disgraced former Republican congressman immediately.Santos \"was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Santos was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison this year after pleading guilty to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He began serving his sentence in late July.The 37-year-old New York representative served in the House for less than a year before he was expelled from Congress under a cloud of scandal in December 2023.Even before he was sworn in, Santos admitted lying about key details of his life on the campaign trail. While in Congress, he was charged by the Department of Justice with an array of federal crimes, including fraud, theft, money laundering and making false statements.Trump's decision to commute Santos' sentence came after multiple friends and allies of the imprisoned ex-politician made appeals for his clemency, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday evening.Trump had also recently read Santos' writings from prison describing his living conditions, the official told NBC.In a flattery-filled letter published Monday in local Long Island news outlet The South Shore Press, Santos directly asked Trump for clemency.\"You have always been a man of second chances, a leader who believes in redemption and renewal,\" Santos wrote. \"I am asking you now, from the depths of my heart, to extend that same belief to me.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who weathered heavy criticism during his 2010 Senate campaign for saying he had \"served in Vietnam\" when he had never been deployed there.Trump had said earlier in October that Blumenthal \"should be investigated, and Justice should be sought.\" The attack came hours after Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a combative and politically charged Senate hearing, directly accused Blumenthal of lying about his military record.Blumenthal said in 2010 that he had misspoken about his service on multiple occasions. On CNN last week, the senator said Trump's accusations are \"completely deceptive and distorted.\"Trump did not serve in the military after receiving five draft deferments during the Vietnam War.Trump wrote Friday that Blumenthal's record \"is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,\" Trump wrote.\"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"Santos' attorney confirmed Santos was released from Federal Correctional Institution Fairton in New Jersey at 11 a.m. ET on Saturday.",

    "body": "Budrul Chukrut | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesOn Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave some hints about more interest rate cuts, mentioning the weakness in the labor market.Bearing in mind an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and potential rate cuts, investors can consider adding some dividend stocks to their portfolios to ensure stable income. The recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors pick attractive dividend-paying stocks with strong fundamentals.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.EOG ResourcesThis week's first dividend pick is EOG Resources (EOG), a crude oil and natural gas exploration and production (E&P) company with reserves in the U.S. and Trinidad. The company recently announced a deal to buy Encino Acquisition Partners for $5.6 billion. The deal will be accretive to EOG's free cash flow, supporting its commitment to shareholder returns.EOG raised its quarterly dividend 5% to $1.02 per share, payable October 31. With an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG offers a yield of 3.8%.Recently, RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a buy rating on EOG and raised his price target to $145 from $140. TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on EOG stock with a price target of $133.Hanold updated his estimates, valuations and EOG stock price target to reflect higher oil price expectations. Notably, the 5-star analyst raised his earnings per share (EPS) and cash flow per share (CFPS) estimates for 2025 and 2026 due to his revised commodity outlook. Hanold now expects EPS of $10.07 and $9.46 for 2025 and 2026, respectively, up from the prior projections of $9.54 and $7.15. Hanold initiated EPS and CFPS estimates of $11.63 and $23.59 for 2027 and at $12.97 and $25.65 for 2028, respectively.Hanold is bullish on EOG and expects it to outperform its peer group over the next 12 months. \"The leading-edge technological approach, strong balance sheet, low-cost operations and capital efficiency should continue to drive meaningful value and make EOG a core E&P holding,\" said Hanold.Hanold ranks No. 79 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 26.5%. See EOG Resources Hedge Fund Activity on TipRanks.Coterra EnergyAnother dividend-paying energy company is Coterra Energy (CTRA), an exploration and production company with operations focused in the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale and Anadarko Basin. Coterra paid a quarterly dividend of 22 cents per share in the  Q2 of 2025 and yields 3.4%.  As part of his Q3 preview for oil & gas E&P companies, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Coterra, while cutting his price target to $32 from $35. By comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on CTRA stock with a price target of $26.Given the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, Sorbara is more cautious and selective in the near term. Based on the recent stock performance, investor positioning and expectations, he said that Coterra is one of his \"favorite names\" heading into Q3 results.Sorbara believes that investors will continue to focus on management's oversight of the large oil production rampup in the second half of 2025 and its outlook for 2026. The analyst expects Q3 oil production to beat expectations, but lag estimates for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and free cash flow, likely due to \"stale Consensus gas pricing.\" Meanwhile, Sorbara sees upside to Q4 oil production expectations due to the potential for incremental upside from the Harkey remediation wells.\"We reaffirm our Buy rating, as we continue to find CTRA attractive on valuation (trading at an EV/EBITDA discount and above average FCF yield) with the potential for strong capital returns,\" said Sorbara, referencing free cash flow.Sorbara ranks No. 315 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 52% of the time, delivering an average return of 20%. See EOG Resources Financials on TipRanks.AT&TWireless telecom giant AT&T (T) is this week's third dividend pick. The company is scheduled to announce its third-quarter results on October 22. AT&T recently declared a quarterly dividend of 27.75 cents share, payable November 3. With an annualized dividend of $1.11 per share, AT&T yields 4.3%.Heading into Q3 results, Citigroup analyst Michael Rollins reiterated a buy rating on AT&T with a base case price target of $32, calling the company a top-ranked pick. TipRanks' AI Analyst also has an \"outperform\" rating on AT&T stock with a price target of $31.Rollins expects AT&T to deliver a strong operating performance in Q3 across its strategic products and segments. Despite intense competition in wireless, the 5-star analyst expects AT&T to report 300,000 postpaid phone net additions in the Q3, with 2.5% year-over-year growth in wireless service revenue.Further, Rollins estimates Q3 fiber net additions of 286,000 in a seasonally stronger quarter. He expects AT&T's fixed wireless access (FWA) to continue to expand with net additions of 210,000. The analyst highlighted that his headline Q3 forecasts are slightly below the Street's consensus estimates for revenue, EBITDA and EPS, and are in line with free cash flow expectations.\"Wireless churn, upgrades and gross adds are likely to have an upward bias in 3Q given the more active replacement rates,\" noted Rollins. The analyst contends that AT&T's broadband opportunity remains an under-appreciated component of the company's annual financial growth prospects.Rollins ranks No. 548 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.7%. See AT&T Ownership Structure on TipRanks.",

It has a portfolio of beverage brands, including Keurig, Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Mott's, A&W, Penafiel, Snapple, 7UP, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, GHOST, Clamato, Core Hydration and The Original Donut Shop, as well as the Keurig brewing system.

Its U.S. coffee segment is a manufacturer and distributor of single-serve brewers, specialty coffee (including hot and iced varieties), and ready-to-drink coffee. Its international segment includes sales in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and other international markets.Stock Market Value: $36.11 billion ($26.59 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKeurig Dr Pepper stock performance year to dateActivist: Starboard ValueOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has taken a total of 161 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.49% versus 13.81% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningStarboard has taken a position in Keurig Dr Pepper and has held meetings with the company's management.Behind the scenesKeurig Dr Pepper is a leading North American beverage company. The core of the company is its U.S. refreshment beverage segment (63.9% of revenue), which includes the manufacturing and distribution of branded concentrates, syrups, and finished beverages. The U.S. coffee segment (22.77%) includes goods relating to Keurig pods, single-serve brewers and accessories, with the remaining revenue deriving from the international segment (13.33%). In January 2018, Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Keurig Green Mountain announced a merger, providing investors unique exposure to the fastest growing hot and cold beverage markets and their respective retail channels. However, this merger did not come without its challenges, including certain synergistic uncertainties. Moreover, as a result of the merger, JAB Holdings — the owner of Keurig — became the majority owner of the combined company, reducing Dr Pepper shareholders to a minority stake of just 13%, and flooding KDP's board with JAB affiliates. This dynamic changed earlier this year when three JAB-affiliated directors resigned following a series of divestures that reduced JAB's ownership to below 10% — now 4.4% following an additional block sale.As JAB began to turn over control and shareholders regained influence, investors began to advocate for a reseparation of the beverage and coffee assets. And management has responded — though not in the way shareholders expected — announcing a merger with coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, followed by a separation of the beverage and coffee assets, now including both Keurig and Peet's in the coffee business. Coincidentally, or not so coincidentally, JAB owns a controlling 68% stake in JDE Peet's. The move shocked investors and sent KDP shares down 25% upon the announcement. It is not that shareholders don't want a separation, but more the structure and negative consequences of the transaction as structured. The logical way to have accomplished this would have been through a spin out of the coffee business by KDP into JDE Peet's using a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust. This would be simpler, economically better for shareholders and make more sense since Keurig is smaller than Peet's. Instead, KDP structured it as an all-cash acquisition with a large premium and using an $18.5 billion loan to finance it, causing a projected leverage-to-earnings ratio of greater than 5x in 2026. Just as the Reverse Morris Trust would have been favorable to KDP shareholders, the structure ultimately agreed upon was as favorable, if not more, to JAB.Starboard has entered this engagement in an unusual position. In the case of a pending strategic transaction, we typically see activists emerge where they can help influence or block a bad deal for shareholders. But that is not happening here — this is a cash deal, leaving KDP shareholders without a vote. Starboard certainly has had extensive success operationally and from a board level with consumer and retail companies, including Kenvue, Papa John's and Darden Restaurants, and we can see them adding significant value here. But the better analogy may be to Starboard's prior engagement in Ritchie Bros Auctioneer, now RB Global. In that engagement, Starboard also became involved shortly after the company's announced merger with IAA – a deal met with similar shareholder opposition. Starboard entered into a $500 million securities purchase agreement with the company that removed certain roadblocks and opposition to the merger, allowing it to consummate. Importantly, Starboard was also granted a board seat for its CEO Jeff Smith, restoring a great deal of investor confidence in the company. By the time Smith resigned from RBA's board less than two years later, the company's stock had more than doubled.Given this track record, Starboard's involvement at KDP likely reflects a similar constructive approach, seeking board representation through amicable settlement, leveraging the fund's expertise to help guide KDP behind the scenes through this inflection point and helping restore investor confidence among this rightfully skeptical shareholder base. Moreover, given the recent decline in KDP's share price, Starboard likely sees this entry as an opportunity to invest at a compelling discount, similar to RBA, where short-term merger headwinds could provide significant upside for long-term and value-oriented shareholders like Starboard. KDP's nomination deadline is not until February, but we do not think that will be relevant here as meetings have already taken place between Starboard and management and we expect an amicable resolution before then.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest.The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective.The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today.With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. \"As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,\" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang.Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed \"superfakes,\" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.Buyer bewareHowever, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of \"caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware.To counter increasingly realistic \"superfakes,\" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale.The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC.\"At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,\" Tan said. \"And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.\"watch nowThe company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said.South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence \"trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,\" Choi told CNBC.Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.Trust fuels salesBoth Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business.Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said.Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen \"very strong interest\" and has recorded \"great growth.\"This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store.\"When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,\" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions.Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer \"fair value.\"\"We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,\" she said. \"Am I better off with a bit of assurance?\"Next wave of luxury consumersAffordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report.But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samina Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.\"These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,\" Virk said.watch nowYounger shoppers, with their limited spending power, prefer to buy, enjoy and quickly resell items, Bunjang's Choi said.\"This remarkable growth reflects a fundamental shift in how Millennials and Gen Z, the next wave of luxury consumers, perceive and engage with luxury goods.\"Correction: Samina Virk is the Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective.

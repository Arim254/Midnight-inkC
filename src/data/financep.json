    "body": "As a clinical psychologist, I often have to caution clients to examine the sparks that they feel for a new romantic prospect.You want to be excited about someone new and feel a deep connection to them. But many of us carry old wounds from our childhood, previous relationships, or formative experiences. If your past was chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing, then you may be drawn to those same relationship dynamics again and again. Here are five signs that the chemistry you feel might actually be a red flag.1. The relationship makes you feel on edgeIn your past, if someone made you feel loved but also anxious, your nervous system learned that loving and fearing the same person was okay.Mixed signals, hot and cold affection, and inconsistency can then feel intimate rather than anxiety-inducing. Excitement and anxiety are closely related emotions, so you feel on edge, but mistake this feeling for excitement and chemistry.What to do: Slow down and notice how your body feels around this person. Does your nervous system settle when you are around them or are you always on edge? If it's the latter, that may be a signal that the feeling you have isn't chemistry, and that this person makes you feel unsafe.2. The highs and lows feel addictiveThe emotional rollercoaster when someone pulls away and the relief when they come close again can feel like a spark, especially if you had relationship dynamics like that in the past. When you are stressed, your body releases hormones such as cortisol, which activates reward and addiction pathways in your brain. As a result, you may unconsciously chase that stress, conflict, unpredictability, and intensity because it gives your body a hit of the feel-good chemicals that it craves.What to do: Your body needs to learn how to slow down and feel safe again. This can look like stretching, breathwork, meditation, nature walks, and decreasing your workload.3. You keep going back to themBeing drawn to someone doesn't always mean the chemistry is good. You may be unconsciously trying to gain mastery over an old wound by reenacting the pain. You believe that you can make it right this time. You might also recreate painful dynamics that mirror your past because you can predict what happens, and this gives you a false sense of control.What to do: Self-reflection is important here. Does this person remind you of something from your past? Therapy can provide you with a safe space to unpack your history. 4. Jealousy feels excitingWhen your partner is jealous, it may feel validating to be \"wanted\" by someone. If it feels exciting when your partner is jealous, this isn't chemistry — it is your insecurity rearing its head. You might even do something on purpose to trigger their jealousy in order to feel closer to them or make them \"prove\" to you that you are wanted. In your mind, this might sound like, \"If they choose me, then I'm finally good enough,\" or, \"If they chase me, it means they love me enough.\"What to do: Work on yourself so your validation comes from within, not from other people. Remember who you are outside of the context of this relationship, and that you are already more than enough. 5. Things are never calmSteady connection should feel grounding and safe. But if your nervous system is used to chaos, calm can feel boring, and even uncomfortable. You may catch yourself thinking there's no spark, and then chase the next thrill by creating tension, initiating conflict, or even leaving the relationship. If you feel safe, and you aren't used to that, in your mind, this might sound like, \"If I feel safe, I'll let my guard down but then I'll get hurt.\"The lack of spark doesn't mean there isn't chemistry. It might just mean there isn't anxiety. What to do: Teach your body that it's okay to feel calm. When you feel like you want to create conflict or chase a thrill, stop and notice that. Then practice doing the opposite of what your urges are, and waiting for them to pass.Noticing patterns in your relationships is a great first step. Of course, you should always consult with your physician or therapist before making significant changes. Understanding how to slow down and process your past can help you relearn what safety and consistency feel like.Dr. Amy Tran is a clinical psychologist.

    "body": "With any credit card, there's typically a limit to how much you can spend. And experts say choosing the right limit can play an important role in maintaining good credit health.Set based on factors like your income, credit history and ability to repay, your credit limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow on a credit card or account. \"Generally speaking, more credit is better, as long as you don't use it as a crutch to overspend and take on too much debt,\" says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. Experts often recommend seeking out a limit that's well above how much you'll spend in a month to maximize your credit score. Your \"ideal\" credit limit will depend on your personal spending habits and preferences, Rossman says.The best limit for your credit scoreToo keep your credit score high, it's best to use only 10% to 30% of your available credit and pay your statements off in full every month, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.The percentage of your available credit that you're using is a metric known as credit utilization. Keeping utilization low shows lenders you manage credit responsibly, which helps improve your credit score, while hitting that limit every month signals to lenders that you may be over-reliant on credit and a higher lending risk, thus lowering your score, says Rossman.Working backward from the an ideal credit utilization of 10% to 30%, if you typically spend around $5,000 a month on your card, you should have a limit of $50,000, Tsantes says. By the same metric, if you typically spend around $2,500 on your card, $25,000 could be a good limit, he adds. \"The idea is that you'll never be close to hitting that limit,\" Tsantes says. Having a seemingly high limit is there not as money available to use, but as a buffer to keep your balance well below your maximum and your credit utilization low.It may also be smart to consult a trusted financial professional who can help you determine the amount of credit that makes sense for you.It's OK to stick to a more practical limitCredit card debt can be costly and hard to pay off. So, if you know you're likely to view your credit limit as the amount you can spend each month, it may be wiser to stick to a limit that covers just the essentials with a small buffer, Rossman says.\"You definitely don't want to be hitting or approaching that limit or spending more than you can afford to pay back,\" he says. \"Even though it's good for your credit score to have more credit, if you're going to use that as a way to overspend, that could be a danger.\"However, even with a lower limit, it's still possible to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, Rossman says. If your line of credit is just enough to cover your essentials and you're getting close to your limit every month, there are \"workarounds\" to lower your utilization, like making extra payments throughout the month to keep your usage under 30%.How to increase your credit limitTo increase your credit limit, you can either request a credit limit increase for an existing card or open a new card with a new line of credit, Rossman says. Start by checking with your existing credit card issuer to see if requesting a credit limit increase will trigger a hard or soft credit inquiry, he says. Hard inquiries can cause a small, temporary dip in your credit score, while a soft inquiry is a routine or informational check that does not affect your credit score. If your issuer will use a soft inquiry, increasing the limit on an existing card can boost available credit and lower your credit utilization without hurting your score, Rossman says.If your issuer is going to run a hard inquiry, it may be more strategic to open a new credit card with a different set of rewards and benefits, Rossman says. That way, you can have more options to maximize benefits across your cards, he says.Although increasing your credit limit can raise your spending power, avoid treating that extra credit as more money or an emergency fund for \"desperate times,\" Rossman says. Spending more than you can afford on a credit card can lead to high-interest debt that becomes difficult to repay, he says, especially if your financial situation is already strained.\"Having a credit card with a $5,000 limit — yes, that could help you in a pinch — but that's not the same as having $5,000 in the bank,\" Rossman says. \"This is debt. It can be very expensive debt.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Americans are more anxious about the holidays this year, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Healthy Minds Poll.Forty-one percent of U.S. adults say they anticipate more stress related to the holidays this year than last year, compared to 28% in 2024 and 29% in 2023. They list numerous reasons including missing someone in their life, dealing with the cost of holiday gifts, navigating challenging family dynamics and being lonely.If you're stressed out this time of year, there are tactics you can try to make the holidays more pleasant. Here's what Sabrina Romanoff, New York–based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily, recommends.Try 'muting accounts on social media that are really making you feel awful'Americans spend a lot of time on social media. Thirty-seven percent of U.S. adults visit Facebook several times a day, according to the Pew Research Center.  With so much time spent looking at other people's lives, it's easy to compare what your holidays look like to what theirs do.Making this season more pleasant \"can mean muting accounts on social media that are really making you feel awful, making you feel not good enough,\" says Romanoff. You can block them or unfollow them altogether.In December, as in any time of the year, \"it's really important to be intentional about what you are seeing and consuming,\" she says, \"because that's going to change the lens through which you see your own life.\"Choose to participate in whatever way 'makes your life more comfortable'If you're nervous about some of the people you'll be spending time with this season, you can also tailor your experience accordingly.That could mean, \"I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable to make Aunt Karen comfortable when she asks her intrusive questions,\" says Romanoff. \"I'm going to let there be silence.\" It could also mean giving yourself breaks during gatherings that feel overwhelming and going to another room for a few minutes. It could even mean deciding that there are certain celebrations you're going to skip altogether — and replace with get-togethers with your chosen family.Ultimately, making this time of year happier and less stressful \"means really showing up in a way that makes your life more comfortable for you,\" she says.

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. \"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. watch now\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

The last three months of 2025 were a rollercoaster of tech sell-offs and rallies, as circular deals, debt issuances, and high valuations fueled concerns over an AI bubble.Such volatility may be an early sign of how AI investment is set to evolve as investors pay closer attention to who is spending money and who is making it, according to Stephen Yiu, chief investment officer at Blue Whale Growth Fund.Investors, especially retail investors who are exposed to AI through ETFs, typically have not differentiated between companies with a product but no business model, those burning cash to fund AI infrastructure, or those on the receiving end of AI spending, Yiu told CNBC.So far, \"every company seems to be winning,\" but AI is in its early innings, he said. \"It's very important to differentiate\" between different types of companies, which is \"what the market might start to do,\" Yiu added.This illustration taken on April 20, 2018, in Paris shows apps for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple, plus the reflection of a binary code displayed on a tablet screen.Lionel Bonaventure | Afp | Getty ImagesHe sees three camps: private companies or startups, listed AI spenders and AI infrastructure firms. The first group, which includes OpenAI and Anthropic, lured $176.5 billion in venture capital in the first three quarters of 2025, per PitchBook data. Meanwhile, Big Tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta are the ones cutting checks to AI infrastructure providers such as Nvidia and Broadcom.  Blue Whale Growth Fund measures a company's free cash flow yield, which is the amount of money a company generates after capital expenditure, against its stock price, to figure out whether valuations are justified.  Most companies within the Magnificent 7 are \"trading a significant premium\" since they started heavily investing in AI, Yiu said.\"When I'm looking at valuations in AI, I would not want to position — even though I believe in how AI is going to change the world — into the AI spenders,\" he added, adding that his firm would rather be \"on the receiving end\" as AI spending is set to further impact company finances.  The AI \"froth\" is \"concentrated in specific segments rather than across the broader market,\" Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank and Wealth Management, told CNBC. The bigger risk lies with companies that are securing investment from the AI bull run but are yet to generate earnings — \"for example, some quantum computing-related companies,\" Lafargue said. \"In these cases, investor positioning seems driven more by optimism than by tangible results,\" he added, saying that \"differentiation is key.\"Read moreThe need for differentiation also reflects an evolution of Big Tech business models. Once asset-light firms are increasingly asset-heavy as they gobble up technology, power and land needed for their bullish AI strategies. Companies like Meta and Google have morphed into hyperscalers that invest heavily in GPUs, data centers, and AI-driven products, which changes their risk profile and business model.Dorian Carrell, Schroders' head of multi-asset income, said valuing these companies like software and capex-light plays may no longer make sense — especially as companies are still figuring out how to fund their AI plans.\"We're not saying it's not going to work, we're not saying it's not going to come through in the next few years, but we are saying, should you pay such a high multiple with such high growth expectations baked in,\" Carrell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Dec. 1.Tech turned to the debt markets to fund AI infrastructure this year, though investors were cautious about a reliance on debt. While Meta and Amazon have raised funds this way, \"they're still net cash positioned,\" Quilter Cheviot's global head of technology research and investment strategist Ben Barringer told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Nov. 20 — an important distinction from companies whose balance sheets may be tighter.The private debt markets \"will be very interesting next year,\" Carrell added. If incremental AI revenues don't outpace those expenses, margins will compress and investors will question their return on investment, Yiu said. In addition, the performance gaps between companies could widen further as hardware and infrastructure depreciate. AI spenders will need to factor into their investments, Yiu added. \"It's not part of the P&L yet. Next year onwards, gradually, it will confound the numbers.\" \"So, there's going to be more and more differentiation.\" ",

    "body": "A Waymo car is halted on the road amid a power outage in San Francisco, California, U.S., December 20, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video.dReutersThree days after a blackout in San Francisco caused Waymo to pause its driverless car service, the Alphabet-owned company said it's updating its fleet so its vehicles are better prepared to respond during future outages. \"We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails,\" the company said in a blog post late Tuesday. Power outages began early afternoon on Saturday in San Francisco and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power. PG&E said a fire at a substation resulted in \"significant and   extensive\" damage.With stoplights and traffic signals not functioning, the city was hit with widespread gridlock. Videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in various neighborhoods. \"We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves,\" Waymo said in Tuesday's blog post. \"This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.\"San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in an update on X Saturday evening that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.Waymo said that it's analyzing the event, and is taking three \"immediate steps.\" The first involves \"fleet-wide updates\" to give vehicles \"more context about regional outages,\" so cars can take more decisive actions at intersections. The company said it's also improving its \"emergency response protocols,\" and is coordinating with Mayor Lurie's team in San Francisco to better collaborate in emergency preparedness. Finally, Waymo said it's updating its first responder training \"as we discover learnings from this and other widespread events.\" In addition to the Bay Area, Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in and around Austin, Texas, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The company recently crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and said in December it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.\"Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a record of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors,\" the company said in Tuesday's blog.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates quickly enough, even though the U.S. economy grew at a much faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter.Hassett, a leading contender to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, said the artificial intelligence boom is boosting economic growth while simultaneously putting downward pressure on inflation. \"If you look at central banks around the world, the U.S. is way behind the curve in terms of lowering rates,\" the top White House economic advisor told CNBC in a \"Money Movers\" interview.U.S. economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, faster than the Dow Jones consensus of 3.2%. Hassett said 1.5% of that growth was due to President Donald Trump's tariffs reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, the third cut this year, but the central bank indicated that the pace of future reductions could be slower. Three Fed governors voted against the quarter-point move, the most dissents since 2019. After this month's meeting, Powell said the decision to cut a quarter point was a \"close call.\" Trump has repeatedly bashed the Fed for not lowering rates as quickly as he would like. Hassett's candidacy has raised concerns among some Fed watchers that he is too close to the president.Hassett told CNBC last week that the Fed's independence is \"really important.\" Trump said in an address to the nation last week that he will announce his nominee for Fed chair soon, emphasizing that he will pick \"someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot.\"The president's prime-time speech focused on affordability. His approval rating on the economy stood at 37% in a CBS News/YouGov published Sunday. When asked about Trump's sagging approval rating, Hassett said public sentiment often does not reflect the economic numbers. \"In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing,  their glimpse of the outside world,\" Hassett said.

    "body": "Different types of leather are seen at the Rio of Mercedes cowboy boot factory, on July 31, 2025, in Mercedes, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt | AFP | Getty ImagesBootmaker Twisted X — known for its Western footwear — was thrown into chaos overnight when President Donald Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on imports in April. The company turned a conference room at its Decatur, Texas, headquarters into a \"tariff war room\" as import costs on its finished work boots surged, shipments were paused mid-transit and invoices fluctuated so wildly that staff found themselves recalculating margins by the hour. \"A lot of other leather companies had to pause shipments because of the chaos and it felt like prices were going all over the place before you could take account,\" Twisted X CEO Prasad Reddy told CNBC. \"It was a very uncertain time.\"Twisted X wasn't alone. Leather retailers big and small are facing similar challenges, and the result has been higher prices at the register that are unlikely to come down anytime soon.  Pre-tariff inventory is gone, while replacement orders cost far more. The products hitting shelves now were manufactured with more expensive hides, subjected to pricier foreign processing and shipped with higher freight costs than last year's merchandise, industry experts said. The Yale Budget Lab projects that leather goods prices will remain elevated by nearly 22% for at least the next one to two years, driven by inflation, supply chain bottlenecks and heavy tariff exposure, particularly across China, Vietnam, Italy and India. \"The reason why leather is hit so hard is twofold,\" said John Ricco with the budget lab. \"No. 1, some of these tariff rates that are the highest are placed on different countries where we import most leather. The second reason is that we just import a lot of leather, and, more broadly, apparel-related products from these trading partners than we make.\"The costs have already shown up for brands like Tapestry, owner of handbag makers Coach and Kate Spade. Executives told investors in August that tariff-related expenses could total $160 million, warning of \"greater than previously expected profit headwinds\" moving forward.Chasing low costsA pair of Twisted X boots starts the way most U.S. leather goods do: as a raw, salted cow hide from an American ranch. That hide is shipped overseas, usually to Asia, to be tanned into leather. For Twisted X, roughly half of its products are tanned in China, down from 90% in 2017, Reddy said. Once turned into leather, the material typically is shipped to another factory — often in China, Vietnam, Mexico or India — to be cut, stitched and assembled, before finally returning to the U.S. as a finished product. Under normal conditions, that global supply chain kept costs low. But reliance on foreign production backfired when the new duties took effect, Reddy said. \"When tariffs happened, everything stopped,\" said Kerry Brozyna, president of the Leather and Hide Council of America. \"So they [China] couldn't take shipments in because if they took them in and they computed in the price of the tariff, they wouldn't be able to sell them.\" Currently, the U.S. leather trade deficit is one of the widest in manufacturing. In 2023, the U.S. imported $1.37 billion in leather apparel while exporting just $92.7 million, a roughly 15-to-1 deficit, according to the Census Bureau. China alone supplies about one-third of all leather goods imported into the U.S.\"Being so reliant on many overseas productions methods ended up hurting many people in the industry in the beginning when they didn't know exactly what was going to happen,\" Reddy said. \"At Twisted X, we have been working for a while to reduce reliance on China.\" As the duties took effect, Twisted X and many other leather companies rushed to exit China and encountered new problems: bottlenecks in Cambodia and Bangladesh, longer lead times in Vietnam, and a sudden 50% tariff on many Indian leather exports imposed in August. By late summer, nearly every leather company was paying more at every stage — for hides, tanning, assembly and re-importation, according to Reddy. \"We saw all our channels to make boots keep getting more expensive until we were able to figure out a good solution,\" Reddy said. Conglomerates like Steve Madden are also feeling the impacts. \"The third quarter was challenging, driven largely by the impact of new tariffs on goods imported into the United States,\" Edward Rosenfeld, chairman and CEO of Steve Madden, said on an earnings call in November.Price increasesMany companies absorbed what they could, but that buffer is fading, Ricco said. Despite rerouting supply chains and moving production, Twisted X said it still had to raise prices around 1% to 3% this year. \"We look at it as a success,\" Twisted X's chief marketing officer, Tricia Mahoney, told CNBC. \"Many competitors were looking at bigger increases and but we made sure to prioritize our customers and keep the prices as stable as possible. Next year could be tough but we are more prepared than ever.\"Already, leather luxury prices are up. Chanel's iconic Classic Flap bag is about 5% more expensive than it was last year, after yet another round of price hikes this spring, according to luxury retail pricing data.But, by 2026, the leather industry's price shock will likely be more prominent, Ricco said. Analysts expect prices for leather footwear and accessories to rise roughly 22% over the next year or two and around 7% long term as higher tariffs, freight costs and scarce premium hides move through the system. \"2026 is going to probably be where rubber meets the road,\" Ricco said. \"They [leather companies] have to make these decisions about whether to pass cost increases on to consumers, whether to cut jobs and whether to reduce payments to shareholders.\"Domestic declinesWorkers at the Rio of Mercedes cowboy boot factory put the finishing touches on boots on July 31, 2025, in Mercedes, Texas. Ronaldo Schemidt | AFP | Getty ImagesThe decline of a once-booming domestic leather manufacturing industry is also reducing the options companies have to pivot away from the global supply chain. In the 1950s, manufacturers employed more than 300,000 people in roughly 1,000 tanneries nationwide, mainly spread across the Midwest and Northeast, according to the Leather and Hide Council of America. The workforce has fallen to around 50,000 in 2025, with the number of tanneries dwindling to a few hundred, per the council. Reddy said the so-called golden age of domestic manufacturing is long gone. The burden of tariffs has had the steepest impact on brands that rely on finished goods from Asia — not companies sourcing leather domestically. So far, rather than restoring U.S. manufacturing, as the Trump administration had predicated the tariffs on, many brands have responded by reshuffling suppliers overseas to contain costs, according to industry experts.Women work in a leather factory in Kolkata, India, on November 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCattle shortagesU.S. leather companies are also dealing with a raw material shortage, as there are simply fewer cattle hides to work with.The U.S. cattle herd is at its smallest point since the 1950s following prolonged drought, rising feed costs and herd liquidation. Since hides are a mandatory byproduct of dairy and beef production, fewer cattle mean fewer hides — even as global demand for top-grade leather persists for handbags, upholstery and footwear.\"Few cattle means that what hides are left makes it more expensive to produce boots with high-quality leather that we use,\" Reddy said. For shoppers hoping for a discount by trading down for a synthetic, alternatives haven't been spared either. Many faux-leather and polyurethane materials rely on petrochemical inputs sourced from Asia, which also fall under the new tariff schedules. Retailers and industry analysts said synthetic footwear and handbags are seeing mid- to high-single-digit cost increases, according to industry estimates.",

    "body": "Annealed neodymium iron boron magnets sit in a barrel at a Neo Material Technologies Inc. factory in Tianjin, China on June 11, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesRare earth magnet makers are having a moment as Western nations scramble to build domestic \"mine-to-magnet\" supply chains and reduce their dependence on China.A turbulent year of supply restrictions and tariff threats has thrust the strategic importance of magnet manufacturers firmly into the spotlight, with rare earths surging toward the top of the agenda amid the U.S. and China's ongoing geopolitical rivalry. Magnets made from rare earths are vital components for everything from electric vehicles, wind turbines, and smartphones to medical equipment, artificial intelligence applications, and precision weaponry.It's in this context that the U.S., European Union and Australia, among others, have sought to break China's mineral dominance by taking a series of strategic measures to support magnet makers, including heavily investing in factories, supporting the buildout of new plants, and boosting processing capacity.The U.S. and Europe, in particular, are expected to emerge as key growth markets for rare earth magnet production over the next decade. Analysts, however, remain skeptical that Western nations will be able to escape China's mineral orbit anytime soon.\"Frankly, we were the solution to the problem that the world didn't know it had,\" Rahim Suleman, CEO of Canadian group Neo Performance Materials, told CNBC by video call. Photo taken on Sept. 19, 2025 shows rare-earth magnetic bars at NEO magnetic plant in Narva, a city in northeastern Estonia. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty Images\"The end-market is growing from the point of physics, not software, so therefore it has to grow in this way,\" he continued. \"And it's not dependent on any single end market, so it's not dependent on automotive or battery electric vehicles or drones or wind farms. It's any energy-efficient motor across the spectrum,\" Suleman said, referring to the demand for magnets from fast-growing industries such as robotics. His comments came around three months after Neo launched the grand opening of its rare earth magnet factory in Narva, Estonia. Situated directly on Russia's doorstep, the facility is widely expected to play an integral role in Europe's plan to reduce its dependence on China. European Union industry chief Stéphane Séjourné, for example, lauded the plant's strategic importance, saying at an event in early December that the project marked \"a high point of Europe's sovereignty.\" watch nowNeo's Suleman said the Estonian facility is on track to produce 2,000 metric tons of rare earth magnets this year, before scaling up to 5,000 tons and beyond.\"Globally, the market is 250,000 tons and going to 600,000 tons, so more than doubling in ten years,\" Suleman said. \"And more importantly, our concentration is 93% in a single jurisdiction, so when you put those two factors together, I think you'll find an enormously quick growing market.\"'Skyrocketing demand'To be sure, the global supply of rare earths has long been dominated by Beijing. China is responsible for nearly 60% of the world's rare earths mining and more than 90% of magnet manufacturing, according to the International Energy Agency.A recent report from consultancy IDTechEx estimated that rare earth magnet capacity in the U.S. is on track to grow nearly six times by 2036, with the expansion driven by strategic support and funding from the Department of Defense, as well as increasing midstream activity. Magnet production in Europe, meanwhile, was forecast to grow 3.1 times over the same time period, bolstered by the EU's Critical Raw Materials Act, which aims for domestic production to satisfy 40% of the region's demand by 2030.  Regional composition of rare earths and permanent magnet production in 2024, according to data compiled by the International Energy Agency.IEAJohn Maslin, CEO of Vulcan Elements, a North Carolina-based rare earth magnet producer, told CNBC that the company is seeking to scale up as fast as possible \"so that this fundamental supply chain doesn't hold America back.\" Vulcan Elements is one of the companies to have received direct funding from the Trump administration. The magnet maker received a $620 million direct federal loan last month from the Department of Defense to support domestic magnet production.\"Rare earth magnets convert electricity into motion, which means that virtually all advanced machines and technologies—the innovations that shape our daily lives and keep us safe—require them in order to be operational,\" Maslin told CNBC by email. \"The need for high-performance magnets is accelerating exponentially amid a surge in demand and production of advanced technologies, including hard disk drives, semiconductor fabrication equipment, hybrid/electric motors, satellites, aircraft, drones, and almost every military capability,\" he added. Read moreSeparately, Wade Senti, president of Florida-based magnet maker Advanced Magnet Lab, said the only way to deliver on alternative supply chains is to be innovative.\"The demand for non-China sourced rare earth permanent magnets is skyrocketing,\" Senti told CNBC by email. \"The challenge is can United States magnet producers create a fully domestic (non-China) supply chain for these magnets. This requires the magnet manufacturer to take the lead and bring the supply chain together – from mine to magnet to customers,\" he added.",

    "body": "Jonathan Ross, chief executive officer of Groq Inc., during the GenAI Summit in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, May 30, 2024. David Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia has agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash, according to Alex Davis, CEO of Disruptive, which led the startup's latest financing round in September. Davis, whose firm has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq since the company was founded in 2016, said the deal came together quickly. Groq raised $750 million at a valuation of about $6.9 billion three months ago. Investors in the round included Blackrock and Neuberger Berman, as well as Samsung, Cisco, Altimeter and 1789 Capital, where Donald Trump Jr. is a partner. Groq said in a blog post on Wednesday that it's \"entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with Nvidia for Groq's inference technology,\" without disclosing a price. With the deal, Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the post said. Groq added that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards as CEO. Colette Kress, Nvidia's CFO, declined comment on the transaction. Davis told CNBC that Nvidia is getting all of Groq's assets, though its nascent Groq cloud business is not part of the transaction. Groq said, \"GroqCloud will continue to operate without interruption.\"The deal represents by far Nvidia's largest purchase ever. The chipmaker's biggest acquisition to date came in 2019, when it bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023. In an email to employees that was obtained by CNBC, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said the agreement will expand Nvidia's capabilities.\"We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture, extending the platform to serve an even broader range of AI inference and real-time workloads,\" Huang wrote. Huang added that, \"While we are adding talented employees to our ranks and licensing Groq's IP, we are not acquiring Groq as a company.\"Nvidia orchestrated a similar but smaller deal in September, when it shelled out over $900 million to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time. Other tech giants, including Meta, Google and Microsoft, have spent heavily over the last couple years to hire top AI talent through various types of licensing deals. watch nowNvidia has ramped up its investments in chip startups and the broader ecosystem as its cash pile has mounted. The company has backed AI and energy infrastructure company Crusoe, AI model developer Cohere, and boosted its investment in CoreWeave as the AI-centric cloud provider was getting ready to go public this year.In September, Nvidia said it intended to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, with the startup committed to deploying at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia products. The companies have yet to announce a formal deal. That same month, Nvidia said it would invest $5 billion in Intel as part of a partnership.Groq has been targeting revenue of $500 million this year amid booming demand for AI accelerator chips used in speeding up the process for large language models to complete inference-related tasks. The company was not pursuing a sale when it was approached by Nvidia, Davis said.Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing unit, or TPU, the search giant's custom chip that's being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In its initial filing with the SEC, announcing a $10.3 million fundraising in late 2016, Groq listed as principals Ross and Douglas Wightman, an entrepreneur and former engineer at the Google X \"moonshot factory.\" Wightman left Groq in 2019, according to his LinkedIn profile. Groq isn't the only chip startup that's gained traction during the AI boom.AI chipmaker Cerebras Systems had planned to go public this year but withdrew its IPO filing in October  after announcing that it raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round.In a filing with the SEC, Cerebras said it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering \"at this time,\" but didn't provide a reason. A spokesperson told CNBC at the time that the company still hopes to go public as soon as possible.Cerebras filed for an IPO in late 2024, as it was ramping up to take on Nvidia in an effort to create processors for running generative AI models. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowU.S. shoppers are willing to spend this holiday season — despite falling consumer confidence and anxiety over prices — but only if the deals are there, Tanger CEO Stephen Yalof told CNBC on Tuesday.\"Retailers are discounting to meet the consumer, and the consumer is responding by shopping,\" Yalof said on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" Yalof said Tanger tries to offer shoppers access to premium brands at prices that feel consistently compelling. Retailers across the company's outlet portfolio leaned heavily into promotions during the holidays, helping sustain traffic and sales.Customers are \"looking to come into a space where they can buy products at full price, maybe above the price point they want to spend, but they can embrace that price point because they know it's value priced every day,\" Yalof said.He described holiday traffic at Tanger's outlet centers as strong, citing full parking lots and steady activity through November and December.\"I feel like the customer is very resilient,\" he said. \"They're looking to spend.\"Yalof's comments come on the heels of fresh data showing that consumers are spending more than their confidence levels might suggest.U.S. retail spending rose 4.2% year over year during the holiday season, before adjusting for inflation, according to preliminary data from Visa released Tuesday. The report, which tracks payments activity beginning Nov. 1, found that in-store shopping accounted for 73% of spending, while online sales drove growth, rising 7.8% from a year earlier.At the same time, sentiment remains subdued. Consumer confidence weakened in December as Americans grew more anxious about persistently high prices and the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1, down from an upwardly revised 92.9 in November and nearing the 85.7 level seen in April, when the administration rolled out broad import duties on U.S. trading partners.Likewise, the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, released last week, found that 41% of Americans planned to spend less this holiday season, up 6 points from a year ago, as higher prices continued to shape where and how shoppers spend. Looking ahead, Yalof said retailers appear confident about demand in 2026.\"Retailers want stores. They love bricks and mortar,\" Yalof said, adding that brands are increasingly looking to control their own physical retail presence as department stores continue to consolidate.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms that include FAST channels like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "When Chelsea Hirschhorn started her company, she didn't buy into the expectations of how a \"traditional founder\" would approach the business, she says. According to Hirschhorn, the founder and CEO of Frida, a fertility, pregnancy and infant product company, \"a lot of founders are celebrated for going fast and breaking things.\" However, her approach to building Frida was \"a little bit more measured,\" she told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on the latest episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast.Her penchant for \"organization and thoughtfulness\" doesn't hold her back, said Hirschhorn, a 2025 CNBC Changemaker. In fact, she considers it her superpower as a leader.Still, before launching Frida, Hirschhorn had to learn how to get comfortable with taking on new challenges.\"From a career perspective, I'm very ambitious,\" she said, but prior to starting her company, she described herself as \"pretty risk-averse.\"Hirschhorn worked as a bankruptcy attorney before she launched Frida. After a neighbor gifted her a NoseFrida, a Swedish nasal aspirator designed for babies, Hirschhorn saw potential in the product and decided to buy the neighbor's business selling the devices.In 2014, Hirschhorn launched Frida with the NoseFrida as its flagship product.It was a difficult decision for Hirschhorn to leave her previous career, she said, and she \"needed a lot of encouragement\" from her husband, who now serves as the president of Frida, to take the leap. True to form, Hirschhorn took a careful approach to scaling her business, and she decided from the beginning not to raise venture capital funding to build Frida.  Rapid growth was \"never our objective,\" she said.\"I approached the business building with a level of practicality and a measured pace, I think, that is not necessarily a reflection of a traditional founder,\" she said.That approach, along with a level of \"comfort with bucking the trend,\" have been consistent threads in her story as a founder, Hirschhorn said – and it helped her build a \"winning strategy\" for the company.How her leadership philosophy has developedHirschhorn described her current leadership style as \"empathic, transparent\" and \"informed by the stage of life that I'm in,\" she told Boorstin.When Hirschhorn first launched Frida, she was \"singularly focused on building the actual foundation for the business\" and prioritized \"achieving certain milestones\" in Frida's growth trajectory, she said.She led \"with the expectation that other people sort of follow my lead as far as the rigor and the work ethic and the commitment,\" she said.Since then, her leadership philosophy has \"evolved meaningfully,\" she told Boorstin. Today, she prioritizes empathy and strives to be \"comprehensive in my understanding of different people's motivations.\"Her leadership style has also been informed by her experiences as a working mother, she said.Hirschhorn is aware of \"the dynamics that mothers face and the trade off and sacrifice of personal and professional ambitions and time management,\" so she offers perks like weekly manicures and haircuts for her team. From the outside, those perks may not seem \"that significant or meaningful,\" she said, but they represent her commitment to prioritizing well-being.Follow and listen to every episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast on Apple and Spotify.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Many entry-level workers are having a tougher time finding jobs these days. LinkedIn is sharing one tip that could help.The professional networking site published a list of its predictions for 2026 on Dec. 16. One proclaims, \"The best career move for entry-level workers will be to start small.\" It predicts small businesses, defined as those with fewer than 250 employees, will be \"the top destination for young jobseekers in 2026.\"\"When you look at who's hiring by company size, what we're seeing is that small businesses still offer a lot of advantages for entry-level workers,\" Karin Kimbrough, LinkedIn's chief economist, tells CNBC Make It. Small companies account for a large proportion of the workforce domestically and globally. The World Bank Group estimates small and medium enterprises constitute roughly 90% of all businesses and are responsible for more than 50% of global employment, as LinkedIn notes in its prediction. Entry-level and early-career workers also tend to make up a higher proportion of the workforce at small businesses than at larger firms. \"When you think of opportunities, that's the best way to start,\" Kimbrough says. \"That's where a lot of opportunity lies.\"The picture for entry-level workers has been bleak in recent years. Entry-level hiring is down 23% from March 2020, compared to an 18% decline in overall hiring over the same period, according to a May LinkedIn report.As of September 2025, the unemployment rate for both 20- to 24-year-old high school graduates without college degrees and 20- to 24-year-old college graduates with a bachelor's degree was 9.7%, according to data from the Federal Reserve, more than double the overall unemployment rate of 4.4% that month.\"You're facing a challenging job market where there are more applications for every job out there,\" Kimbrough says. \"Small businesses are the best on-ramp right now.\"At very big employers, the average share of entry-level workers is \"flat or shrinking,\" according to an October LinkedIn report on entry-level hiring. For workers just starting out, what matters is getting experience, regardless of the company's size, Kimbrough says.\"What's most important for new grads is getting their foot in the door,\" she says. \"If you're not getting traction in a very large company that isn't hiring as much as they used to, don't forget the small companies that are all around you.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Whether it from unexpected expenses or increased costs, many Americans say they are ending this year in a worse financial situation than last.Nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, and 24% say their credit scores took a hit in 2025, according to a survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults released Dec. 16 by Intuit Credit Karma, a personal finance platform. That's not surprising, says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. \"The cumulative effects of higher prices and higher interest rates have weighed on people,\" and it's showing up in data as well, Rossman says, citing increased late payment rates on loans, known as delinquencies.Yet, he says it's important to have a good credit score, not just because it allows you to access loans and credit cards, but also because landlords, utility companies, cell phone providers and even some employers may review your credit to assess your financial trustworthiness.If your credit score has taken a hit this year, there isn't much you can do to erase your history, but Rossman says there are steps you can take to rebuild your credit. Going forward, \"try to fill your report with positive info,\" he says.Strategies to increase your credit scoreHere are some examples of how you can add positive information to your credit report, according to Rossman:Pay off your balanceMake on-time paymentsHave someone add you as an authorized user on their accountSign up for alternative data reporting programsConsider credit-building productsThe first and best things you can do to increase your credit score are pay off your balance and make on-time payments going forward, Rossman says. Making multiple payments per period to keep your debts low can also boost your score, he adds.From there, consider asking someone with better credit, such as a family member, to add you as an authorized user on their credit card, he says. As an authorized user, the main account's positive payment history, age and low utilization can appear on your credit report, helping \"piggyback\" their good credit to boost your score, Rossman says.You could also sign up for alternative data reporting programs that report on-time rent, utility or subscription payments to credit bureaus, Rossman says, or look into safe credit-building products, like a secured credit card or credit-builder loan.Products that build credit can help if used correctly, but they also come with costs, potential negative reporting and limited impact in some credit scoring models. It's wise to compare costs and understand what is actually reported and to which bureaus, Rossman says.With any of these steps, it comes down to managing your cash flow and keeping the balance on your credit cards low, a metric called credit utilization, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia. Like paying off your balances, keeping your credit utilization low is another way to show lenders you can manage credit responsibly, which can help improve your credit score.\"Look at how much cash you have coming in and see where you can utilize some of the cash you have to lower the balance on some of the larger balances you may have,\" Tsantes says. \"That's going to lower your utilization and increase your credit.\" Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "watch nowCitadel plans to return about $5 billion in profits earned in 2025 back to investors at the beginning of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The firm's flagship multistrategy fund, known as Wellington, gained 9.3% in the year through last week, the person said, who asked not to be named discussing performance details. The profit being returned is not all that was generated in 2025, the person said, but rather, a way of constraining capital to better match what the firm sees as the opportunity set going into the new year. As such, Citadel will start 2026 with $67 billion in assets, down from the $72 billion it currently manages, the person said. A spokesperson for Citadel declined to comment. The firm does not opt for profit distributions every year, but since 2017 (and including what's expected to be given back this year), Citadel has returned $32 billion in profit to its investors. Citadel has been ranked the most profitable hedge fund based on net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Through 2024, Citadel has generated $83 billion in net gains since it was founded in 1990. It is anticipated that number will jump to more than $88 billion when the new rankings come out in January.",

Kim Hong-ji | ReutersShares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. watch nowLast week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the new frigate class would be part of Trump's envisioned \"Golden Fleet.\"Trump on Monday stateside said that the U.S. Navy will build two new \"Trump-class\" battleships, and may expand the count to as much as 25 such ships. The U.S. president described the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" adding that the they will \"help maintain American military supremacy, [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"Describing them as \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,\" the Trump-class battleships are envisioned to be equipped with hypersonic weapons, lasers, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons, according to the U.S. President.",

Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesHoliday road-trippers are feeling some relief at the pump this year.The average price of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. has been below $3 a gallon for most of the month — the lowest level since 2021, according to AAA. The association said it's shaping up to be the cheapest December for drivers filling up their tanks going back to the pandemic year of 2020.Fuel prices are down about 7% from a month ago, AAA data shows, and have tumbled roughly 43% from mid-2022 highs near $5 a gallon that followed runaway inflation in the wake of the pandemic.The latest slide in prices comes as AAA forecasts a record of more than 122 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home in the 13 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 1. AAA found nearly nine of 10 people on the move during the period — or close to 110 million — are expected to travel by car.The drop in pump prices may help mitigate the impact of lingering inflation elsewhere during the holiday season.Just over 40% of those polled said they planned to spend less at the holidays this year, a 6-point increase from a year ago, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey. Of those who are pinching pennies, 46% blamed the high cost of goods.The national average masks wide, regional variances, as Hawaii and California both recorded average gas prices above $4 on Monday. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, a gallon came in just below $2.30.",

    "body": "Gold and silver have rallied this year — and prices keep climbing.Gold futures for February delivery rose settled 0.8% higher at $4,505.7, after hitting a record of $4,530.80 per ounce. Spot gold was up 1.04% to $4,491.68 per ounce. Meanwhile silver futures for March advanced 4.59% and was last seen at $71.71 per ounce, while spot silver was last trading at $71.22, up 3.19%. Spot silver crossed $70 for the first time earlier in the session.   The metals have soared this year, smashing consecutive price records as sentiment shook on riskier assets amid fears of an AI bubble and uncertainty over the next Federal Reserve chair looking into 2026. Gold is typically viewed as a safe bet in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty and is often used as a hedge.watch nowThe futures prices represent a fresh highs for the metals, topping Monday's record-breaking moves. David Neuhauser, CIO at Livermore Partners, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" that gold has more room to run — potentially hitting $6,000 per ounce. \"I think all metals, for the most part, are rising because they have been under-owned and there's a further risk that global debt around the world is just exploding, and therefore you need to own assets which will defend against that debasement. That's what you're seeing now. It's loud and clear, but it could continue for some time to come,\" Neuhauser said. ",

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates quickly enough, even though the U.S. economy grew at a much faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter.Hassett, a leading contender to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, said the artificial intelligence boom is boosting economic growth while simultaneously putting downward pressure on inflation. \"If you look at central banks around the world, the U.S. is way behind the curve in terms of lowering rates,\" the top White House economic advisor told CNBC in a \"Money Movers\" interview.U.S. economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, faster than the Dow Jones consensus of 3.2%. Hassett said 1.5% of that growth was due to President Donald Trump's tariffs reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, the third cut this year, but the central bank indicated that the pace of future reductions could be slower. Three Fed governors voted against the quarter-point move, the most dissents since 2019. After this month's meeting, Powell said the decision to cut a quarter point was a \"close call.\" Trump has repeatedly bashed the Fed for not lowering rates as quickly as he would like. Hassett's candidacy has raised concerns among some Fed watchers that he is too close to the president.Hassett told CNBC last week that the Fed's independence is \"really important.\" Trump said in an address to the nation last week that he will announce his nominee for Fed chair soon, emphasizing that he will pick \"someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot.\"The president's prime-time speech focused on affordability. His approval rating on the economy stood at 37% in a CBS News/YouGov published Sunday. When asked about Trump's sagging approval rating, Hassett said public sentiment often does not reflect the economic numbers. \"In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing,  their glimpse of the outside world,\" Hassett said.

    "body": "This story is part of CNBC Make It's Millennial Money series, which examines how people earn, spend and save their money.Nabeel Khan knew he wanted to be an entrepreneur early in life.In high school, Khan hired \"12 of the smartest kids I could find,\" he says, and co-founded an AP tutoring company. They charged between $20 and $50 per hour and made \"about $5,000\" within the first month, he says. He says he loved the challenge of working in customer service and balancing costs and earnings.The now-27-year-old went on to study materials science and engineering at the University of Michigan, thinking he might dive into the world of sports equipment after college. But over time, he says he realized he could have a bigger impact as an entrepreneur in the tech world. When he graduated in 2020, Khan accepted an offer as an operations manager at an Amazon warehouse, which became an entryway into tech. While his initial offer as an operations manager was for $50,000 per year, within five years, Khan says he was working as a senior AI product manager at the company earning $432,000 per year, including base pay and company stock. Khan left Amazon in July 2025 to pursue entrepreneurship and co-founded SkillAxis, which creates AI product managers for non-tech companies. His quick rise at Amazon and the savings he amassed enabled his departure, he says.Here's how he built his career at the tech giant and made the transition to entrepreneurship, and a look at his life in Brooklyn, New York, where he currently lives with his girlfriend.Khan looked for mentors and built out his skillsAt Amazon, Khan immediately began looking into how he could grow in the company, specifically in roles that would contribute to his dream of becoming an entrepreneur. He discovered the roles of project manager and product manger, both of which would be promotions and teach him skills like managing people and designing products.To learn more about how to get hired for those roles, Khan looked for mentors who held them both within Amazon and outside of it. He says each mentor gave him advice about which skills he would need to get hired, as well as specific project ideas for how he could prove he had what it took to move forward.Khan in his apartment building in Brooklyn, New York.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItKhan created an educational road map for himself and says he would spend evenings and weekends working on gaining new skills he hoped would help him get promoted. For example, he spent six months taking a software bootcamp class from the Georgia Institute of Technology to learn how to code, he says, and got certified in Amazon Web Services. He also looked for opportunities to practice and gain new skills while in his current job. In his role as an operations manager, for example, he helped update the safety system in the warehouse, which helped build his portfolio to become a project manager. \"I was always finding ways to be creative about the role that I was currently in, going above and beyond to find ways that I could apply that next role,\" Khan says. By mid-2021, Khan was promoted to project manager, earning $66,000 a year. By mid-2023, he moved into a product manager role, earning $146,000, and by 2025, he was a senior product manager earning $432,000. Building up $666,000 in savings and investmentsWhile at Amazon, Khan says he saved upwards of 80% of his income, accruing around $666,000 by the time he left between his various savings, investment and retirement accounts. In part, it's why he felt comfortable leaving, he says. He knew if anything went awry, he'd have a financial cushion to fall back on.During that time, he primarily held positions that were either remote or required a lot of travel, enabling him to save money on housing. Instead of having a home base where he paid rent, he split time between his parents' home in Georgia and his girlfriend's home in New York in between work trips.Khan at a local bodega.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItWhen he finally made the leap to becoming an entrepreneur, Khan first lived off of his savings.Between July and November 2025, SkillAxis brought in about $51,000 in sales. He now pays himself about $5,000 per month from the company to cover his living expenses.He keeps his expenses to about $5,000 per monthAside from having built up a financial cushion, Khan left Amazon in July because as he plans for his future, he says this is his window to make a big career swing. Khan lives with his girlfriend in a one-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn. Here's how he spent his money in October. Nabeel Khan's spending breakdown in October 2025.Alisa Stern | CNBC Make ItRent: $2,125Food: $1,238 for groceries and dining outTransportation: $899 for the subway and rideshares Health insurance: $289Business expenses: $198 for a Filmic Pro subscription and travelSubscriptions: $143 for his two gym memberships, his Wall Street Journal subscription, Spotify, iCloud and Google DriveDiscretionary: $93 for laundry and entertainmentKhan and his girlfriend split their rent 50/50, and his girlfriend has a stipend from law school, which covers their Wi-Fi and various utilities. Khan is still on his family's phone plan, which covers his phone bill. He's already paid off his student loans — around $50,000 worth — and currently has no credit card debt.Despite Khan's history of saving, he's not currently contributing to his savings as he builds his business. He says he'll resume saving money in the future after his company grows. As of early November 2025, his net worth is about $703,000, including his checking accounts, savings, investments, retirement accounts, cryptocurrency and a couple of watches, worth around $6,000 each. Khan in his apartment.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItAs a kid, Khan says he remembers seeing his dad watch a commercial for an Omega watch and comment about how nice it would be to own one. Once Khan made enough at Amazon, \"I ended up getting one for him,\" he says.'Be creative about what you can do in your current environment'Going forward, \"my financial goal is to have an overall net worth of $1 million by the time I'm 30,\" Khan says. He wants to enter his 30s with more financial stability. To get there, he'll double down on making sure his company is successful by identifying gaps in software tools and letting the market guide them to build the solutions their clients need, he says.For anyone who wants to try and copy his career growth, \"just be creative about what you can do in your current environment,\" he says. If you find ways to go above and beyond your job description, \"you'll end up benefiting yourself and your reputation wherever you are.\"Khan at an event.Zachary Green | Marisa Forziati | CNBC Make ItKhan currently spends about 80 hours per week working, and the rest working out and seeing the people he cares about most. \"A successful life to me is one that balances work as well as time with family and friends,\" he says.But big picture, he is happy with the balance he's struck in life. Between building his company and spending time with his family and friends, \"I think I'm living my dream life right now,\" he says.What's your budget breakdown? Share your story with us for a chance to be featured in a future installment.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. By law, borrowers must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on Monday rebuked President Donald Trump's appointment of a special envoy to Greenland, the U.S. president's latest move in his long-running effort to acquire the autonomous island territory of Denmark. \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlandic people, and territorial integrity must be respected,\" Nielsen said in a statement. \"We are happy to cooperate with other countries, including the United States, but this must always take place with respect for us and for our values and wishes.\"Trump on Sunday appointed Louisiana Republican Gov. Jeff Landry to the new envoy post. He said Landry understands \"how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.\"Landry, in a post on his X account, thanked Trump for the appointment and said, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationIn a follow-up post on Monday, Landry reiterated that he will not be leaving his post as Louisiana governor and detailed his role. \"All we're gonna do is go have us a great conversation with those folks in Greenland,\" Landry said. Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland from Denmark, first floating the idea in his first term due to the island's strategic location and rich mineral bounty. He made a push again for the island when he was elected in 2024, but was rebuked by both Greenland and Denmark despite dispatching Vice President J.D. Vance to the island in March.The Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on Monday said that he was \"deeply upset\" by Landry's appointment and that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark over it.

    "body": "A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 airplane arrives at Los Angeles International Airport from San Francisco on March 28, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.  Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines' profit fell 42% in the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2024. But its stock has been on a tear.Shares of Southwest are up nearly 24% so far in 2025, more than any other U.S. passenger carrier. Industry profit leaders Delta Air Lines and United Airlines have risen about 17% each this year.Southwest stock this week hit a 2½ year high. Analysts and investors have high hopes for the carrier next year, when it completes its planned transformation from a one-size-all-fits airline to one that looks more like its larger rivals.\"What's helping Southwest's stock is clearly the initiatives, not the [demand] environment, because if it was you'd see it in all the other stocks as well,\" said Savanthi Syth, airline analyst at Raymond James.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSouthwest Airlines stock compared with the NYSE Arca Airline indexStarting Jan. 27, Southwest is ditching open seating and moving to assigned seats on its all-Boeing 737 fleet. The first rows of seats have extra legroom — for a fee. Seat prices vary, but, for example, a Baltimore to Las Vegas flight in early February showed the seats going for about $80 each way. Southwest in October forecast that assigned seating and extra legroom seats could drive $1 billion in pretax earnings next year and $1.5 billion in pretax earnings in 2027.\"Because the assigned seating, the extra legroom, kicks in and there's a lot of value in that, of course, [results are] going to be better year over year,\" Southwest CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC on Dec. 10. \"The bookings that we're seeing reflect the business case for assigned seating and extra legroom.\"Barclays upgraded Southwest's stock earlier this month, with transportation analyst Brandon Oglenski forecasting Southwest's adjusted earnings will be above $4 per share next year and surpass $6 per share in 2027.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesThe end of the cattle call boarding lineup comes months after the Dallas carrier got rid of another decades-old policy: two free checked bags for customers. It also started selling its first-ever no-frills basic economy fares.Southwest, like other airlines, cut its profit forecast for 2025 after demand dipped early this year as President Donald Trump's tariffs and cost cutting in Washington weighed on bookings. More recently, the government shutdown that ended last month hurt demand prompting Southwest to again lower its earnings outlook for the year.Southwest typically provides its yearly outlook alongside the previous year's earnings in late January.",

    "body": "watch nowU.S. shoppers are willing to spend this holiday season — despite falling consumer confidence and anxiety over prices — but only if the deals are there, Tanger CEO Stephen Yalof told CNBC on Tuesday.\"Retailers are discounting to meet the consumer, and the consumer is responding by shopping,\" Yalof said on CNBC's \"Money Movers.\" Yalof said Tanger tries to offer shoppers access to premium brands at prices that feel consistently compelling. Retailers across the company's outlet portfolio leaned heavily into promotions during the holidays, helping sustain traffic and sales.Customers are \"looking to come into a space where they can buy products at full price, maybe above the price point they want to spend, but they can embrace that price point because they know it's value priced every day,\" Yalof said.He described holiday traffic at Tanger's outlet centers as strong, citing full parking lots and steady activity through November and December.\"I feel like the customer is very resilient,\" he said. \"They're looking to spend.\"Yalof's comments come on the heels of fresh data showing that consumers are spending more than their confidence levels might suggest.U.S. retail spending rose 4.2% year over year during the holiday season, before adjusting for inflation, according to preliminary data from Visa released Tuesday. The report, which tracks payments activity beginning Nov. 1, found that in-store shopping accounted for 73% of spending, while online sales drove growth, rising 7.8% from a year earlier.At the same time, sentiment remains subdued. Consumer confidence weakened in December as Americans grew more anxious about persistently high prices and the impact of President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs. The Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 3.8 points to 89.1, down from an upwardly revised 92.9 in November and nearing the 85.7 level seen in April, when the administration rolled out broad import duties on U.S. trading partners.Likewise, the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, released last week, found that 41% of Americans planned to spend less this holiday season, up 6 points from a year ago, as higher prices continued to shape where and how shoppers spend. Looking ahead, Yalof said retailers appear confident about demand in 2026.\"Retailers want stores. They love bricks and mortar,\" Yalof said, adding that brands are increasingly looking to control their own physical retail presence as department stores continue to consolidate.",

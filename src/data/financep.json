    "body": "Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBeyond Meat shares slashed gains Wednesday, briefly dipping into negative territory as the meme stock rally faltered.The food company known for its plant-based burgers and sausages rose just 15% in midday trading Wednesday, after surging 112% at one point in the session. The stock reached a high of $7.69 during the session, after closing Tuesday at $3.62. It was last above $4, up 14%.It's the latest in an extraordinary week for the company. On Monday, the stock rallied more than 127% after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).That decision appeared to have the added effect of driving a short squeeze in the stock, as investors rushed to cover their positions. According to FactSet data, more than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short.On Tuesday, Beyond Meat soared 146% in its best day ever, after saying it will expand distribution at Walmart's stores.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, year-to-date performanceShares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time. After making its public debut in 2019, when the name soared past $230 per share, it has since become a penny stock. The shares have slid in each of the last five years, falling more than 47% in 2021, 81% in 2022, 27% in 2023, and 57% in 2024. The name is down more than 3% in 2025.The latest bad news for the stock came last week, when shares tumbled more than 67% to end the week at just 65 cents after Beyond Meat said it has finalized a debt deal.This week's comeback, however, is reminiscent of the height of the pandemic, when retail traders took on online message boards such as Reddit's WallStreetBets to coordinate moves behind high-risk, aggressive trades.In 2021, Bank of America said Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock to watch, though it ended that same year with losses.The return of Beyond Meat could be the latest signal of a frothy market, one that is relentlessly climbing higher in spite of concerns around elevated valuations and a possible artificial intelligence bubble. Indeed, Roundhill shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest. It revived it earlier this month as retail traders dove back into the bull market.In response to someone on WallStreetBets saying they bought 10,000 shares of Beyond Meat for $7.50, one commenter wrote Wednesday, \"Youre already down 7k, impressive.\"Another posted: \"You know the economy is cooked when BYND stock is making a comeback.\"",

    "body": "Demolition of a section of the East Wing of the White House, during construction on the new ballroom extension of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Aaron Schartz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe entire East Wing of the White House will be demolished to make room for the massive ballroom that President Donald Trump is building, The New York Times reported Wednesday, citing a senior administration official.The demolition work should be completed by this weekend, the official told the Times.A White House official told CNBC that \"the entire East Wing is undergoing modernization and renovation.\"Trump had promised in July that the East Wing's structure would not be touched to build the $250 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom.\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said at the time.Images showing the demolition of part of the East Wing triggered public anger this week.The White House on Tuesday dismissed the furor as \"manufactured outrage\" and called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.The Treasury Department this week banned its staff from sharing photos of the East Wing, calling it a potential security risk. The department is located next to the White House with a clear view of the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will cover the costs of the ballroom. But it is still unclear who all the contributors are and how much they have agreed to pay for the project.\"The White House Ballroom is being privately funded by many generous Patriots, Great American Companies, and, yours truly,\" the president said in a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday.Tech giant Alphabet is contributing $22 million to help build the ballroom under a legal settlement reached with Trump last month over his being banned from the company's YouTube platform after the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot by his supporters.A demolition crew takes apart the facade of the East Wing of the White House, where U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed ballroom is being built, in Washington, D.C., October 21, 2025.  Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Google parent Alphabet's contribution in the form of the settlement, which was recorded in Oakland, California, federal court, represents nearly 10% of the estimated construction costs.The settlement notes that the $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf \"to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom.\"Lockheed Martin confirmed to CNBC that it is contributing to the project, but declined to disclose the size of its donation.\"Lockheed Martin is grateful for the opportunity to help bring the President's vision to reality and make this addition to the People's House, a powerful symbol of the American ideals we work to defend every day,\" a company spokesperson saidSources told CBS News in September that R.J. Reynolds, Booz Allen Hamilton, Palantir and NextEra Energy have also donated. CNBC has requested comment from those companies.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom. It is not clear how much Comcast is contributing. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company, Versant.Trump selected McCrery Architects to design the ballroom. The construction team is led by Clark Construction, and the engineering team is headed by AECOM, the White House said in July.",

    "body": "Steve Wozniak, co-founder of the technology company Apple.Thomas Banneyer | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesA group of prominent figures, including artificial intelligence and technology experts, has called for an end to efforts to create 'superintelligence' — a form of AI that would surpass humans on essentially all cognitive tasks. Over 850 people, including tech leaders like Virgin Group founder Richard Branson and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak, signed a statement published Wednesday calling for a pause in the development of superintelligence. The list of signatories was notably topped by prominent AI pioneers, including the computer scientists Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton, who are widely considered \"godfathers\" of modern AI. Leading AI researchers like UC Berkeley's Stuart Russell also signed on. Superintelligence has become a buzzword in the AI world, as companies from Elon Musk's xAI to Sam Altman's OpenAI compete to release more advanced large language models. Meta notably has gone so far as to name its LLM division the 'Meta Superintelligence Labs.' But signatories of the recent statement warn that the prospect of superintelligence has \"raised concerns, ranging from human economic obsolescence and disempowerment, losses of freedom, civil liberties, dignity, and control, to national security risks and even potential human extinction.\"It called for a ban on developing superintelligence until there is strong public support for the technology and a scientific consensus that it can be built and controlled safely.In addition to AI and tech figures, the names behind the statement came from a broad coalition ranging from academics, media personalities, religious leaders and a bipartisan group of former U.S. politicians and officials. Those retired officials included former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen and former National Security Advisor Susan Rice.Meanwhile, Steve Bannon and Glenn Beck — influential media allies to U.S. President Donald Trump — were also prominently featured on the list.Chief Strategist to the President Steve Bannon speaks during the Semafor World Economy Summit 2025 at Conrad Washington on April 23, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesOther high-profile signatories included the British royal family members Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, as well as former president of Ireland Mary Robinson. As of Wednesday, the list was still growing.AI doomers versus AI boomersThere has been a growing divide in the tech space between those who see AI as a powerful force for good, warranting unfettered development, and those who believe it's dangerous and in need of more regulation. However, as noted by the 'Statement on Superintelligence' signatory website, even the leaders of the world's leading artificial intelligence companies, such as Musk and Altman, have, in the past, warned about the dangers of superintelligence. Before becoming CEO of OpenAI, Altman wrote in a 2015 blog post that \"development of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.\"watch nowMeanwhile, Elon Musk said on a podcast earlier this year that there was \"only a 20% chance of annihilation\" when discussing the risks of advanced AI surpassing human intelligence. The 'Statement on Superintelligence' cited a recent survey from the Future of Life Institute showing that only 5% of U.S. adults support \"the status quo of fast, unregulated\" superintelligence development. The survey of 2,000 American adults also found that a majority believe \"superhuman AI\" shouldn't be created until proven safe or controllable and want robust regulation on advanced AI. In a statement provided on the site, computer scientist Bengio said AI systems could surpass most individuals in most cognitive tasks within a few years. He added that while such advances could help solve global challenges, they also carry significant risks.\"To safely advance toward superintelligence, we must scientifically determine how to design AI systems that are fundamentally incapable of harming people, whether through misalignment or malicious use,\" he said. \"We also need to make sure the public has a much stronger say in decisions that will shape our collective future.\"",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.The company announced the cuts in a memo from its chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit and other product-related positions will be impacted.Axios was first to report the layoffs.Meta notified at least some employees on Wednesday that Nov. 21 is their termination date and, until then, they're in a \"non-working notice period.\"\"During this time, your internal access will be removed and you do not need to do any additional work for Meta,\" said the message, which was viewed by CNBC. \"You may use this time to search for another role at Meta.\"The company also said it's paying 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, \"minus your notice period.\"Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a \"significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.— CNBC's Jonathan Vanian and Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this reportWATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

    "body": "Ranchers Duke Phillips III, prepares to rope a calf during the final branding at Chico Basin Ranch in Hanover, Colorado on June 29, 2024. Helen H. Richardson | MediaNews Group | The Denver Post | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said U.S. cattle ranchers \"don't understand\" how they have benefitted from his tariffs, adding that they \"have to get their prices down.\"The admonition came after some ranchers have openly criticized Trump's proposal to import beef from Argentina in order to bring down prices for American consumers.Trump claimed that those ranchers \"don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States.\"He highlighted the 50% tariff he imposed in early August on imports from Brazil, one of the top sellers of beef to the U.S.\"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years — Terrible!\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\"It would be nice if they would understand that, but they also have to get their prices down, because the consumer is a very big factor in my thinking, also!\" he added.Beef prices in the U.S. have generally risen since last year, and some products, such as boneless sirloin steaks, have shot up by double-digit percentages, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Trump told reporters on Sunday that his administration is \"thinking about doing\" a deal with Argentina in which \"we would buy some beef\" from the South American nation.\"If we do that, that will bring our beef prices down,\" he said.The comments drew swift rebukes from U.S. cattle ranchers.watch now\"This plan only creates chaos at a critical time of the year for American cattle producers, while doing nothing to lower grocery store prices,\" National Cattlemen's Beef Association CEO Colin Woodall said in a statement on Monday.In response to Trump's Truth Social post on Wednesday, Woodall said that his organization \"cannot stand behind the President while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers by importing Argentinian beef in an attempt to influence prices.\"\"It is imperative that President Trump and Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins let the cattle markets work,\" Woodall said.At least one Republican senator, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, has openly pushed back on Trump's proposal.\"Government intervention in the beef market will hurt our cattle ranchers,\" she wrote in an X post Tuesday.Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said Tuesday that \"a lot\" of Republican senators have told Trump that they do not want Argentine beef imported to the U.S.The U.S. financial relationship with Argentina has come under heavy scrutiny after the Trump administration agreed to a $20 billion currency swap deal to help stabilize the country's teetering economy. Trump is a close ally of Argentina President Javier Milei, whose aggressive deregulation efforts have been celebrated by American conservatives. American soybean farmers and their advocates have slammed the financial lifeline for Buenos Aires because China, a top buyer of the staple crop, has moved its business from the U.S. to Argentina amid Trump's trade war.Argentina, in a move that coincided with Trump's pledge to help Milei, suspended export taxes last month.\"Why would USA help bail out Argentina while they take American soybean producers' biggest market???\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote on X at the time.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., when asked Wednesday morning about Trump's Argentine beef-buying plan, said there have been some developments \"over the last 24 hours.\" \"The White House doesn't want any unintended consequences.\" Johnson said.— CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons and Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

Each of the banks posted rising hauls from net interest income on lower funding costs, while some of their metrics around credit quality actually improved from previous quarters.The Cantor Group episode forced Western Alliance to review other loans in its note finance portfolio, Vecchione said Wednesday.\"Today we have reverified titles and liens for all notes greater than $10 million and have found no irregularities,\" he said.Analysts grilled Vecchione during the Wednesday call for more details around the bank's loan collateral and lending to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs.\"What are you doing to validate your collateral and safeguard against future frauds?\" Autonomous Research analyst Casey Haire asked. \"It just seems like as long as you're not afraid to go to jail, it seems easy to double pledge collateral.\"Besides the recent review, Western Alliance periodically checks collateral to make sure the bank is still in a position to collect if the loan sours, executives said. Much of the bank's NDFI book is tied to residential mortgages, which Western Alliance considers low-risk, they added.'Can't unsee'Western Alliance is also exposed to another recent blowup, the bankruptcy of the auto parts maker First Brands.But in this case, a loan facility made to a fund managed by a subsidiary of the investment bank Jefferies \"remains current, and we continue to receive principal and interest payments as modeled,\" said Vecchione.While this week's reassurances have calmed markets for now, the sharp selloff in regionals last week is leaving a lasting mark on the industry. Shares of both Western Alliance and Zions plunged on Thursday after the banks disclosed problems with the Cantor Group.Investors are ready to hit \"sell\" on any signs that the losses aren't isolated, and share gains for the group will be capped for the foreseeable future because of these worries, said Timur Braziler, who covers mid-cap banks for Wells Fargo. He cut his recommendation on Western Alliance to \"sell\" on September 29.\"You can't unsee these events,\" Braziler said in an interview. \"The timer for any kind of sustainable outperformance within the regional group has gotten reset once again.\"",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. government shutdown on Wednesday entered its 22nd day, becoming the second-longest federal funding lapse ever, with no end in sight.The milestone means that the two longest shutdowns have both occurred while President Donald Trump was in office.The longest shutdown began in December 2018, in Trump's first term, and dragged on for nearly five weeks. That shutdown stemmed from a dispute about funding Trump's contentious immigration policy.The current shutdown resulted from Senate Democrats refusing to vote for a short-term government funding bill sponsored by Republicans, because it lacks additional spending on health care and other provisions.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

    "body": "Rupert Murdoch looks on, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. Feb. 3, 2025.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersWhy let a $10 billion lawsuit get in the way of old friends having some chicken and gravy for dinner?President Donald Trump last week dined at the White House with Rupert Murdoch and that media baron's key lieutenants, despite Trump's ongoing defamation lawsuit over Murdoch's Wall Street Journal reporting that he sent a \"bawdy\" 50th birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to a new report.Breaker Media on Tuesday night reported that Trump hosted his fellow billionaire Murdoch and company at the White House last Thursday.Guests included Murdoch's wife, Elena Zhukova, New York Post editor Keith Poole and Post columnists Miranda Devine and Douglas Murray, News UK CEO Rebekah Brooks, The Sun editor-at-large Harry Cole, as well as Vice President JD Vance and White House Susie Wiles, Breaker reported. Murdoch's News Corp owns The Post, The Sun, and News UK, along with the Journal.The outlet said the group ate chicken and gravy.Three months before the dinner, Trump, in a social media post, wrote, \"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his 'pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ.\"\"That will be an interesting experience!!!\" the president wrote.CNBC has requested comment on the report from News Corp and the White House. A spokesman for Trump's legal team declined to comment.The reported dinner came five days before Trump's legal team filed a blistering response to a request by Murdoch's lawyers that a federal judge in Miami dismiss the president's defamation lawsuit.That suit is a glaring exception to the often cozy relationship Trump has with Murdoch's conservative media empire, which includes Fox News. The Post and Fox have acted as cheerleaders for Trump and his policies for years, and Trump, for decades, has been an avid reader of and fixture in The Post's tabloid pages.The current dispute stems from a July 17 report by the Journal, which said that a risqué letter bearing Trump's signature was included in an album of letters that Epstein was given for his 50th birthday party in 2003.At the time of the party, Trump was a friend of Epstein. The two later had a falling out; Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump wants $230 million from DOJ for investigating him: NYTWhite House calls Trump ballroom demolition work furor 'manufactured outrage'Trump Jan. 6 pardon recipient accused of threatening to kill Dem leader JeffriesTrump idea to buy beef from Argentina will hurt U.S. ranchers, GOP Sen. warnsTrump can deploy National Guard in Portland, appeals court panel saysU.S. and Australia sign critical minerals agreement with $8.5B project pipelineComey seeks case dismissal, says Trump-picked prosecutor appointed unlawfullyWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

This is a fake thing. It's a fake Wall Street Journal story,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women,\" he said. \"It's not my language. It's not my words.\"Trump also said that he had personally warned Murdoch that Trump would sue him if the Journal printed the story.\"Mr. Murdoch stated that he would take care of it but, obviously, did not have the power to do so,\" Trump claimed on Truth Social.On July 18, Trump sued Murdoch, the Journal, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson, and the two reporters who wrote the article.The lawsuit denied that Trump authored the letter, and that, \"Despite the glaring failures in journalistic ethics and standards of accurate reporting, Defendants Dow Jones and News Corp — at the direction of Defendants Murdoch and Thomson — published to the world the false, defamatory, and malignant statements authored by Defendants.\"Trump has continued denying he wrote the letter even after Democrats in the House of Representatives in early September released a screenshot of the missive that the Journal reported on. The letter was obtained by the House Oversight Committee from Epstein's estate, pursuant to a subpoena.Murdoch's lawyers flagged that letter to the judge overseeing Trump's lawsuit.In their motion to dismiss that case, Murdoch's lawyers said that the article is true, and that the letter released by the House panel contains a \"letter identical to the one described in the Article.\"The lawyers also argued that the article is not defamatory.The motion noted that Trump has acknowledged being a longtime friend of Epstein, and that he was quoted by New York magazine three months before the birthday party, calling Epstein a \"terrific guy\" who \"likes beautiful women as much as I do.\"\"President Trump has also publicly admitted to 'locker room' talk and has made numerous bawdy public statements,\" Murdoch's lawyers wrote.\"The Article is therefore consistent with President Trump's self-described reputation.\"Trump's lawyers, in their response to that motion, called the arguments by Murdoch's lawyers \"disjointed\" and incorrect.\"The Article was fully driven by Defendants' salacious and scandal-driven narratives that prioritize gossip, clicks, and profit over truth,\" Trump's lawyers said.",

    "body": "Mary Barra speaks onstage during WSJ's Future of Everything 2025 at The Glasshouse on May 28, 2025 in New York City.Dia Dipasupil | Getty ImagesNEW YORK — General Motors is targeting a suite of new software initiatives for its vehicles over the next three years, including an in-vehicle artificial intelligence assistant from Google and a driver-assistance system that can largely control the vehicle without human interaction or monitoring.GM said the conversational Google Gemini AI will begin launching in its vehicles next year, followed by the new driver-assistance system, which will allow drivers to be hands-free and take their eyes off the road under certain circumstances, in 2028.GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives made the announcements Wednesday as part of a \"GM Forward\" software event that also showcased other initiatives designed to \"transform the car from a mode of transportation into an intelligent assistant,\" the automaker said.The company also announced that it is working on a new centralized computing platform, which is planned to roll out starting with the Escalade IQ in 2028; increased use of collaborative robots, also known as cobots, that can work alongside humans; and expanding availability of products from its GM Energy business.GM displays its plans for a new centralized computing platform during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025, in New York City.Michael Wayland | CNBC\"Today we'll share our vision for our vehicles, our industry and how we're driving the future of transportation forward,\" Barra said to kick off the event in lower Manhattan.'New era of mobility'GM said the announcements are meant to usher in a \"new era of mobility\" for the company, which has struggled to achieve such initiatives in the past. Its previous efforts included announcing plans in 2021 to double revenue by 2030, led by many now-defunct growth businesses, as well as growing annual software and services revenue to between $20 billion and $25 billion.In recent years, it also killed an \"Ultra Cruise\" system meant to be able to drive in 95% of circumstances that was initially due to come out in 2023 and folded its Cruise robotaxi business.GM executives on Wednesday declined to discuss revenue potential of the new announcements. CFO Paul Jacobson has previously walked back the doubling revenue goal, but has noted the company's growing revenue, up 9.1% last year to $187.44 billion.GM graphic of the automaker's upcoming centralized computing design that's set to debut in the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028.GMGM President Mark Reuss on Wednesday said the company's revenue plans are \"pretty much on track … maybe a year or two different\" as it plans to continue to grow revenue, especially with the technologies announced Wednesday. He also said these initiatives are \"very different\" than prior announcements, as they're tangible products that are entering the market shortly.As of the third quarter of this year, GM recognized $2 billion from software services. That's up from 2021, when the plans were announced and it took the full year to hit that mark. It also cited $5 billion in deferred revenue, up 90% from a year earlier, to end the third quarter.The event comes a day after GM reported standout third-quarter earnings and upped its guidance, pushing the stock to have its second-best day on record since the automaker's 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.GM stock on Wednesday was trading relatively flat.AIGM said the artificial intelligence system from Google, which its infotainment system is developed on, will make \"it possible to talk to your car as naturally as you would to a fellow passenger.\"\"Our vision is to create a car that knows you, that looks out for you, and just meets your needs, even before you say,\" Sterling Anderson, GM chief product officer, said during the event.Anderson called the centralized computing a \"foundational piece\" of the company's plans in increasing the capabilities of its vehicles.GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.Michael Wayland / CNBCThe Detroit automaker said it expects to update select vehicles from the 2016 model year to all new models in the U.S. beginning next year with the AI tech.GM also said it plans to develop its own \"AI, custom-built\" technology in the years to come but did not provide an exact time frame.\"In the future, we will introduce our own AI fine-tuned to your vehicle,\" said David Richardson, a former Apple executive who is now GM vice president of software and services engineering. \"Think of this as an assistant. It's going to anticipate your needs, offer timely help and make every journey more personable and more enjoyable.\"Hands-free, 'eyes-off'GM said it plans for its upgraded advanced driver-assistance system, also known as ADAS, to feature hands-free, \"eyes-off\" driving technology, beginning on the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV, which currently starts around $127,500, in 2028.The automaker then expects to expand the availability of the tech to other models, company executives said.\"Autonomy will make our roads safer. They'll give customers back their most valuable asset: time. It'll be a cornerstone of GM product portfolio going forward,\" Anderson said.Cadillac Escalade IQ with lidarGMThe vehicle will use lidar, or light detection and ranging, systems that allow it to better detect or \"see\" its surroundings. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has notably been a critic of the technology, and his company's vehicles rely on camera-based systems and computer vision.\"Just be clear, we're developing a self driving product,\" Anderson, a former Tesla executive, told CNBC. \"It's an eyes-off, self-driving system. As it relates to use of lidar in it, your product will be better with multiple modes of sensing, period. Full stop.\"Anderson, calling it an \"ocean that's too big to boil,\" said the system is expected to evolve incrementally to its full potential.GM declined to say whether the new technology will be called \"Super Cruise,\" which is its current system that allows drivers to be hands-free on 600,000 miles of pre-mapped roads in North America.The current Super Cruise system monitors a driver's attentiveness through the use of sensors and eye-detection cameras.GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016, but it was slow to roll out the technology until recent years.Barra said the rollout of the new system will be significantly faster than the company's initial expansion of Super Cruise.GM EnergyStarting in 2026, GM said it will make its \"Energy Home System\" — which includes bidirectional electric vehicle charging and a stationary home battery — available via leasing, compared with outright purchasing the equipment.The leasing will begin with GM all-electric vehicles owners and later roll out to other homeowners interested in backup power and solar integration, the company said.GM Energy launched in 2022 as one of the automaker's growth initiatives involving EVs. It was started to rival Tesla's home energy systems and provide battery packs, EV chargers and software to help customers optimize charging and ride out electric grid disruptions.GM has not disclosed the size or revenue of its GM Energy business other than a blog by Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy, that said momentum for its services are growing.\"It's really incredible to see all the great things that are right on the horizon, and I know we will deliver for our customers, and that's what matters most,\" Barra said. \"This moment builds on our history and sets the course.\"",

The fundamentals that have driven the metal to record highs this year will likely persist, according to UBS.

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 15, 2025.Alexander Zemlianichenko | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia scrambled on Wednesday to salvage the prospect of in-person talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin after they were unceremoniously put on hold.Trump said on Tuesday that he didn't want \"to have a wasted meeting\" with Putin, which was set to take place in Hungary in the next few weeks, as it became clear that Russia opposes the idea of an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine.\"I don't want to have a waste of time — so we'll see what happens,\" Trump said following a call on Monday between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.After the call, Russia's top diplomat told reporters in Moscow that he had told Rubio that \"Russia has not changed its position\" since Trump and Putin met in Alaska in August, and that while Moscow wanted a \"lasting and sustainable peace,\" it was not interested in an \"immediate ceasefire that will lead to nothing.\"After those comments, and with Trump seemingly pouring cold water on the idea of meeting Putin again, the Kremlin appeared to go into damage limitation mode, insisting on Wednesday that the dates for the summit in Budapest \"weren't set\" but that preparations were still underway.\"This is yet to be done. Careful preparation is needed before then. Time is needed for that,\" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, told reporters, in comments translated by NBC News.\"There's no news yet; it's clear that all of this is surrounded by a lot of gossip, rumors, and so on. For the most part, they are completely untrue. There's no news yet,\" he added.Another U-turn?The suspension of talks with Russia appears to be yet another U-turn from the U.S. administration, which has seesawed this year over its position on Russia, the Ukraine war and its causes, and its potential resolution.There was more than a whiff of smugness and schadenfreude in Moscow, and Russian state media, last week when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's own in-person talks with Trump last Friday appeared to go badly.Particularly after Russia had effectively undermined the talks by getting in there first, gaining Trump's ear with a \"very productive\" phone call — as Trump described it — that was held with Putin. It was during that call when the leaders agreed to meet in person within a couple of weeks.Trump and his team appeared to vacillate on their support for Ukraine after that call, with Zelenskyy leaving the White House the next day empty handed, with no long-range Tomahawk missiles, as requested, and concerns that it could be pressured to give up occupied territory in eastern Ukraine.US President Donald Trump gestures as he greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives for a meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 17, 2025.Tom Brenner | AFP | Getty ImagesThose fears grew when Trump last weekend called for the partially Russian-occupied region of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in the three-and-a half year war, to be \"cut the way it is.\"\"It's cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,\" the president said on Air Force One on Sunday. \"They should stop right now at the battle lines. ... Go home, stop killing people and be done.\"Read moreUkraine and a group of European allies pushed back against Trump's position, warning in a joint statement Tuesday that Russia was using \"stalling tactics\" to prolong the war. Wary of alienating Trump, however, they were careful to praise his efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table.\"We strongly support President Trump's position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations. We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,\" European leaders noted.Russia blames 'fake news'Now the tables have turned again, Moscow appears to be feeling anxious, with the Kremlin insisting it is serious about ending the war.\"No one wants to waste time. Neither President Trump nor President Putin. These are two presidents who are accustomed to working effectively and efficiently, but effectiveness always requires preparation,\" Peskov stated Wednesday.Various Russian officials in Putin's inner-circle accused media outlets of spreading \"fake news\" about the \"cancellation\" of the Hungary summit in a bid to undermine it.\"Media is twisting comment about the 'immediate future' to undercut the upcoming Summit. Preparations continue,\" Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's investment envoy and CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, commented on the X social network.Russia's President Vladimir Putin (L) and Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev during a meeting with Russian Direct Investment Fund experts and representatives of international investment community at Konstantin Palace.Mikhail Klimentyev | TASS via Getty ImagesRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova also presented a similar argument, telling Radio Sputnik on Wednesday that an \"information circus\" surrounded the Trump-Putin summit.\"This whole information circus which, by the way, they haven't finished yet, it's still going on: Fake leaks, self-corrections, confirmations, denials, exist to once again provide informational support to Zelenskyy,\" she said, in comments translated by NBC News.",

    "body": "An aerial view of residential homes, many with solar panels, on Sept. 17, 2025 in Fontana, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesMortgage rates last week dropped to the lowest level in a month, pushing more borrowers to refinance. Potential homebuyers, however, were not as enthused.The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased last week to 6.37% from 6.42%, with points falling to 0.59 from 0.61, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to weekly changes in interest rates, rose 4% for the week and were 81% higher than the same week one year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The rate on the 30-year fixed was 15 basis points higher a year ago. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\"The refinance index increased 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in conventional refinances and a 12 percent increase in FHA refinance applications, as borrowers remain attentive to these opportunities to lower their monthly mortgage payment. VA refinances bucked the trend and were down 12 percent,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release.Kan noted that demand for adjustable-rate mortgages rose again.\"ARM applications increased 16 percent over the week, which pushed the ARM share to 11 percent, with the ARM rate more than 80 basis points lower than the 30-year fixed rate,\" he added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.ARM applications usually rise when overall interest rates climb, not when they fall. This increase speaks more to currently high home prices than it does to rates. Buyers are doing everything then can to afford what's available.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week one year ago. Buyers are finding more supply on the market, and prices are starting to soften slightly in some areas, but there are those who are waiting, expecting rates to come down even further.And mortgage rates did come down even more to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily.\"Some lenders are offering their lowest rates in over a year, and some in over 3 years,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND, although there was no particular reason for the drop.",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Netflix were down 9% in morning trading Wednesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss after the bell Tuesday, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said.\"It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,\" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a material impact on our results going forward.\"Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.Here's how the company did in the period ended Sept. 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $5.87 vs. $6.97, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.51 billion vs. $11.51 billion, according to LSEGNetflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%.Still, Netflix said it posted its best quarter for advertising sales ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.\"Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. \"This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.\"Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of \"Strangers Things\" and new seasons of \"The Diplomat\" and \"Nobody Wants This\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" and Rian Johnson's \"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.\"Netflix is also still riding the coattails of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated movie has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" dolls, plush, role-play items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.",

    "body": "A Walmart store is shown in Oceanside, California, on May 15, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersWalmart is pausing the hiring of job candidates who need H-1B visas to work in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the decision, an example of the ways the Trump administration's immigration policies are shaping corporate strategy.Walmart's decision comes after President Donald Trump in September announced higher fees for the visas, which allow companies to temporarily hire skilled workers from other countries such as China and India. The Trump administration said it would now require companies to pay a $100,000 fee for each new visa application. It said the decision was intended to protect American workers' jobs and end abuse of the visa.In a statement, a Walmart spokesperson said, \"Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.\"Exceptions to the pause on H-1B hiring are possible in some cases, said the person familiar with the decision, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. H-1B visas, which Congress created in 1990, have been a way for companies to bring in skilled workers from other countries when they can't find qualified applicants in the U.S. It's been frequently used for filling science, technology, engineering and math roles.The program has an annual cap of 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If demand is above the cap, a lottery system is used.For the Trump administration, the steeper fee on H-1Bs is intended as a deterrant for companies who are weighing whether to hire a foreign worker over an American. It fits into Trump's broader goal of using trade policy and an immigration crackdown to compel companies to invest in their U.S. operations and hire U.S.-born workers. Read moreWalmart is the nation's largest private employer with about 1.6 million employees in the country at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and most work in the company's big-box stores and warehouses. However, H-1B visas are typically used for a small portion of Walmart's corporate ranks. The retail giant's corporate workforce is based in its headquarters of Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as major U.S. cities like the San Francisco Bay Area.Walmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth largest U.S. employer to issue the visas, according to U.S. government data as of June 30. Microsoft is No. 1 with 5,189, followed closely by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.Yet the decision has faced pushback by some in the corporate world. Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.In a news release, the U.S. Chamber's Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the fee \"will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.\"Walmart's policy change was first reported by Bloomberg.",

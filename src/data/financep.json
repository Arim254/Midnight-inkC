Grogen | CNBC </p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.A/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a><span><span></span></span></span> formally separated the roles of chairman and chief executive officer, a long-anticipated move that paves the way for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO at the beginning of 2026.</p><p>In a new regulatory filing, the Omaha-based conglomerate said its board voted on Sept. 30 to amend its bylaws to distinguish the two top roles, effective immediately. Buffett, who has run Berkshire since 1965, will remain chairman of the board, while Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take over as CEO on Jan. 1, 2026.</p><p>The move was first announced by the 95-year-old Buffett at the end of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May, which took many by surprise. Shortly after the initial announcement, Berkshire's board unanimously approved Abel's appointment.</p><p>Buffett, even at his advanced age, has likely stayed active at the conglomerate. Just earlier this week, Berkshire announced <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/warren-buffett-berkshire-occidental-oxychem.html\">it is acquiring OxyChem</a>, the chemical arm of Occidental Petroleum, in a roughly $9.7 billion all-cash transaction. It marks Berkshire's biggest deal in three years.</p><p>Abel, 63, has been seen as Buffett's heir apparent since Charlie Munger, Berkshire's late vice chairman, publicly identified him as the chosen successor in 2021. He joined the Berkshire orbit when Berkshire acquired a controlling interest in MidAmerican Energy in 1999, and he later became CEO of the energy firm.</p><p>Since 2018, Abel has served as Berkshire's vice chairman for non-insurance operations, overseeing railroad, utilities, energy, manufacturing and retail businesses.</p></div></div>",

At one point, open positions outnumbered available workers by more than 2 to 1.</p><p>\"A lot of the new entrants in the market, young workers, recent graduates, people who are already unemployed [are] having a hard time getting into the market,\" said Cory Stahle, senior economist at job postings site Indeed, which itself provides an encompassing menu of labor market data. \"Regardless of what the unemployment rate is, people taking longer to find jobs is a sign of some economic distress for some households.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>Signs of imbalances</h2><div><p>Indeed's <a href=\"https://data.indeed.com/#/\" target=\"_blank\">measure of job postings</a> shows a decline of about 8.9% from a year ago as of Sept. 26, a sharper drop than the 5.5% reflected in BLS data, which only runs through August.</p><p>Broader trends suggest an uneven labor market, with professions like health care continuing to thrive while other fields lag, Stahle said.</p><p>\"Overall, things are looking pretty good, but a lot of those job gains, a lot of those postings and hiring, are coming from health care, and so it's hard to say that the labor market is fully in balance when it's not providing equal opportunities across different occupations,\" he said.</p><p>BLS data also has shown a fairly sizeable tilt in openings toward health care-related professions, with business and professional services next followed by leisure and hospitality. Government had been a leader but has pulled back since President Donald Trump began his term in January with a vow to pare down the federal payroll.</p><p>\"Right now is a good time to be a nurse, not so good of a time to be working as a software developer,\" Stahle added. \"That bifurcation of the labor market is also an important thing to look at here, not just the overall balance and an overall number.\"</p><p>Other indicators paint a similar picture, though <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/private-payrolls-declined-in-september-by-32000-in-key-adp-report-coming-amid-shutdown-data-blackout.html\">ADP's private payroll count</a> for September showed a decline of 32,000 jobs and an August loss of 3,000 as well. ADP on occasion also has been maligned for being incongruent with BLS data. However, the firm's reports are getting a closer look after it signaled a slowdown in the labor market well before the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/09/jobs-report-revisions-september-2025-.html\">BLS marked down its own counts</a> also to show a weak hiring picture.</p><p>It wasn't just the monthly nonfarm payroll account that went missing because of the shutdown: The Labor Department also didn't release its weekly tally of initial jobless claims.</p><p>Goldman Sachs came to the rescue for that metric, figuring that state-level claims data that was filed pointed to a national total of 224,000 — slightly higher than the previous week but largely in line with trends through most of the year.</p></div><h2><a></a>Other measures</h2><div><p>Beyond simple job or payroll count, spending data also can be a useful indirect gauge.</p><p>Bank of America's credit and debit card tracking showed spending on a steady uptick in September. Total card outlays compared to a year ago increased 2.2% for the week ending Sept. 27.</p><p>\"Spending growth remains solid despite soft labor data. We will continue to monitor this dichotomy,\" BofA economist Shruti Mishra said in a client note.</p><p>Similarly, Fiserv's small business index showed annual sales and transactions increased 2.3% in September, reflecting the same pace for the past three months.</p><p>However, other small business indicators show weakness.</p><p>\"Right now we see that there are a lot of firms that have job openings. There are, unfortunately, very few that get filled,\" Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist at the National Federation of Independent Business, told CNBC on Friday. \"So plans to fill them are always very optimistic, but when the dust clears, very few jobs actually get created.\"</p></div></div>",

They follow the shuttering of four other U.S. locations in recent months, in Washington, Virginia, New York and a Los Angeles suburb. </p><p>\"Certain locations work better than others, and after an assessment, we've made the decision to close these Amazon Fresh locations,\" Amazon spokesperson Griffin Buch said in a statement. \"We're working closely with affected employees to help them find new roles within Amazon wherever possible.\"</p><p>At one Fresh supermarket in La Verne, California, employees were told to gather for an all-hands meeting on Wednesday, according to an internal message viewed by CNBC. They learned at the meeting that the store would close in mid-November, and that employees would receive a severance package, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details were confidential. </p><p>The other three stores that are closing are in cities of Mission Viejo, La Habra and Whittier.</p><p>Last week, Amazon said it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/amazon-closing-fresh-grocery-stores-uk.html\">intends to close</a> 14 Fresh grocery stores in the U.K. and convert its five other locations there into Whole Foods markets.</p><p>Amazon said it regularly evaluates its store portfolio, which can lead to opening, reopening, relocating or closing certain locations. In the U.S., the company has more than 60 remaining Fresh stores. Last year, the company removed its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/03/amazon-ditches-cashierless-checkout-system-at-its-grocery-stores.html\">\"Just Walk Out\"</a> cashierless technology from the stores. It's also been culling its footprint of Go cashierless convenience stores.</p><p>Amazon has been determined to become <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/19/amazons-sprawling-grocery-business-has-become-an-expensive-hobby.html\">a major grocery player</a> for nearly two decades. The company launched <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2007/08/27/amazon-gets-fresh-challenges-with-new-grocery-business.html\">Amazon Fresh</a> in 2007, then a pilot project for fresh food delivery, before acquiring upscale chain <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/amazons-acquisition-of-whole-foods-is-a-threat-to-everyone-even-restaurants.html\">Whole Foods</a> for $13.7 billion in 2017, its biggest purchase on record. </p><p>Amazon debuted its <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/27/amazon-expands-beyond-whole-foods-with-fresh-grocery-store-chain.html\">Fresh grocery chain</a> in 2020, with an eye toward mass-market shoppers. The rollout has been turbulent since its early days. </p><p>The company opened a flurry of Fresh locations by 2022, but the expansion plans ran into CEO Andy Jassy's <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/12/amazon-cost-cuts-under-andy-jassy-reflect-new-reality-after-25-years.html\">widespread cost-cutting efforts</a> as the company reckoned with the impact of rising interest rates and soaring inflation. In 2023, Amazon announced it would <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/02/amazon-is-shutting-some-fresh-and-go-stores-as-the-company-cuts-costs.html\">shut some Fresh stores</a> and halt further openings temporarily as it evaluated how to make the chain stand out for shoppers.</p><p>While it's closing Fresh stores, Amazon continues to \"innovate and invest in making grocery shopping easier, faster, and more affordable,\" Buch said. The company still maintains 500 Whole Foods locations and has opened <a href=\"https://media.wholefoodsmarket.com/first-whole-foods-market-daily-shop-now-open-in-new-york-citys-upper-east-side/\" target=\"_blank\">mini \"daily shop\"</a> Whole Foods stores in New York City.</p><p>On Wednesday, Amazon also launched a new \"price-conscious\" grocery brand that will be offered online and in its physical stores.

Clary | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke is upbeat on the asset-based finance segment of the private credit market, but warns of \"cracks\" in corporate direct lending, which makes up the bulk of the sector.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/chery-kang/\">Speaking with CNBC's </a>Chery Kang at the annual Milken Asia Summit in Singapore Wednesday, Stracke highlighted the widening gap between the two lending spheres.</p><p>\"There are problems [in corporate private credit] where borrowers are going to their lenders and saying, 'Can I not pay you cash interest now, but basically borrow the interest from you and pay it later?' It's called Payment-in-Kind [PIK], and it's fairly prevalent right now,\" Stracke said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Balance sheet divergence</h2><div><p>He referred to asset-based financing as a \"much healthier\" credit environment.</p><p>\"In asset-based financing — residential mortgages, consumer loans, student loans and auto loans — the economy is strong, households are strong, the consumer is strong, and we really aren't seeing cracks that way,\" he added.</p><p>The widening gap stems from the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which saw consumer borrowers scale back their borrowing and deleverage their household balance sheets, which has helped boost asset-based financing activity. Corporate borrowers, in contrast, have built up their leverage and have \"less clean\" balance sheets.</p><p>In October last year, PIMCO raised more than $2 billion for asset-based specialty financing strategy as part of its continued push into private credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206130-17592796421759279639-41893235216-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759279641&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"'Real cracks' showing in the direct lending market within private credit: PIMCO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Corporate borrowers also face a trade-off in public versus private debt markets, according to Stracke.</p><p>The smaller number of lenders in private markets means it can be easier for borrowers to renegotiate loan terms in the event of loan pressure — albeit with higher costs.</p></div><h2><a></a>Unfolding opportunities</h2><div><p>More liquid bank debt, on the other hand, comes at a much lower cost, though the refinancing process can be trickier.</p><p>\"It's more difficult with a broadly syndicated bank loan or bond,\" Stracke said. \"We're seeing some real problems in the credit markets. There have been some high-profile defaults in the credit markets — in the public markets — where it's very difficult for the company to negotiate with the lenders to preserve value in the company.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, Stracke said that as the Federal Reserve continues on its path of interest rate cuts, and the overall all-in cost of borrowing comes down, particularly in mortgage rates, there will be more opportunities for PIMCO to take advantage of that demand for credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206122-17592776821759277679-41892888085-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759277682&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"We are going to see more IPOs in the first half of next year: Hostplus CEO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, David Elia, CEO of Australian superannuation fund Hostplus, said institutional investors in search of portfolio diversification are increasingly drawn to the private markets space – but said regulation should be focused on the retail wealth space.</p><p>Elia told CNBC at the Milken Asia summit that any push for tougher regulation of private markets should center around \"mom-and-dad\" investors who are attracted to the diversifying benefits of the asset class, rather than sophisticated institutional investors.</p><p>\"There are probably about 19,000 companies that are listed on global markets. There are 140,000 private companies who generate in excess of $100 million in U.S. revenue,\" Elia said.</p><p>\"As long-term institutional investors, you will not see the level of concentration, if you're genuine about diversification, in listed markets. Therefore, it's going to drive you towards the unlisted sector, largely around private equity-style types of investments.\"</p><p>He also predicted more IPOs in the coming months.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Nicole Teo and Asriel Chua contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>",

A court struck that program down in February and now borrowers who remain in the SAVE forbearance, which borrowers were placed into during the legal challenges, are seeing interest grow on their debt. (The Trump administration started charging interest as of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/01/student-loan-interest-free-save-forbearance-ends.html\">Aug. 1</a>.)</p><p>\"Interest has been accruing on their loans, but they have been unable to switch to another plan,\" Kantrowitz said.</p><p>In the meantime, borrowers stuck in the backlog may not be making progress toward loan forgiveness, either under the terms of an IDR plan or through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. PSLF offers debt cancellation to certain public servants or non-profit workers after a decade.</p></div><h2><a></a>What borrowers in the backlog can do</h2><p>For now, the best move student loan borrowers stuck in the backlog can do is to salt away the money they would have directed to their payments, Kantrowitz said. That way, you'll have plenty of cash to draw on when the Education Department switches you into another IDR plan and your first bill comes due.</p><blockquote><div><p>This remains a waiting game.</p><div><p>Carolina Rodriguez</p><p>director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>While this waiting period likely doesn't count toward IDR or PSLF forgiveness, when you first applied for an IDR plan, you were supposed to be put into a 60-day administrative forbearance at first, and those two months still do count on your forgiveness timeline, Kantrowitz said.</p><p>\"Our advice to borrowers is to maintain thorough records and monitor any applications submitted during this period,\" said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program, speaking about the backlog.</p><p>\"Once processing resumes, it's important to follow up promptly to ensure their application remains on track,\" Rodriguez said. \"Beyond that, unfortunately, this remains a waiting game.\"</p></div></div>",

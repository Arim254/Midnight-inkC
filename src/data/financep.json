    "body": "Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos arrives at the White House in Washington, Feb. 26, 2026.Andrew Leyden | Getty ImagesNetflix is walking away from a deal to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's studio and streaming assets after the WBD board on Thursday deemed a revised bid by Paramount Skydance to be a superior offer. Earlier this week, Paramount raised its bid to buy the entirety of WBD to $31 per share, up from $30 per share, all cash. It was the latest amendment to Paramount's multiple offers in recent months — and since moving forward with a hostile bid to buy the company — and it's now unseated a deal between WBD and Netflix to sell the legacy media company's studio and streaming businesses for $27.75 per share. Last week, Netflix granted WBD a seven-day waiver to reengage with Paramount, resulting in the higher bid. Paramount's offer is for the entirety of WBD, including its pay-TV networks, such as CNN, TBS and TNT. Netflix had four business days to make changes to its own proposal in light of Paramount's superior bid, the WBD board said in a statement Thursday. Instead, the decision by the streaming giant to walk away puts a pin in a drawn-out saga that saw amended offers from both bidders.\"Netflix is a great company and throughout this process Ted, Greg, Spence and everyone there have been extraordinary partners to us. We wish them well in the future,\" WBD CEO David Zaslav said in a statement, referring to Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters and CFO Spencer Neumann. \"Once our Board votes to adopt the Paramount merger agreement, it will create tremendous value for our shareholders. We are excited about the potential of a combined Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery and can't wait to get started working together telling the stories that move the world.\"Netflix stock spiked 10% in extended trading Thursday, while Paramount stock gained 5%. Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery fell 2%.\"The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval,\" Sarandos and Peters said in a statement. \"However, we've always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance's latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.\"The latest Paramount bid included a $7 billion breakup fee in the event the proposed merger doesn't win regulatory approval. The company also agreed to pay the $2.8 billion breakup fee that WBD would owe Netflix if that deal didn't go through. Sarandos told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in an interview last week that Netflix granted WBD the waiver to reopen Paramount talks in order to give shareholders clarity. \"Paramount had been making a ton of noise, flooding the zone with confusion for shareholders ... including floating all these hypothetical offers and talking directly to the shareholders and bypassing the Warner Bros. Discovery board,\" Sarandos said at the time. \"So we've given the opportunity to get those shareholders exactly what they deserve, which is complete clarity and certainty.\"However, Sarandos had fallen short of commenting on whether Netflix would up its own offer to match a revised Paramount bid. And Thursday, Sarandos attended meetings at the White House to discuss the potential tie-up.\"Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process,\" the Netflix co-CEOs said in their statement. \"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S.,\" they said. \"But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price.\" ",

Retail is not behind the selling that led to a lackluster reaction to the blockbuster results, Patel said.There's a caveat: Patel said there's strong selling in addition to buying in the chipmaker. That can help explain the stock's rocky action in morning trading, he added.\"Flows have been two-way,\" Patel wrote in a Thursday note. \"Total retail turnover in [Nvidia] has been pretty epic too at the start of the session.\"Thursday's action comes on the heels of the AI darling's earnings, which beat analyst expectations and came with strong guidance. Nvidia also reported 75% revenue growth in its core data center business, which helped drive the company's overall sales up 73%.Despite trading modestly higher before the bell, shares were lower by more than 4% in midday trading.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia, 1-day chartBroadcom, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) and the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) have seen \"spillover buying\" as retail investors up their activity more broadly, Patel said.\"If this continues, then we may be on track for one of the biggest days of retail buying of single stocks in months, which matters a lot for the overall risk view,\" Patel said.To be sure, everyday traders were relatively reserved heading into Nvidia's report. Average daily net flow over the five-day window ahead of the release was $94 million, around half of what was seen in the runup to the prior report, Vanda said Wednesday.Nvidia has been a top stock for retail investors since 2023, Vanda data shows. Despite Thursday's slide, Wall Street is bullish on the path ahead: The typical analyst polled by LSEG has a buy rating and price target suggesting shares can jump more than 35% over the next 12 months.",

Agents looking to enter private campus spaces should wait until the school's public safety team has been contacted, she added.A Department of Homeland Security official told CNBC that ICE agents arrested Aghayeva, whose student visa was terminated by the Obama administration in 2016, after \"the building manager and her roommate let officers into the apartment.\"\"She has no pending appeals or applications with DHS,\" said the official, whose agency oversees ICE.Manhattan Borough President Brad Hoylman-Sigal, in an X post, said that ICE \"used a phony missing persons bulletin\" about a 5-year-old girl.\"They purposefully deceived campus housing/security to gain entry to the student's apartment,\" Hoylman-Sigal wrote. \"The level of civil rights violations that took place is staggering.\"The incident comes as Trump's focus on immigration has become a national flashpoint.Border czar Tom Homan earlier this month said the administration would wind down its immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota, an operation that sent thousands of agents to the Minneapolis area. Two U.S. citizens were killed by immigration officials this year in Minnesota, sparking backlash against the White House's efforts.Columbia has been in the Trump administration's crosshairs since the president returned to office last year.The Education Department in June said the Ivy League school did not meet its accreditation standards because it was \"in violation of federal antidiscrimination laws.\" A month later, Columbia said it would pay $200 million to the federal government to restore its funding that the Trump administration cut.Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil was released in June after three months in ICE detention.",

Of course, the humanitarian issues of Cuban citizens must be resolved, and no one should create obstacles,\" Peskov said. The comments come shortly after Cuba's Interior Ministry said border guards killed four exiles and wounded six others onboard a Florida-tagged speedboat that entered its territorial waters. The 10 passengers of the vessel were said to have opened fire on a Cuban patrol off the northern coast of the island. The individuals, all of whom were Cuban nationals residing in the U.S., were armed and some had previous criminal records, Cuba's Interior Ministry said. It added that assault rifles, handguns, improvised explosive devices and camouflage uniforms were among the items seized from the boat.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the incident as \"highly unusual\" and said the White House would \"respond appropriately\" once it had conducted an independent investigation.

FanDuel's performance in the final quarter of 2025 was affected by bettors losing more often than usual.  When that happens, gamblers get discouraged, bet less and stop using the app as frequently, Flutter CEO Peter Jackson told CNBC in an interview.\"It's fair to say, not everything went our way in the fourth quarter,\" Jackson said. Shares of Flutter fell almost 7% in extended trading Thursday. Here's what the company reported for the fourth quarter, compared with Wall Street consensus: Revenue: $4.74 billion vs. $4.97 billion, according to LSEGAdjusted EPS: $1.74 vs. $1.95, according to LSEGFor the fourth quarter, Flutter reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $832 million, below the $893 million that Wall Street was expecting, according to StreetAccount. Its fourth-quarter revenue marked a year-over-year increase of 25%. And yet, Flutter's 2026 revenue guidance of $17.75 billion to $19.05 billion was lower than analysts' projection of $19.34 billion for the year.

    "body": "Source: NavientSome student loan borrowers can soon expect a check in the mail, more than a year after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reached a $120 million settlement with former federal servicer Navient. The CFPB said Navient steered student loan borrowers away from affordable repayment plans and into expensive forbearances, causing many to pay steep interest charges.\"People suffered real consequences — delaying children, not buying homes or returning to school when they wanted to, and more,\" said consumer advocate Julia Barnard, who was the top student loan official at the CFPB when the settlement was announced. \"These checks are necessary and will help make debtors whole after the harm they faced due to Navient's misconduct.\" A Navient spokesperson, at the time of the settlement, said it disagreed with the CFPB's allegations.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageSome student loan borrowers are getting Navient settlement checks — who qualifiesTrump accounts aren't exactly 'tax-free,' as the president said.

As part of the settlement, the CFPB banned the company from handling federal education loans, although it continues to play a role in the private student loan market. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service.Here's what borrowers should know about the settlement compensation. Qualifying borrowers are those put in forbearanceIf you had federal student loans with Navient and your account was placed in a forbearance in 2017 or earlier, you may qualify to receive a check, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Over the years, the U.S. Department of Education has transferred many borrowers between student loan servicers, once or even multiple times. You should be able to pull up a record of the companies that have managed your debt at Studentaid.gov. Navient's federal student loan accounts were originally transferred to Mohela, and may have subsequently been switched to Aidvantage, Nelnet or EdFinancial.Asked this week about the settlement payments, Cate Fitzgerald, a spokesperson for Navient, said, \"the CFPB is responsible for administering the funds and, under our agreement, identifying the borrowers who will receive them.\"The CFPB did not respond to a request for comment. On its website, the bureau directs consumers with questions about settlement compensation to call the third-party payments administrator, Rust Consulting, at 1-800-711-8418 or email navient_info@rustcfpbconsumerprotection.org. At least 100,000 borrowers may get a checkThe CFPB has not shared the number of borrowers who will be compensated under the settlement. However, Kantrowitz estimates that at least 100,000 people could get a check, based on his analysis of historical data of Navient borrowers in forbearance. The typical payment will likely be several hundred dollars, Kantrowitz said. Borrowers on Reddit have so far reported settlement payments of up to $2,000. \"I'm happy to see that debtors are already receiving these checks that they're entitled to,\" Barnard said. Financial consequences of forbearances When a borrower enters forbearance, they are not required to make payments, but interest typically continues to accrue on their loans. As the Navient settlement showed, forbearances can be costly for borrowers. While it can be tempting to put your loan payments on hold, your balance can grow much larger and, therefore, be harder to repay when the relief period ends. In March 2017, the average loan amount in forbearance by Navient was around $43,000, Kantrowitz found. That means a borrower's balance would spike by nearly $3,000 each year their bill was paused, assuming a 6.8% interest rate, he estimated. Borrowers are better off finding a repayment plan they can afford, consumer advocates say.",

    "body": "Antonio Filosa attends the presentation of the new Fiat 500 Hybrid at the Stellantis FIAT Mirafiori plant in Turin, Italy, on November 25, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAuto giant Stellantis on Thursday reported its first-ever annual loss after booking substantial write-downs amid a major strategic shift.The multinational conglomerate, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, posted a full-year 2025 net loss of 22.3 billion euros ($26.3 billion), compared with full-year profit of 5.5 billion euros a year ago.The net loss was impacted by 25.4 billion euros in write-downs, Stellantis said, as the firm sharply scales back its electric vehicle strategy.Despite the results, shares of the company were up Thursday after CEO Antonio Filosa discussed Stellantis' North American operations leading a turnaround for the company, including better-than-expected results for the region during the second half of the year.\"North America is a very strong growth in volume. ... It is very encouraging,\" Filosa told investors during its results. \"This growth will be the largest contributor in the world for Stellantis' profitability.\"Shares of the company in Milan and New York closed Thursday up by more than 4%.Filosa said expected continued growth in North America will be led by new products as well as the increased production of trucks with Hemi V8 engines. He also said the company's decision to cancel its plug-in hybrid electric vehicles will help with profitability.Stellantis' results come as carmakers across the globe look to walk back their EV plans. Car giants including GM, Ford and Honda, for example, have all announced billions of dollars in charges to write down EV investments in recent months. The trend underscores the shifting dynamics at play on the road to full electrification.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMilan-listed shares of Stellantis so far this year.\"Our 2025 full year results reflect the cost of over-estimating the pace of the energy transition and of the need to reset our business around our customers' freedom to choose from the full range of electric, hybrid and internal combustion technologies,\" Filosa said in a statement. \"In 2026 our focus will be on continuing to close the execution gaps of the past, adding further momentum to our return to profitable growth,\" he added.Stellantis said it had suspended its dividend for 2026, as it had previously flagged, and issued up to 5 billion euros of hybrid bonds. It also reiterated its 2026 forecasts, including a mid-single-digit percentage increase in net revenue and a low-single-digit adjusted operating margin.Other earnings highlights:Adjusted operating loss of 842 million euros in 2025, compared with an adjusted operating income of 8.65 billion euros in 2024.Estimates net tariff expenses of 1.6 billion euros in 2026. Stellantis said it expects positive industrial free cash flow in 2027.Over the second half of 2025, Stellantis it delivered a \"solid\" performance, noting consolidated shipments came in at 2.8 million units, with North America posting the strongest contribution. Net revenue rose 10% to 79.25 billion euros through the latter half of 2025 when compared with the same period a year ago. These results reflect the initial impact of improved operational efficiencies, disciplined commercial strategies and the strength of the firm's global brand portfolio, Stellantis said.",

Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesCongressional Democrats will force a vote on a war powers resolution relating to Iran next week, Democratic leadership announced Thursday, as President Donald Trump engages in a massive military buildup in the region. The resolution would limit Trump's ability to conduct military action there.Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., have introduced a measure known as a war powers resolution that would compel the administration to seek congressional approval before engaging in any further activity in Iran. Congress has the sole authority to declare war under the U.S. Constitution, though that authority has been stretched in recent years by the executive branch. \"As soon as Congress reconvenes next week, we will compel a vote of the full House of Representatives on the bipartisan Khanna-Massie War Powers resolution,\" the Democratic leaders led by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement. \"The Iranian regime is brutal and destabilizing, seen most recently in the killing of thousands of protestors,\" the statement read. \"However, undertaking a war of choice in the Middle East, without a full understanding of all the attendant risks to our servicemembers and to escalation, is reckless.\"The war powers resolution would also need to be approved by the Senate if it is passed by the House. But passage from the House is far from a guaranteed outcome as bipartisan lawmakers have recently lined up against the resolution. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., released a statement last week opposing the measure, citing concerns about Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.\"We respect and defend Congress's constitutional role in matters of war. Oversight and debate are absolutely vital,\" the pair wrote. \"However, this resolution would restrict the flexibility needed to respond to real and evolving threats and risks, signaling weakness at a dangerous moment.\"Trump has overseen a massive military buildup in the Middle East and has threatened strikes against Iran. His administration is also negotiating with Tehran over the country's nuclear program. The two countries held a third round of talks in Geneva on Thursday.Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi in a post on X described the day's negotiations as having made \"significant progress.\" He said that technical discussions will continue next week in Vienna and that the principals would reconvene \"soon after consultation in the respective capitals.\"The president said during his State of the Union address Tuesday that he prefers to resolve the Iran situation diplomatically but did not take military force off the table. \"I will never allow the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,\" Trump said.

    "body": "watch nowState Farm on Thursday announced a historic $5 billion dividend for its car insurance members, the largest in the mutual insurance company's 103-year history. \"This dividend is possible due to State Farm Mutual's financial strength and a stronger than expected underwriting performance, which has been reported industry wide,\" the company said in a statement. Customers can expect to receive refunds of $100 on average, though State Farm says the amount will vary by state and by the amount of premium paid. State Farm reports it has also lowered premiums by about 10% across 40 states, totaling $4.6 billion in cost savings for customers.That's a trend across the motor vehicle insurance industry. Auto repair costs are starting to decline, and the frequency of accidents declined in 2025. But car insurance premiums have soared. By early 2025, rates had climbed by more than 50% over three years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the highest inflation for motor vehicle insurance in 50 years.Affordability became a primary concern for many customers and led them to shop around for better deals. TransUnion recently issued a report showing insurance shopping has become a routine activity for consumers, rather than a rare event prompted by a car or home purchase.\"At this point we can safely say that regular insurance shopping is just the new normal,\" Patrick Foy, the senior director of strategic planning for TransUnion's insurance business, told CNBC in an interview. The report noted that the main drivers behind the rate shopping are economic pressures pushing consumers to find ways to reduce household expenses. At the same time, insurers are investing heavily in marketing and setting competitive rates.Travelers, Berkshire Hathaway's Geico, Root and Chubb compete with State Farm and USAA and other mutuals, where customers are also shareholders.Progressive in particular has been pressuring State Farm's dominance in auto and was among major auto insurers announcing significant financial returns to customers in 2025. The company paid $1 billion in dividends to its customers in Florida, where state laws require insurers to return excess profits. USAA announced a $3.8 billion payout to its members across states in 2025. The auto insurance business represents 63% of State Farm's property and casualty insurance business. Customer loyalty in auto insurance often leads to loyalty in homeowner's insurance too, where State Farm told CNBC it is not seeing its claims costs subsiding and it's still working to charge adequate rates to compensate.

The plaintiffs are asking the court to stop the importation of the drug. The lawsuit comes on the heels of a CNBC investigation that revealed a growing class of businesses called alternative funding programs, or AFPs, which promise to connect patients with more affordable options for accessing medications that often come at very high costs. The AFPs are able to obtain the overseas drugs at a substantially reduced price.Federal authorities told CNBC last year that importing medications from foreign markets is illegal and could pose risks to patients' health.watch nowAFPs contract with employer-sponsored health plans to offer coverage on specialty drugs. They often work with private employers, school districts, local governments and unions.CNBC's investigation revealed that in at least one case, an employer required its staff to obtain their high-cost medication through SHARx or said it wouldn't be covered. SHARx last year defended its business model, telling CNBC it provides an alternative to expensive drugs in the U.S. SHARx, which is based in St. Louis, Missouri, did not respond to CNBC's request for comment about the lawsuit.According to the complaint, the shipment of Xolair to the Michigan allergy center came from Campbell Heights Pharmacy in British Columbia, Canada. The pharmacy also did not respond to a request for comment.The suit said SHARx \"continues to brazenly deceive patients into believing they are receiving the same safe, securely supplied medicines that they would receive from a U.S. retail pharmacy.\"The drug has strict shipping and temperature controls, the suit said.Drugs not approved for the U.S. market that are shipped from overseas can result in contamination, potentially leading to \"serious patient injury and even death,\" the suit said.A separate lawsuit, filed in late 2024 by Gilead Sciences, similarly alleges that other alternative funding programs illegally import medications. The AFPs in the case, which is pending, have denied any wrongdoing.",

    "body": "Republican lawmakers are pushing to place limits on the ability of U.S. companies to sell advanced semiconductors to China — an effort that has run afoul of some key figures in the Trump administration.The effort also pits China hawks on the Hill against Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who has repeatedly made the pitch to lawmakers and government official that the more U.S. chips are used in China, the more U.S. companies will be a leader in the space. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Brian Mast, R-Fla., is at the forefront of ensuring artificial intelligence and chips are being viewed as a national security asset — and he isn't afraid to call Huang out directly.  \"The joke here is, Jensen wants us to trust the CCP,\" Mast told CNBC in an interview, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. \"Anybody watching this should laugh.\"In the latest salvo, the House Foreign Affairs Committee advanced legislation that would allow Congress 30 days to review and block sales of advanced chips to adversarial countries — similar to the power Congress has with arms and weapons sales. It would also cancel all existing export licenses to countries like China until the government submits a detailed strategy about how the chips would impact military and intelligence. All but two members of the committee voted to advance the measure. There is already a companion bill in the Senate with bipartisan backing from Sens. Jim Banks, R-Ind., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\"We are in an AI arms race, and it's important that we know where the AI arms dealers are selling,\" Mast said in the interview. He said while Congress has no right to interfere with chips being sold for video games and other commercial purposes, \"when it blends into the world of now, it's real war, real weapon systems, real casualties at the highest level of all militaries, yeah, we're going to have a say.\"Mast added that Huang \"might not like it, but that's what's going to take place.\"Nvidia said in a statement to CNBC the likelihood of China's military using American chips was low as \"it makes no sense for the Chinese military to depend on American technology.\"The company added that the \"administration's critics are unintentionally promoting the interests of foreign competitors — America should always want its industry to compete for vetted and approved commercial businesses, and thereby protecting national security, creating American jobs, and keeping America's lead in AI.\"Mast, a supporter of Trump's, said the committee was in sync with the White House, and the bill codified provisions in a recent Commerce Department regulation that permitted the sale of advanced chips to China. Both the bill and regulation ban advanced chips from being licensed in a way that could benefit the Chinese military, although the Commerce Department doesn't give lawmakers the power to block a sale. Despite strong support, the bill faces an uphill climb to get to the floor. Ahead of the vote in committee, David Sacks, the White House's AI czar, retweeted a post from the X account Wall Street Mav that slammed the bill, saying it \"handicaps Trump's ability to strategically position the USA favorably against China.\"Sacks quoted the tweet, adding \"Correct.\"Mast pushed back, saying that the talking points of the accounts Sacks boosted matched the talking points he'd heard from Nvidia. \"What he was promoting was literally mercenary influencers, about a dozen of them, telling literal lies,\" Mast said. Mast said he worked with others in the administration on the bill prior to the vote in committee. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The committee isn't done with its oversight of chips. Mast is also planning a vote on a bill requiring exported advanced chips contain a mechanism to verify their location — and would require exporters to flag the government if a chip wound up in an unauthorized location. The bill, known as the Chip Security Act, has bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate",

    "body": "watch nowThere is a $3 trillion opportunity for Black and other minority entrepreneurs to become business owners as part of the \"Great Business Transfer,\" according to a new report from McKinsey.\"This is the largest ownership transition in modern US history,\" said Shelley Stewart, a co-author of the report, senior partner and Chair of the McKinsey Institute for Economic Mobility. \"This is a huge opportunity but there is also a challenge, the issue is many viable businesses may not successfully transfer because the market to connect buyers, sellers and capital is not built at scale.\"Researchers forecast 6 million small- and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, will be available for acquisition by 2035. If Black, Latino and women entrepreneurs can increase ownership in these transitioning businesses, it has the potential to unlock $3 trillion in new household wealth, the report found.McKinsey said the contrast between the opportunity and the risk is especially stark for the Black community.Only 3% of U.S. business owners are Black compared to 13% of the population. If current trends hold, Black entrepreneurs are expected gain $87 billion of the transferring enterprise value. However, if they increase their participation in the Great Business Transfer, the number could jump to more than $369 billion. Conversely, without greater participation, disparities in wealth would only be increased according to the report.Stewart added, the ripple effect of the transfer goes far beyond underrepresented communities.\"The thing that is going to make this successful is having the broadest pool of entrepreneurs to buy these businesses, so that means you have to be inclusive,\" said Stewart. \"This is in the interest of all Americans. This has implications on employment, it has implications on local economic spend, it has implications on wealth creation.\"Funding and finding the businessAccording to McKinsey, the biggest challenges for potential acquirers in the Black and other minority communities will be financing, gaining access to deal flow and navigating the advisory process in an acquisition.\"We have more Black check writers at venture capital firms and buyout firms than ever before,\" said Jacob Walthour of Blueprint Capital Advisors. \"Also working inside other traditional financial institutions like banks, so the capital is there.\" But Walthour added it's imperative for members of the Black and minority communities to understand the dynamics of acquiring a business compared to starting a new business.\"You can get people to put capital behind a business that already exists, one of the hardest things to do is raise capital to build that business,\" said Walthour. \"The basic principles of capitalism should always be in place and this includes return on investment. That's how professional investors think about allocating capital.\"John Hope Bryant, founder and CEO of Operation Hope, also emphasized the need for Black entrepreneurs to look for opportunities in essential industries as opposed to personal interests.\"You don't have to fall in love with this business,\" said Bryant. \"Business is not personal. Once that shift happens and you connect the hustle we have, the untapped ambition … that's how you become a millionaire. This boring traditional approach we have never tried.\"The planning process The McKinsey report highlights five stages of a successful ownership transfer: aspiration and preparation, search and sourcing, deal structuring and financing, ownership and value creation and succession and exit.Sheena Gray, CEO of the African American Advisors Association, said the transfer highlights the need for Certified Financial Planners as potential acquirers will, in many cases, enter unfamiliar financial territory.\"The right planning infrastructure can be meaningful to expand minority business ownership,\" said Gray. \"Certified Financial Planners are better positioned to structure tax strategies that will help someone when they want to transition to ownership strategically. It's an important component that most business owners don't think about when they are in talks about acquiring a new opportunity.\" Gravy Wealth founder Brandon William Jones is working with the National Black MBA Association to help professionals become business owners, a transition he calls going from an \"earner\" to an \"owner.\"\"It's more urgent now than ever to be in control and capture the value you create,\" said Jones. \"The world is moving to a place where the workers, the knowledge workers specifically, are now becoming optional.\"AI impactMcKinsey's Stewart said the potential for disruption from AI only increases the upside for business acquisition.\"What's in the 6 million businesses? You've got retail, you've got restaurants, you've got construction, you've got healthcare. You've got small manufacturing. These will certainly be impacted by AI, but these are labor intensive businesses that will continue to need labor,\" said Stewart, \"AI will play a role in helping entrepreneurs get smart on different industries, AI is not likely to eliminate the need for these businesses.\"\"It will be a question of whether we can create the market mechanism that connects businesses with entrepreneurs and capital. I actually think we could see an acceleration over the next decade if we can pull the infrastructure together that actually sets people up to buy these businesses.\"Jones also said AI can also be a key tool for narrowing wealth and ownership gaps: \"If someone is AI forward, not only can they potentially acquire this business they can run the AI playbook to drive a lot more efficiency and value.\"",

    "body": "The US Court of International Trade in New York, US, on Thursday, April 24, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration's Department of Justice is nearing its first big legal deadline in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that President Donald Trump's tariffs issued under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are illegal.The DOJ needs to weigh in by Friday on one of the first legal fights over refunds in which plaintiffs are asking for expedited payment of tariff refunds through the Court of International Trade (CIT), which has typically handled tariff cases.Trade attorneys have told CNBC there are upwards of 2,000 cases that have been filed by companies suing for tariff refunds at the CIT. Back in December, the CIT put a stay on the cases until after the Supreme Court announced its decision.After the Supreme Court ruling, one of the plaintiffs, V.O.S., filed a motion for its case, which was in federal appeals court pending the Supreme Court decision, to be moved as soon as possible through the Court of International Trade for refund payment. The federal district court sent a motion to the Department of Justice, asking for the DOJ to respond on or before February 27 to allow the case to go back to the CIT for its ruling. As of Thursday afternoon, there had been no filing by the DOJ. It did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.The Supreme Court gave the government court system 32 days to decide on next steps after its ruling.  While the case only covers one group of small businesses, it has legal implications for many cases, the plaintiffs said in their filing: \"This Court's prompt action in this case will facilitate the prompt payment of refunds to the numerous other plaintiffs that have filed and will file IEEPA tariff challenges in this Court. ... the refund process in this case can be used as a template for providing swift relief in those other actions as well.\"Trade attorneys and customs experts tell CNBC approximately 300,000 shippers have paid the tariffs and by some estimates there is as much as $175 billion in potential refunds. More companies have sued in the wake of the Supreme court decision, including a case filed last week by FedEx after the Supreme Court ruling. The DOJ response to the court request may begin to reveal how the Trump administration plans to navigate the refund process. President Trump said at a press conference last Friday that it could take years to litigate the tariff refund issue. Democrats on Capitol Hill have been pressing for a plan from the administration to repay the tariffs since last Friday, citing the fact that it had months to prepare for an adverse ruling. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in an interview last Friday on Fox News it \"could take years to litigate and get to a payout. If there is a payout, it looks like it's just going to be the ultimate corporate welfare.\"The plaintiffs state in their motion that they want to require the government to issue the administrative orders necessary to \"promptly effectuate the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs — including any administrative orders necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs swiftly receive the refunds, with interest, that the government has committed to provide.\"While the motion says the plaintiffs do not expect the government to oppose the court, \"the Administration's recent public statements suggest that injunctive relief from this Court will be necessary to ensure the government promptly adheres to its commitments to pay.\"Trade experts have said that while the Court decision did not specifically weigh in on the tariff process — it was only Justice Brett Kavanaugh in his dissent who said it could be a \"mess\" — refunds are due to companies.\"It is clear that the importers of record that paid the unlawful tariffs are entitled to the amounts they paid,\" said Pratik A. Shah, lead attorney for Learning Resources Supreme Court Case and head of the Supreme Court practice at Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. \"There is no doubt that people that paid the IEEPA tariffs should get refunds. The only question is the process by which refunds will be made.\"watch now",

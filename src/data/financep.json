    "body": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people about what makes it possible for them to thrive. I've learned that resilience isn't something you're born with. It's not even about bouncing back, a concept that often does more harm than good. Real resilience is about building specific habits that train your brain to weather difficulty without breaking. Here are 9 habits that actually work:1. Reframing stress as a signal, not a threatIf your heart is racing before your big meeting, your instinct might be to panic. Before you do, pause and tell yourself: \"I'm excited about this.\"I know it sounds like toxic positivity. It's not. Research shows that this simple reframing, shifting from a threat to a challenge, can change your physiological response. Your body doesn't easily distinguish between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is your interpretation. 2. Making one micro-decision daily with confidenceWhen you constantly second-guess yourself, your brain learns that you can't be trusted to handle outcomes. Confident micro-decisions can help rewire your brain and boost your trust in yourself.So pick your lunch without researching five options. Commit to a movie in two minutes flat. Send the email without editing it 10 times. This teaches your brain: \"I can decide and handle what comes next, even if it's not perfect.\" That's the exact skill you need in a crisis. 3. Building your support system with intentionIt's extremely difficult to maintain deep relationships with hundreds of people. Research has found we can manage about 150 stable relationships, but only about five truly intimate ones. The most emotionally resilient people don't spread their emotional energy thin or try to handle everything alone. They invest in these core relationships. And when things do get hard, they have people in their corner who can help them carry the weight. 4. Creating a 'done' list instead of a to-do listMost of us focus on what's left undone. It's a perpetual sense of failure. I want you to flip this.Every day, write down what you actually accomplished, even the small stuff. Over time, your brain stops noticing gaps and starts noticing progress. That shift is where resilience lives.5. Noticing and savoring one good moment every dayWhen you deliberately pay attention to positive moments, you rewire neural pathways for happiness. Pick one moment a day worth savoring. A good conversation. A small win. Really good coffee. Spend 30 seconds actually noticing it. This practice counteracts your brain's obsession with what's wrong and builds psychological resilience, one moment at a time.6. Practicing honesty in your closest relationshipsBe vulnerable with the people who matter to you. Tell someone about a real challenge. Ask for honest feedback, not just agreement. Have conversations where things might get uncomfortable.The most resilient people feel safe to be themselves without fear of judgement. Being open with people who you trust can help build that muscle. 7. Helping someone else, before you need helpThis sounds counterintuitive until you realize that helping others is a powerful recharge practice. Plus, you're building your support system for the future. You're reinforcing your identity as capable and resourceful.Most importantly, you remember that resilience is also about contributing and mattering to other people.8. Asking yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?'Most people avoid this question because they are afraid of the answer. But research shows that actually imagining the worst-case scenario can reduce anxiety, not increase it.So after you ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" actually sit with the question. Then ask yourself, \"Could I handle that?\" The answer is usually yes. Maybe not easily, but yes.The most resilient people understand that bad things can happen, but the most important thing is to be confident that you can handle them when they do.9. Practicing these habits in low-stakes momentsEmotional resilience is a skill you can hone. It doesn't require therapy, meditation retreats, or years of work. Start with just one or two of these habits. Reframe stress when the stakes are low. Build your support relationships now, not when you're desperate. Make confident decisions about small things, so you're ready for big things.Jessica Weiss is a keynote speaker and executive coach who teaches people and businesses how to find more happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction at work.

    "body": "For couples, \"holidays are a scary time\" because they often call for revealing a new side of yourself to your partner, says Sabrina Romanoff, New York-based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily. Some people have decades-long, big family traditions they want to uphold. Others prefer to keep it low key. Whatever the activities are, and whatever the meaning behind them, opening up about what matters to you can feel very vulnerable.  Ultimately, the goal is to blend \"each other's cultures and worlds,\" says Romanoff. Here's how successful couples tackle this festive time of year. They're 'direct and honest' about what they want First, each partner has to know what they want and be open about it.Do they want their partner to join them for their family Christmas? Do they want to take some time off and have a quiet Hanukkah? \"You are better off being direct and honest with your partner so you both can really get what you both need,\" says Romanoff.Ultimately, there will likely have to be some flexibility, on both sides. \"I think the healthiest couples are those who can get creative and compromise,\" she says. \"There's only one Christmas Eve, there's only one Christmas Day.\" Maybe this year, the couple spends time with one side's family and next year they spend time with the other. They create new traditions togetherSecond, successful couples create new traditions together. \"That could mean going to see the tree together a Rockefeller Center,\" says Romanoff, \"or getting an ornament together.\" It could mean cooking a holiday meal or doing a hot chocolate crawl. Building something new together is a bonding experience. \"I think that's what brings security\" in the relationship, she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A photo showing President Donald Trump's face that was included in the release of the investigative files on notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein — and more than a dozen other files — appears to have been removed from the Department of Justice's website.The photo, released on Friday along with a slew of other files, shows a desk displaying a large assortment of framed and unframed photographs and other items. Among those photographs are at least two that clearly show Trump's face.Lawmakers on Saturday were quick to note that the image was missing from the DOJ website. \"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"The photo featuring Trump was among the at least 16 files that disappeared from the site, the Associated Press reported Saturday.Friday's release included only some of the vast number of documents required to be disclosed under a deadline set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which mandated that the DOJ divulge all the files. The DOJ continued its partial release with more files tied to the investigation early Saturday.Congress is considering holding impeachment hearings about Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche if the documents that were released don't comply with the law, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said Friday.\"What we need is a clear timeline of when the rest of the documents will be released and an explanation for why they did not release all of them today,\" Khanna said during a press conference following the files' release.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who co-sponsored the House bill with Khanna that ordered the Justice Department to release the files, on Saturday, accused the DOJ of openly disregarding the law.\"Compare Language of Epstein Files Transparency Act directing DOJ to provide internal communications regarding their decisions Versus DOJ letter to Congress asserting privilege to omit materials related to decisions, because they weren't specified by law,\" Massie wrote in a post on X.From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesWhile Trump is a former friend of Epstein, the president has not been accused of wrongdoing. He has also denied his awareness of Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls and women.The appearance of Trump's name and image was noticeably scarce in the files made public Friday. Recently, however, Trump has been shown in a number of images that were released by House Democrats, who obtained the photos directly from Epstein's estate.The DOJ said in a post on X late Friday that it wasn't \"redacting the names of any politicians\" and cited comments made by Blanche reiterating such.\"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law — full stop,\" Blanche said. \"Consistent with the statute and applicable laws, we are not redacting the names of individuals or politicians unless they are a victim.\"Blanche, who previously served as a criminal defense lawyer for Trump, echoed that sentiment in an interview with ABC News on Friday, saying that there has been \"no effort\" to redact any mention of the president in the files' release.The White House referred questions about the missing photo to the DOJ.CNBC has reached out to the Justice Department as well as House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., for comment.Former President Bill Clinton appeared in several photos released Friday, and it is unclear when or where they were taken. One showed Clinton sitting in a chair next to a young woman, who sat on the chair's armrest.The former president has also not been accused of wrongdoing.Clinton's spokesman, Angel Urena, on Friday said, \"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday to protect Bill Clinton. This is about shielding themselves from what comes next, or from what they'll try and hide forever. So they can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"\"There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light,\" Urena added. \"The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first. No amount of stalling by people in the second group will change that. Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats.\"— CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

    "body": "Bob Newhart and Will Ferrell star in \"Elf.\"Warner Bros.In the 2003 movie \"Elf,\" the lead character Buddy discovers he is human, though he has spent his life raised by elves.He travels to New York City to find his real family, including his father who shares an Upper West Side apartment with his family.The fictitious apartment, located at 55 Central Park West, is home to Buddy's father, Walter; his wife, Emily; and their son, Michael. Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, stubbornly high mortgage rates and now less supply are all weighing on potential homebuyers. Sales of previously owned homes rose just 0.5% in November from October and were 1% lower than November 2024, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales came in at an annualized rate of 4.13 million units.This count is based on closings, so it reflects contracts likely signed in September and October, when mortgage rates initially came down slightly but then stayed in a tight range.   Supply, which had been gaining for much of this year, fell in November. There were 1.43 million homes for sale at the end of the month, down 5.9% from October but up 7.5% year over year, according to the association. At the current sales pace, that represents a 4.2-month supply. A six-month supply is considered balanced between buyer and seller. \"Inventory growth is beginning to stall,\" Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors, said in a release. \"With distressed property sales at historic lows and housing wealth at an all-time high, homeowners are in no rush to list their properties during the winter months.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Sellers who were on the market also began to delist their properties at a higher rate than usual. Sellers often take unsold homes off the market heading into winter, but that dynamic was much stronger this year. And that is keeping pressure on home prices. The median price of a home sold in November was $409,200, an increase of 1.2% from November 2024, and the highest November reading on record. The Realtors use a median measurement, which can skew to what end of the market is selling most. The high end is currently doing much better than the low end. Sales of homes priced in the $100,000 to $250,000 range were down nearly 8% from a year ago, while homes priced at more than $1 million were up 1.4%.\"Wage growth is outpacing home price gains, which improves housing affordability. Still, future affordability could be hampered if housing supply fails to keep pace with demand,\" Yun said.Homes are staying on the market longer, at 36 days compared with 32 days last November. First-time homebuyers made up 30% of sales, unchanged from a year ago, but historically they make up about 40%. Investors stepped back into the market, making up 18% of transactions, up from 13% in November 2024.",

    "body": "Capsule hotels are a cheap alternative to expensive accomodation in London for office workers.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.Private sleeping capsules alongside each other in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaThe cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. \"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room,\" she said. \"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London.\" In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.Inside a sleeping capsuleInside a sleeping capsule in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaIt's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.Each capsule measures 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth.Sawdah BhaimiyaEarlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. A female-only dormitory inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaI learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. That's because it is \"still under construction,\" Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. \"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered,\" she added. While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. Zedwell Capsule Hotel is located in Piccadilly Circus, London.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers are coming back to the city During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high.\"Halima AzizCriterion's Head of Hotels A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. A typically dormitory with roughly a dozen capsules inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaZedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a \"base in the city\" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high,\" she said. \"Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home.\" The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. \"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy,\" Aziz added. As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London. ",

    "body": "watch nowLucid Motors gets rave reviews from critics. But it's sorely lacking customers.    That's a problem the company can't afford. The Arizona-based EV maker has top-shelf tech, deep-pocketed backers, and highly praised cars. However, it has struggled to meet production targets, and has been unable to steal the spotlight away from established luxury brands with century-old pedigrees. Lucid is ramping up production of its high-end, three-row, Gravity SUV, though it has sold only a few hundred units so far in 2025. The Gravity's production ramp has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages. Yet the company already has plans for another vehicle aimed more at the middle of the market, where it would compete with the top-selling Tesla Model Y SUV. And it's investing in self-driving cars for consumers while working on a robotaxi fleet with Uber and self-driving tech maker Nuro. A Lucid Gravity coming off the line at the company's factory in Casa Grande, ArizonaIn the process, Lucid is burning through a lot of money. The company's third-quarter results were worse than Wall Street expected, with a net loss of close to $1 billion.  \"Their gross profit has been getting kind of worse,\" said Tom Narayan, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. \"A lot of people are doing the math. How long can the company keep losing cash?\"Adding to its challenges is a tougher environment for all EV manufacturers. Demand has fallen short of expectations, and many automakers are pulling back. EVs have lost key support from the federal government, including a $7,500 tax credit, funding for charging, and restrictions on state level programs that incentivize automakers to produce zero-emission vehicles. A 'fantastic car'Lucid's first vehicle, a sedan call the Air, is the most popular vehicle in its segment, according to Cox Automotive. Through the third quarter, it was the third best-selling full-size luxury sedan, and the top selling electric one, according to the company. The Air is frequently a \"critic's pick.\" No other EV can touch the 512-mile range of the Air Grand Touring, one of its top trim levels.  Last year, Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles, the majority of which were Air sedans, a 71% increase from 2023. U.S. EV leader Tesla delivered 1.8 million. Unfortunately, sedans have consistently compared to SUVs, crossovers, and pickups--which now all but dominate the roads. Of the top 10 best-selling models in the U.S., seven are from those three segments, according to Edmunds. \"It was a fantastic car,\" said Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research for Telemetry. \"It still is a fantastic car. But it came to market at kind of the wrong time.\"Marc Winterhoff, interim chief executive officer of Lucid Group Inc., in a Lucid Air Grand Touring model in San Francisco, California, US, on Thursday, July 17, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIn 2023, Tesla's Model Y was the best-selling vehicle in the world, according to JATO Dynamics. It sold more than 265,000 units in the U.S. through the third quarter of 2024, according to Cox Automotive, about 100,000 more than the Model 3 sedan. Among EVs, the Model 3 is unusually popular for a sedan. Behind the two Tesla Models, the three vehicles that round out the top five are crossovers — Chevrolet Equinox, Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq5. The Model S, the Air's closest Tesla competitor in terms of size, performance, and price, sold just over 4,500 units in the same period.  The highest volume EVs, such as the Model Y, are also less expensive than the Air, which starts just above $70,000 and runs up to about a quarter of a million dollars. The Model 3 is nearly half that. The average EV transaction price in November was just above $59,000, according to Cox Automotive. \"There's just not enough of a market for those premium electric sedans right now,\" Abuelsamid said. Lucid sold slightly more than 300 Gravity SUVs in the US through the third quarter of 2025, according to Cox Automotive. Like the Air, the Gravity has a high price tag. Nevertheless, the company has said the Gravity stands to attract six times as many customers as the Air. \"We'll see if that's the case,\" said Narayan. \"The latest numbers I've seen show it kind of equalizing the sales of sedans.\"Lucid interim CEO Mark Winterhoff told CNBC in an interview that the company has seen \"a very good uptick in demand when it comes to the Gravity as compared to the Air.\" He added that most customers are configuring the car in ways that run the price up above $100,000. Production troubleDemand might be strong, but Lucid also has to get the vehicle into customers' hands. Gravity's launch earlier in 2025 was beset by shortages of key materials like magnets, aluminum, and chips, Winterhoff said on the company's third-quarter earnings call.\"We haven't been able to produce as many as we wanted up until this point,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"We're very confident right now that we solved those problems.\"Deliveries have risen for seven straight quarters, culminating in a 47% percent jump over the third quarter of 2024. Lucid has added a second shift to the final assembly section of its factory to meet demand.The company said demand has been resilient despite worries the EV market is stalling after the federal EV incentive ended on Sept. 30.\"In October, our delivery numbers went up,\" Winterhoff said. \"Whereas in many other pure EV players or even EVs for incumbent players that also have [internal combustion] vehicles, the deliveries dropped down drastically.\"watch nowStill, analysts say it's a tougher time to make EVs than it was when Tesla was ramping up the Model 3 and Model Y. \"They were the only game in town,\" Narayan said. \"So there wasn't competition there. They also benefited from battery prices falling significantly. And they got a lot of government support. Today we're in a very different world.\" If gross profit does keep getting worse, the company will eventually have to return to investors, Narayan said. Lucid is currently about 55% owned by the Saudi Public Investment fund, according to FactSet.In the third quarter, Lucid and the PIF agreed to increase a delayed draw term loan credit facility from $750 million to roughly $2 billion. A DDTL is a loan the company can draw on over time, rather than all at once. That brings its total liquidity to $5.5 billion. The company has said it has enough to get through the first half of 2027.CNBC tours Lucid Motors factory in Casa Grande, Arizona.Andrew Evers\"So far, the Saudis have put many billions of dollars into Lucid, and they've been very patient through Lucid's struggles as they try to ramp up production and sales,\" said Abuelsamid. \"It's unclear how long they will continue to be patient.\"The company also received a $300 million investment from Uber in September to develop a platform for robotaxis with a third partner, autonomous driving tech developer Nuro. On top of that, Uber plans to buy 20,000 Gravity vehicles for the self-driving fleet. Separately, Lucid has a partnership with Nvidia to develop what it calls the \"the first true eyes-off, hands-off, and mind-off (L4) consumer owned autonomous vehicle.\" L4 means Level 4, nearly the highest level of autonomy in the current system devised by the Society for Automotive Engineers.\"You need to invest first and then you reap the benefits later on,\" Winterhoff said. \"And therefore we have to do a lot of things in parallel.\"Smaller SUV on the wayDespite Gravity's production challenges, the company is already at work on its next vehicle — a mid-size crossover priced closer to the industry average of about $50,000. This could boost volumes, but deepen losses. \"If gross profit is negative at a vehicle transacting around $100,000 or more on average, what Lucid's Air and Gravity are currently going for, what will it look like when the company is selling a vehicle that is closer to half of that?\" Narayan said. \"One answer could be, well, it's a much bigger scale, so you have better operating leverage,\" Narayan said. The argument, he said, is that Lucid's technology enables it to squeeze a lot more range out of a battery than competitors.\"Our vehicles are way more efficient by 30% to 40% than the competition, which means smaller battery use smaller battery to achieve the same range,\" said Emad Dlala, senior vice president of engineering and digital at Lucid. \"That means a lower [bill of materials] cost. That means better margins.\"Dlala said the Lucid Air Pure has a battery size of a Tesla Model Y, but has a range of 420 miles, about a hundred miles more than the Tesla Model Y. Lucid says the money it's spending goes to developing an array of technologies and manufacturing processes that are hard to copy. \"Lucid has about over 10 years of powertrain history,\" Dala said. \"This didn't come overnight. There's lots of IP patented technologies across powertrain, vehicle and software,\" which lead to \"gains in efficiency across the board,\" he said. Brand new Lucid electric cars sit parked in front of a Lucid Studio showroom in San Francisco on May 24, 2024.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThat even extends to the way the cars are made. \"We use manufacturing processes here that no one else in the industry uses in powertrain,\" said Adrian Price, senior vice president of operations at Lucid.\"Lucid is very highly vertically integrated,\" he said, meaning it brings much of the car-making process in house. \"We have a lot more of our own subassemblies. That's also how we get the performance that other people don't. A lot of that engineering is outsourced by other major automakers. Not only do we do the engineering, but we also do the manufacturing, and we can control some of the Lucid secret sauce by doing it in-house.\"One area where Lucid appears to lag competitors is brand awareness. \"A lot of people don't know what Lucid is,\" Narayan said. \"That's the biggest, I think, hurdle that they have.\"The company has given more thought to marketing, and raising its profile in the luxury market, where it's going up against names like Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, and BMW. \"The buyer of a luxury brand, typically, they like things like heritage,\" Narayan said. \"The brand matters. So, you know, how do you create that from scratch?\"\"We are very well known and have tons of accolades in the motor press, Winterhoff said. \"So everybody who's interested in cars knows about it. But that's not the majority of vehicle buyers.\"So, it has begun a new marketing and advertising strategy for the Gravity, with Hollywood actor Timothee Chalamet as its first \"global brand ambassador.\" \"We're shifting from focusing on our vehicles, about the capabilities of our vehicles, to what does it mean to own a Lucid and what does it say about you?\" Winterhoff said. Winterhoff said he's confident the company can successfully ramp the Gravity, while building and eventually delivering its mid-size vehicle.  \"That is the point where I think this is a sustainable business going forward,\" he said. \"We have a clear plan also to profitability.\"Watch the video to get an exclusive inside look at Lucid's Gravity production and to find out what's next for the automaker.

    "body": "watch nowOracle's stock jumped about 7% Friday after the cloud provider joined a group of investors slated to lead TikTok's U.S. operations. In a memo to employees Thursday, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said the social media company's U.S. division will be run by a joint venture that includes Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX. The deal is expected to close on Jan. 22.The agreement prevents the popular social platform from getting banned after President Joe Biden signed a law requiring a divestiture of the company's U.S. unit due to national security concerns. President Donald Trump extended the deadline for a deal on multiple occasions and signed an executive order in September that approved a potential plan for China-based ByteDance to divest.Oracle will be tasked with auditing and validating that TikTok follows \"agreed upon National Security Terms,\" according to the memo. China has not publicly confirmed the investment deal, but reports in Chinese state media suggest that the deal will go through, CNBC's Eunice Yoon said. State-run media reported comments from a pro-Beijing professor, who said the deal was in line with the country's laws and is \"not a sale of the algorithm.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Nvidia VC arms back vibe coding startup Lovable at $6.6 billion valuationMetaX and Moore Threads' IPOs underscore Chinese chipmakers' growing challenge to NvidiaInstacart shares drop on report that FTC is probing company over AI pricing toolAmazon says AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving, Peter DeSantis to lead 'AGI' groupOracle's cloud-based computing centers will also house sensitive U.S. data.In a note to clients on Friday, Evercore ISI called the news a \"nice win\" for the cloud company with upside potential. \"We continue to believe the recent pullback represents an interesting entry point with investors that can take a 6-12 month view,\" analysts wrote. The deal comes at the end of what has been a chaotic 2025 for the cloud provider and a massive pullback in shares in recent months over concerns about its AI infrastructure spending. Earlier this week, shares slumped on a report that talks over a $10 billion data center deal with Blue Owl Capital had reached a standstill. That exacerbated concerns over the massive — and potentially risky — funding plans behind the artificial intelligence data center buildout.

Oracle and OpenAI in particular have raised eyebrows, as the ChatGPT maker committed to pay more than $300 billion to the software company. Cramer suggested investors grew concerned after Oracle raised $18 billion in its September bond sale — one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry.OpenAI should \"strike while the iron's hot and try to raise $200 billion at a trillion dollar valuation,\" Cramer said. That funding will allow the company to pay Oracle the money it needs now to build data centers, he continued. If that happens, he said, other hyperscalers will have to keep spending on infrastructure, and data centers stocks can take off.Cramer said he's fairly optimistic OpenAI can raise the money. But the outfit has \"monster hubris,\" he continued, and suggested now could be a \"humbling moment\" for the company, or it could \"demonstrate that they're right to be arrogant.\"\"Even if OpenAI raises, say $100 billion now in a private round and then comes back for a public round for another $100 billion next year, the data center theme could continue to hum,\" he said. \"Of course, if Open AI can't raise enough money, then we just reverse everything we saw today, and we go back down.\"OpenAI and Oracle did not immediately respond to request for comment.watch now",

    "body": "Josh Woodward, VP of Google Labs, addresses the crowd during Google's annual I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California on May 20, 2025. Camille Cohen | AFP | Getty ImagesJosh Woodward may not be a household name in Silicon Valley. But inside Google, everybody knows about him.The 42-year-old Oklahoma native, who started at Google by way of a product management internship in 2009, has spent the past eight months running the Gemini app, the centerpiece of the search giant's artificial intelligence strategy. Heading into 2026, Woodward's work is more critical than ever as Google rushes to keep pace with its high-powered AI rivals, namely OpenAI, which kickstarted the generative AI boom with the launch of ChatGPT just over three years ago. As industry experts forecast a shift in consumer behavior from traditional search to AI-powered apps, Google is fighting to make sure users stay within its ecosystem, whether it's for chatbot services, images, videos or online shopping. Woodward is helping to spearhead that effort while also keeping his job as head of Google Labs, home to the company's experimental AI projects.Clay Bavor, former co-lead of Google Labs, said Woodward's ability to move fast, break down barriers and execute \"has landed him right at the center of the most important work at Google.\"CNBC spoke with more than a dozen people who have worked with Woodward about his evolving profile at Google, how he got there and the pressure he faces to help Google stay ahead of the competition without losing the trust of users. Several current and former colleagues, including some who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak to the press, emphasized how seriously Woodward takes the societal concerns that come with the power of AI, and about Google's role in shaping the future. watch nowIn April, when Woodward was promoted to run the Gemini app, Google's position in AI was tenuous. Alphabet shares plunged 18% in the first quarter, their worst performance for any period since 2022, and concerns were building that the company was losing its long-held position as the internet's front door. Demis Hassabis, co-founder of Google DeepMind and the person considered the top AI executive at Google, said in the memo announcing the move that Woodward would be focused on the \"next evolution\" of the app, according to a Semafor report. A major turning point for Woodward's group came in late August, with the launch of image generator Nano Banana, a Gemini feature that lets users blend multiple photos together to create personal digitized figurines. Within days, Nano Banana had become so popular it was overloading the company's infrastructure, forcing Google to place temporary limits on usage to ease the burden on its custom-designed chips called tensor processing units. \"Our TPUs almost melted,\" said Amin Vahdat, Google's head of AI infrastructure, at a November all-hands meeting, according to audio reviewed by CNBC. By the end of September, the Gemini app surpassed 5 billion images and dethroned OpenAI's ChatGPT at the top of Apple's App Store. Nano Banana is now being rolled into other products like Google Lens and Circle to Search.Like its top rivals, Alphabet is pouring money into AI infrastructure ahead of an expected surge of new business. The company said in its earnings report in October that capital expenditures for the full year would reach between $91 billion and $93 billion, up from a prior forecast of $85 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet vs. Meta in 2025Wall Street's mood on the company has reversed dramatically. Despite a brutal first quarter, Alphabet's stock is up 62% this year, outperforming all of its megacap peers including Meta, which is up 13%. Google said in October that the Gemini app's monthly active users swelled to 650 million from 350 million in March. AI Overviews, which uses generative AI to summarize answers to queries, has 2 billion monthly users. OpenAI said in October that ChatGPT hit 800 million users per week. Last month, Google introduced Gemini 3, its latest model, prompting excitement across much of the tech sector. \"I've never had more fun than right now,\" Woodward told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa in an interview soon after the release. \"It's partly the pace. It's partly the abilities these models give to people who can imagine use cases and products.\"Bavor, who's now co-founder of AI agent startup Sierra, said Woodward \"was among the very earliest people in the company to see the potential in large language models for building products,\" and lauded his ability to \"get his mind fully around a new technology, to see around corners, to see how it might evolve and how it might be used.\"'Change for good or bad'Woodward now faces the challenge of not only leading two units within Google but also finding a balance between moving fast to compete with AI rivals OpenAI and Anthropic and not moving so fast that the search company's AI products enable potential harm. It's a pressing issue as AI rapidly bleeds into daily life, more slop populates social media, and an onslaught of AI-generated content makes it difficult for average consumers to distinguish fact from fiction. Woodward discussed the theme in a podcast with partners from venture firm Sequoia in March, shortly before taking over the Gemini app. AI-generated videos were rapidly getting more advanced, following the launch of OpenAI's Sora in late 2024.\"When I'm thinking of video, for example, I'm on the side of wanting to amplify human creativity, but there are these moments that happen in our valley here where things change,\" Woodward said. \"And they change often for generations. And they can change for good or bad.\"The Nano Banana Pro, released in November, is so advanced that its creations blur the lines between images that are clearly AI generated and those that are real. The product has faced criticism for depicting white women surrounded by Black children in responding to a prompt about humanitarian aid in Africa. The intensity of the job is hardly reflected in Woodward's persona. Colleagues harp on his disarming, goofy laugh that often comes out mid-conversation and a friendliness stemming from his Midwestern upbringing. Caesar Sengupta, who worked with Woodward on one of his earliest projects at Google, said, \"I've never seen him get angry with anyone.\" Sengupta, who's now founder of AI finance platform Arta, added that he used to tease Woodward, suggesting he would be Google's next CEO. Clay Bavor, VP of Virtual Reality for Google, introduces the Daydream View VR headset during the presentation of new Google hardware in San Francisco, California, U.S. October 4, 2016.Beck Diefenbach | ReutersWoodward joined Google Labs in 2022. Bavor said Woodward was his first choice to help lead the effort. One of the team's first breakout products was known as Project Tailwind, an AI notebook that senior product manager Raiza Martin thought up in her 20% time, Google's longstanding practice of letting employees dedicate one day a week to a project of personal interest. Woodward helped shepherd the project through several iterations to what morphed into NotebookLM, a popular product that analyze articles, PDFs or videos a user uploads, and provides summaries or offers insights. Martin stayed on as a senior product manager until December 2024, when she left to co-found AI startup Huxe. To help build NotebookLM, Woodward turned to an unsuspecting hire. Steven Johnson had never had a full-time boss and had no connection to Google. Living in New York, he'd spent his career up to that point as an author, writing books about the history of science and technology. Woodward was an admirer of his work.\"We hatched plans for him to join us as a visiting scholar,\" Bavor said. Johnson joined on a part-time basis in 2022. When he went full time in May 2023, Woodward put him to work immediately. With Google's annual I/O developer conference a week away, Woodward had the idea to demo an audio feature for what would become NotebookLM, viewing it as a way to test the evolving capabilities of Google's AI models. The group worked overtime to get it done in time for Woodward's presentation.Leading up to the event, Martin wanted to collect user feedback on communication app Discord even though Google preferred that staffers use homegrown products for such efforts. Woodward intervened to make sure Martin could keep using Discord, employees told CNBC. \"In true Google fashion, everyone was like 'What is Discord?'\" Martin said in October 2024, on Lenny's Podcast, hosted by tech investor and researcher Lenny Rachitsky. She recalled being asked by Google administration, \"Why not use Google Meet, why not Google Groups, why not this and that, and I was like, 'The server is the way to go.'\"Johnson, who spoke with CNBC on a video call, said Woodward's approach was, \"Let them cook.\" The discord server now has more than 200,000 members, a company spokesperson told CNBC.The screen displays the inscription ''NotebookLM'' during a meeting between Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk at Google for Startups in Warsaw, Poland, on Feb. 13, 2025. Klaudia Radecka | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAt I/O, Woodward took the stage after Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian's keynote. He opened by talking about Project Tailwind, a concept that \"five engineers at Google put together over the last few weeks.\"\"We've been developing this idea with authors like Steven Johnson and testing it at universities like University of Oklahoma, where I went to school,\" said Woodward, as he walked across the stage to a laptop. \"You want to see how it works?\"He began his demo, uploading documents into the app. In a side panel, Tailwind instantly began showing key concepts and questions based on the materials in each document. He hovered his mouse over a button that said citations, saying \"My favorite part is it shows its work.\"NotebookLM was initially released in July 2023, followed by a broader rollout in the ensuing months. It was an instant hit, and has since been updated to include podcasting, audio and video features. Recommended readingWoodward graduated from Oklahoma with an economics degree in 2006, and then headed to graduate school at University of Oxford in the U.K., where he studied the effects of the U.S. military and economic foreign aid on democracy. He kicked off his career at Google in 2009 with a product management internship, and went on to hold a number of product management roles. When Sengupta was tapped by CEO Sundar Pichai to start the Next Billion Users (NBU) project, an initiative to understand users in emerging markets like India, Woodward was \"one of the first people I asked to join,\" he told CNBC. At NBU, Woodward wrote a weekly newsletter that was concise and thought-provoking, and became so popular that people would email the author asking to be added to the newsletter, Sengupta said.Woodward still writes a newsletter — now it's quarterly — about matters of interest to him and what he's been reading. Woodward reads so much that he's often the first person Google executives go to for book recommendations, colleagues said. He also assigns reading. Martin said on the podcast last year that Woodward had given her an article to read that dissected whether users should trust AI chatbots.watch nowOne of Woodward's best-known attributes, employees said, is his ability to circumvent Google's massive bureaucracy. He helped set up a system called \"block,\" where workers can file a note if they see a perceived roadblock, and a team within Labs will handle it, they said. When NotebookLM launched, the product needed more TPUs, and Woodward was able to get them. \"It's been very cool that we have someone who can take care of the annoying stuff, and we're able to just get to the users,\" said Usama Bin Shafqat, a Google Labs software engineer.Woodward also came up with a process called \"Papercuts\" to address minor issues that create friction in a particular product. In October, Woodward posted on X, \"Papercut fixed: You can now change models mid-conversations on GeminiApp without having to start over.\" The post got more than 100 replies, including many from users thanking him. Woodward is known for responding directly to users on X and Reddit, and brings feedback to employees so they can address complaints, said Jason Spielman, a former designer at NotebookLM.  \"It's that level of commitment to the end user I hadn't seen in other leaders,\" said Spielman, who left Google in January to join Martin at Huxe.At a Google all-hands meeting last December, Woodward took the microphone as the Zombie Nation song \"Kernkraft 400\" blared in the background. \"I'm going to try to do six demos in eight minutes,\" Woodward told the audience, according to audio obtained by CNBC. He started with Jules, a coding assistant. He showed off NotebookLM, which had received several updates. He then moved to Project Mariner, an AI-powered multitasking Chrome extension, and demoed AI video generator Veo and experimental AI tool Whisk. He also showed project Maya, an image generation tool built in collaboration with the Google Shopping team. Attendees erupted in applause after seeing all of the demos work in real time. Ahead of last year's I/O event, Woodward suggested Google host a second show tailored to staffers, according to two employees. Pichai quickly greenlit the proposal and dispatched Woodward's Labs teams to make it a reality. The result was Demo Slam, where employees showed off rapid demos to an audience of their peers, who could also try the products. It was such a hit that Google hosted a second Demo Slam in May, the same week as I/O.Expectations are high for Woodward, and Google broadly, to continue delivering new AI features in 2026. But with 2025 wrapping up, Pichai sees the company riding high. \"The momentum has been incredible to see,\" Pichai said at a recent all-hands meeting. \"We've been shipping at a pretty fast pace across the company\"WATCH: Battle of the chatbotswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowIntel was once the world's largest semiconductor company, but its market cap plummeted in recent years as the chipmaker fell behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and spent billions of dollars trying to catch up. Now, Intel has entered high-volume production of 18A, the new chip node it says will turn things around.The biggest problem? Convincing a big chipmaker to trust Intel with manufacturing on the new node. For now, Intel's only major customer is itself. The company's long-awaited Core Ultra series 3 PC processor, code-named Panther Lake, will come to PCs in January as the first major product made on 18A.\"It's become an internal node for now,\" said Daniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Group. \"So many companies have made such massive investments into TSMC to ensure yield, to ensure capacity wafers that they just will not make the switch just yet.\"Intel is pinning its hopes of attracting customers on a new chip fabrication plant, Fab52, in Chandler, Arizona, where CNBC got an exclusive on-camera tour in November. Some 50 miles north, in Phoenix, TSMC also has a new fab, where it's making chips with 4 nanometer technology. Its most advanced 2nm tech is currently only made in Taiwan.Intel's 18A is generally on par with TSMC's 2nm node in some metrics such as transistor density. But as Intel works out the kinks after years of delays on previous nodes, some 18A wafers have had defects, making for a lower number of usable chips per wafer, typically referred to as yield.\"Yields are always an issue at the advanced node. This is not an uncommon problem,\" said Harvard Business School professor David Yoffie, who served on Intel's board from 1989 to 2018. He pointed to early yield issues with Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs at TSMC that were quickly fixed.Intel's renewed focus on foundry — manufacturing chips for outside clients — came when Pat Gelsinger took the helm as CEO in 2021. Gelsinger was pushed out last December and replaced by Lip-Bu Tan in March. \"Over the past several years, the company invested too much, too soon – without adequate demand,\" Tan wrote in a memo in July. Intel's campus in Chandler, Arizona, now includes five chip fabrication plants, with Fab52 being the newest addition, shown here on November 17, 2025. Tony PuyolWith Intel awaiting a big outside customer, the U.S. government stepped up in August, taking a 10% stake in the company with an $8.9 billion investment, primarily coming from grants promised under the CHIPS Act signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.Days earlier, SoftBank invested $2 billion in Intel, followed by a $5 billion investment in September from Nvidia, which agreed to use some Intel technology but didn't commit to using its foundry.Here's a look behind the curtain of Intel's new chip factory where it hopes to find major foundry customers and, with them, redemption.Fall of a giantFounded in 1968 by Silicon Valley chip pioneers Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore and legendary investor Arthur Rock, Intel brought the world's first commercially available microprocessor to market just three years later. From the late 1970s through the early 2000s, Intel pumped out increasingly advanced process nodes at a rapid pace, leading to the term \"Moore's Law\" — the doubling of components on a chip every couple years.\"The 1990s was a period of wonder and excitement at Intel,\" Yoffie said. \"We were the world's largest semiconductor company, the world's most profitable.\"But Intel largely missed the mobile revolution, famously turning down a deal to make Apple's processors for the original iPhone. Then came a whiff in AI.In 2024, Intel saw its worst year ever, losing about 60% of its value. The plunge came after two of its previous chip nodes, 10nm and 7nm, were delayed by several years. Analysts say the delays may have been triggered by an earlier choice to hold off on using ASML's costly Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography machines. \"I think we lost the discipline of cycle time,\" said client computing head Jim Johnson, who joined Intel more than 30 years ago. \"Cycle time requires you to commit and deliver, and we started talking ourselves into, hey, we can have longer cycle times and try and lift more or do more.\"As it hustles to get back on track, Intel told CNBC there will be at least 15 EUV machines in Fab52.Intel 18A production manager Lea Tensuan shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov the EUV machines inside Fab52 in Chandler, Arizona, on November 17, 2025.By 2021, TSMC had become the node leader, and Intel began to outsource some leading-edge chip production to the Taiwanese giant. Around the same time, Apple began replacing Intel chips in Mac computers with its own M-series chips, also manufactured primarily at TSMC. In his earlier stint at Intel, more than a decade before rejoining as CEO, Gelsinger \"was given the responsibility to build a GPU to compete with Nvidia,\" Yoffie said. \"Unfortunately, that project failed and that ultimately meant we ended up not playing a significant role in the AI revolution.\"Intel may now be considering a deal to buy custom AI chip design startup SambaNova for $1.6 billion, though the company declined to comment on the matter.'Changing our culture'The trademark of Gelsinger's tenure as CEO was Intel's focus on chip manufacturing. His ambitious roadmap had Intel catching back up to TSMC by releasing five nodes in four years.Now, Tan is CEO and Naga Chandrasekaran is in charge of foundry.\"We are making yield improvements, defect density improvements, month-over-month and hitting our goals,\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC in an interview in November. \"So I believe we have turned the corner.\" Chandrasekaran joined Intel last year after more than two decades at leading memory maker Micron. He said his top goal is finding foundry customers.\"I have to become part of their team and convince them that they can trust Intel Foundry to execute,\" Chandrasekaran said. \"That's number one. And to do that, we are changing our culture. We are bringing a huge execution focus internally into Intel Foundry.\" Chandrasekaran told CNBC that Fab52 is capable of more than 10,000 18A wafer starts per week. There's more than a million square feet of manufacturing cleanroom space in Arizona, with five fabs all connected by 30 miles of overhead track moving wafers between them. A sixth fab, Fab62, is expected to be ready around 2028.18A also uses RibbonFet, Intel's gate-all-around architecture that improves power control by fully surrounding the transistor, unlike previous designs that only contact the top and sides. Chandrasekaran said 18A offers \"more than 15% performance per watt improvement\" over Intel 3.Perhaps the biggest way Intel stands out is in advanced packaging, the assembly and connections of chips onto the final systems where they appear in real-world applications. Intel engineer Shripad Gokhale shows CNBC's Katie Tarasov its next Xeon data center chip in Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler, Arizona, on November 17, 2025.Tony PuyolCNBC went to Intel's advanced packaging lab in Chandler to see several steps in the process, such as protecting chips with a polymer-based seal, and exposing them to a liquid that detects any defects. Yoffie said Intel's advanced packaging \"can help mitigate some of the power consumption problems.\"\"One of the biggest problems today for everybody making chips for data centers is the power that it consumes,\" Yoffie said.Chandrasekaran said the Arizona fab is on almost 100% renewable energy. As for water, Intel's Arizona facilities used more than 3 billion gallons in 2024 and returned 2.4 billion gallons to the local supply through a water recycling plant it has on site. 'No blank checks'Tan's message to employees when it comes to spending on future foundry nodes is clear: \"No more blank checks.\" The company needs customers.Intel's big new Ohio chip fab is delayed until at least 2030, and Tan has made major cost cuts by slashing 15% of the workforce in July and axing projects in Germany and Poland.\"That's what the company needed,\"  said Newman of Futurum. \"It needed to be faster. It needed to be leaner. It needed to be more focused. It needed someone that would be a little bit more shrewd.\"Tan is waiting to see how demand shapes up before giving solid details about Intel's next node, 14A.  Chandrasekaran told CNBC it will first be developed in Oregon, with a goal of volume production in 2028.Finding customers for 18A won't be easy. Unlike TSMC which only makes chips for outside clients, Intel also makes devices powered by its chips, positioning it as a competitor to some of the customers it hopes to land. \"If I'm an Nvidia or AMD or Qualcomm or Broadcom, do you really want to put your secret sauce into a manufacturing operation where you're giving Intel access to that secret sauce?\" Yoffie said.He suggests breaking out foundry into a different company.\"If you actually separated the two, I think you'd give Intel a much better shot at being successful,\" Yoffie said. \"And you'd also give the United States a much stronger position for being the home of a major semiconductor manufacturing organization.\"Intel client computing head Jim Johnson gives CNBC's Katie Tarasov an early look at its Panther Lake CPU in Santa Clara, California, on November 12, 2025.Marc GanleyFor now, Intel hopes Panther Lake will be a big proof point when it debuts in PCs from major companies like Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus and Acer in January. Intel's next data center chip, Xeon 6+, is also made on 18A.\"If you're a major company that wants to bet on a process node, you're going to feel a lot more comfortable if you see Intel ramping the heart of their client product line to high volume on that process node,\" Johnson said.Microsoft and Amazon signed early deals last year committing to use Intel's foundry for some of their in-house custom chips.\"It's a good sign, but of course their volumes are very small relative to Nvidia and the other major chip companies,\" Yoffie said.Recent reports suggest AMD is considering manufacturing at Intel, and one analyst predicts Apple may once again make some Mac chips at Intel by 2027.In the meantime, Intel got a lifeline with the U.S. government's 10% stake.\"It shows the confidence that the U.S. government has in Intel and the belief that we need to have leading edge R&D and manufacturing on U.S. soil,\" Chandrasekaran said.The government investment came days after President Donald Trump called for Tan to resign, then reversed course.\"I worry sometimes about the scope creep here and how the U.S. could decide to take stakes in all kinds of things,\" Newman said. \"But you have industries that we have let leave the U.S. to an extent that put us into indefensible risk, and we need to bring them back.\"Some 92% of the world's most advanced chips are made in Taiwan, following a decades-long decline in the percentage of chips made in the U.S.\"The stakes are incredibly high for Intel, for the U.S. and for the world,\" Yoffie said. \"The whole idea that the world's most advanced products are dependent on a single location in an island a few miles off the Chinese coast is a terrible situation for the whole world to have to deal with.\"Chandrasekaran, for his part, is committed to turning Intel into a manufacturer of advanced chips.\"As a semiconductor community, we have to enable this solution for the world to move forward with AI,\" he said. \"There's no other option than to be successful.\" WATCH:  Inside the Arizona chip fab key to Intel's redemption",

    "body": "Company: LKQ Corp. (LKQ)Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.Stock Market Value: $7.66 billion ($30.15 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: 0.39%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.Behind the scenesLKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Ask any job seeker today and they'll likely tell you it's a challenging time to be looking for work.If you're wondering where the jobs are, LinkedIn offers a look in a new ranking. The professional networking site on Wednesday released its annual Jobs on the Rise list identifying the 25 fastest-growing occupations in the US based on data from the past 2.5 years.The ranking takes into account millions of jobs that LinkedIn members started from Jan. 1, 2023 to July 31, 2025 to calculate a growth rate for each job title. To be ranked, a job title needed to show consistent, positive growth across LinkedIn's membership base, and to have grown by 2025 to a meaningful size, which LinkedIn says varies by market and year based on total available jobs.Jobs in AI make up three of the top five positions on the list, indicating \"continued momentum in both technical and strategic AI roles,\" the report says.Self-employed careers also took up several spots, like strategic advisors and independent consultants at No. 7 and founders at No. 9. In addition, the number of members adding \"founder\" to their profile has climbed 60% year-over-year, a December LinkedIn report noted, and nearly tripled since 2022.\"Rising costs and economic uncertainty may be pushing many to rethink the traditional career ladder, which may no longer feel as secure or linear as it once did,\" LinkedIn career expert Catherine Fisher tells CNBC Make It. She notes that \"founder\" on LinkedIn's list refers not only to startup founders but also to people building side hustles, consulting brands, microbusinesses and creator-led services.\"Full-time roles are still important, but contract work, advisory roles and portfolio careers are fast becoming a strategic way to build experience, stay competitive and create opportunity for yourself,\" she says.For job seekers trying to break into the roles or industries that made the list, take stock of the skills you already have.\"The most successful pivots aren't about starting from scratch — they're about translating existing skills into new contexts,\" Fisher says. \"Spending time thinking about the skills you have and how they might transfer to one of these growing roles can help unlock opportunities for job seekers.\"Here are the top 10 jobs on the rise from LinkedIn's list, as well as their most common skills, hiring hot spots, and roles people switched from for these.

    "body": "GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen.CNBCGameStop has laid out a a massive, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Chairman and CEO Ryan Cohen that will only pay out if the video game retailer's stock and profits soar to levels far beyond anything it has achieved to date.The board of GameStop granted Cohen performance-based stock options tied to a $100 billion market-capitalization target and $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to a statement released Wednesday. Under the terms of the plan, Cohen receives nothing unless the minimum thresholds are met, and there is no partial credit if targets are missed. If GameStop fails to reach at least $20 billion in market capitalization and $2 billion in cumulative EBITDA, none of the options will vest.GameStop shares slid 36% last year and the company currently has a market cap of $9.3 billion. The company reported a net income of $77.1 million in the third quarter. If Cohen hits the goals, the total award will be for stock options to purchase 171,537,327 shares of GameStop's Class A common stock at a price of $20.66 per share.Cohen, who joined the board in January 2021 and later became CEO, has been the central figure in GameStop's post-meme-stock transformation. The company has made a few moves aimed at broadening its business beyond physical video-game sales, including an expansion into collectibles, trading cards as well as buying bitcoin aggressively with its corporate cash. What remains absent, however, is a clear master plan for how those initiatives translate into the scale of growth implied by the compensation targets. The compensation structure, the company said, is intended to align Cohen's incentives directly with long-term shareholder returns by tying his compensation entirely to what it called \"extraordinary growth.\"",

Marco Bello | ReutersJPMorgan said its asset management division has fully parted ways with controversial proxy advisors for shareholder votes. In an internal memo, the firm said it no longer needs third-party data collection or voting recommendations. Instead, it launched an artificial intelligence tool, Proxy IQ, to aggregate and analyze proxy data from 3,000 annual company meetings. Proxy advisors such as Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis typically provide research and voting recommendations. JPMorgan said it is the first major investment firm to eliminate reliance on such companies. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news earlier Wednesday.Proxy advisors have been under fire from President Donald Trump, who signed an executive order in December to reassess existing rules. Trump said the proxy advisors \"regularly use their substantial power to advance and prioritize radical politically-motivated agendas.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musk also lashed out at proxy advisors last October, calling them \"corporate terrorists,\" after ISS recommended shareholders reject his nearly $1 trillion pay package.",

Trump has called for U.S. oil majors to invest billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector. When asked whether the president would deploy troops to protect U.S. oil workers, Leavitt said Trump would do what is in the best interests of the American people and the energy industry. \"It's not something he wants to do, diplomacy is always the first option,\" Leavitt said. The U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela, she said. Trump will meet with oil executives at the White House on Friday, sources told CNBC's Brian Sullivan. The CEOs of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips as well as a representative from Chevron are expected to attend the meeting.Energy Secretary Chris Wright will speak with oil executives at Goldman Sachs' annual energy conference in Miami on Wednesday, a Department of Energy spokesperson told CNBC. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela, under a special license issued by the U.S. The U.S. ousted President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid over the weekend and took him to New York where he faces charges in a federal drug-trafficking conspiracy indictment.The Trump administration has built up military forces in the Caribbean, including the deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford and its carrier strike group. The president told NBC News on Monday that the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela. Energy analysts say U.S. oil companies will need certainty about the security situation and stability of the government in Venezuela to invest in the country. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The South American country was recently producing about 800,000 barrels per day, according to data from energy consulting firm Kpler. Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela will send 30 million to 50 million barrels of sanctioned oil to the U.S., which will be sold at market prices. The energy secretary said Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely.  \"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela — first this backed up stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\" Wright said at Goldman Sachs' energy conference. \"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" the energy secretary said.

Kennedy Jr. attend a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission event, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 22, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Tuesday said it was freezing $10 billion in federal grant funds for certain child care and family assistance programs in five states because of \"serious concerns about widespread fraud\" in state-administered programs.All five states targeted by the freeze — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York — are led by Democrats.The action applies to three programs overseen by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Children and Families: Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Social Services Block Grant.The move comes a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dropped his bid for a third term amid political fallout from widespread fraud in social service programs in the state, including child-care services, which a federal prosecutor has estimated cost more than $9 billion.\"Families who rely on child care and family assistance programs deserve confidence that these resources are used lawfully and for their intended purpose,\" said Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O'Neill in a statement.\"This action reflects our commitment to program integrity, fiscal responsibility, and compliance with federal requirements,\" O'Neill said.More than $7.3 billion in TANF funds have been frozen, and nearly $2.4 billion in CCDF funds have been frozen. Nearly $840 million in Social Services Block Grant funding was frozen.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker blasted President Donald Trump for the freeze.\"Rather than making it more affordable for families, Trump is stripping away child care from those just trying to go to work,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on X. \"Thousands depend on these programs, and now their livelihoods are at risk,\" Pritzker wrote. \"It's wrong and cruel — we'll take every step possible to defend Illinoisians.\"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, in a tweet, wrote, \"Trump is threatening to freeze $10 billion in child care funding in blue states to make life harder and more expensive for kids and families. It's vindictive. It's cruel. And we'll fight it with every fiber of our being.\"HHS on Monday announced that it was rescinding a series of child-care rules implemented under the Biden administration \"that required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.\"\"The change will roll back provisions in the 2024 Child Care and Development Fund rule that weakened oversight and increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse in federally-funded state child care — including programs now under investigation in Minnesota,\" HHS said in a statement on Monday.The department last week froze all federal child care funding for Minnesota, which totals about $185 million annually.",

The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for additional information.Trump griped in the post that \"massive\" shareholder dividends and buybacks were taking place \"at the expense and detriment of investing in Plants and Equipment.\"\"This situation will no longer be allowed or tolerated!\" Trump wrote in the post, which warned the defense industry to \"BEWARE.\"\"Therefore, I will not permit Dividends or Stock Buybacks for Defense Companies until such time as these problems are rectified — Likewise, for Salaries and Executive Compensation,\" he wrote.Military equipment \"must be built now with the Dividends, Stock Buybacks, and Over Compensation of Executives, rather than borrowing from Financial Institutions, or getting the money from your Government,\" Trump added.While the tech industry leads the way in buybacks, defense companies have also spent big repurchasing stock in recent years.Northrop Grumman, for example, spent $1.17 billion on stock buybacks in the nine months ended Sept. 30 and paid out $964 million in dividends to shareholders over that time period.Lockheed spent $2.25 billion on stock buybacks in the nine months ended Sept. 28, while paying out $2.33 billion in dividends.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks during the daily briefing in the Brady Briefing Room of the White House in Washington, DC, on Jan. 7, 2026. Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday shared new U.S. nutrition guidelines, advising Americans to eat more \"real food\" and reduce their intake of highly processed foods and added sugars.The government's new food pyramid replaces the MyPlate diagram released under President Barack Obama, and emphasizes protein, full-fat dairy and vegetables. The most significant changes under the updated guidelines include prioritizing protein over carbohydrates, recommending full-fat dairy instead of low-fat options, and cutting out processed foods like white bread, chips and candy.\"Healthy fats\" like full-fat dairy and avocados have also been added to the pyramid, and the guidelines recommend cooking with olive oil, butter or beef tallow. \"We are ending the war on saturated fats,\" Kennedy said at a White House press briefing on Wednesday.Similarly, the website announcing the new guidelines declares, \"We are ending the war on protein.\"Kennedy called the new guidelines the \"most significant reset of federal nutrition policy in history.\"Source: HHSHis \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda has taken aim at processed foods and sugary beverages, while pushing more controversial dietary changes like cooking with beef tallow and consuming more red meat, which many public health experts say can lead to cardiovascular and other health issues in excess. The backbone of the MAHA platform is that healthier diets will prevent chronic disease, according to Kennedy.In response to the MAHA push, food and beverage giants like PepsiCo and J.M. Smucker have announced plans to phase out synthetic dyes and other artificial ingredients. Since Kennedy's confirmation, the industry has feared greater regulation, particularly regarding ultra-processed foods, although major policy changes haven't happened yet. The USDA and HHS release updated dietary guidelines every five years. While many Americans may brush off the recommendations, the guidelines are intended as a public health tool to inform health-care providers, federal agencies, policymakers and nutrition experts. The food industry also takes them into account, given the wide reach of the guidelines. Changes in the dietary recommendations will trickle down to school lunches and federal nutrition programs. The consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest estimates that 1 in 4 Americans will be directly affected by changes in the guidelines. More than a year ago, an advisory committee of health and nutrition experts said that Americans should eat more plant-based food and low-fat dairy and consume less red meat and sugary beverages, based on a review of scientific evidence. However, it is unclear if the USDA and HHS used the report to inform the dietary guidelines announced on Wednesday.",

Airlines offer elite loyalty program members perks — ranging from earlier boarding and a free checked bag to free upgrades to roomier cabins and airport lounge memberships — in exchange for lots of flights on the carrier and its partners, as well as co-branding credit card spending.Airlines in recent years have switched their loyalty program models to reward travelers' spending instead of simply how far they fly.American said it is also adding more perks for milestones in between earned status tiers, like two food and beverage coupons at the 15,000-point level or a subscription to The New York Times games or cooking platforms or the Times' sports publication, The Athletic. The first level of elite status, Gold, is awarded at 40,000 loyalty points.The carrier has been investing in new cabins and larger lounges and on Tuesday said it is starting to offer free in-flight Wi-Fi, a plan it announced last April.

John Lamparski | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe statement was posted hours after a tweet by the conservative independent journalist Nick Sortor, which contained a video of him visiting the Hampton Inn by Hilton Lakeview Minneapolis on Monday night — hours after Everpeak issued its apology — and trying to book 10 rooms for what Sortor said were DHS employees.\"So, we're not accepting people from Immigration, ICE agents, DHS into our property,\" the clerk said. \"That's just our management, ownership.\"When Sortor said he thought the policy had changed \"today\" — Monday — the clerk replied, \"I just talked to the owner of the building, and he didn't say there had been any changes.\"\"Yeah, it's just policy,\" the clerk said. The clerk, who also said \"I'm new here,\" then repeated that he had not been informed of any policy changes, and he offered to speak to the owner. When the clerk returned, he said he had been unable to reach anyone in authority because of the late hour.Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement officers question a man's status on Lake Street near a Somali mall called the Karmel Mall in Minnesota, United States on December 10, 2025.

    "body": "An American flag flies at Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, California, on Sept. 12, 2025.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. Discovery board on Wednesday once again unanimously recommended that WBD shareholders reject a hostile takeover offer from Paramount Skydance. The board said it continued to believe the Paramount bid is \"inferior\" to a previously announced deal with Netflix to buy WBD's studio and streaming business for $72 billion. \"We have a signed merger agreement with Netflix, it's a compelling value, a clear path to closing and protections for our shareholders if something stops the close, whatever that might be,\" WBD board Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber on \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday morning. In the days following the announcement of that deal, Paramount launched its hostile bid, taking directly to shareholders an offer of $30 per share, all cash for the entirety of Warner Bros. Discovery, including its TV networks. WBD's board made an initial recommendation to reject the offer, and Paramount subsequently made another push for the coveted assets. In late December Paramount guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison, the father of Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, as a clear response to questions raised by WBD's board. Di Piazza previously told CNBC that the board had concerns about the backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. In an amended offer late last year, Paramount said Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. However, Paramount Skydance stopped short of upping the amount of its bid.  \"PSKY has repeatedly failed to submit the best proposal for WBD shareholders despite clear direction from WBD on both the deficiencies and potential solutions,\" the WBD board said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday. \"The WBD Board, management team and our advisors have extensively engaged with PSKY representatives and provided it with explicit instructions on how to improve each of its offers. Yet PSKY has continued to submit offers that still include many of the deficiencies we previously repeatedly identified to PSKY, none of which are present in the Netflix merger agreement, all while asserting that its offers do not represent its 'best and final' proposal,\" the board continued. In a Wednesday letter to members of the WBD board, Pentwater Capital Management CEO Matthew Halbower said the board has \"made an error\" in not engaging with Paramount's revised bid. Pentwater is WBD's seventh largest shareholder.\"Paramount has offered a $30 per share that is economically superior, it is superior in terms of regulatory risk, and I understand the board has some legitimate issues with it, but those legitimate issues don't warrant giving Paramount the stiff arm and refusing to actually have a conversation,\" Halbower told Faber Wednesday morning. \"That's not how I want my board of directors to act.\"Halbower's letter argues that the board's reasons for not engaging with Paramount's bid were insufficient and that the board has \"breached its fiduciary obligations\" to its shareholders.\"We are a small voice, but I think it's important for the board to at least hear our voice as the seventh largest shareholder, because I think what they are doing is wrong,\" Halbower said on CNBC. \"If Paramount goes away, then it is a lost opportunity.\"watch nowParamount first showed interest in acquiring all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets in September. The company made three takeover offers before Warner Bros. Discovery kicked off a formal sale process, inviting other bidders into the fold. Representatives for Paramount didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Netflix issued its own statement welcoming the WBD board's recommendation and noting it has been engaging with the U.S. Department of Justice and European Commission on antitrust concerns surrounding the merger. \"The WBD Board remains fully supportive of and continues to recommend Netflix's merger agreement, recognizing it as the superior proposal that will deliver the greatest value to its stockholders, as well as consumers, creators and the broader entertainment industry,\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said in the statement.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said the U.S. should bar large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans.\"For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing, but now, because of the Record High Inflation caused by Joe Biden and the Democrats in Congress, that American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post Wednesday.\"It is for that reason, and much more, that I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it. People live in homes, not corporations,\" he added.Private equity giants, real estate investment trusts and other large institutional investors have amassed sizable portfolios of single-family rental homes over the past decade. Many have argued that these investments have reduced housing supply for would-be homeowners and helped drive up prices. Invitation Homes, which is the largest renter of single-family homes in the country, tumbled 7%. Shares of Blackstone, an investing firm that owns and rents single-family homes, dropped more than 4%. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management also declined over 4%.Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. Trump said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio said Wednesday he will introduce a bill to make it harder for larger investors to buy single family homes.The national median existing single-family home price was $426,800 in the third quarter of 2025 after hitting a record high of $435,300 in the summer, according to the National Association of Realtors. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage is currently at 6.19%, according to Mortgage News Daily.Blackstone was the largest private-equity owner of apartments in the U.S. with more than 230,000 units, according to data from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project released last year. Blackstone in recent years has spent billions acquiring real estate companies such as Tricon Residential, American Campus Communities and AIR Communities.— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed reporting.",

Tim Evans | ReutersU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fatally shot a woman in her car on Wednesday on a residential street in Minneapolis, authorities said.Department of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and another top DHS official both claimed that the dead woman engaged in an \"act of domestic terrorism\" by intentionally trying to run down ICE agents.But Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey scoffed at that account, citing video footage they had seen.Frey called DHS' claims \"bulls---\" and \"a garbage narrative.\"Videos of the incident that were posted on social media show the woman being shot within seconds by an ICE agent who was standing at the front of her SUV when she began driving off after being told to exit her vehicle.Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said his department secured the \"crime scene\" and that the incident is being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. O'Hara said the state bureau will probe \"whether any state laws ... have been violated.\"The shooting came during increased tension over a surge of ICE and DHS agents to Minneapolis, criticism of the city's large Somali population by President Donald Trump, and the Trump administration's focus on a series of frauds against social service programs administered by Minnesota that receive federal support.Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, in a post on X, said, \"Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them — an act of domestic terrorism.\"Video from the scene posted on social media shows ICE officers pulling up to a group of cars parked on a residential street.\"Get the f--- out of our neighborhood,\" a woman is heard saying on the video, apparently from behind the camera.ICE agents then quickly exited their truck and walked up to a vehicle blocking the road, saying, \"Ma'am, get out of the car, out of the car, get out of the f---ing car,\" the video shows. One agent grabbed the handle of the driver's side door and tried to open it, and reached inside the vehicle, the video shows.The car then backs up slightly and begins pulling away, the video shows.Another agent, who had been standing up the road from the woman's vehicle, walks up to the front of the car and draws his pistol and quickly fires toward the car's windshield as the vehicle begins moving forward at him, according to videos. He appears to have fired at least three shots.One video aired by KSTP 5 in Minneapolis shows the agent who pulled his pistol appearing to lean on or toward woman's SUV vehicle at the time it began moving forward, and then firing.Less than three seconds pass between the car reversing and moving forward, and the beginning of the gunfire.\"Oh f---ing, God!\" a woman screams on the video.The vehicle that was shot at quickly crashes down the street into another car.\"Dude, you did a murder, for what?\" a man yells on the video.Noem, the DHS secretary, during a speech said, \"Our ICE officers were out in an enforcement action.\"\"They got stuck in the snow because of the adverse weather that is in Minneapolis,\" Noem said. \"They were attempting to push out their vehicle and a woman attacked them, and those surrounding them, and attempted to run them over and ram them with her vehicle.\"Noem said, \"An officer of ours acted quickly and defensively shot to protect himself and the people around him and my understanding is that she was hit and is deceased.\"There is no footage on the video supporting Noem's claim that the officers were trying to push their vehicle out of any snow, or that the woman attacked them as they were doing so right before the shooting occurred. The truck carrying the agents was driving up the street when it stopped and the agents got out. The street was clear of any snow.Walz, the governor, in a tweet said, \"I've seen the video. Don't believe this propaganda machine.\"\"The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice,\" Walz said.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

They're ripping families apart,\" Frey said.\"They're sowing chaos on our streets, and in this case, quite literally killing people, so they are already trying to spin this as an action of self-defense,\" the mayor said. \"Having seen the video of myself, I want to tell everybody directly that is bulls---. This was an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying, getting killed,\" Frey said. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., in a post on X, wrote, \"I'm following news of a reported shooting of a legal observer by ICE agents in South Minneapolis.\"\"ICE must stop terrorizing our communities and leave our city,\" Omar wrote. Correction: Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called DHS' claims about the incident \"a garbage narrative.\" A previous version of this story misattributed the quote.",

Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate sector job creation turned positive in December though at a bit softer pace than expected, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.Companies added 41,000 hires for the month, a reversal from the loss of 29,000 in November, providing a positive sign for a labor market that otherwise struggled as 2025 came to a close. Private company payrolls had declined in three of the four months before the December release.The final tally was slightly less than the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 48,000. Payroll growth came entirely in services industries as education and health-related fields added 39,000 jobs and leisure and hospitality contributed 24,000. Trade, transportation and utilities gained 11,000 while financial services rose by 6,000.Offsetting those gains were losses of 29,000 in professional and business services and 12,000 in information services. Goods-producing industries lost 3,000, due primarily to a drop of 5,000 in manufacturing.Nearly all the job gains came in companies employing fewer than 500 workers. Larger firms added just 2,000.\"Small establishments recovered from November job losses with positive end-of-year hiring, even as large employers pulled back,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson.The November total was revised form an initially reported loss of 32,000.Wage gains continued to be tempered, with those staying in their jobs seeing an average annual increase of 4.4%, unchanged from November, while job changers saw gains of 6.6%, or 0.3 percentage point better than the prior month.The report comes two days ahead of the more closely watched nonfarm payrolls count from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS data collection had been hampered by the government shutdown. This will be the first on-time release of the report since the impasse was resolved.Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect 73,000 new jobs for the month, up from 64,000 in November, while the unemployment rate is seen edging down to 4.5%.

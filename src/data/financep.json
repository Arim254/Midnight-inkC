    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

    "body": "India's government plans a modest improvement in its fiscal picture in the coming financial year, with reductions in the fiscal deficit and debt, while boosting manufacturing in sectors ranging from textiles to chips.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in her ninth consecutive budget speech, said on Sunday that the government sees its fiscal deficit falling to 4.3% of GDP in the 2026-27 financial year, down from 4.4% in 2025-26.Sitharaman said the government expects India's debt-to-GDP ratio to fall to 55.6% in the coming financial year from 56.1% in 2025-26.The finance minister pointed to the wider uncertainties facing India.\"Today, we face an external environment in which trade and multilateralism are imperilled and access to resources and supply chains are disrupted,\" Sitharaman said. \"New technologies are transforming production systems while sharply increasing demands on water, energy and critical minerals.\"The government plans to encourage manufacturing in seven key sectors, including semiconductors, rare-earth magnets, pharmaceuticals, chemicals, capital goods, textiles and sports goods.India's benchmark Nifty 50 stock index was down about 1.7% shortly after Sitharaman's speech to parliament and closed 1.96% lower.In its economic survey for the financial year 2026 released on Thursday, India said it sees its economy growing between 6.8% to 7.2% in the fiscal year 2027, outpacing most other major economies.\"As a growing economy with expanding trade and capital needs, India must also remain deeply integrated with global markets, exporting more and attracting stable long-term investment,\" Sitharaman said.Consultancy firm PwC India said the budget places the country \"at a crossroads to push the nation into its next phase of transformation\".\"The Union Budget 2026-27 holds opportunities to set India's role towards financial stability, while boosting businesses to be future ready — especially as they navigate the opportunities of AI adoption alongside challenges around talent, infrastructure, governance and trust,\" PwC India said in an online commentary.",

    "body": "Latin America's media landscape is being reshaped by a new suite of entertainment producers, as short drama platforms, often with business ties to China, command an increasingly large share of the region's video streaming market.According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower's State of Mobile 2026 report published last week, demand for short dramas is driving a \"structural shift in consumer attention\", with such content thriving in Latin America.Globally, the number of downloads of short-drama platforms surged by 186% year-on-year, to 733 million in the fourth quarter of 2025, surpassing those of video-streaming platforms like Netflix and Disney+, at 658 million, according to the report.Short dramas, also known as \"micro\", or \"mini\" dramas, refer to vertically-shot serials featuring episodes typically no longer than three minutes long.\"The appeal of short dramas lies in their ability to deliver emotional intensity and stimulation, which is also what allowed the format to rise so rapidly in popularity\", says Wenjia Tang, research associate from the University of Sydney's Media and Communications department.First popularized in China on short-form content-sharing apps like Douyin, a sister app of TikTok, and Kuaishou, short dramas have found international appeal, with popular platforms such as ReelShort and DramaBox now producing content dubbed in English, Spanish and French, among others.Although short dramas are increasingly expected to meet higher standards of production quality and professionalism, their original narrative style has largely been retained - delivering low-effort, low-commitment entertainment that requires neither deep thought nor extended attention, Tang told CNBC.Such content is often \"easier to digest\" for consumers accustomed to watching short-form content like TikTok videos and Instagram reels, as opposed to longer-form content from streaming platforms like Netflix, according to Seema Shah, Vice President of Insights at Sensor Tower.Sensor Tower reports that although there is a significant global uptick in consumption of short-drama content, Latin America is \"emerging as the fastest-growing region for engagement\" with these videos.Latin American downloads of the top 20 short drama apps have increased by roughly 402% year-on-year in 2025, on top of a 4,300% year-on-year increase from 2024, according to Shah.Not only do Latin American users overwhelmingly consume entertainment content on their mobile phones, there are also strong similarities between short dramas and telenovelas - a genre of serialized drama popular in Latin American countries, according to Maria Rua Aguete, Head of Media and Entertainment at research firm Omdia.Dramatic growthShort drama platforms DramaBox and ReelShort consistently ranked as two of the region's most downloaded video entertainment apps, with ReelShort's 77 million downloads in 2025 slightly edging out Dramabox's 74 million downloads, according to figures provided by Shah.While officially based abroad, both platforms have business ties to China.ReelShort is owned by Crazy Maple Studio, a content creation and distribution enterprise founded in 2017 in San Francisco. Despite having offices in Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, Crazy Maple Studio remains a subsidiary of the COL Digital Publishing Group - a Chinese media conglomerate.Micro drama custom thumb for digital video.ReelShort | GoodShort | DramaBox | Getty ImagesSimilarly, while officially headed by the Singapore-based Storymatrix Pte. Ltd, DramaBox's content remains the intellectual property of China's DianZhong Technology, according to a copyright infringement claim that it filed against Crazy Maple Studio in 2025.ReelShort and DramaBox are part of a suite of entertainment firms competing for a stake in Latin America's growing video streaming market.Omdia estimates that the total revenue generated by the Latin American market grew by 9.1% between 2024 to 2025 - more than triple the revenue growth in the U.S. over the same period. That growth is projected to accelerate to 10.7% in 2026.Latin America's expanding middle class is driving the growth in demand for short-video streaming, along with retail and ride-sharing services, according to Shah.Short-drama platforms aren't the only beneficiaries of the growing Latin American market. The region is also an important source of revenue growth for streaming giants like Netflix, which saw the fastest revenue growth on an FX-neutral basis from Latin America, according to its Q4 2025 earnings report.While the download figures of short-drama platforms have begun surpassing those of longer-form providers, experts do not see these new short video streaming platforms as credible threats to market leaders like Netflix.\"Not now, and it is not their targets either. They are aiming for different audiences, and their profit manners are different,\" Tang told CNBC.While short-drama platforms have lower production costs and can produce content at a much higher rate than more traditional studios, their business models are generally contingent on advertising revenue and pay-per-view income, which does not necessarily translate into higher margins, according to Omdia's Rua Aguete.Omdia estimates that the total revenue for all short-drama streaming platforms generated from outside China will amount to $3 billion in 2026. In comparison, Netflix reported $12 billion in revenue in Q4 2025.Nonetheless, as demand for short-drama content grows in Latin America and beyond, it is likely that these platforms will produce an increasingly diversified video-streaming market.\"I don't believe short-drama apps are a complete replacement for streaming. They are, however, additional competition for consumers' attention and dollars,\" says Sensor Tower's Shah.",

    "body": "When I was in college, in between my English and creative writing classes, I would race a few blocks downtown to volunteer at an animal shelter on the east side of Manhattan. Getting lost in books and spending time with shelter dogs were the twin pillars that held together the chaos of my twenties, and what kept me sane and motivated day after day. The north star of my career has been telling stories about animals in need. My first job out of college was working for a dog photographer. I followed him around New York City, and then the country, and then the world, helping to carry camera equipment and making notes of all the dogs we met that day. I didn't make good money, but I loved it. After seven years, I was unexpectedly let go. It was the eve of my 30th birthday, and I was suddenly without a job. I had two options: I could find another position, or I could try to make it on my own. The choice, for me, was simple. I had to at least try to make a name for myself, doing what I loved most, which was helping dogs.Sharing my foster dogs with the world This upheaval all coincided with me moving into a new apartment with my now-fiancé, Jacob, and our special needs rescue dog, Simon. This apartment was special because after living in seven New York City apartments, I had a backyard for the first time. I had fostered some dogs over the years, but with a big yard and a rare dog-loving landlord, I decided it was a great time to really lean into it again.Sitting in our backyard with Simon and one of our foster dogs, Twinkle.Photo: Isabel KleeWe welcomed our first foster, a Heeler mix named Ken, a few months after moving into the new apartment. On our way to pick him up, I handed Jacob my phone and asked him to take a video of me. I had an Instagram audience of about 50,000 followers, where I posted videos about my dog. But I decided that I wanted to highlight the process of fostering, every step of the way. I wanted to show people exactly how it was done, so it wouldn't be so intimidating for people who might want to try it themselves.I spoke to the camera and explained what we were doing in the sweltering subway tunnels, my excitement and nervousness bubbling off me. We recorded the entire thing: Ken coming off the transport van, bringing him back to our apartment, and introducing him to Simon. One of our fosters, Whimsy, hanging out with Simon on our couch. Simon always seems to know what his foster siblings need to feel comfortable.Photo: Isabel KleeAfterwards, I edited the clips together and posted it to Instagram and TikTok. Miraculously, for whatever reason, people loved it. The video blew up. On TikTok it got 257,000 views, 27,000 likes, and over 500 comments. I was in shock by how people responded to it, and the immediate emotional connection these strangers on the internet felt with Ken. So I continued: a video of us giving Ken a bath, a video of Ken playing with Simon, a video of Ken chasing bubbles I blew for him in the backyard. And, finally, a video of Ken getting adopted by his new mom.The magic of seeing a dog be loved for the first time Over the week that we had Ken, my audience grew. People wanted to see his journey, and the process of fostering a dog in New York City. But, more than anything, I think people wanted to see a happy, feel-good story play out in front of their eyes, to feel a piece of magic that happens when a dog is loved for the very first time.After that first foster, I decided to focus on fostering primarily medical and behavioral cases. Simon has struggled with idiopathic epilepsy his entire life, and my experience caring for him completely shifted the way I interacted with the world and the level of patience I have. Poutine, one of our medical fosters, who stole the internet's heart.Photo: Isabel KleePlus, most rescues and shelters cover all costs associated with fostering: supplies, food, and any medical procedures a dog might need, so the only thing I needed to sacrifice was my time and heart.I wanted to tell the stories of the dogs who would otherwise be forgotten and show the world how incredible they are. One of our fosters, Gus, was actually adopted by my parents.Photo: Isabel KleeSince Ken, I have fostered nearly 30 difficult medical cases and found them all loving homes. I've raised over half a million dollars for animal welfare organizations. I've worked with brands like Toyota, Chewy, The Farmer's Dog, and Williams Sonoma. I've grown my audience to over two million followers across platforms. And, my greatest dream came true. I wrote a memoir called \"Dogs, Boys, and Other Things I've Cried About,\" and it will be published in the spring.I feel like the luckiest person in the world to have made a career doing exactly what I've always dreamed of: helping dogs and telling stories. I have more freedom, I make more money, and I'm making a bigger impact. Our foster dog Itsy perching with Simon in the bedroom.Photo: Isabel KleeMy best advice for turning your passion into a career My biggest advice for people who hope to make their passion their full-time job is to start small. Before I went out on my own, I did freelance content creation for a year and a half. I reached out to every dog brand I could think of and asked if they needed help creating content or managing their social media. My biggest client was Adopt a Pet and Kinship, where I got to travel to shelters and highlight adoptable dogs. It wasn't until it became unsustainable to work full time and do content creation that I actually stopped those jobs. But the connections I made absolutely helped forge my way as an independent creator.Spending time with Simon never gets old.Photo: Isabel KleeEvery day looks different for me: Some days I'm picking up a dog from the shelter and scrubbing feces off of them, some days I'm doing a photoshoot with my previous foster dogs for Oscar de la Renta, and some days I'm sitting in a coffee shop, hoping to meet my writing deadline on time.What has become most apparent to me, through every foster dog and every journey I document, is that dogs are one of the greatest human connectors that we have. They represent life, love, loss, joy, sadness, and living each day in the moment. They ground us, motivate us, and when you tell their stories, people can't help but listen. Never in a million years did I think that telling my stories could turn into a career. But as I sit in my Brooklyn apartment with my rescue dog snoring at my feet, I am eternally grateful that it did. Isabel Klee is a dog owner, writer and content creator.

Senate Democrats demanded changes to the package that the House originally passed after two U.S. citizens were shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minnesota. Democrats ultimately had the Department of Homeland Security funding stripped from the package and replaced with a two-week stopgap. Now, the amended package has to be reapproved by the House.The House is set to begin taking up the bill on Monday. The House Rules Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday, the first step in that process.Read more CNBC politics coverageMore Jeffrey Epstein files being released by DOJ, Blanche saysLuigi Mangione won't face death penalty in CEO murder case, federal judge rulesSenate to vote on funding deal soon as shutdown looms, GOP Sens. predictFeds arrested Don Lemon, former CNN anchor, over Minnesota activities: LawyerSen.

House Democrats are demanding assurances that changes to DHS's immigration operations will be finalized before voting on the spending package. \"Well, we're going to have that conversation later on today and as we return to Washington. But the one thing that we've said publicly is that we need a robust path toward dramatic reform,\" Jeffries, D-N.Y., said on ABC's \"This Week\" when asked how he and Democrats will vote. \"The administration can't just talk the talk. They need to walk the walk. That should begin today. Not in two weeks, today,\" he said.Sources familiar with the matter told MS NOW over the weekend that Jeffries spoke with Johnson and said Democrats will not provide the votes to fast-track the spending package, potentially jeopardizing the end of the shutdown this week.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said on \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he will vote against the package when it comes to the floor. \"I'm not just a no, I'm a firm no, and I'm going to advocate with colleagues that they vote no,\" Khanna said. \"I just in good conscience cannot vote to give more money to ICE agents as they're violating our constitutional rights.\"Democratic resistance to the package makes Johnson's job of pushing the package through significantly harder. He has a razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House, set to dwindle further after Democrat Christian Menefee won a special election in Texas. \"I have a one-vote margin, yes, for the rest of 2026,\" Johnson said. \"But we're going to demonstrate once again that this is the party that takes governing seriously.\"In addition to the stopgap for DHS, the package includes bills to fully fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education through the remainder of the fiscal year.This story is developing.

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: CoStar Group Inc (CSGP)Business: CoStar Group engages in the provision of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the commercial and residential property markets. It operates through the following segments: CoStar Portfolio, Information Services Portfolio, Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio. The CoStar Portfolio segment consists of two classes of trade receivables based on geographical location: North America and International. The Information Services Portfolio segment includes four classes of trade receivables: CoStar Real Estate Manager; Hospitality, North America; Hospitality, International; and other Information Services. The Multifamily Portfolio, LoopNet Portfolio and Other Marketplaces Portfolio segments focus on one class of trade receivables. The company was founded by Andrew Florance and Michael Klein in 1987 and is headquartered in Arlington, Va.Stock Market Value: $26.07B ($61.50 per share) Ownership: 0.71%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Third Point is a multi-strategy hedge fund founded by Dan Loeb, that will selectively take activist positions. Loeb is one of the true pioneers in the field of shareholder activism and one of a handful of activists who shaped what has become modern-day shareholder activism. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. Third Point has amicably gotten board representation at companies like Baxter and Disney, but the firm will not hesitate to launch a proxy fight if it is being ignored.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Third Point sent a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related residential real estate (RRE) businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core commercial real estate (CRE) business. Third Point was previously bound by standstill restrictions following a settlement for board seats last year, which expired on Jan. 27. The firm now plans to nominate a new slate of directors.Behind the scenesCoStar Group (CSGP) is a provider of online real estate marketplaces, information, and analytics in the property market. It manages major brands including CoStar Suite, LoopNet, Apartments.com and Homes.com. Approximately 95% of the company's revenue is derived from its core commercial real estate (\"CRE\") franchises, which largely consists of CoStar Suite and Apartments.com. These businesses benefit from high barriers to entry, strong pricing power, proprietary data and subscription-based business models that drive recurring revenue and highly predictable free cash flow. Because of these dynamics, this business has historically traded at a premium to its Information Services peers but is now trading in line with them.This regression in the company's valuation largely stems from CoStar's aggressive investment into the residential real estate (\"RRE\") marketplace, Homes.com, which the company acquired in May 2021. From the beginning, CoStar's plan to build a dominant online classifieds business in the U.S. RRE industry was deeply flawed. Unlike its core CoStar Suite and Apartment.com businesses, Homes.com lacks clear competitive advantages and meaningful differentiation and faces intense competition from well-established peers like Zillow. Nevertheless, over the past five years, CoStar has invested roughly $5 billion in its RRE segment, $3 billion of which was in the U.S. Despite this massive investment, the U.S. RRE businesses generated only $60 million of revenue in 2024 and $80 million in 2025. Moreover, in addition to these direct financial losses, these initiatives have diverted focus from the core CRE business, limiting its growth potential.It was this backdrop that initially prompted Third Point to engage with CoStar last year, which ultimately resulted in a support agreement between the company, D.E. Shaw and Third Point. This agreement included (i) the addition of Christine McCarthy, John Berisford and Rachel Glaser as directors to the board; (ii) the retirement of Michael Klein, Christopher Nassetta and Laura Kaplan from the board; (iii) the appointment of Louise Sams as independent board chair; and (iv) the creation of a capital allocation committee. While these governance changes appeared to be a meaningful step in the right direction, progress has been deeply disappointing. Management has continued to move forward with its U.S. RRE initiatives, repeatedly shifting the strategy and missing targets even after they had been revised. In fact, the RRE business has gotten so bad that in 2025, the company cut Homes.com subscription pricing by over 30% and Homes.com is now expected to reduce 2025 adjusted EBITDA by more than 65%. Moreover, these losses are not going away anytime soon, as CoStar's new medium-term guidance now projects that Homes.com will not break even until 2030. Unsurprisingly, these failures continue to be reflected in the company's share performance, which has been underperforming the S&P 500 by over 45 percentage points since the date of the agreement and over 120 percentage points over the past five years.With the standstill period now expired, it's perhaps no surprise that Third Point is escalating its engagement, issuing a letter to the CoStar board calling on them to (i) replace a majority of the board and align management compensation to total shareholder return; (ii) consider strategic alternatives for Homes.com and related RRE businesses; and (iii) refocus on the core CRE business. While the latter two of these initiatives may feel intuitive given the aforementioned track record, it prompts the troubling question as to why this has not already been put into motion. The answer to that is the board's failure to hold management accountable. In fact, the company has rewarded CEO Andrew Florance. In 2024, he received approximately $37 million in total compensation, placing him in the top 10% of S&P 500 CEO earners despite the company being in the bottom 10% of performers. The board has done nothing to remedy this going forward as it has proposed tying only 25% of his future long-term incentives to total shareholder return, further disconnecting his pay from shareholder outcomes and particularly concerning for a CEO with de minimis stock ownership. This was done by the new board with three of eight directors recently appointed through the Third Point/D.E. Shaw settlement agreement, which appears to underscore the degree of control the CEO maintains over the company.While this may seem like a tall task, if Third Point succeeds, the upside potential appears significant. The firm points out that CoStar Suite alone has significant untapped pricing power, with an average selling price of just $350 per month, far below comparable information services products. Third Point also believes that the company has substantial opportunities to expand into adjacent end markets and develop new agentic products. Overall, Third Point believes that the CRE business should be capable of achieving EBITDA margins above 50% in the medium term, with further expansion over time given that peers ultimately achieve margins from 60% to 70%. In addition, the company's under-levered balance sheet also provides capacity for meaningful share repurchases, creating further opportunities for shareholder value creation. Putting it all together, absent the RRE distraction, Third Point believes that the CRE business could compound revenue at a mid-teens rate and grow earnings power per share in excess of 20% annually.This engagement is an example of shareholder activism the way it ought to be. Third Point quickly and amicably agreed to a settlement with the company to give it a chance to show Third Point that it can change its ways and start to turn around its poor performance. Had CoStar Group done that, you would not be reading this right now. But the company did the opposite, leaning into the strategy that has been failing it and its shareholders. So, now Third Point knows two things for sure: (i) change is definitely needed and (ii) three new directors is not enough to release the grip that Florance has on the board. We would expect to see Third Point nominate anywhere from three to six new directors. Two of the three directors (Christine McCarthy and John Berisford) appointed in last year's settlement were selected by Third Point, and we would expect them to not be targeted this year. So, assuming they are on the ballot as incumbents, Third Point could get a majority of the board by winning three seats. The decision whether to go for more than three will be made after consulting advisors on strategy and doing proxy math, particularly in the era of the universal ballot. There is an outside chance that the firm goes for eight if the company does not nominate McCarthy and Berisford. We would hope to see a Third Point executive nominated because in situations like this where substantial change is needed and that change has been met with resistance by a founder/CEO for so many years, it is helpful to have the activist in the room who designed the plan and is most passionate about it. While Third Point does not overtly call for it, it is hard to imagine a scenario where the firm wins meaningful board representation and Florance stays on as CEO – it does not seem like either of them would want that.Third Point, founded by Dan Loeb, is a true pioneer in shareholder activism, but has used it more sparingly in recent years as dictated by the market environment and available opportunities. He invented the poison pen letter in a time when it was often necessary. As times have changed, he has transitioned from the poison pen to the power of the argument. However, in this campaign we see shades of the old Dan Loeb – using phrases like \"feckless board of directors\" and \"CEO and his supine enablers.\" We particularly enjoyed his analogy of a CEO's compensation to elementary school children who win participation awards for finishing last. CoStar Group saw the new, more amicable Dan Loeb in April when he settled for three new directors. Now, the company may have woken up the Dan Loeb of the past, who has been in a sort of hibernation for years. We will not know for sure until March 13 when the nomination window opens.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

Ethereum slid about 9% to $2,445.31, while Solana lost 9.9% at $105.50.The slide in crypto comes in the wake of Trump's selection of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed, which bolstered the U.S. dollar as it eased concerns about the central bank's independence. Dollar strength may reduce bitcoin's appeal among investors as an alternative currency.If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Warsh would replace sitting Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell's current term as chair ends in May. Trump has criticized Powell — particularly about his unwillingness to reduce interest rates — almost since the Fed chair took the job in 2018.The slide in crypto is the latest blow to retail investors, who were buffeted by a sharp selloff in spot silver on Friday, the worst day for the market since March 1980. Spot silver was down 28% at $83.45 an ounce, trading near its lows of the day. Silver futures plummeted 31.4% to settle at $78.53.",

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

    "body": "SLB Headquarters, Houston, Tx.Courtesy: SLBCorporate earnings along with geopolitical concerns have swayed investor sentiment in recent trading sessions. But investors seeking consistent income against a volatile backdrop can always add attractive dividend-paying stocks to their portfolios. For discerning investors, top Wall Street analysts can help select the right stocks, backed by strong cash flows to support consistent dividend payments. Here are three dividend-paying stocks that are highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Viper EnergyViper Energy (VNOM), a subsidiary of Diamondback Energy, is focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil-weighted basins, primarily the Permian in West Texas. Considering the base and variable dividends paid over the past year, VNOM stock offers a dividend yield of 5.53%. Ahead of Viper's Q4 2025 results in February, Roth Capital analyst Leo Mariani reiterated a buy rating on VNOM stock with a price target of $48. The analyst is bullish on VNOM based on its high \"organic growth rate vs. peers, a solid and growing dividend, strong free cash flow even at lower oil prices and a multi-year line of sight on its operations not had by its peers.\"Mariani expects Viper Energy to deliver strong Q4 results with oil production of 66,552 barrels of oil per day (Bopd), about 1% above the Street estimate. He expects total production of 129,424 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boepd) for Q4 2025, or almost 2% above the consensus estimate. Mariani also anticipates that Viper will report solid oil price realizations for Q4 2025, but weaker gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) realizations. The 5-star analyst expects Viper to announce a cash distribution to shareholders of $0.57 for Q4 2025, reflecting a sequential decline of 2%. But he expects $95 million worth of share buybacks in Q4 2025, up from $90 million in the third quarter. Mariani expects share buybacks to play a larger role in Viper's capital return plans, especially compared with a subdued oil backdrop.Mariani also describes Viper as more insulated than its peers if 2026 drilling and completion activity is cut due to weak oil prices. That's because Diamondback operates about 60% of its production and can scale back cut activity outside VNOM's mineral acreage, helping protect volumes. Moreover, VNOM's non-operated activity is led by top-tier operators like Exxon Mobil, Occidental, EOG Resources, ConocoPhillips, and Ovintiv, which lowers the risk of sharply lower activity, as they control about two-thirds of Viper's non-Diamondback acreage.Mariani ranks No. 124 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 60% of the time, delivering an average return of 27.1%. See Viper Energy Statistics on TipRanks.SLB The week's second dividend pick is oilfield services provider SLB (SLB). The company recently reported  better-than-expected results for the fourth quarter of 2025. Moreover, SLB announced a 3.5% hike in its quarterly cash dividend to $0.295 per share. SLB pays a dividend yield of 2.41%. Following the Q4 print, JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram reiterated a buy rating on SLB and raised his price target to $54 from $43. The analyst noted that SLB's 2026 guidance was in line with consensus expectations, adding that encouraging insights from the earnings call reflect management's optimism about improvement in three international areas — Saudi Arabia, Mexico and deepwater — which hurt the company's 2025 performance.SLB expects its international segment to gain from business in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia in 2026, partially offset by a modest fall in revenue in Europe and Africa, the 5-star analyst said. SLB is also expected to benefit from the revitalization of Venezuela's oil industry, as it's the only Western oil field services company currently operating in the country as part of Chevron's operating license. Meanwhile, SLB's Gulf of Mexico presence and growth in the Data Center Solutions segment are expected to drive revenue in North America. \"The growth dynamics of Digital and Data Center Solutions remain key longer-term catalysts for SLB,\" said Jayaram. Overall, Jayaram expects SLB to deliver solid cash flow growth, driven by the company's international footprint, project integration capabilities and robust digital adoption. The analyst expects SLB to generate free cash flow of about $4.2 billion in 2026 and return nearly $4.3 billion in cash to shareholders through $1.7 billion of base dividends and $2.6 billion of buybacks.Jayaram ranks No. 673 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 11%. See SLB Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.EOG ResourcesAnother dividend-paying energy company this week is EOG Resources (EOG). The crude oil and natural gas exploration and production company offers a quarterly dividend of $1.02 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.08 per share, EOG's dividend yield stands at 3.68%. Ahead of Q4 earnings, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reaffirmed a buy rating on EOG stock with a price target of $150. The analyst expects EOG to deliver upbeat Q4 results on both operational and financial fronts. Sorbara expects the company to report oil production of 545.7 Mbbls/d (thousand barrels per day), in line with the Street's estimate and within the company's guidance of 542.5 to 547.5 Mbbls/d. Additionally, Sorbara expects total production of 1,369 Mboe/d (million barrels of oil equivalent per day), almost in line with the consensus estimate of 1,371 Mboe/d. The 5-star analyst thinks that investors will focus on EOG's 2026 guidance and early updates on its international projects in Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, as well as management's commentary on capital efficiencies in the Utica Shale and Delaware Basin. \"EOG stands out with the potential for peer-leading shareholder returns (at least 70% of FCF returned to shareholders annually) supported by its strong free cash flow generation and best-in-class balance sheet,\" said Sorbara. Specifically, Sorbara expects EOG to make opportunistic buybacks, with $4 billion still available under an existing authorization as of the end of the third quarter of 2025. The analyst estimates $457.4 million in Q4 2025 share buybacks. Including the base dividend, Sorbara estimates $1.0 billion of total capital returns, reflecting 98.4% of EOG's free cash flow.Sorbara ranks No. 511 among more than 12,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 53% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.9%. See EOG Resources Technical Analysis on TipRanks.",

    "body": "Pharma giant AstraZeneca will list on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, days after it announced big commitments on the other side of the world.Like the rest of Big Pharma, the company has a balancing act. It wants a close relationship with the U.S., its biggest market, and the listing is intended to boost investment there.Meanwhile, innovation-friendly China is attracting pharma companies that urgently need to develop new medicines to replace blockbuster drugs whose patents are set to expire in the next few years. Pricing challenges in the U.S. add to the pressure.AstraZeneca has announced it's investing billions in China and partnering with a Chinese biotech on weight-loss drugs, just before its shares list in the U.S on Monday.The developments come at a critical time for the pharma industry as companies are increasingly looking east for innovation to replace the revenue of current blockbuster medicines going off patent in the next couple of years. Pricing challenges in the U.S. market, which accounts for the bulk of profits for most big pharma companies, are adding to the pressure on Big Pharma.China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesOn Thursday, AstraZeneca said it plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030 to expand both manufacturing and research and development, as Keir Starmer became the first UK prime minister to visit the country for eight years.\"These investments span the value chain, from drug discovery and clinical development to manufacturing, and bring Chinese innovation to the world,\" the company said, while highlighting a flurry of other partnerships with other biotechs in the region.In a separate announcement on Friday, the UK's largest company would partner up with Hong Kong-listed CSPC Pharmaceuticals to strengthen its obesity portfolio. The collaboration agreement includes eight of CSPC's preclinical and early-stage programs, including a once-monthly injectable. CSP stock fell 10.2% on the announcement. AstraZeneca will pay CSPC $1.2 billion upfront, and an additional $17.3 billion if certain regulatory, research and sales milestones are met, an AstraZeneca spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Friday. The company declined to comment further on its geographic priorities. watch nowThe announcements came just before the listing of AstraZeneca shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, as well as its recently announced $50 billion U.S. investment to waive off U.S. pharma tariffs.\"What we can discern from this is that the US and China will be the two most important regions for the company for the foreseeable future,\" Camilla Oxhamre, portfolio manager at Rhenman & Partners, told CNBC via email.AstraZeneca's balancing actThe U.S. is AstraZeneca's by far largest market, and the company said last year it would end its American depositary shares program to pursue a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, keeping its listings also in London and Stockholm, saying it wanted a more global investor base.\"It's the largest pharma company [in China] and when they decide to list in the U.S., there would always be a question about the commitment in the minds of some to China, and the fact that they had a few investigations last year,\" HSBC's Rajesh Kumar, head of European life sciences and healthcare equity research, told CNBC. In 2025, Astrazeneca faced several probes by Chinese regulators into unpaid import duties.\"So they are, in effect, telling you very clearly that they are committed to China by this action,\" Kumar added.China is also AstraZeneca's second-largest market. Oxhamre, whose fund has a large long position in Astra, added that the Chinese market would \"continue to grow in importance over time, both in terms of revenue and research.\"And Astra isn't the only pharma company looking to China for new, innovative assets. London-listed GSK inked a deal with Hengrui Pharma worth up to $12 billion in July, most of it tied to achieving certain development and commercial milestones.China's hot biotech sceneLicensing deals between Big Pharma and Chinese biotechs, like the one between AstraZeneca and CSPC, have increased sharply in recent years, with 57 such deals in 2025, according to Biopharma Dive data. \"These deals demonstrate the success of China's long-running effort to move up the biopharma value chain, from fast followers to differentiated assets that can compete globally,\" said PitchBook analysts in a report published last month.Read moreChina's emergence as a leader in preclinical and early-stage development comes as biotech funding elsewhere has suffered in recent years, and is helped by the speed at which early human trials can be conducted there. A reverse brain drain, where Chinese scientists are returning to the country, is also helping the country's biotech sector, according to Kumar.\"China's biopharma sector has reshaped itself around next-generation therapeutics paired with efficient clinical-trial infrastructure to de-risk these assets,\" the PitchBook analysts said.\"Multinational and mid-cap biopharma companies are sourcing assets from China at growing rates, spanning both headline megadeals and smaller licensing deals. Importantly, this activity is skewing toward complex biologics rather than legacy modalities.\"A Harvard Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs report from June suggested \"China has the most immediate opportunity to overtake the United States in biotechnology\" and that this could \"quickly shift the global balance of power.\"But late 2025 saw a meaningful pickup in U.S. biotech funding.\"There will always be innovation coming from both geographies,\" Kumar said. \"The world has changed… China was catching up with the U.S., [the] U.S. will re-accelerate.\"— CNBC's Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi is due to make the trip next week — the first by a South American leader since U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in early January. The Canadian and British leaders' trips are the first in at least eight years, while a visit by Ireland's prime minister on Jan. 5 was the first in 14 years. China had closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic and only reopened them in earnest in early 2023.\"These visits reflect managed, selective resets under rising U.S. policy uncertainty, rather than a strategic pivot to China,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\"Keeping communication channels open with Beijing is increasingly seen as preferable to disengagement,\" she said, \"particularly as the gains from selective resets with China become more visible, and U.S. policy has grown less predictable.\"Since taking office 12 months ago, Trump has wielded tariffs not just on China but a slew of U.S. trading partners. In recent months, he's increased efforts to ramp up U.S. influence over Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. It's an opportunity for Beijing, which has sought to portray itself as not only a partner for developing countries but also as a stabilizing force for the world. watch now\"Maintaining distance from the United States indicates that these countries value ties with China's large economy,\" Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, said in a phone interview Thursday. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.European and other countries may still need to align with the U.S. on security issues, but they are now increasing economic engagement, Cui said. Facilitating business dealsLarge business delegations often accompany national leaders when making state visits. Nearly 60 British companies and cultural organizations sent representatives to accompany the U.K. prime minister on his China trip. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca used the state visit to announce plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030.Similarly, during Carney's visit, Canada agreed to cut tariffs on a limited number of China-made electric cars to 6.1% from 100%, in exchange for lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola seeds. Global businesses have also long been keen to sell to China's large consumer market, the second-largest in the world. For their part, Chinese leaders have urged visiting nations to create fair environments for Chinese businesses operating or investing locally. Many Chinese companies, such as electric car makers, have accelerated global expansion plans as domestic growth has slowed.Beijing has increasingly made clear its efforts to build technological self-sufficiency and hold its own on the global stage.Earlier this month, the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department wrote in the official party newspaper that China's modernization efforts break a \"Western-centric\" model and gives developing countries a new choice.U.S.-China still hold cloutBut the overarching question remains tensions between the world's two largest economies. Some of the visiting nations still count the U.S., not China, as their largest trading partner.The five countries with leaders who visited in January — Ireland, South Korea, Canada and Finland — have a combined gross domestic product of $8.71 trillion, or less than half of China's $18.74 trillion GDP, as of 2024 World Bank figures. The U.S. remained far larger with a GDP of $28.75 trillion.China was the first major economy to retaliate against Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025. The two countries reached a fragile one-year trade truce in late October, with Trump expected to visit China in April. The American Chamber of Commerce in China hosted an appreciation dinner on Thursday evening in Beijing while Starmer was visiting, which included representatives from the Chinese side. In an opening address, Chair James Zimmerman urged both Trump and Xi to create a vision for greater global stability. The potential for the two leaders to meet as many as four times this year marks \"a moment for sustained leadership and meaningful progress that should not be missed,\" Zimmerman said. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tOne of the opportunities for Trump and Xi to meet — as well as draw other world leaders to China — is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which China is hosting this year. The APEC forum is set to hold a senior officials' meeting in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early next month, ahead of the main economic leaders' meeting in November. But visiting leaders still must straddle a fine balance when dealing with China.This week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with China and said it was \"very dangerous\" for Britain to do business with China. In a nod toward European industry interests, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened China with tariffs a day after he returned from his state visit in December. \"These trips are a hedging strategy,\" said Jack Lee, a foreign affairs analyst at consultancy China Macro Group. \"They keep the China channel open as a way to preserve strategic optionality,\" he said. But he cautioned that trust, especially between the EU and Beijing, remains limited. ",

    "body": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket is on the launch pad carrying Amazon's Project Kuiper internet network satellites, which are expected to eventually rival Elon Musk's Starlink system, at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, on April 9, 2025.Steve Nesius | ReutersAmazon has asked the Federal Communications Commission for more time to meet a deadline that requires the company to deploy roughly 1,600 internet satellites by July 2026. The company needs to bring more of its satellites online so it can begin offering an internet-from-space service that was recently rebranded as Amazon Leo. The company has earmarked at least $10 billion to build the network.Delays beyond Amazon's control, including a \"shortage in the near-term availability\" of rockets, necessitate an extension, the company said in a filing made public on Friday. Amazon also pointed to manufacturing disruptions, the failure and grounding of new launch vehicles and limitations on spaceport capacity. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company is now seeking a 24-month extension, to July 2028, or for the FCC to waive its deadline requiring Amazon to get roughly half of its 3,236 low Earth satellites up. In 2019, Amazon unveiled its plans to build a constellation of low Earth satellites. They are designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet to consumers, corporations and governments, offering connections through square-shaped terminals. Amazon has booked more than 100 launches to deploy dozens of satellites at a time. The company said in the filing that it has bought 10 more launches with Elon Musk's SpaceX, as well as a dozen additional rides with Blue Origin, the space exploration startup of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.The company said that many of its partners have notched significant launch milestones with their respective rockets in the past year. \"Not withstanding this progress, the development timelines for these next-generation vehicles have extended beyond initial projections, contributing to Amazon Leo's deployment delays,\" the company wrote.Amazon has sent up more than 150 satellites since April. The company said it expects to deploy about 700 satellites by July 30, \"moving from the third- to the second-largest satellite constellation in orbit.\" Its next launch is slated for Feb. 12, when Amazon will fling another 32 satellite into space atop a rocket from Arianespace, a French company. Leo's primary rival is SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Another challenger, OneWeb, is operated by France's Eutelsat and has a constellation of more than 600 satellites.In November, Amazon opened up an \"enterprise preview\" of Leo to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch. Amazon said if the FCC were to deny it an extension, it would \"undermine\" the agency's goals of expanding spectrum access and promoting \"expeditious deployment.\" The company also noted that the agency has previously granted similar extensions.\"Amazon Leo is engaged in full-scale deployment and stands on the doorstep of offering U.S. customers a competitive and innovative new service,\" the company said. \"An extension would enable this rapid and ongoing deployment to continue, while strict enforcement would interrupt or halt this effort.\" WATCH: Amazon laying off about 16,000 corporate workers in latest anti-bureaucracy pushwatch now",

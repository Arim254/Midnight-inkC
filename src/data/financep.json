Michael Ochs Archives | Moviepix | Getty ImagesIn the dwindling days of the California gold rush, the wife of a local miner faced a problem. Her husband's denim work pants kept ripping, so her tailor, Jacob Davis, had the idea to add copper rivets to key points of strain, like the pocket corners and the base of the button fly, to keep them from tearing. Davis' \"riveted pants\" soon became a roaring success and, unbeknownst to him at the time, marked the official birth of the blue jean, a garment that would transform fashion and come to represent the United States around the globe. \"It really has democratized American fashion and it also is the greatest export that we have sent to the world, because people identify jeans specifically with American Western culture,\" said Shawn Grain Carter, a fashion professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York. \"It doesn't matter your economic or social class. It doesn't matter what your views are in terms of the political spectrum. Everybody wears denim.\" Jacob DavisCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.These days, denim is a major sales driver for retailers big and small, as the global denim market reached $101 billion this year, up 28% from 2020, according to data from market research company Euromonitor International. Major apparel companies from American Eagle to Levi Strauss are in a race to corner that market, leaning on A-list celebrities like Sydney Sweeney and Beyonce to win over shoppers and drive sales in an unsteady economy.But if it weren't for Levi Strauss, founder of the eponymous blue jeans company, Davis' invention may not have gone far beyond the railroad town where it was created in the early 1870s. How Levi's created blue jeansSoon after Davis created his riveted pants, called \"waist overalls\" or \"overalls\" at the time, they began selling like \"hot cakes\" and he needed a business partner to secure a patent, said Tracey Panek, Levi's in-house historian. So he wrote to Strauss, a Bavarian-born immigrant who was running a successful wholesale business in San Francisco and had supplied Davis the denim he used to create his riveted pants. \"The secret of them Pents is the Rivits that I put in those Pockets and I found the demand so large that I cannot make them up fast enough,\" Davis wrote Strauss in a letter, according to PBS. Levi StraussCourtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Strauss, an \"astute\" businessman, recognized the opportunity and agreed to partner with Davis, said Panek. \"This would have been the first time that Levi was actually\" manufacturing his own products, said Panek. \"He was no longer just importing and selling other people's goods. He was manufacturing himself and selling to retailers.\"On May 20, 1873, the two men secured a patent for the riveted pants and eventually opened a factory on Fremont Street, close to the modern-day Salesforce tower in San Francisco's financial district. They promised to offer workers the most durable jeans on the market and soon, business was booming. Dude ranch duds and the American worker Through Strauss' connections as a wholesaler, the company's riveted overalls soon spread across the U.S., becoming the garment of choice for working men everywhere: miners, cowboys, farmers – any role that required durable clothing. Jeans were exclusively reserved for work settings at the time, but as emerging denim manufacturers vied for a similar customer base, they looked to expand their assortment to drive sales. \"Slowly and steadily into the 20th century, you start to see some of these manufacturers making variations,\" said Sonya Abrego, a New York City-based fashion historian. \"There was this one design called spring bottom pants that was kind of a more form fitted, a more dressed up, a slightly flared, maybe what the factory foreman would be wearing, right? As opposed to just the guy on the shop floor.\"In 1934, Levi created the first ever line of jeans for women. Around that time, denim started to become more popular in settings outside of work, primarily for activities like dude ranch vacations, camping and horseback riding. \"So they were kind of taking on a cowboy's garment or a worker's garment but wearing it in a … resort setting,\" said Abrego. Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co. Dude ranch vacations had become popular because there were finally highways connecting different parts of the country, and few were willing to venture to Europe during a war. Companies like Levi began releasing advertisements highlighting their denim as \"dude ranch duds\" and \"authentic western riding wear\" to capture shoppers looking for jeans to bring with them on vacation, according to archival advertisements from the time. These cultural moments helped to expand denim beyond workers, but jeans didn't become widespread casual attire until after World War II, when American fashion overall started to shift. The rise of the backyard BBQ By the time World War II ended, the mighty American consumer was beginning to emerge. For years, Americans had been forced to ration common goods like rubber, sugar and meat while simultaneously being encouraged to save their money by buying war bonds and socking away spare cash.When the country shifted from wartime to peacetime, Americans were ready to splurge and soon began spending big on new cars, appliances and clothes. \"With a little bit more money to spend, you start seeing a bigger push for leisure clothes and fun clothes and play clothes, clothes to wear to backyard barbecues,\" said Abrego. \"Clothes that we would consider today as just like casual style.\" Courtesy: Levi Strauss & Co.Slowly and surely, it became more and more acceptable for both men and women to wear jeans outside of work settings. Then, denim manufacturers made a push to allow jeans in schools. \"They wanted to sell to as many people as they possibly could,\" said Abrego. \"The idea that jeans are good for school means that they're good for every day.\"By the time the 1960s hit, denim manufacturers had expanded their products and were selling a wide variety of colors, fits and styles. It became a symbol of the hippie movement and a mainstay on Hollywood sets. Soon, denim was everywhere, and the 1970s brought the iconic bell bottom pants and the first iteration of the \"designer jean\" — denim pants being produced by labels and brands whose designs had nothing to do with work wear or western wear, like Calvin Klein and Gloria Vanderbilt. Since then, denim has remained a constant in global fashion. While silhouettes, washes and fits have changed over time, jeans never really go out of style, which is what makes them so enduring, said Abrego. \"This is a design from 1873 … do we see anything else from 1873 on the street? It's kind of wild if you think about it that way,\" said Abrego. \"We can talk about all the details, all the changes in manufacturing and all the different fits and finishes but it's a recognizable thing, it's still a pair of jeans. For me as a historian, that continuity is so compelling because I can't really name anything else that has stayed the same to this degree.\" ",

    "body": "When it comes to managing your finances, you may feel like you have to do the most: reap the most rewards from your credit cards, pay as little as you can in taxes, earn the highest returns on your investments and extract the most interest from your savings. If you feel this sort of pressure, you come by it honestly, says Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement at Morningstar and author of \"How to Retire.\" \"The [financial] industry has this optimizing mindset,\" she tells CNBC Make It. \"If you're just learning and getting up to speed, you probably start to think that's the only way to do this stuff and that you're doing it wrong if you cut corners.\"To be clear, if you're the kind of person who enjoys drilling down into every tiny detail of your finances, and has time to do so that's fine, Benz says. But for the rest of us, taking a simplified approach can free up time and energy to do other things while keeping us on track to reach our financial goals, she says. In a recent article for Morningstar, Benz called this the \"good enough\" approach to managing finances. Though they may not be moves to \"maximize\" your finances, consider these four strategies, which she says will achieve similar results \"with much less time and hassle.\"Reverse budgetingMany major financial goals, such as saving for retirement and paying down debt, are predicated on your ability to consistently save a portion of your income, Benz says. \"If you are saving reasonably, it obviates the need to do a lot of other things,\" she says. \"Even if you make subpar decisions about investment selections, for example, if the savings rate is decent, it addresses a lot of things that might not be perfect in the plan.\"Put simply, consistently investing 20% of your income into a below average portfolio will likely get you a better outcome than putting 5% in and earning above-average returns. If you want to keep things really simple, try a strategy Benz uses known as reverse budgeting. Rather than trying to tinker with your spending to optimize your savings rate, pick a flat percentage of your income — Benz says 15% is a good target — and set that money to automatically come out of each paycheck to be put toward financial goals. The rest of the money is yours to spend as you see fit. Index investingTheoretically, someone picking the right investments at the right time can beat the stock market over the long term. In practice, though, it's really tough to do. Consider the managers of large-company U.S. stock funds, whose job it is to beat the S&P 500. Over the decade ended June 2025, just 8% of those mutual funds survived and beat the benchmark, according to Morningstar. That's why Benz recommends building a core portfolio of index funds, which come with low fees and merely track the performance of market indexes rather than trying to beat them. \"A lot of data point to the fact that index funds are really terrific choices, and they're hands off,\" she says. \"They can give you exposure to a lot of different parts of the stock and bond market with a single holding.\"\"To me, index funds are a great intersection of optimization and the 'good enough' portfolio.\"Simplifying financial relationshipsNo one wants to park their cash in an account that offers practically no interest. But you needn't move your money around in search of a few tenths of a percentage point either, Benz says. \"It drives me crazy — the idea of people running around trying to get the best cash instrument,\" she says. \"The best way to tip things in your favor is to go with a low-cost provider that will deliver a persistently competitive yield.\"In the context of a brokerage, that may mean comparing what you'll get on so-called \"sweep accounts\" — the places where your money sits within your brokerage account when it's not invested, she says. For high-yield savings accounts, it pays to remember that rates fluctuate, Benz says. It will probably be less of a headache to stick with a bank that you like and that pays a generous rate rather than ping-ponging between online banks offering the highest rate of the year. And if that bank or brokerage also offers credit cards with rewards you like, all the better, she says. When it comes time for you or someone else to get hands-on with your money, having more of it under one roof tends to make things more manageable.\"Reducing the number of financial relationships is such a good practice, which doesn't mean you want to be completely lazy,\" she says. \"But if you can try to skinny down the number of entities that you need to connect with, it's good all around.\"Using an advisorBenz thinks and writes about finances for a living. She published a book about retirement. Still, when it comes to managing money and planning her own retirement, Benz and her husband have enlisted the help of a financial planner. Doing so allows Benz to have an optimized financial plan — she's just letting someone else help with all the fine-tuning. \"She has it all calibrated, and that gives me a lot of peace of mind, knowing that someone else is doing that optimization and using pretty high-powered tools to do it, too,\" Benz says. It's not that Benz or you or anyone else couldn't figure this out on their own. But delegating some of the heavy lifting can free you up to focus on the things you really want to spend time and energy on. Benz favors fee-only planners, who may charge an hourly fee, bill you for specific services or charge something akin to a monthly or annual subscription rate. The key is, they don't get paid to sell you certain financial products, which can be a conflict of interest, Benz says. For Benz, working with a pro has been worth the cost. \"I felt a little glimmer of like, 'Oh, I should be doing this on my own,'\" she says. \"But ultimately, I realized that turning to someone who, importantly, has tools to come up with some really good answers ... that I don't necessarily have, I decided it was a good value proposition.\"Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up today for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

    "body": "Dr. Vicky Pebsworth, from left, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Retsef Levi, Case Western Reserve University Professor Catherine Stein and Dr. Raymond Pollak, listen to presentations during an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting to discuss childhood vaccine schedule changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, U.S., December 4, 2025.Alyssa Pointer | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s handpicked vaccine committee voted on Friday to do away with the long-standing, universal recommendation that all babies receive a hepatitis B shot at birth, issuing weaker guidance for certain infants. The group, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, recommended that parents use individual decision-making in consultation with a health-care provider to determine when or if to give the hepatitis B birth dose to a baby whose mother tested negative for the virus. For babies who don't receive the birth dose, the committee recommended that they wait to receive a first vaccine until they are at least 2 months old. The acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still has to sign off on that new recommendation. The CDC currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth, regardless of their mother's testing status. The move overturns that guidance, which has been credited with driving down infections in children by 99% since it was first introduced three decades ago and is widely considered to be a public health success story. Some committee members and public health experts warn that the change could have wide-ranging consequences, such as an increase in infections among kids. The vote only affects the timing of the first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine series. The second would still be given one to two months after birth, with a third dose between 6 and 18 months of age. All pregnant people are supposed to be tested for hepatitis B during pregnancy. During previous meetings, some advisors questioned the need for babies to receive a shot if their mothers test negative. But test results can produce false negatives, some people become infected later in pregnancy after being tested and babies can get infected by other members of their household. The panel's closely watched two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. ACIP sets recommendations on who should receive certain shots and which vaccines insurers must cover at no cost. Eight members voted yes, while three voted no. Some advisors strongly pushed back on the new guidance ahead of the vote. \"This has a great potential to cause harm, and I hope that the committee accepts the responsibility when this harm is caused,\" said Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, psychiatrist and voting member. Dr. Cody Meissner, voting member and professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, said he hopes that pediatricians will continue to administer the birth dose within the first 24 hours of delivery and before discharge from the hospital. \"To follow any other course is not in the interest of infants,\" he said. Meissner added that more children will be injured and will catch hepatitis B infections. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. Infants are more vulnerable to developing chronic hepatitis B infections, which have no cure. \"We will see hepatitis B come back,\" he said. \"The vaccine is so effective. It does not make sense in my mind to change the immunization schedule.\"In a statement Friday, the American Medical Association said the vote is \"reckless and undermines decades of public confidence in a proven, lifesaving vaccine.\" The group added that the decision was not based on scientific evidence and \"creates confusion for parents about how best to protect their newborns.\"Meanwhile, Retsef Levi, a voting member and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, falsely claimed during meetings that experts have \"never tested\" the hepatitis B vaccine \"appropriately.\" Some committee members raised concerns about vaccinating during the so-called neonatal period, which is a critical window of development for the brain and immune system. But decades of evidence show that the hepatitis B shot has been safely administered to newborns. Other advisors said there is no evidence supporting the two-month delay to the birth dose.\"We have to make decisions with the data that we have, and we must use only the credible data to make the decisions, and not speculations and not hypotheses,\" said Hibbeln. A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies, so the new recommendations should not have a material impact on their businesses. Still, Merck said in a statement Friday that it is \"deeply concerned\" by the vote, which it said risks \"reversing this progress and puts infants at unnecessary risk of chronic infection, liver cancer and even death.\" The company added that \"there is no evidence delaying it provides any benefit to children.\" In a statement, GSK said, \"we await additional information and an official adoption of today's recommendations by CDC to fully understand the potential impact.\"The panel's vote will not affect insurance coverage for the shots, including under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program, Andrew Johnson, principal policy analyst for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, told the members during the meeting.

    "body": "People hold a sign as they participate in a protest outside the U.S. Supreme Court over President Donald Trump's move to end birthright citizenship as the court hears arguments over the order in Washington, May 15, 2025.Drew Angerer | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Supreme Court on Friday said it will hear arguments in a case that will determine if President Donald Trump can undo automatic citizenship for people born in the United States.Trump, on his first day back in the White House on Jan. 20, issued an executive order that said babies born in the U.S. more than 30 days after that order were not entitled to be issued citizenship documents if their parents were temporary visitors or illegal immigrants.Before Trump's order, there was little dispute that the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment, with rare exceptions, meant that children born in the country were automatically U.S. citizens, regardless of their parents' status.The Citizenship Clause in that amendment says, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" The Supreme Court, which is expected to rule next year, will determine if Trump's executive order complies with that amendment.The order told federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. if their mother \"was unlawfully present in the United States and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth,\" or when the baby's \"mother's presence in the United States was lawful but temporary, and the person's father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time.\"Several federal district court judges have found that Trump's order violated the Constitution, and two federal circuit courts of appeals upheld injunctions blocking the order from taking effect.",

    "body": "watch nowA key inflation measure was lower than expected in September, the Commerce Department said Friday in a report delayed by the government shutdown that gives a further green light for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.The core personal consumption expenditures price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, indicated a 0.2% monthly rise while the annual rate was 2.8%. The monthly rate was in line with the Dow Jones consensus, but the annual level was 0.1 percentage point lower. The core annual rate edged down from 2.9% in August.In addition, headline PCE increased 0.3% for the month, putting the annual inflation rate also at 2.8%, according to the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Both of those readings were in line with expectations though the annual rate was up 0.1 percentage point from August.Federal Reserve officials use the PCE price index as their primary policy tool for inflation. While officials look at both measures, they generally consider core a better indicator of longer-term inflation trends.\"The slightly stale September inflation report shows that prices remained reasonably stable despite tariffs and healthy consumer spending. This probably provides further air cover for the Fed to cut rates in December,\" said Scott Helfstein, Global X's head of investment strategy.Goods prices surged 0.5% on the month as President Donald Trump's tariffs continue to work their way through the economy. Services prices were up just 0.2%. Food rose 0.4% while energy was up 1.7%.The report also showed the personal savings rate was unchanged from August at 4.7%.The release was put off several weeks by the government shutdown, which had caused a halt to all data collection and economic reports.In addition to the inflation figures, the release provided information on income and spending.Personal income rose 0.4% on the month while spending was up 0.3%. Income was 0.1 percentage point above the forecast, while spending was 0.1 percentage point below the forecast.Stocks added to gains following the release as traders anticipate a quarter percentage point interest rate cut from the Fed when it announces its rate decision Wednesday.Odds of a rate cut when the Fed convenes next week held at 87.2% following the report, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge. The interest rate decision will be announced Wednesday.Though the September data is backward-looking, it is the last price reading the Fed will get before its monetary policy meeting next week. However, policymakers have been unusually divided in what the next steps should be for rates. One FOMC faction supports additional cuts as a way to head off further weakness in the labor market, while another sees continued threats from inflation that would require holding rates in a more restrictive position. Recent labor market indicators show a slow pace of hiring, with some private data points exhibiting an increasing level of layoffs. Labor Department data, though, actually showed a decline last week in initial unemployment benefit claims.A separate economic report Friday showed consumer sentiment a bit better than expected to start December.The University of Michigan's consumer survey came in at 53.3, up 4.5% from November and better than the Wall Street estimate for 52. Inflation expectations also dropped, with the one-year view falling to 4.1% and the five-year at 3.2%, both at their lowest levels since January.",

The stock climbed 13% over the past five days, its best weekly performance since December 2023.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.25, topping Wall Street's estimates of $2.86 per share. Revenue increased 8.6% year over year to $10.26 billion but just missed analyst projections of $10.27 billion.Although the artificial intelligence boom has pushed several tech companies into record surges, cloud software firms have seen a rocky year as investors wonder whether AI will render the industry obsolete.Salesforce is hoping to persuade Wall Street that AI will be able to bolster its products rather than replace them.

Despite initial investor skepticism over the platform, Cantor analysts were encouraged by its strong adoption in the customer service space.\"We think CRM is starting to formalize and mature the strategy, which should make it easier for customers to understand, and therefore adopt, Agentforce,\" the Cantor analysts wrote.Annual recurring revenue of Agentforce jumped 330% year over year to $540 million.\"Why everyone is so excited about Agentforce is because this is what AI was meant to be,\" Benioff said. \"It brings together humans and data and AI and apps, and delivers an incredible experience for companies.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff goes one-on-one with Jim Cramer",

    "body": "Attendees speak with representatives at the Barrick booth, at the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada (PDAC) annual mining conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada March 3, 2025. Carlos Osorio | ReutersCompany: Barrick Mining (B)Business: Barrick Mining, formerly Barrick Gold Corporation, is a gold and copper producer, which is engaged in the production and sale of gold and copper, as well as related activities, such as exploration and mine development. It has ownership interests in producing gold mines in Argentina, Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Tanzania and the United States. Its copper mines are in Zambia, Chile and Saudi Arabia. Its operations include Nevada Gold Mines, Bulyanhulu, Hemlo, Jabal Sayid, Kibali, Loulo-Gounkoto, Lumwana, North Mara, Porgera, Pueblo Viejo, Tongon, Veladero and Zaldivar. Its Bulyanhulu operation is located in northwest Tanzania, over 55 kilometers south of Lake Victoria and 150 km southwest of the city of Mwanza. The Jabal Sayid copper operation is located 350 km northeast of Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Lumwana copper mine is a conventional open pit operation.Stock Market Value: $69.16 billion ($40.38 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBarrick Mining shares year to dateActivist: Elliott Investment ManagementOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Elliott is a multistrategy investment firm that manages about $76.1 billion in assets (as of June 30, 2025) and is one of the oldest firms of its type under continuous management. Known for its extensive due diligence and resources, Elliott regularly follows companies for years before making an investment. Elliott is the most active of activist investors, engaging with companies across industries and multiple geographies.What's happeningOn Nov. 18, Elliott announced a position in Barrick Mining and expressed its interest in seeing a potential separation of North American assets from its mines in riskier regions across Asia and Africa. Most recently, on Dec. 1, Barrick announced that the board has authorized the company to explore a potential separation of the North American assets.Behind the scenesBarrick Mining is a Toronto-based global mining company focused predominantly on gold, operating 14 gold mines, as well as three additional cooper mines. The core of this business is its North America Gold assets, which consists of some of the highest quality deposits in the world, specifically Nevada Gold Mines, a joint venture with Newmont in which Barrick owns 61.5% and serves as its operator. The company also operates gold mines in Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia. Its copper portfolio is centered around Africa and the Middle East, including Reko Diq, a new copper development project in Pakistan. With the recent bull market for gold, Barrick's stock has more than doubled over the past six months. Despite this, Barrick continues to trade at 0.9 times its price to net asset value ratio, a significant discount to North American peers, who trade well above 1x, with best-in-class peers like Agnico Eagle trading at approximately 1.5x.Investors buy gold companies primarily for gold price exposure, and from there prefer the companies with the best management teams that operate the companies most efficiently to best isolate the value of the commodity. Barrick has not been a top operator amongst its peers and, as a result, they abruptly parted ways with their CEO in September and replaced him with Mark Hill, the former COO, as interim CEO. An interim CEO creates two very valuable opportunities for an activist in a company like Barrick. First and most importantly, they get to have a voice in who the new CEO will be regardless of whether they settle with the company for a board seat or just remain an outspoken shareholder. While they may not always be in the room when the discussions are had or the decision is made, we know of no CEO who would take a job at a company with an activist like Elliott engaging unless they knew that Elliott approved of the hiring. Second, when a company has an interim CEO, it is an advantageous time to explore strategic alternatives, and a breakup of this company has always been the elephant in the room. Barrick's North American operations have been sullied by the company's exposure to higher-risk regions and separating the two would go a long way to close the valuation gap between Barrick and Agnico Eagle. The value proposition for a breakup is clear and even something management has discussed. In a presentation released in May, management demonstrated that applying a peer-like multiple to Barrick's North American assets could unlock as much as 49% of unrealized value. Since then, the price of gold has appreciated by over 70% but the company's stock has appreciated by more than 100%, so much of that gain has been realized but there is still some value to be realized from a breakup.  Elliott has a history of taking board seats at companies not for activist's sake, but only when they feel that the director they are putting on the board could genuinely add value for shareholders. In this case, the breakup of the company is something that is being seriously considered by the board, and Elliott, just by its existence, is likely to have at least negative approval power over the new CEO. Moreover, Elliott does not act impetuously in its activism. They have likely had a position in Barrick for many months at this point and have already received a great return from the company's 100% appreciation in the past six months. We would not expect them to escalate their activism here unless either the board goes down a path they didn't expect and don't agree with, or it is at the company's invitation to join the board to assist with the tasks ahead.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "watch nowNetflix announced Friday it's reached a deal to buy pieces of Warner Bros. Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. The transaction is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the equity value of the deal at $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of approximately $82.7 billion. Netflix will acquire Warner Bros.' film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will move forward with its previously planned spinout of Discovery Global, which includes its massive portfolio of pay TV networks, such as TNT and CNN. The blockbuster deal brings together the streaming giant Netflix, which has upended the media industry in recent years, and the storied Warner Bros. film studio, known for its library including \"The Wizard of Oz,\" the Harry Potter franchise and the DC comics universe. It will also include the content of HBO Max, including \"The Sopranos\" and \"Game of Thrones.\"\"I know some of you're surprised that we're making this acquisition, and I certainly understand why. Over the years, we have been known to be builders, not buyers,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on an investor call Friday morning. \"We already have incredible shows and movies and a great business model, and it's working for talent, it's working for consumers and it's working for shareholders. This is a rare opportunity,\" he said. \"It's going to help us achieve our mission to entertain the world and to bring people together through great stories.\"Netflix's initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets was for $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.The acquisition is expected to close after the TV networks separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. The companies estimated the transaction would close in 12 to 18 months. CNBC has reached out to Comcast and Paramount for comment.As part of the deal, every Warner Bros. Discovery shareholder will receive $23.25 in cash and $4.50 in shares of Netflix common stock for each share of WBD common stock outstanding following the close of the deal. Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery said each of their boards of directors unanimously approved the deal, which is subject to regulatory approval as well as approval of WBD shareholders. Netflix has agreed to pay a $5.8 billion reverse break-up fee if the deal is not approved, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Warner Bros. Discovery would pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it decides to call off the deal to pursue a different merger.Edging out ParamountThe merger could invite regulatory scrutiny given the size of the expansive streaming businesses for each company. Netflix said it surpassed 300 million global streaming subscribers at the end of 2024, the last time it publicly reported its customer count. Warner Bros. Discovery said it had 128 million global subscribers as of Sept. 30. Paramount raised the potential for antitrust concerns earlier this week in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management as second-round bids came in, The Wall Street Journal reported. The newly merged Paramount Skydance made its initial run at Warner Bros. Discovery in September, submitting three bids before WBD launched a formal sale process. The David Ellison-run company was the only suitor bidding for the entirety of WBD's portfolio — the film studio, streaming business and TV networks.Paramount's final bid, received Thursday evening, was for $30 per share, all cash, people close to the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity about confidential dealings. Paramount's offer included a $5 billion breakup fee if the transaction didn't win regulatory approval after roughly 10 months, the people said. Earlier this week, Paramount raised questions about the \"fairness and adequacy\" of the sale process, contending Warner Bros. Discovery favored Netflix.\"It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder,\" Paramount attorneys said in a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery management.— CNBC's David Faber, Kasey O'Brien and Laya Neelakandan contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "A man walks past movie posters at at AMC Theater in Montebello, California on May 5, 2025. Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesMovie theater operators woke up Friday to the possibility of a new world order.Netflix and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a deal for the streaming giant to acquire WBD's film studio and streaming service, bringing an end to a months-long bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the assets.With Netflix as the victor, exhibitors are in a panic. Unlike traditional movie studios, the streamer has not adhered to conventional theatrical distribution, and there are fears that big changes could be coming to an industry that is still struggling post-pandemic.\"It's no secret that this was probably the least desired outcome for many theater owners,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory. \"There are no two ways around that. This may be one of the most meaningful days in the history of the business, but it could yet be a constructive one for cinema if Netflix honors early indications that it will maintain the theatrical business model of Warner Bros. properties and lean into those unique strengths which are not replicable on the streaming platform.\"Cinema United, the world's largest exhibition trade association, came out strong Friday morning against the sale of WBD assets to Netflix.\"The proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. by Netflix poses an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business,\" CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. \"The negative impact of this acquisition will impact theatres from the biggest circuits to one-screen independents in small towns in the United States and around the world.\"A half dozen movie theater operators who spoke to CNBC shared concerns that Netflix's acquisition of WBD would lead to a significant decline in the number of films made available to cinemas annually and, therefore, hit annual box office ticket sales.\"Netflix's stated business model does not support theatrical exhibition. In fact, it is the opposite,\" O'Leary said. Cinema United said the deal \"would risk removing 25% of the annual domestic box office\" putting smaller theater chains and independent cinemas, in particular, at risk.watch now\"We are going to be pulling all of the levers we can because we think that a deal of this magnitude and the potential impact that it will have is something that everyone with regulatory and oversight authority needs to look closely at,\" O'Leary said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Friday. \"So, we've already been talking to people at the federal level, at the state level and internationally because this is a significant, significant threat, we believe, to the long-term viability of the theatrical exhibition.\"And Cinema United isn't the only group worried about the future of the industry if the Netflix deal is approved.A collective of top industry players sent an open letter to Congress detailing the potential economic and institutional blowback that could play out if the merger goes through.The letter, reported by Variety, stated that Netflix would \"effectively hold a noose around the theatrical marketplace\" and could alter the footprint of theatrical movies and decrease licensing fees paid in post-theatrical windows.An uncertain futureSeveral exhibitors told CNBC that they fear a deal between WBD and Netflix will result in fewer theatrical releases and even shorter theatrical windows for would-be major releases.Consolidation in the studio space has been a growing issue for the theatrical industry in recent years. When studios merge, they typically decrease the number of films they produce, something the industry saw firsthand when Disney bought 20th Century Fox back in 2019.The theatrical business has struggled in recent years from pandemic related production shutdowns as well as dual labor strikes that halted film shoots and delayed movie releases. The industry still has not returned to pre-pandemic release numbers or box office ticket sales, and there are worries that it never will.\"If you look historically, when legacy studios are absorbed by other entities, even in the case where those other entities are also legacy studios, the amount of movies produced for theatrical distribution goes down,\" O'Leary told CNBC Friday. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during an investor call Friday morning following the deal announcement that planned Warner Bros. releases \"will continue to go to the theaters through Warner Bros.\"Sarandos doesn't plan to alter WBD's current business practices, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. Still, he does plan to meet with theater owners in an effort to assuage any concerns and to explain his vision that movies should have shorter exclusive theatrical windows, the person said. For exhibitors, shrinking theatrical windows pose a major threat. Prior to the pandemic, movies typically played in theaters for between 70 and 90 days before entering the home market. Following Covid shutdowns, studios and cinemas renegotiated these terms, and the average window fell to 30 to 45 days.Netflix, however, has never followed these guidelines. The company has long held that its content is meant for its streaming subscribers and therefore should be delivered to them at home, on the service as soon as possible. If Netflix does release a film in cinemas, it's usually only for the minimum requirement to be eligible for awards contention or for weekend stints as one-off events. When Netflix does go to theaters, it doesn't report box office figures publicly. That's left industry analysts wondering if the company will continue WBD's transparency when it comes to ticket sales once the deal is finalized.\"We've released about 30 films into theaters this year, so it's not like we have this opposition to movies in the theaters,\" Sarandos said during Friday's investor call. \"My pushback has been mostly in the fact of the long exclusive windows, which we don't really think are that consumer friendly.\"\"Netflix movies will take the same strides they have, which is some of them do have a short run in the theater beforehand, but our primary goal is to bring first-run movies to our members, because that's what they're looking for,\" he said. Of course, that strategy could shift in the coming years. Alicia Reese, an analyst at Wedbush, highlighted in a research note Friday that the theatrical slate has already been negotiated through 2029.\"So any buyer would have to honor those contracts by showing the slated WBD films in theaters for at least the next four years,\" Reese wrote.One theater chain operator, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share candid thoughts, told CNBC, \"All exhibition can do is take Netflix at their word.\" \"In the deal they have pledged to continue to release legacy WB titles to theatres,\" the operator said. \"Now does that mean with a one-week window, a four-week window or no window? Netflix will have to diametrically alter their corporate philosophy of streaming first. We just have to wait to see. It's not great for exhibition.\"— CNBC's Alex Sherman and Stephen Desaulniers contributed to this report. Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of Fandango and NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025.Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThis isn't exactly what David Ellison had planned in September. Just a few months ago, the Paramount Skydance CEO sent a letter to the Warner Bros. Discovery board of directors arguing a combination of the two media and entertainment companies made sense. That letter was the first of several that offered increasingly higher prices to acquire the company along with arguments of why the assets were better together.Paramount's interest spurred a formal sale process — bringing Comcast and Netflix into the mix — which ultimately doubled the value of Warner Bros. Discovery shares and culminated, at least for the moment, in Paramount losing out in the bidding war it started.  On Friday, Netflix announced a deal to acquire HBO Max and the famed Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per share, or an equity value of $72 billion. WBD will move forward with a plan to separate out its pay-TV networks, such as CNN and TNT Sports, before the deal closes. Instead of supercharging Paramount, just months after gaining control of the company through a merger with Skydance, Ellison effectively handed a prized jewel of the media and entertainment industry to its most dominant player, strengthening Netflix's reach and stripping Paramount and Comcast's NBCUniversal of an obvious merger target. \"It wasn't for sale before, and they certainly hadn't cleaned up the assets or separated the assets in the way they have right now,\" said Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos in a conference call Friday morning after announcing the deal. \"I think that kind of goes to the 'why now.'\"Ellison jump-started a process that has made a lot of money for Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav, WBD's executive team and its shareholders. Zaslav's shareZaslav currently owns more than 4.2 million shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, with another 6.2 million shares that would be delivered to him in the future via previously granted stock awards, according to Equilar. Zaslav also has a grant of almost 20.9 million options with an exercise price of $10.16, Equilar found.Based on the Netflix-WBD transaction price of $27.75 per share, all of that adds up to more than $554 million for the WBD CEO. Factoring in another 4 million shares that Zaslav is set to receive in January, according to a person close to the situation who declined to be named speaking about the executive's holdings, the true total is closer to $660 million.For shareholders, the sale process has brought a similar windfall. Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $12.54 on Sept. 10, the day before The Wall Street Journal reported Paramount was preparing a bid for the company. On Friday morning, Warner Bros. Discovery shares were up almost 3% to more than $25 apiece. That's more than double Warner Bros. Discovery's unaffected sale process price and a return to 2022 levels when WarnerMedia and Discovery first merged. That's vindication for Zaslav, who has spent nearly four years coming under fire from Hollywood and investors for failing to deliver for shareholders. With Friday's announcement, he's effectively pulled victory from the jaws of defeat. And still, Paramount is likely not done with its pursuit of buying all of Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount's hostile playEllison has wasted no time at the helm of Paramount Skydance, transforming the company through deals and acquisitions.Since the merger closed in August, Paramount has brought on C-suite executives and high-profile Hollywood talent such as the Duffer Brothers. It secured the rights to develop a live-action feature film based on Activision's Call of Duty video game franchise and struck a $7.7 billion deal for UFC rights. Ellison's hunt for Warner Bros. Discovery was his biggest endeavor since taking control of the company.Paramount's lawyers sent a letter to Warner Bros. Discovery this week, first reported by CNBC, claiming the sale process had been rigged in Netflix's direction. Paramount has accused Warner Bros. Discovery of failing to properly consider its offer of $30, all-cash, and instead selling to Netflix as a predetermined outcome. Netflix made an initial bid for WBD's studio and streaming assets of $27 a share, according to a person familiar with the matter. That trumped Paramount's offer at the time and turned the trajectory of the sales talks in Netflix's direction, said the person, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private.Paramount was the only bidder interested in acquiring all of WBD's assets — the film studio, streaming service and TV networks. It has maintained that its offer is superior. Paramount's executives and advisors valued the Discovery Global networks portfolio at close to $2 a share, based on its predicted trading multiple and estimated leverage ratio, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named because the discussions were private. Discovery Global would include the CNN, TNT Sports and Discovery channels.Warner Bros. Discovery believes Discovery Global could have a value of $3 per share or more if it trades well in the public markets, according to other people with direct knowledge of the matter.Paramount has also argued there are tax efficiencies for shareholders in acquiring the whole company rather than buying only a portion of it, and that Netflix's bid comes with steeper regulatory risk. The Trump administration's view of the proposed combination is one of \"heavy skepticism,\" CNBC reported Friday.Paramount offered a break-up fee of $5 billion if the proposed deal didn't get regulatory approval, according to the people familiar.  Netflix's bid included a $5.8 billion break-up fee in case the deal doesn't get regulatory approval, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday. Paramount is now weighing its options about whether to go straight to shareholders with one more improved bid — perhaps even higher than the $30-per-share, all-cash offer it submitted to WBD this week. If it does, Netflix would have a chance to match that bid. The end result would mean even more money for WBD shareholders — and more money for Zaslav.— CNBC's Nick Wells contributed to this report.

Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump may remove members of the National Labor Relations Board and the Merit Systems Protection Board at will, a federal appeals court ruled Friday.The 2-1 decision from a panel of judges in Washington, D.C., reverses lower-court rulings blocking Trump's attempts to fire members of the key labor and employment panels.\"Congress may not restrict the President's ability to remove principal officers who wield substantial executive power,\" the two-judge majority wrote, citing a 2020 case known as Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.They determined that another key court precedent, which was cited in the prior rulings that favored the fired board members, did not apply to the NLRB and MSPB.Those boards \"wield substantial powers that are both executive in nature and different from the powers\" that are covered by the removal protections laid out in the 1935 case known as Humphrey's Executor, the majority wrote.\"So, Congress cannot restrict the President's ability to remove NLRB or MSPB members,\" ruled Judges Gregory Katsas and Justin Walker, who were both appointed to the D.C. circuit by Trump.The Trump administration is challenging the 90-year-old precedent set by Humphrey's, which limits the president's ability to unilaterally remove the heads of certain independent government agencies. The Supreme Court on Monday is set to hear oral arguments in a case that could determine whether Humphrey's is overturned. The third judge on the appellate panel, Florence Pan, warned in a strongly worded dissent that Friday's ruling significantly increases the president's power.\"Today, my colleagues make us the first court to strike down the independence of a traditional multimember expert agency,\" Pan, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, wrote.\"Under my colleagues' reasoning, it appears that no independent agencies may lawfully exist in this country,\" she wrote. \"Their determination that the MSPB cannot be independent ... suggests that no agencies can be independent.\"Pan added that her colleagues \"redefine the type of executive power that must be placed under the exclusive command of the President, and effectively grant him dominion over approximately thirty-three previously independent agencies.\"Katsas and Walker noted that their opinion does \"not address whether Congress may restrict the President's ability to remove members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\"They pointed to a Supreme Court ruling from May, which, while allowing Trump to temporarily fire two NLRB and MSPB members, identified \"a 'distinct historical tradition' regarding the treatment of congressionally chartered banks, which may bear on Congress's ability to restrict the removal of their officials.\"Trump has tried to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden nominee, while urging the central bank and its chairman, Jerome Powell, to quickly slash U.S. interest rates. Cook sued to block her removal; the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in the case on Jan. 21.Friday's ruling also does not touch on whether Congress can restrict the president's ability to fire members from certain agencies that have \"solely adjudicatory functions,\" Katsas and Walker noted.They cited the \"War Claims Commission,\" a temporary agency established after World War II to adjudicate compensation claims from American prisoners of war, as an example.Katsas and Walker additionally did not weigh in on \"whether wrongfully removed principal officers may obtain declaratory, equitable, or mandatory relief against the President or other government officials,\" they wrote.",

    "body": "Being a great leader takes time and practice, and a growing share of workers are trying to get better at it.Search interest in the term \"leadership\" is at an all-time high, according to Google data, along with related terms like training, best practices, advice on how to lead a team and sources for professional development.The buzz likely stems from people wanting to lead during a time of rapid business changes due to remote and hybrid policies in offices, global politics, changing economic circumstances and the adoption of technology like AI, says Brian Glaser, Google's chief learning officer.Glaser has been a manager off and on for the last 20 years and leads the onboarding, training and leadership development for some 150,000 employees worldwide. As a leadership expert, Glaser tells CNBC Make It that people of all experience levels struggle with one main aspect of being a boss: delivering \"really effective feedback so that people are clear about where they stand.\"Instead, many managers shy away from critical or constructive feedback in the pursuit of being well liked.\"As a leader, being nice is great,\" Glaser says. That can lead you to be liked among your reports, but \"the name of the game is really to be respected.\"\"If you're not delivering the feedback, you may not get the kind of respect you need as a manager,\" he says. This can be tough for first-time managers or someone who's been promoted and is now overseeing the work of former peers.But teams can grow stagnant or repeat avoidable mistakes \"if you're only looking to tell people what's working and not necessarily delivering the hard stuff,\" Glaser says.Glaser's team is behind Google's latest People Management Essentials, a paid course available to the public that covers lessons from over a dozen Google bosses about what it takes to be an excellent leader.Some of the lessons about delivering solid feedback are inspired by sports psychology, Glaser says.\"We know the best athletes are the folks who receive constant feedback from their coaches about how they're performing, he says. Win or lose, \"every time they finish a game, they debrief, they talk about what worked and what didn't. We believe those same concepts can be applied to organizational life.\"Talking about areas for improvements helps ensure stronger performance outcomes in the future. Athletes including Super Bowl champ Tom Brady and Team USA Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas have discussed that learning from mistakes and failures fueled their successes.In the workplace, meanwhile, telling a report that \"they need to improve can be challenging,\" Glaser says, \"but we know through good practice, managers can do this, and it really matters.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

Anna Rose Layden | ReutersThe White House on Friday evening named the Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent as \"media offender of the week,\" blasting their coverage of a video released by Democratic lawmakers telling the U.S. military that they can disobey illegal orders.The Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Last week, six Democrats, all with military or national security experience, released a video reminding service members that they have the right to refuse illegal orders. President Donald Trump accused them of \"seditious behavior\" and said that in \"the old days\" that was \"punishable by death.\" The FBI is now seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly and the other Democrats featured in the video.The White House has denied that Trump has ever issued illegal orders. However, some experts have said the Pentagon's deadly campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean is unlawful. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth verbally ordered to kill all crew members on a suspected drug boat. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a Marine Corps veteran, told the newspaper that Americans will eventually be prosecuted for this, \"either as a war crime or outright murder.\"",

Sergio Yate | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines said Saturday that aircrafts impacted by an Airbus recall have received the software fixes necessary to resume flying.\"As of 12 p.m. CT, no aircraft were left to be updated of the 209 impacted,\" the company said. \"American expects no further operational impact related to the Emergency Airworthiness Directive and looks forward to the remaining days of the Thanksgiving holiday travel period, especially Sunday, our most-traveled day.\"Thousands of travelers worldwide were stranded after Airbus ordered immediate software fixes for 6,000 A320-series aircraft, a move that affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.The directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.United Airlines said six aircraft in its fleet were affected, and the carrier expected \"minor disruption to a few flights.\"  Delta Air Lines said less than 50 of its Airbus A320 fleet were affected.Japan's ANA Holdings canceled 95 domestic flights Saturday, affecting around 13,200 passengers. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft.watch nowAir India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled.Scoot, another carrier under the Singapore Airlines group, said 21 of its 29 A320s required the fix and that it aimed to complete the work by Saturday.In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. \"As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November,\" a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC.The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an \"uncommanded and limited pitch down event.\"  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also issued an emergency directive later that day, ordering operators of the affected model to address the glitch.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: \"The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations.\"",

Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSouth Korea became the latest country to impose sanctions on Prince Group, a multinational network accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia. Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added. Prince Group is accused of operating large-scale online 'scam centers' in Cambodia and Myanmar that used trafficked workers to defraud victims around the world. South Korean sanctions target 15 people and 132 entities linked to the network.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New YorkSouth Korea and Cambodia agreed in October to set up a joint task force to help tackle online crimes, after a university student died of torture in August in a scam compound.Prince Group has denied any wrongdoing. In a Nov. 11 statement issued through U.S. law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, the group called the allegations \"baseless.\"\"The recent allegations are baseless and appear aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets worth billions of dollars,\" the Cambodia-based network said, adding that it had engaged a team of lawyers from the U.S. legal powerhouse.CNBC has reached out to Prince Group and Boies Schiller Flexner for comment and didn't immediately hear back.Crackdown widensThe latest action against Prince Group builds on broader international efforts to curb scam networks in the region. On Oct. 14, the U.S. and UK announced sweeping sanctions on Prince Group, which the U.S. Treasury Department designated as a \"Transnational Criminal Organization.\"The U.S. Department of Justice also seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin on Oct. 14, held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by Cambodian national Chen Zhi, the chairman of Prince Group. Zhi, a 38-year-old Chinese-born emigre who is also known as \"Vincent,\" was also charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy and remains at large.Chart of The Prince Group Transnational Criminal OrganizationU.S. Treasury DepartmentAnother Cambodian financial network, Huione Group, was also banned from the U.S. financial system on the same day, which the U.S. Treasury Department accused in May of colluding with North Korean cybercriminals.\"Huione Group serves as a critical node for laundering proceeds of cyber heists carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and for [Transnational Criminal Organizations] in Southeast Asia perpetrating virtual currency investment scams, commonly known as \"pig butchering\" scams, among others,\" the U.S. Treasury Department said.Seoul's sanctions announced Thursday also target the Huione Group. The British government said the centers in Southeast Asia used fake job adverts to lure workers, who were then forced to commit online fraud, including love scams and crypto scams, under threat of torture.In October, Singapore had seized over 150 million Singapore dollars of assets linked to the group. The Singapore Police Force said these included bank accounts, securities accounts and cash.",

These technological advances come with their own risks.  \"It definitely makes my life easier… but at the same time, it also makes fraudsters' life substantially easier as well,\" said Michael Reitblat, CEO of Forter, an identity intelligence company that works on fraud prevention.According to Reitblat, there has been a 200% increase in agentic shopping by consumers over the past six months. That has been accompanied by a nearly tenfold increase in fraudsters using AI. \"Think of it as sending thousands of robots into different stores to masquerade as good consumers,\" Reitblat told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"watch nowWhile some retailers' knee-jerk reaction has been to simply ban AI purchases, that could be a faulty strategy as more and more consumers use AI for shopping and that is driving good quality traffic, Reitblat said.A report by McKinsey & Company and The Business of Fashion found that among fashion executives, AI and digital tools were seen as the single biggest opportunity for the industry in 2026. To ensure products are visible and favored by AI models, brands must rethink marketing and e-commerce strategies, the report noted, adding that semantically rich data and API-accessible content will be critical to success.\"You need to use AI to fight AI,\" Reitblat said. \"You need to make sure that you're leveraging better data than fraudsters may have, and you need to properly think of: how do you authenticate the consumers?\"Shaky consumer confidenceValue-conscious consumers is another factor retailers have to deal with this year as heightened trade tensions and worries about a slowing economy impact consumers' spending habits.Consumer confidence has been shaky heading into the shopping season. In Europe, economic sentiment has remained stubbornly below its long-term average since mid-2022, according to data by the European Commission. Meanwhile in the U.S., consumer confidence hit its lowest point since April in November as concerns about job security mount.watch nowSome experts have suggested a split between wealthy consumers doing well and others that are cutting back on spending amid pressure from higher prices, in what has been dubbed the \"K-shaped economy.\"\"Consumer confidence has been bumpy, and therefore the customers feeling like they're getting genuine value is going to be a big thing for this year,\" said Curry's Chief Services Officer Dean Kramer. \"We know research is a big part of how consumers approach Black Friday, making sure they're getting absolute value.\"",

    "body": "Silver, often nicknamed the 'Devil's metal' because of its volatility, has reached record highs this year and still has further to run despite a supply crunch, according to experts.The metal's growth value has been running alongside gold's, which has seen its own rally with the price surging past $4,000 an ounce this year.Silver prices reached a historic peak of $54.47 per troy ounce in mid October, marking a 71% rise year-on-year. They've since pared back gains somewhat, but are now growing again, despite low supply levels.\"Some people were having to transport silver by plane rather than on cargo ships to meet delivery demand,\" Paul Syms, head of EMEA ETF Fixed Income and commodity product management at Invesco, told CNBC.\"While we've seen the spike up, we've seen the price come down a little bit. Longer term, there's a different dynamic this time that could keep silver at reasonably high prices and maybe continuing to go up for some time to come,\" he added.October was only the third time in the past 50 years where silver prices peaked. Other silver price highs include January 1980, when the Hunt brothers amassed a third of the world's supply as they attempted to corner the market, as well as 2011, following the U.S. debt ceiling crisis when silver and gold were embraced as safe haven assets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices year-to-date\"Silver is only about a tenth the size of the gold market, and that short squeeze, obviously, sort of caught a few investors by surprise,\" said Syms.Unlike the previous investment waves, silver's boom in 2025 relied on a mix of low supply and high demand from India as well as industrial needs and tariffs.\"After Liberation Day, the gold price spiked, but silver actually went down a little bit. And the gold-silver ratio spiked to above 100,\" said Syms, referring to the gold-silver ratio which reflects how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold.A low ratio means gold is relatively cheap, while a high ratio indicates silver is undervalued and likely to rise. In April, the ratio reached a historic high.\"The risk managers in financial and industrial entities did not want to let any metal go out of the States for fear that it might come back in at 35% higher for example,\" said Rhona O'Connell, head of market analysis EMEA and Asia at Stone X.watch nowFast forward to the Autumn and silver entered its peak demand, especially as India's monsoon and harvest seasons came to an end.\"Farmers don't really like the banks very much, so gold and latterly, silver, tend to be the first port of call when they've got the harvest in,\" said O'Connell.India is also the world's largest consumer of silver, with about 4,000 metric tons used every year, mostly for jewelry, utensils and ornaments. The silver appeal this Autumn also coincided with Diwali, a five-day 'Festival of Lights' celebrating prosperity and good fortune and also India's biggest public holiday.Supply crunchWhile gold is traditionally a favorite, this year silver — an affordable investment option in a country where about 55% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood — outshined other metals.On Oct. 17, the price of silver in India rose sharply, reaching a record high of 170,415 rupees a kilogram — an 85% rise since the start of the year.However, 80% of India's silver supply is imported. The UAE and China are increasingly supporting that demand, but the U.K. is traditionally India's largest silver supplier.Yet, London's vaults have been emptying rapidly for the past few years. In June 2022, the London Bullion Market Association held 31,023 metric tons of silver. By March  2025, volumes had fallen by around a third to 22,126 metric tons — its lowest point in years.\"What isn't necessarily so visible to people is what's happening in the vaults,\" said O'Connell. \"And that had reached a point where there was basically there was no available metal left in London.\"In October, the squeeze was such that traders had to pay much higher borrowing costs – or lease rates – to close their positions.\"At one stage, to borrow overnight was costing 200% on an annualized basis, so a lot of people were very stressed to put it mildly,\" said O'Connell.Supply is a constant issue for silver, as for other precious and rare metals. The Silver Institute's 2025's World Silver Survey estimates that mine production has been decreasing over the past 10 years, especially in Central and South America.\"Over the course of the past twelve months or so, the underlying surplus has started to turn into a deficit for three reasons: the impact of the electrification of the vehicle fleet, artificial intelligence, and photovoltaics,\" said O'Connell.Read more\"At the moment, a standard electric vehicle has about 25 grams of silver, maybe the larger EVs have 50 grams of silver as part of their components,\" said Syms.\"If we move into these solid-state silver batteries, each electric vehicle might require a kilo or more of silver,\" he added.And with silver having a high thermal conductivity and a higher electrical conductivity than other metals, as well as increasing demand for EVs, AI and renewables, the metal's value is likely to keep shining.\"Silver crosses over that bridge between precious and industrial metals, and the way technology is going on, the batteries, the solar panels, it's got some great use cases as we move into a more electrified world,\" said Syms.",

    "body": "Black Friday early morning shoppers rush in as the doors are opened at a Walmart store in Fairfax, Virginia, Nov. 28, 2008.Gerald Martineau | The Washington Post | Getty ImagesBlack Friday has long been defined by massive crowds, rock-bottom prices and rabid consumers willing to bite, scratch and claw their way to the best deals of the season. But these days, retail's biggest holiday looks a bit different. Stores are opening their doors later, foot traffic is flat, online shopping is up and, in a world where Black Friday begins in September, consumers are wary, unsure if the deals they're getting are even that good. \"The integrity of the event is pretty much gone,\" said Mark Cohen, former CEO of Sears Canada, who spent a decade as the director of retail studies at Columbia Business School. \"Back in the day, a Black Friday price was the best you could ever find on something ... never to be seen again. In today's day and age, promotional pricing just gets better and better from a consumer's point of view the closer you get to the holiday.\"A line forms for the 4 a.m. Black Friday opening at Kohl's department store in Pleasanton, California, Nov. 27, 2009.Michael Macor | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesWhile Black Friday remains a critical day for many retailers and is still arguably the most popular shopping day of the year, it's no longer defined by the in-person experience. Millions of shoppers are expected to visit malls, big-box stores and specialty retailers on Friday, but millions more are expected to stay at home and shop online from their phones and computers. That means a shift in strategy for retailers that have long gone all in on Black Friday, including Walmart, Target and Macy's. Some, such as Kohl's, are launching their holiday sales earlier in the season. Others, such as Walmart, are spacing out promotions in separate events — one in mid-November, another over the holiday weekend and a final, one-day event on Cyber Monday. Many others planned to stay closed on Thanksgiving but still had deals online during the holiday. \"I still recall queuing up outside stores waiting for those special deals that every retailer would advertise,\" said Denish Shah, the department chair and professor of marketing at Georgia State University's Robinson College of Business. \"Whereas now it goes over weeks, over multiple days, and most of the time the consumers are doing it from the comfort of their home through online sales.\" For the last six years, more people shopped online on Black Friday than in-store, and foot traffic has been relatively flat following a post-Covid spike, according to data from the National Retail Federation and Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate overall visits to locations.Since 2021, Black Friday store visits have consistently been more than 50% higher than the daily average for the full year, but the amount of foot traffic stores are getting on the day after Thanksgiving isn't really growing, data from Placer.ai shows. From 2023 to 2025, the number of millennials and Generation X consumers planning to make the majority of their purchases on Black Friday has dropped. It's largely flat for Gen Z and baby boomer shoppers over that time period, according to data from the Bank of America Institute.Meanwhile, the amount of money people are spending during the so-called Turkey 5 – the period of shopping days spanning Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday – has declined for two straight years, according to the NRF. Between 2019 and 2024, spending fell nearly 13%. That decline is expected to continue this year, with consumers planning to spend 4% less on average during the Turkey 5, according to a recent Deloitte survey. \"There is still going to be a day of highlights from retailers, whether it is door busters, ... certain additional promotions, etc.,\" said Tiffany Yeh, a managing director and partner with Boston Consulting Group's consumer practice. \"But it is more muted.\" How Black Friday lost its edge When the modern-day version of Black Friday became popularized in the 1980s, it took an entire year of planning to pull off, Cohen said. \"The art was to convince a vendor to give you an enormous discount on cost so that you could create this tremendously compelling offer to the consumer that would then ... benefit you for the balance of the holiday season,\" he recalled. \"But it required an enormous amount of work.\" Retailers had to pick the perfect product, set the perfect price and make sure their competitors didn't get wind of their promotional plans. Then, they had to make sure they ordered enough inventory to sell out, but not so early that it would cause riots. Black Friday shoppers pour in to a Best Buy store in Los Angeles at 5 a.m. on Nov. 28, 2008.Jewel Samad | AFP | Getty ImagesBut over time, as Black Friday became more popular, retailers began extending the shopping holiday so their biggest sales tailwind of the year could last longer than a single day. First, stores opened earlier Friday morning, then they began opening on Thanksgiving, and then, promotions began the day before. When consumers began expecting discounts on more than a handful of products, promotions were spread to items in every department.\"In other words,\" Cohen said, \"to sustain the ride, they started to dilute it.\" As discounts spread across the store, the operational feat behind inventory and staffing became even more challenging to manage, leading retailers to spread out promotions even earlier, Yeh said. \"It's always been a tough one to really staff up labor so significantly for a short period of time,\" she said. \"If it's only for a day, people are not going to necessarily want to sign up for that, versus, if it's for a longer season, then you're more likely to get the necessary team members and also be able to train them.\"At the same time, consumer habits began to shift in the backdrop. Are Black Friday deals still worth it? Online shopping had been on a slow and steady rise for 20 years, but during the Covid-19 pandemic, adoption skyrocketed. Now, retailers don't need to put on as big of an in-person show on Black Friday, because online sales are increasingly outpacing those in stores. Stretching Black Friday into a seasonlong event also makes it easier for consumers to spread out their own spending, Shah said. \"November and December are two different pay periods for many consumers,\" he said. \"It makes a difference if they can spread their spending across two pay periods rather than just one.\" Of course, there's also debate about how good the discounts actually are on Black Friday, especially in a soft economy where retailers are leaning heavily on promotions to drive sales at the same time they're raising prices to offset tariffs. People crowd the first floor of Macy's department store in New York as they open for Black Friday sales at midnight on Nov. 23, 2012.Stan Honda | AFP | Getty Images\"Rampant discounting\" across the industry — before, during and after the holiday shopping season — has left many consumers feeling \"skeptical\" about promotions overall, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of consulting firm AlixPartners' global fashion practice. Some promotions this holiday season could also be disguising price increases, notching the cost back down to what it was before the ticket price was raised, said Lapinsky. \"They've had the power to cross-shop and look for these discounts, and now there's just this lack of trust,\" Lapinsky said. \"They're tired of doing that, and there's a lack of trust that they're actually getting the value piece of it.\" For example, brands like Gap, Levi Strauss and Under Armour started their Black Friday sales on Thanksgiving, and the promotions were comparable to those offered earlier in the season.\"The whole idea of creating urgency is kind of goofy and gone,\" Cohen said. \"Like so many headlines that purportedly offer a deal, the deal is something of a scam.\" ",

But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up.

A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024. Swiss billionaire Peter Spuhler, founder and owner of Stadler Rail, has threatened to leave the country if the tax becomes law. He told told Swiss daily Tagesanzeiger that his family would struggle to pay such a tax as their wealth is tied up in companies.\"A lot of people who would be affected talked to their consultants and their tax lawyers, and they did the paperwork to be sure that this time of the year, a week before the final vote, they are ready to move out if necessary,\" Stefan Legge from the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland told CNBC on Friday.'The ultra wealthy are like queens on a chessboard'Legge, who conducted research into the potential impact of the tax, said: \"If you target the super wealthy, they are like queens on a chessboard.\" \"They are very mobile.

    "body": "Carly Xie looks over facial mask items at the Face Shop, which specializes in Korean cosmetics, in San Francisco, April 15, 2015.Avila Gonzalez | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesOn a recent Saturday at an Ulta Beauty store in midtown Manhattan, Denise McCarthy, a mother in her 40s, stood in front of a wall of tiny pastel bottles, tubes and compacts. Her phone buzzed — another TikTok from her 15-year-old daughter.\"My kids text me the TikToks,\" she told CNBC, scooping Korean lip tints and sunscreens into her basket, destined for Christmas stockings. \"I don't even know what half of this does. I just buy the ones they send me.\"Two aisles over, a group of college students compared swatches of Korean cushion foundations. A dad asked a store associate whether a viral Korean sunscreen was the one \"from the girl who does the 'get ready with me' videos.\" Near the checkout, a display of Korean sheet mask mini-packs was nearly empty.Scenes like this are playing out across the country.Once a niche reserved for beauty obsessives, Korean cosmetics — known as K-beauty — are breaking fully into the American mainstream, fueled by TikTok virality, younger and more diverse shoppers, and aggressive expansion from retailers such as Ulta, Sephora, Walmart and Costco.K-beauty sales in the United States are expected to top $2 billion in 2025, up more than 37% from last year, according to market research firm NielsenIQ, far outpacing the broader beauty market's single-digit growth.And even as trade tensions complicate supply chains, brands and retailers told CNBC the momentum is strong.\"We have no plans of slowing down and see more opportunities to penetrate the market,\" said Janet Kim, vice president at K-beauty brand Neogen.In the first half of 2025, South Korea shipped a record $5.5 billion worth of cosmetics, up nearly 15% year over year, and has become the leading exporter of cosmetics to the U.S., surpassing France, according to data from the South Korean government.\"The growth has been remarkable,\" said Therese-Ann D'Ambrosia, vice president of beauty and personal care at NielsenIQ. \"When you compare that to the broader beauty market, which is growing at single digits, K-beauty is clearly operating in a different gear right now.\"Facial skin care remains the biggest K-beauty revenue driver in the U.S., NielsenIQ reported. Hair care is growing fastest, and hybrid items such as tinted serums and skin care-infused cushion compacts — sponge cushions soaked with an SPF foundation — continue to surge, the firm said.Big businessRetailers are racing to take advantage of the cosmetics boom, and a turf war is underway.Ulta, which has over 1,400 U.S. stores, launched \"K-beauty World\" in July, to spotlight Korean brands and tech devices. It's the only major U.S. retailer carrying products from Medicube, a beauty-tech company touted by celebrities such as Hailey Bieber. Ulta's first quarter 2025 report cited a 38% increase in Korean skin care sales, and executives said in August that new K-beauty partnerships contributed to the company beating Wall Street expectations for earnings in the second quarter. Sephora is leaning in as well. Its Times Square flagship location now features an entire wall of Korean skin care and cosmetics, and the retailer secured exclusive U.S. launches for Korean heritage brand Hanyul and sensitive-skin label Aestura.Big-box players are piling in too. Costco and Walmart have also expanded their assortments, adding essences, serums and sheet masks as demand accelerates.\"It's an arms race to see who can capitalize on the market for Korean products,\" Delphine Horvath, professor of cosmetics and fragrance marketing at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CNBC. \"These products are now seen as a top driver of growth for cosmetic brands, and it seems it will keep booming.\"The competition is heating up just as Olive Young, often called the \"Sephora of Seoul,\" prepares to open its first U.S. store in Los Angeles next year. Asian beauty retailer Sukoshi is also expanding, planning 20 new stores in the coming year across cities such as Seattle, Miami, and Austin, Texas.\"Meeting customers where they can touch, feel and try what they see on TikTok is key,\" Sukoshi CEO Linda Dang told CNBC. \"Across the industry, companies are looking to expand partly because people really don't want to have to wait for shipping or travel all the way to Korea to get products.\"The boom arrives in the middle of the ongoing trade war.This spring, U.S. shoppers rushed to stock up on K-beauty favorites, bracing for price hikes from tariffs, Dang said. However, prices ultimately stayed relatively stable as Korean brands have temporarily absorbed the duties, Dang said, though many are now exploring alternative manufacturing or shipping methods.South Korea finalized a deal with President Donald Trump last month, settling on a 15% tariff rate instead of the initial 25% levy the president announced in April.\"The system of easy trading isn't what it was before tariffs,\" Dang told CNBC. \"That being said, a lot of companies have worked with advertisers and internally to do their best to offset and prevent passing those costs on to customers in the U.S.\"A visitor tries Korean-made cosmetics during the 2022 Korea Tourism Organization's Discover Your Korea, in Vanderbilt Hall of Grand Central Terminal, New York.Lev Radin | Pacific Press | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe 'second wave'Over the past decade, there's also been a rise in Korean entertainment in the U.S. — from pop groups such as BTS and Blackpink to this year's Netflix hit \"KPop Demon Hunters\" —which has helped push South Korea's cultural exports to unprecedented popularity.\"Korean culture has exploded on every front, and that has really shown up when it comes to K-beauty,\" Dang said.K-beauty's \"first wave,\" which hit the U.S. in the mid-2010s, was defined by \"glass skin,\" 10-step routines, snail mucin, cushion compacts and beauty blemish creams. Most products catered to lighter skin tones, and distribution was limited to small boutiques, Amazon sellers and early test placements at Ulta and Sephora, beauty experts said.\"The first wave had some penetration, but nothing like today,\" Horvath said. \"It was mostly people in the know.\"The second wave has been bigger, faster and far more inclusive. It has spanned color cosmetics, hair and scalp care, body care, fragrances and high-tech devices. TikTok is the central engine of discovery, especially for Gen Z and millennial shoppers, who account for roughly three-fourths of K-beauty consumers, according to a Personal Care Insights market analyst report. Posts tagged \"K-beauty\" or \"Korean skin care\" draw 250 million views per week, according to consumer data firm Spate. And viral products with sleek packaging often vanish from shelves faster than retailers can restock — particularly those that combine gentle formulas and low prices, Dang said.\"TikTok has changed the game,\" Horvath said. \"It's easier to educate consumers on innovation and get the word out. Brands are deeply invested in paying influencers, and TikTokers talk about textures, formulas and efficacy.\"Virality has also pushed brands to be more inclusive for younger and more diverse shoppers. After TikTok creators criticized Korean brand Tirtir for offering only three foundation shades, the company expanded to 40 shades within months and many other companies followed suit.The trend is visible across the Americas: 61% of consumers in Mexico and nearly half in Brazil say K-beauty is popular in their country, compared with about 45% in the U.S., according to Statista.\"Traditional retail and e-commerce remain important, but TikTok Shop is the standout disruptor,\" said Nielsen's D'Ambrosia. \"It's not just about the direct sales on that one platform; it's about how it's changing the entire discovery and purchase journey.\"But the second wave brings its own risks. A heavy dependence on virality could expose brands to sudden algorithm changes or regulatory scrutiny, D'Ambrosia said.\"When you have so much growth concentrated on one platform [such as TikTok], algorithm changes could significantly impact discoverability overnight,\" D'Ambrosia said. \"We've seen what happens when platforms tweak their recommendation engines. ... There are definitely some caution flags we're watching.\"Collagen eye patches and face masks at the Face Shop, which specializes in Korean beauty items, in San Francisco, April 15, 2015.Avila Gonzalez | San Francisco Chronicle | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesRapid innovationK-beauty's staying power, Dang said, is rooted in an intensely competitive domestic Korean market. Trends move at breakneck speed and consumers spend more per capita on beauty than in any other country, according to South Korean research firm KOISRA.South Korea had more than 28,000 licensed cosmetics sellers in 2024 — nearly double that of five years ago — creating a pressure-cooker environment that forces constant experimentation, said Neogen's Kim.\"We develop about hundreds of formulas each day,\" Kim told CNBC. \"We build the library and we test results with clinical individual tests. ... Everything that's very unique and works really well for skin care, we develop.\"Korean consumers churn through trends quickly, fueling a pipeline of upstart brands that can go viral and, in some cases, get acquired. For example, when gooey snail mucin, a gel used to protect and repair people's skin, took off globally, skin care brand Amorepacific acquired COSRX, the small Korean brand that helped popularize the ingredient, for roughly $700 million.The next wave of products, analysts predict, are likely to be even more experimental. Brands are betting on buzzy ingredients such as DNA extracted from salmon or trout sperm that early research suggests may help calm or repair skin. They are also expanding into biotechnology.\"K-beauty is very data-driven. [Artificial intelligence] helps us get fast results for content, formula development, and advertising,\" Kim said. \"In Korea, they started talking about delivery systems. They're very good with biotechnology.\"watch now",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

    "body": "Yellow Dog Productions | The Image Bank | Getty ImagesIf you plan to donate money on Giving Tuesday, you could score a tax break. But recent changes enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" could affect your savings, financial experts say.   Some 36.1 million U.S. adults participated in Giving Tuesday for 2024, with donations totaling $3.6 billion, up from $3.1 billion in 2023, according to estimates from GivingTuesday Data Commons.Despite economic uncertainty in 2025, high assets in donor-advised funds could continue to bolster philanthropy in the coming years, according to an analysis from consulting firm RSM. These funds, which act like a charitable checkbook, allow donors to receive immediate tax deductions for their contributions and then grant the money to nonprofits over time.If you're preparing to write a check on Giving Tuesday 2025 or before year-end, here are some key things to know about Trump's tax law changes.  Wait until 2026 for smaller cash giftsWhen filing returns, you take the greater of the standard deduction — $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly in 2025 — or your itemized tax breaks, which include deductions for charity, state and local taxes and medical expenses, among others. The vast majority of taxpayers use the standard deduction, according to the latest IRS data, which prevents most people from claiming the charitable deduction. But starting in 2026, Trump's tax law added a new charitable tax break for non-itemizers, worth up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly.If you're planning to donate cash in 2025 and don't itemize deductions, \"wait until next year,\" said Thomas Gorczynski, a Tempe, Arizona-based enrolled agent. An enrolled agent has a tax license to practice before the IRS.Higher earners should donate more in 2025Another 2026 change affects higher earners who could see a smaller charitable deduction, thanks to Trump's legislation.  After 2025, there's an itemized charitable deduction \"floor,\" which only allows the tax break once it exceeds 0.5% of your adjusted gross income. Plus, the new law caps the benefit for filers in the top 37% income tax bracket, also beginning in 2026.High-income itemizers \"should seriously think about making that contribution in 2025 as opposed to 2026,\" said Bob Petix, senior wealth strategist for Wells Fargo Wealth and Investment Management.One option is \"bunching\" multiple years of gifts into 2025 via a donor-advised fund, which allows future gifts to eligible charities of your choice, experts say. The strategy would provide an upfront charitable deduction for 2025 before the limits change in 2026.watch now",

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10? Is that not going out to eat?\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

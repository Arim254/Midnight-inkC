Siebert told Justice Department officials before he quit that \"investigators found insufficient evidence to bring charges against Ms. James and had also raised concerns about a potential case against Mr. Comey,\" The New York Times reported on the day he resigned. </p><p>Trump promptly tapped Halligan to replace Siebert.</p><p>New York Gov. Kathy Hochul blasted the indictment of her fellow Democrat James.</p><p>\"New Yorkers know @NewYorkStateAG James for her integrity, her independence, and her relentless fight for justice,\" Hochul wrote in a <a href=\"https://x.com/GovKathyHochul/status/1976390804999721286\" target=\"_blank\">post on X.</a></p><p>\"What we're seeing today is nothing less than the weaponization of the Justice Department to punish those who hold the powerful accountable,\" the governor wrote.</p><p>James' indictment comes three days after MSNBC reported that a top prosecutor in Halligan's office, Elizabeth Yusi, was resisting pressure to ask a grand jury to charge James.</p><p>\"Yusi ... has confided to co-workers that she sees no probable cause to believe James engaged in mortgage fraud, the two sources told MSNBC,\" that report on Monday said.</p><p>Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte in April made a criminal referral against James with the U.S. Justice Department, saying she had in multiple instances falsified bank documents and property records in connection with a home in Virginia and a New York property.</p><p>Lowell has denied the suggestion that James said the Virginia home was her primary residence to obtain a more favorable loan rate.</p><p>In early September, she asked the state's highest court to overturn an appeals court's decision tossing out the $500 million penalty imposed on Trump and his company in the business fraud case.</p><p><strong>This is breaking news.

    "body": "<div><div><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/04/how-to-add-dividend-funds-to-your-investment-portfolio.html\">Dividend-paying stocks</a> are popular among retirees, and for good reason: The cash that companies distribute to their stockholders is a form of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/how-to-use-dividend-strategies-to-create-passive-income.html\">truly passive income</a>.</p><p>A retiree with a $1 million stock portfolio paying a 3% average dividend yield can expect $30,000 a year just for holding the stock. But dividend-paying stocks have plenty to offer younger investors, too, says <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/30/jim-cramer-disagrees-with-warren-buffett-on-classic-investing-strategy.html\">Jim Cramer</a>, host of CNBC's \"Mad Money\" and author of \"<a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Make-Money-in-Any-Market/James-J-Cramer/9781668088647\" target=\"_blank\">How to Make Money in Any Market</a>.\"</p><p>\"I love dividends,\" Cramer tells CNBC Make It. \"And the reason why I love dividends is: If you keep them in your fund by reinvesting them, you end up with just a huge amount of stock that you never thought [you'd have].\"</p><p>In other words, if you take your cash distributions and use them to buy more stock, you can build wealth that much faster.</p></div><h2><a></a>How dividends help you build wealth</h2><div><p>A quick reminder of how dividends work: Profitable companies have a choice of what to do with their excess cash, and many financially mature firms issue cash distributions to shareholders as a sort of \"thank you\" for their loyalty.</p><p>You can calculate a company's dividend yield — which reflects the generosity of a firm's payout — by dividing the amount of cash you receive per year, typically divvied up in quarterly payments, by the stock's share price. A stock worth $100 per share that pays a $1 annual dividend yields 1%.</p><p>The S&P 500 currently yields 1.17%, which may seem like small potatoes compared with the index's prodigious returns in recent years. \"Most of the time people don't even consider dividends as too important,\" Cramer writes in his book. \"They seem small, a couple of percentage points at best.\"</p><p>But over long periods, reinvested dividends can have an outsize impact on investment returns, due to compound interest, says Cramer.</p><p>\"The great part of investing is how much more you make if you compound,\" he says. \"Do you know, about half of the [return of the] S&P since the time I've been in the business is from the [dividends] compounding?\"</p></div><div><p>Say you buy $100 worth of stocks, and after a year, they're worth $110. Based on the movement in the value of your shares, you've earned a 10% \"price\" return. What if the stock had a 2% dividend yield, too? If you use that dividend to buy more shares, now you have $112 worth of stock for a 12% \"total\" return.</p><p>Do that year after year over a career as long as Cramer's -- he writes that he started \"investing seriously\" in 1982 — and it's easy to see how things add up. </p><p>The further you go back, the bigger a dividend's impact.<strong> </strong>From the start of 1960 through 2024, a $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have earned you roughly $982,000 based solely on price appreciation, according to mutual fund and ETF provider<strong> </strong>Hartford Funds. Over the same period, that investment with reinvested dividends would have grown to $6.42 million, with the dividends accounting for 85% of the index's total return.</p><p>It's no wonder, then, that Cramer describes dividends as \"magic\" – as long as younger investors consistently use them to bolster their investments.</p><p>\"You cannot take your dividends out,\" he says. \"If you're doing my program [and] you take the dividends out, I can't help you.\"</p><p><em><strong>Upgrade to an </strong></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/investingclub/subscribe/?ClubMerch&__source=investingclub%7Consite%7Carticle%7Cmakeit%7Ccramerbook&tpcc=investingclub%7Consite%7Carticle%7Cmakeit%7Ccramerbook\"><em><strong>annual CNBC Investing Club membership</strong></em></a><em><strong> today and claim your free, signed copy of Jim Cramer's new book, \"How to Make Money in Any Market.\"</strong> (See terms and conditions for complete offer details.

It was Ferrari's worst trading day since the automaker publicly listed on the Milan stock exchange in early 2016.</p><p>U.S.-listed shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed down by 15% at $407.38 apiece, marking the stock's worst trading day since Ferrari listed in October 2015. The stock's largest single-day decline was previously 12.4% in February 2016.</p><p>The U.S.-listed shares, with a market cap of nearly $77 billion, are now down about 4% for the year.</p><p>Analysts at Citi said in a research note that Ferrari's guidance \"falls below our 'lower growth case' estimates from our CMD preview and reflects conservatism from management, we think.\"</p><p>They added, \"Given guidance, albeit conservative, implies limited operating leverage through the coming cycle we think there is some risk to both consensus EPS and multiples near-term.\"</p></div><div><p>A picture shows the entrance of the historic Ferrari factory in Maranello on February 18, 2025.   </p><p>Federico Scoppa | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>In a separate <a href=\"https://www.ferrari.com/en-EN/corporate/articles/ferrari-capital-markets-day-2030-strategic-plan\" target=\"_blank\">update</a>, Ferrari said it would target a 2030 sports car model lineup made up of 40% internal combustion engine, or ICE, cars, 40% hybrid and 20% fully electric vehicles.</p><p>Ferrari said the revised target, which is down from a prior goal of 40% EV sales by the end of the decade, is the result of a client-centric approach, the current environment and its expected evolution.</p><p>The pivot comes as the Italian carmaker lifted the hood on the technology set to power its maiden electric vehicle. Ferrari unveiled the production-ready chassis and powertrain of the \"elettrica\" during a technology and innovation workshop, saying it would start deliveries of the model in late 2026.</p><p>The completed car is expected to be launched at a global premiere next year.</p><p>\"With the new Ferrari elettrica, we once again affirm our will to progress by uniting the discipline of technology, the creativity of design and the craft of manufacturing,\" John Elkann, executive chairman of Ferrari, said in a statement.</p></div><h2><a></a>Electric ambitions</h2><div><p>Several global carmakers have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/autos-car-giants-forced-to-confront-hard-truths-over-ev-transition.html\">scaled back their EV sales targets</a> in recent months, citing factors such a lack of affordable models, a slower-than-anticipated rollout of charging points and intense competition from China.</p><p>Sweden's Volvo Cars, for instance, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/swedens-volvo-cars-scraps-plan-to-only-sell-electric-vehicles-by-2030.html\">abandoned</a> its heavily promoted plan to sell only EVs by 2030, saying in September last year that it needed to be \"pragmatic and flexible\" amid changing market conditions.</p><p>Ferrari, which has seen its current number of active clients grow to 90,000, an increase of 20% compared with 2022, also said it planned to launch an average of four new cars per year between 2026 and 2030.</p><p>Analysts at JPMorgan were bullish following the announcements laid out in Ferrari's 2030 Strategic Plan.</p><p>\"We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on its long-term plan given ample evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,\" analysts at JPMorgan said Thursday in a research note.</p><p>\"We also estimate the company benefits from CEO Benedetto Vigna's leadership style, which has challenged the company to capitalise on collaboration to increase the speed at which it embraces innovation. An imminent Supercar launch may also have the potential to turbocharge profits,\" they added.</p><p>— <em>CNBC's </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/michael-bloom/\"><em>Michael Bloom</em></a><em> and </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/michael-wayland/\"><em>Michael Wayland</em></a><em> contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>",

    "body": "<div><p>A pedestrian walk by sign is posted in front of Levi Strauss headquarters on Oct. 9, 2025 in San Francisco, California. </p><p>Justin Sullivan | Getty Images</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LEVI/\">Levi Strauss</a><span><span></span></span></span>'s profits are growing more than Wall Street expected despite higher costs from tariffs, thanks to targeted price increases and a shift away from wholesalers, the company said Thursday as it reported fiscal third quarter results. </p><p>During the quarter, Levi's gross margin grew 1.1 percentage points to 61.7%, up from 60.6% in the year-ago period and better than the 60.7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. </p><p>In an interview with CNBC, CEO Michelle Gass said the company has started to raise the price of some of its jeans and clothes and will hike more prices in the U.S. and other markets next year.</p><p>\"As we've been taking these targeted actions, we've not seen an impact to demand. We'll of course, stay very, very close to that but … we're taking a surgical, thoughtful approach on any pricing,\" said Gass. \"We know that we're a brand that is known for great quality and value. We don't take that for granted. We know we have to earn that every day.\" </p><p>Finance chief Harmit Singh added demand is \"really strong\" and most of the company's revenue growth is not coming from price increases.</p><p>Price hikes are helping Levi's margins, but the company is also discounting less and selling more through its own website and stores instead of wholesalers, which comes at a higher margin. </p><p>The denim maker said its strong results led it to raise its full-year outlook, but added<strong> </strong>it's still taking a \"prudent\" and \"conservative\" look at the rest of the year as it navigates ongoing macroeconomic volatility, Singh said. </p><p>Here's how Levi's performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:</p><ul><li>Earnings per share: 34 cents adjusted vs. 31 cents expected</li><li>Revenue: $1.54 billion vs. $1.50 billion expected</li></ul><p>Though Levi's posted better-than-expected results, shares dropped more than 6% in extended trading. Its stock had climbed about 42% this year through Thursday's close.</p><p>The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended Aug. 31 was $218 million, or 55 cents per share, compared with $20.7 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items related to impairment and restructuring charges, among other expenses, Levi posted adjusted earnings of 34 cents per share. </p><p>Sales rose to $1.54 billion, up 7% from $1.44 billion a year earlier.</p><p>Levi's is now expecting its full year sales to rise 3%, up from its prior guidance of between 1% and 2% growth, far exceeding expectations of a 2.9% decline, according to LSEG. </p><p>It's expecting its full year adjusted earnings per share to be between $1.27 and $1.32, up from a prior range of between $1.25 and $1.30. At the high end, the outlook is in line with Wall Street estimates of $1.31 per share, according to LSEG. </p><p>The jeans company said it's expecting its operating margin to be between 11.4% and 11.6%, which is also in line with expectations of 11.6%, according to StreetAccount. It's now expecting its gross margin to rise by 1 percentage point, which is the outlook Levi's delivered earlier this year before it factored tariffs into its forecast. At the time, its guidance didn't reflect any tariff impact. The following quarter, it cut its gross margin guidance by 0.2 percentage points because of the new duties. </p><p>Now, Levi's is returning to that original outlook, as long as U.S. tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and rest-of-world duties stay at 20% for the remainder of the year. </p><p>Under the direction of Gass, Levi's has been working to grow its direct sales, expand beyond jeans and win over more female shoppers – strategies that helped the business grow both its top and bottom lines. </p><p>During the quarter, direct-to-consumer revenue, or sales from Levi's website and stores, grew 11%, driven by strength in the U.S. market, while women's was up 9%. Levi's is benefiting from strong momentum in the denim category, but the company is growing its assortment outside of just jeans, which gives it a hedge if fashion trends change.</p><p>Other types of clothes beyond denim bottoms, including tops, now make up nearly 40% of the business. The company's efforts to sell more tops is also resonating with consumers, as that category was up 9% during the quarter.</p></div>",

letters came as the Trump administration continues to face pressure — from Democrats and from some of President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>'s Republican supporters — over its handling of matters related to Epstein.</p><p>The wealthy financier and sex offender, who was once a friend of Trump's, died by suicide while in jail facing federal child sex trafficking charges in 2019.</p><p>In his letters, Raskin bluntly asked each CEO if their bank will \"help reveal the truth\" about Epstein and his co-conspirators, or if they would \"choose to be part of the cover-up for this massive, international sex trafficking ring that victimized more than 1,000 women and girls?\"</p><p>Deutsche Bank, in a statement to CNBC, said that it \"takes its legal obligations seriously, including appropriately responding to authorized investigations and proceedings.\" The statement did not explicitly commit to complying with Raskin's requests.</p><p>\"The bank regrets our historical connection with Jeffrey Epstein,\" Deutsche Bank said. \"We have cooperated with regulatory and law enforcement agencies regarding their investigations and have been transparent in addressing deficiencies and investing in strengthening our control environment in parallel.\"</p><p>JPMorgan declined to comment on Raskin's request.</p><p>The congressman, in his letter to Dimon, emphasized that the CEO recently said, referring to Epstein, that he and JPMorgan \"regret any association with that man at all.\"</p><p>Raskin also noted that Dimon had committed to providing information to the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>But Dimon had specified that he would comply with a subpoena, saying, \"If it's a legal requirement, we would conform to it. We have no issue with that.\"</p><p>JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank have both paid substantial sums to settle lawsuits accusing them of facilitating and financially benefiting from sex trafficking by their client, Epstein.</p><p>In 2023, JPMorgan agreed to pay $290 million to settle a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Epstein victims and reached a $75 million settlement in a separate case brought by the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p>The same year, Deutsche Bank agreed to<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/18/jeffrey-epstein-lawsuit-deutsche-bank-will-pay-75-million-to-victims.html\"> pay $75 million</a> to Epstein victims to settle a suit.</p><p>Bank of America and BNY Mellon did not respond to CNBC's requests for comment on Raskin's letters to their CEOs.</p><p>Raskin wrote that he was sending the letters after Republicans, who hold a majority on the Judiciary panel voted against Democratic members' <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/09/17/congress/dems-fail-to-subpoena-major-banks-in-epstein-case-00569352\" target=\"_blank\">attempt to issue subpoenas</a> to the four bank CEOs last month.</p><p>The subpoena effort fell in a nearly party-line vote. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote in favor of the subpoenas.</p><p>The request for subpoenas came at the end of a hearing with FBI Director Kash Patel, whom Democrats grilled about the Trump administration's handling of the so-called Epstein files.</p><p>Raskin, in his letters, asserted that Patel's testimony showed that his FBI \"has failed to 'follow the money'\" regarding suspicious transactions related to Epstein that the banks had reported to the Treasury Department.</p><p>Raskin's letters focused on records known as Suspicious Activity Reports, SARs, which banks are required to file when they notice certain unusual financial activities that may be connected to illegal conduct.</p><p>The lawmaker accused each of the four banks of either ignoring or failing to adequately report red flags about Epstein's financial transfers.</p></div><div><h2>Read more CNBC politics coverage</h2><div><ul><li><a target=\"_blank\"

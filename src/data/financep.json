Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesJapanese exports in September snapped four months of declines, climbing 4.2% year on year, as shipments to Asia saw robust growth, partially offsetting the drop in exports to the U.S.Exports, however, missed Reuters' median estimates of a 4.6% rise.Shipments to Asia climbed 9.2% compared to the same period last year, boosted by a 5.8% jump in exports to mainland China, Japan's largest trading partner rose. Exports to the U.S., Japan's second largest trading partner, dropped 13.3%.Japan's semiconductor exports were a driver of the overall growth in September, rising 12.6% in terms of value year on year.Japan's exports had fallen into negative territory as the country grappled with U.S. tariffs, with its shipments of automobiles to the world's largest economy taking a huge hit. Auto shipments to the U.S. dropped 24.2% in September in terms of value, slightly less compared to the 28.4% drop in August.Tokyo in July clinched a trade deal with Washington, bringing down tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from the 25% initially proposed by President Donald Trump. The 15% tariffs took effect on Aug. 7.The world's fourth-largest economy saw imports increase 3.3% year on year, reversing course from the 5.2% decline in August and beating the 0.6% growth expected by the Reuters poll.Hirofumi Suzuki, chief FX strategist & head of research at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, told CNBC that exports are actually \"not as strong as it appears on the surface,\" citing the impact of a low base last year. He expects external demand to continue to recover, lifting exports growth, but warns that U.S.-China trade tensions have clouded the outlook.Japan's trade data comes a day after the country got its first female prime minister in Sanae Takaichi, after months of political turmoil following electoral losses of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.Takaichi's stance of a loose momentary policy and massive fiscal stimulus is likely to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive, benefiting exporters — heavyweights on the benchmark Nikkei 225 that hit a record high on Tuesday.SMBC's Suzuki said that even though \"the yen was at quite weak levels against the U.S. dollar last year, we have yet to see a significant surge in exports. Policy factors such as tariffs seem to have a larger impact than FX on exports.\"  The yen hit a low of nearly 150 against the greenback in September, compared with 147 during the same month last year.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMarkets have priced in the so-called \"Takaichi trade\" since she took the helm of the LDP in September, which has seen the Nikkei rise to record highs and the yen weakening past the 150 mark.The country's economy has held up better than expected, with the second-quarter GDP being revised upward to 0.5% quarter on quarter from 0.3% estimated initially — analysts in a Reuters poll had had estimated 0.1% growth.",

DraftKings targeted the company for its team and proprietary technology. \"We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,\" DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC. \"We believe that Railbird's team and platform—combined with DraftKings' scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.\"Predictions markets allow customers to trade on the outcomes of various events in the worlds of finance, culture and entertainment, which will allow DraftKings to expand beyond its sports betting business. The markets on election outcomes and sports are the most controversial.  Dozens of states, their gaming regulators and tribes are suing or taking other actions to try to prohibit companies from offering trades based on sporting events, because they see it as unlicensed gambling.  Nevada is among the states warning that companies risk losing their gambling licenses if they offer sports in their prediction markets.If DraftKings offers sports events contracts, it's likely to focus only on states that don't offer licensed sports betting, like California and Texas, to avoid running afoul of the states where it offers sports betting.  Additionally, technology exists to prevent those sports trades from being available on tribal lands.  DraftKings also may offer more advanced \"know your customer\" guardrails, a term commonly used to reference identity verification, given its experience in the regulated gambling market.  ",

    "body": "watch nowLauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, said the surge in enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has all the markings of a bubble.\"We are absolutely in an AI bubble now. It is going to burst,\" she said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday to David Faber. \"I don't know when, I don't know the order of magnitude. A lot of people are going to lose money.\"Her remarks come as enthusiasm for AI continues to drive markets higher, with investors betting the technology will transform industries and lift corporate earnings. Taylor Wolfe said investors are underestimating the risks tied to the surge in AI-related spending by major technology companies.\"There are trillions of dollars that are being earmarked to be spent relative to hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow generated by the Mag 7,\" she said, referring to the group of large-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. \"They're going to have to borrow to invest in all this CapEx, and we have yet to see the returns on investment.\"Her remarks come at a time when analysis shows the S&P 500 has become pretty much an AI index.Taylor Wolfe believes the mismatch between capital expenditures and profit potential makes current valuations difficult to justify.\"Show me the trillions of dollars of profits that are going to be generated in the next five years,\" she said. \"And you just can't. The math doesn't work.\"She said the current environment is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when investors chased anything associated with the internet regardless of valuation or business model. During the dotcom era, the right thing to do wasn't short the bubble companies; it was to look where no one else was looking, she said.\"You'd have been better off owning a railroad in 2000 than buying Cisco at 35 times earnings, Taylor Wolfe said. \"So at Impactive, what we're doing today is looking for our railroads.\"At the 13D Monitor's Active-Passive Investor Summit Tuesday, Taylor Wolfe presented her new idea Advanced Drainage Systems, which she called the undisputed leader in plastic stormwater and residential septic systems. She said the company is AI proof.",

Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House,\" the White House said in a statement.The White House called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.Photos of construction workers tearing down parts of the building went viral online Monday, triggering public anger over the planned 90,000-square-foot, $250 million ballroom.\"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back,\" Trump said during a Rose Garden event Tuesday. \"That's music to my ears. I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it.\"In July, Trump said that construction of the ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building.\"\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said of the White House at the time.The Treasury Department has told staff not to share photos of the East Wing, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. The department is located next to the White House, and has a clear view of the demolition work.\"Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details,\" the Treasury spokesperson told CNBC.\"Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images.\"The Wall Street Journal first reported Treasury's message to employees.\"Trump's billionaire ballroom. This is a disgrace. Welcome to the Second Gilded Age,\" Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., tweeted Monday, above a photo from The Washington Post showing the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will finance the construction of the ballroom.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom's construction. It is unclear how much Comcast and other donors contributed. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.",

Its popularity has spurred Netflix to release it twice in theaters — once in August for a two-day weekend event and again next week around Halloween.Partnering with Mattel and Hasbro will allow Netflix to offer a suite of consumer products based around the film.Mattel will handle dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets, while Hasbro will focus on plush, electronics, roleplay items and board games, the companies announced Tuesday.

    "body": "watch nowShares of Netflix fell around 7% in extended trading Tuesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said. \"It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,\" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a have a material impact on our results going.\" Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.Here's how the company did in the period ended September 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share:  $5.87 vs. $6.97, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.51 billion vs. $11.51 billion, according to LSEGNetflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%. Still, Netflix said it posted its best ad sales quarter ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.\"Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. \"This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.\"Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of \"Strangers Things\" and new seasons of \"The Diplomat\" and \"Nobody Wants This\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" and Rian Johnson's \"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.\"Netflix is also still riding the coattails of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated film has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" dolls, plush, roleplay items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHBO Max is the latest streaming services to raise its prices.The streaming giant, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Tuesday that it is raising prices across all plans. HBO Max's Basic with ads plan is increasing $1 a month to $10.99, the Standard plan is going up $1.50 to $18.49, and Premium is increasing $2 to $22.99. HBO Max last raised prices in June 2024.The price hikes are effective immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the new prices starting on their next billing date on or after November 20, the company said. The updates come as the streaming market becomes increasingly saturated with options — and as other major apps hike their prices. Disney raised the price of its Disney+ plans and bundles last month, Apple hiked the price of Apple TV by 30% in August and Netflix raised its prices early this year.WBD CEO David Zaslav indicated in September that price increases were on the way along with a stricter crackdown on sharing passwords.\"The fact that this is quality, and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality, we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,\" Zaslav said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month. \"We think we're way underpriced.\"As of June 30, WBD said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That stat includes HBO Max as well as other legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service.HBO Max's news comes as its parent company, WBD, undergoes changes of its own. The company announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. A streaming and studios company would include its movie properties and HBO Max, while a global networks business would include linear channels like CNN and TNT Sports. At the same time, WBD is fielding takeout interest from companies including Paramount Skydance and said Tuesday it's open to a sale. ",

    "body": "The Mattel, Inc. logo is displayed outside the headquarters of the toy company known for products including Barbie and Hot Wheels in El Segundo, California on June 8, 2023.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBarbie-maker Mattel posted third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations as ongoing global tariffs continue to hamper the toy manufacturer's sales in North America.Shares of the company fell 4% in after hours trading.Here's what Mattel reported for its third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. $1.07 expectedRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $1.83 billion expectedFor the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $278 million, or 88 cents per share, down from $372 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs associated with restructuring and certain product recalls, per-share profit was 89 cents.Net sales fell 6% to $1.74 billion, coming in short of Wall Street's expectations.This is the first time in three quarters that the toy giant has missed on both earnings and revenue expectations.In May, Mattel pulled its annual financial targets and said it would increase prices for some products in the U.S. to counter higher input costs due to the Trump administration's tariffs on key trading partners. On Tuesday the company issued full-year guidance that calls for net sales to increase between 1% and 3% and for earnings per share to come in between $1.54 and $1.66.\"While our U.S. business was challenged in the third quarter by industry-wide shifts in retailer ordering patterns, the fundamentals of our business are strong,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said in a release. \"Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, orders from retailers in the US have accelerated significantly.\"Tariffs have put pressure on toy manufacturers industry-wide. Approximately half of Mattel's global toy sales come from the U.S., and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China, Kreiz noted on CNBC in May.During the third quarter, sales in North America fell 12%, with the largest year over year declines in the company's infant, toddler and preschool category. International sales meanwhile climbed 3%.Overall, sales for two of Mattel's largest toy brands saw declining sales: Global Barbie sales fell 17% from the same quarter a year earlier, and Fisher-Price sales dropped 19%. The company's global Hot Wheels sales ticked up 8%.Moving forward, Mattel has focused on expanding its entertainment offerings and employing new technology. On Tuesday, Mattel and Hasbro partnered with Netflix to capitalize on the success of the movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" to offer dolls and other consumer products tied to the film.Mattel is producing dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets and currently is taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.Correction: Mattel reported net income of $278 million. A previous version of this article misstated the figure. ",

More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, 1-day performanceIt's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBYND, all timeYet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.watch nowThe return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix is \"all in\" on leveraging generative artificial intelligence on its streaming platform, according to the company, as AI continues to make its way into mainstream entertainment.The comments came from Netflix's earnings report Tuesday, which highlighted AI as a major focus for the world's largest streaming service by subscriber count. \"For many years now, [machine learning] and AI have been powering our title recommendations as well as production and promotion technology,\" Netflix said in a letter to shareholders.It added that generative AI presents a \"significant opportunity\" across its streaming platform, including improving its recommendations, ads business, and movies and TV content.\"We're empowering creators with a broad set of GenAI tools to help them achieve their visions and deliver even more impactful titles for members,\" the company said.Netflix provided recent examples of this, noting its recently distributed film Happy Gilmore 2 used generative AI tools to help de-age characters. Meanwhile, producers for the Netflix series Billionaires' Bunker have used various generative AI tools during pre-production to explore wardrobe and set designs.Concerns of AI replacementNetflix's comments come amid broader concerns in the entertainment and art world regarding the potential for AI to replace human workers and the technology's use of human-made content.  Speaking during an earnings call, Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos seemingly addressed those issues, noting that AI can enhance the overall TV and movie experience, but \"can't automatically make you a great storyteller if you're not.\"\"We're confident that AI is going to help us and help our creative partners tell stories better, faster and in new ways — we're all in on that,\" Sarandos said. He added: \"We're not worried about AI replacing creativity.\" However, many in the entertainment industry remain skeptical of AI and its growing presence in media. An upstart production studio called Particle6 recently faced massive backlash for its plan to create, design, manage and monetize AI-generated actors and talent, including from the media union SAG-AFTRA. SAG-AFTRA previously led a significant actors' strike in July 2023, amid a broader series of Hollywood labor disputes that saw concerns about the use of artificial intelligence brought to the forefront.The strike lasted over 100 days before a tentative agreement was reached between SAG-AFTRA and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which included the establishment of contractual AI protections for film and TV performers for the first time.To further encourage the responsible use of such AI tools, Netflix recently released a new AI-focused production guidance aimed at its creators. watch now",

Chevrolet Silverado truck at a dealership in Upland, California, US, on Wednesday, Oct 15, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — General Motors raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday after beating Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, while lowering its expected impact from tariffs.GM stock rose more than 15% in trading Tuesday. The stock, which closed Monday at $58 per share, had its best day since 2020 and its second best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.31 expectedRevenue: $48.59 billion vs. $45.27 billion expectedAdjusted EBIT: $3.38 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedGM's third-quarter revenue of $48.59 billion was down less than 1% from $48.76 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. GM's new outlook signals strength for the automaker heading into the fourth quarter and beats Wall Street analysts' current expectations for the last three months of the year.The updated guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, up from $10 billion to $12.5 billion, or $8.25 to $10 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGM stock in 2025The automaker's new EPS target suggests fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of between $1.64 and $2.39, with a midpoint around $2.02, which is above current consensus of $1.94.\"Thanks to the collective efforts of our team, and our compelling vehicle portfolio, GM delivered another very good quarter of earnings and free cash flow,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday in a shareholder letter. \"Based on our performance, we are raising our full-year guidance, underscoring our confidence in the company's trajectory.\"GM also reduced the expected impact of tariffs this year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, down from $4 billion to $5 billion. The automaker expects to offset about 35% of that impact.Barra on Tuesday thanked President Donald Trump for \"the important tariff updates\" Friday that included imposing levies on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts as well as extending a tariff offset worth 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.Read moreEV impactGM's adjusted results do not include $1.6 billion in special charges reported by the automaker last week due to its pullback in all-electric vehicles, which more than halved its net income attributable to stockholders compared with the third quarter of 2024.The company's net income attributable to stockholders was $1.3 billion during the just-reported period, down 57% from roughly $3.1 billion a year earlier. Its net income margin also plummeted to 2.7%, down from 6.3% a year earlier.GM CFO Paul Jacobson on Tuesday said only about 40% of the company's EVs were profitable on a production, or contribution-margin basis. He signaled that the company expects profitability for EVs to take longer than previously expected amid an expected slowdown in adoption.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" he told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box.\"GM has made significant gains in EV sales this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. GM still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla by a wide margin.NA business downGM's North American business, which has driven its profits this decade, earned more than $2.5 billion during the third quarter, on an adjusted basis. Its adjusted profit margin declined from 9.7% a year earlier to 6.2% during the most recent quarter.Barra said in Tuesday's letter that the automaker's \"top priority\" is to return to 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America through \"driving EV profitability, maintaining production and pricing discipline, managing fixed costs, and further reducing tariff exposure.\"Gains in the company's China operations, up $217 million from a year earlier, as well as its international markets, up $184 million, helped offset the lower North American earnings during the third quarter.GM Financial, the automaker's lending arm, also reported adjusted earnings of $804 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2024.",

    "body": "The Workday Inc. pop-up pavilion ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, on Saturday, Jan. 19, 2025.Hollie Adams | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of software maker Workday dropped as much as 10% on Wednesday as analysts lowered their price targets, citing a lack of a upside after the company revised its full-year subscription revenue forecast.Many software stocks have been under pressure in 2025 as commentators have worried that generative artificial intelligence tools that can quickly write lines of code might pose risks to incumbents. This year, Workday has announced the launch of several AI agents and expanded its offerings through startup acquisitions. Earlier this month, Workday completed the $1.1 billion purchase of AI and learning software company Sana.Despite those moves, Workday's third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday failed to impress Wall Street. The company called for $8.83 billion in subscription revenue for the fiscal year that will end in January 2026, implying 14.4% growth, but the figure was up just $13 million from the company's guidance in August. The new number includes contributions from Sana and a contract with the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, Workday finance chief Zane Rowe told analysts on a conference call.\"Investors were likely looking for more of a beat-and-raise quarter,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Matt VanVliet and Mason Marion wrote in a note to clients. They have the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday stock. The new number, they wrote, \"borders on a slight guide down.\" The analysts held their 12-month price target on Workday stock at $280.Stifel, with a hold rating on the stock, lowered its Workday target to $235 from $255.\"It does not appear that the underlying momentum of the business is showing any signs of stabilization,\" Stifel's Brad Reback and Robert Galvin wrote in a note. Reback and Galvin said Workday implied that growth from its 12-month subscription revenue backlog will continue to slow when removing impact from acquisitions. They expect the trend to continue even as customers sign up for Workday's AI products, they wrote.The outcome was \"like turkey without the gravy,\" Evercore analysts, with the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock, wrote in the title of their note. Analysts at RBC, which also has the equivalent of a buy rating on Workday shares, lowered their price target to $320 from $340. Despite the mixed guidance, they wrote in a note to clients, results for the fiscal third quarter did exceed consensus. Plus, AI products contributed over 1.5 percentage points of annualized revenue growth, Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said on Tuesday's conference call. '\"We remain encouraged by early AI momentum,\" the RBC analysts wrote.WATCH: AI will drive the market higher in 2026, says Citizens' Mark Lehmannwatch now",

    "body": "At this point, shopping on Black Friday is every bit a Thanksgiving tradition as turkey dinners and pumpkin pie. But certain discounts you see online may not be as good a deal as advertised. In fact, 36% of items on sale for Black Friday offer no savings compared with how they were priced between Oct. 27 and Nov. 17, according to new data from WalletHub. \"There's some trickery happening,\" says consumer savings expert Andrea Woroch. \"Retailers are constantly fluctuating prices. So they may repackage something and say it's on sale for Black Friday when, in reality, it was the same discount a few weeks ago.\"That's not to say that there aren't legitimate savings to be had. For items that are on sale, the average markdown is about 24%, according to WalletHub's data. You'll just have to do a little digging to make sure that you're making the most of the discounts you see. \"The consumer has to be proactive,\" says Chip Lupo, a writer and analyst at WalletHub. \"Because retailers do more or less rely on people rushing in at the last minute and taking advantage of anything that appears to be a sale.\" Track price historiesIdeally, says Woroch, you'd begin researching items that you're considering buying long before an anticipated sale while keeping an eye on the price. But if you come across an enticing discount while shopping Black Friday sales, \"it's definitely not too late\" to do some research to make sure you're getting a good deal, Woroch says. Using online price tracking tools is a good place to start, Woroch says. She recommends CamelCamelCamel, which compares current prices for items listed on Amazon with their historical high, low and average cost. \"Even if you're trying to figure out a price at another retailer, that's a good benchmark,\" says Woroch. Woroch also likes the Droplist browser extension from Honey, which allows you to make a list of items you're interested in purchasing and will notify you of price drops at more than 800 retailers. Some products will be more difficult to track because they're manufactured specifically for Black Friday sales, says Woroch. A bargain price on a TV, for instance, may mean that you're buying a basic version of a more prominent model without some of the bells and whistles you're looking for, she says. \"Don't assume that the model is the same one you saw all year long that you've been waiting for it to drop in price,\" Woroch says. \"Look at the model number, look when it's been sold, read reviews and make sure it offers everything you need.\"Beware of other Black Friday pitfallsAlthough Black Friday is often touted as the time of the year when the deepest discounts are available, don't fall into the trap of buying something that may go on deeper sale during another time of year, experts say. Winter apparel, for instance, tends to go on sale after Christmas, says Woroch. And the biggest sales on furniture typically happen on Presidents Day, she says. \"You may be able to find good deals on mattresses,\" says Lupo. \"But you're unlikely to see big discounts on traditional furniture like couch sets or coffee tables on Black Friday.\"And no matter what you buy, beware of deals that encourage what Woroch calls \"spaving\" — spending more money than you otherwise would to unlock discounts. That may mean buying a more expensive \"bundle\" of items to earn a markdown or meeting a certain spending threshold to get free shipping. \"Maybe it's buy two sweaters, get one free. If you only need one sweater, don't buy the second one, just to get one free,\" Woroch says. You could come out of Black Friday having spent extra money on things you don't really need, she says. And if you're on a tight budget, \"you could find yourself in a lot of trouble because of it.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA)Yuri Gripas | ReutersRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., filed a 19-page lawsuit Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., alleging Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte abused his authority to make \"fanciful\" mortgage fraud allegations against him and other critics of President Donald Trump.The lawsuit asks the court to declare Pulte's conduct unlawful, order him and the FHFA to withdraw a criminal mortgage fraud referral, and award damages for violations of federal privacy law.Swalwell — who announced Friday that he is running for governor of California — alleges in the complaint that Pulte improperly accessed and leaked his private mortgage records in retaliation for his political speech, violating both the Privacy Act of 1974 and the First Amendment.\"Director Pulte has combed through private records of political opponents to silence them,\" Swalwell posted in a statement on X.The suit alleges Pulte's referral of the matter to the Justice Department was \"patently false,\" noting that Swalwell had sworn in an affidavit that his Washington, D.C., home would be his wife's primary residence and that he remained a California resident.Swalwell's lawyers note in the filing that the disclosures landed just as Swalwell prepared to launch his gubernatorial bid. The leak of Pulte's referral letter to the media occurred \"with remarkable speed,\" the suit states, followed by conservative commentators posting details about his home where his wife and children live, activity Swalwell's suit says increased security risks for his family.The filing casts Pulte's actions as part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to use federal agencies and the courts against political opponents. Swalwell, a seven-term congressman and former House impeachment manager during Trump's second impeachment, has long been one of the most vocal critics of the president. \"Pulte's brazen practice of obtaining confidential mortgage records from Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac and then using them as a basis for referring individual homeowners to DOJ for prosecution is unprecedented and unlawful,\" the lawsuit argues. In recent months, Pulte has issued similar criminal referrals to Swalwell's to other Trump critics, among them New York Attorney General Letitia James, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. James' indictment was dismissed by a federal judge Monday while Schiff faces an ongoing probe though has not been charged. Cook also has not been charged, though Trump cited the criminal referral as cause in his attempt to fire her from the board of governors for the Federal Reserve in August. The firing is currently on hold pending a Supreme Court review.Pulte defended his agency's criminal referral of Cook to CNBC in August, saying it wasn't politically motivated. \"We make referrals almost every day. Lisa Cook happened to be one of them,\" he said.In an interview with \"Squawk Box\" in September, Pulte refused to tell host Andrew Ross Sorkin where the tip came from.\"I'm not going to explain our sources and methods, where we get tips from, who are whistleblowers,\" Pulte said.Swalwell's lawsuit says no comparable FHFA criminal referrals have been made against Trump allies. There is evidence that top Trump officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made mortgage claims similar to ones Trump cited to try to fire Cook.Spokespeople for the FHFA and DOJ did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

    "body": "Singapore tops the list in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index by INSEAD and Portulans Institute.Calvin Chan Wai Meng | E+ | Getty ImagesSingapore has claimed the top position in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) for the first time, bolstered by its robust education systems, sound governance and a proactive approach to sustaining an adaptive, innovation-ready workforce in the age of artificial intelligence.In its 11th edition this year, the index — produced by business school INSEAD and in partnership with D.C.-based think tank Portulans Institute — measured how countries grow, attract and retain talent across all income groups.This year's report, themed \"resilience in the age of disruption,\" ranked 135 economies globally on 77 indicators such as soft skills and AI talent concentration across six pillars.This report comes at a time when \"rapid technological change, geopolitical uncertainty and profound societal transitions make dependable talent metrics more essential than ever,\" said Rafael Escalona Reynoso, CEO of Portulans Institute.While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety.Lily FangDean of research and innovation, INSEAD\"While historians can give us more perspective, it certainly feels as if we are living in a period of maximum disruption and anxiety,\" said INSEAD's dean of research and innovation, Lily Fang. \"Geopolitical uncertainty poses massive challenges to the resilience of global commerce and markets, while artificial intelligence presents both amazing opportunities to enhance human potential — but also unfathomable risks.\"Here are the top 10 countries in the 2025 Global Talent Competitiveness Index: SingaporeSwitzerlandDenmarkFinlandSwedenNetherlandsNorwayLuxembourgUnited StatesAustralia Notably, Switzerland was leapfrogged by Singapore and fell from its top position for the first time in the history of the GTCI. However, the country records multiple top-five results across the study's framework, including internet access in schools (1st), government effectiveness (2nd), and AI skills migration (4th).High-income European countries continue to dominate the ranking, accounting for seven of the top ten positions. Switzerland, Denmark and Finland closely follow each other in the top ten, \"suggesting a shared focus on enabling and retaining talent through favorable conditions and access to opportunities,\" according to the report. These three countries consistently rank near the top in enabling and retaining talent.Several Nordic countries have jumped places in the top ten since the last GTCI in 2023. Denmark moved up one position to 3rd this year from 4th in the 2023 report, Finland jumped two places from 6th to 4th, and Sweden jumped four places from 9th in rank in 2023 to 4th this year. Meanwhile, the United States fell from third place in 2023 to ninth in this year's report — its weakest showing since 2013. Although the U.S. scored strongly in areas such as enabling and growing talent, \"slight declines in the categories of openness and lifelong learning\" pushed the country down to ninth place in 2025, according to the report.Singapore takes the leadSingapore's rise marks a big milestone for both the country and the wider region in the competition for talent, the report said.The city-state \"ranks in the top ten across four of the six pillars and has made notable improvements in its ability to retain talent, rising seven positions,\" according to the report. The Southeast Asian country also leads globally in enabling and retaining talent, which is supported by the country's regulatory landscape and high standards of living. The country also ranked first globally in formal education and \"Generalist Adaptive Skills,\" which spans soft skills, digital literacy, and innovation-oriented thinking.A key driver of Singapore's jump this year is a sharp improvement in its ability to retain talent, jumping seven places from 38th in 2023 to 31st this year. The report pointed to gains in areas such as physician density, personal rights, personal safety and more. \"Economies that cultivate adaptable, cross-functional and AI-literate workforces tend to be better positioned to convert disruption into opportunity and sustain long-term competitiveness,\" says Paul Evans, emeritus professor of organisational behaviour at INSEAD and co-editor of the report.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "watch nowMassachusetts Institute of Technology on Wednesday released a study that found that artificial intelligence can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor market, or as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, health care and professional services.The study was conducted using a labor simulation tool called the Iceberg Index, which was created by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The index simulates how 151 million U.S. workers interact across the country and how they are affected by AI and corresponding policy. The Iceberg Index, which was announced earlier this year, offers a forward-looking view of how AI may reshape the labor market, not just in coastal tech hubs but across every state in the country. For lawmakers preparing billion-dollar reskilling and training investments, the index offers a detailed map of where disruption is forming down to the zip code.\"Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market,\" said Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research. ORNL is a Department of Energy research center in eastern Tennessee, home to the Frontier supercomputer, which powers many large-scale modeling efforts.The index runs population-level experiments, revealing how AI reshapes tasks, skills and labor flows long before those changes show up in the real economy, Balaprakash said. The index treats the 151 million workers as individual agents, each tagged with skills, tasks, occupation and location. It maps more than 32,000 skills across 923 occupations in 3,000 counties, then measures where current AI systems can already perform those skills.What the researchers found is that the visible tip of the iceberg — the layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing and information technology — represents just 2.2% of total wage exposure, or about $211 billion. Beneath the surface lies the total exposure, the $1.2 trillion in wages, and that includes routine functions in human resources, logistics, finance, and office administration. Those are areas sometimes overlooked in automation forecasts.The index is not a prediction engine about exactly when or where jobs will be lost, the researchers said. Instead, it's meant to give a skills-centered snapshot of what today's AI systems can already do, and give policymakers a structured way to explore what-if scenarios before they commit real money and legislation.The researchers partnered with state governments to run proactive simulations. Tennessee, North Carolina and Utah helped validate the model using their own labor data and have begun building policy scenarios using the platform.watch nowTennessee moved first, citing the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month. Utah state leaders are preparing to release a similar report based on Iceberg's modeling. North Carolina state Sen. DeAndrea Salvador, who has worked closely with MIT on the project, said what drew her to the research is how it surfaces effects that traditional tools miss. She added that one of the most useful features is the ability to drill down to local detail. \"One of the things that you can go down to is county-specific data to essentially say, within a certain census block, here are the skills that is currently happening now and then matching those skills with what are the likelihood of them being automated or augmented, and what could that mean in terms of the shifts in the state's GDP in that area, but also in employment,\" she said. Salvador said that kind of simulation work is especially valuable as states stand up overlapping AI task forces and working groups.The Iceberg Index also challenges a common assumption about AI risk — that it will stay confined to tech roles in coastal hubs. The index's simulations show exposed occupations spread across all 50 states, including inland and rural regions that are often left out of the AI conversation.To address that gap, the Iceberg team has built an interactive simulation environment that allows states to experiment with different policy levers — from shifting workforce dollars and tweaking training programs to exploring how changes in technology adoption might affect local employment and gross domestic product. \"Project Iceberg enables policymakers and business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize training and infrastructure investments, and test interventions before committing billions to implementation,\" the report says. Balaprakash, who also serves on the Tennessee Artificial Intelligence Advisory Council, shared state-specific findings with the governor's team and the state's AI director. He said many of Tennessee's core sectors — health care, nuclear energy, manufacturing and transportation — still depend heavily on physical work, which offers some insulation from purely digital automation. The question, he said, is how to use new technologies such as robotics and AI assistants to strengthen those industries rather than hollow them out.For now, the team is positioning Iceberg not as a finished product but as a sandbox that states can use to prepare for AI's impact on their workforces. \"It is really aimed towards getting in and starting to try out different scenarios,\" Salvador said.

    "body": "President Donald Trump and his administration will begin imposing new limits for federal student loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2026.Undergraduate borrowers will have the same current limit of up to $7,500 a year for dependent students, depending on their class year. But graduate and professional students will see new limits of up to $20,500 per year ($100,000 total) for graduate studies and $50,000 a year ($200,000 total) for professional programs. Graduate PLUS loans, which previously allowed students to borrow up to their total cost of attendance, will be eliminated.According to the proposed regulation, a professional degree \"signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree.\"The Department of Education has named 11 degree fields that meet the requirements to be considered professional, and thus eligible for higher loan limits under the new rules: Pharmacy (Pharm. D.)Dentistry doctorate (D.D.S. or D.M.S.)Veterinary medicine (D.V.M.)Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.)Law (L.L.B. or J.D.)Medicine (M.D.)Optometry (O.D.)Osteopathic medicine (D.O.)Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.)Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.)Clinical psychology (Psy.D. or Ph.D.)The addition of clinical psychology came out of the department's recent negotiated rulemaking session where stakeholders debated the loan limit rule and how it should be applied.The department also said programs in at least 44 other fields could qualify if they meet certain criteria, including giving students a \"level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree,\" generally resulting in a doctoral level degree and requiring professional licensure to begin practice. Potentially eligible programs include a number of other pharmacy degrees, clinical counseling and theological studies. Institutions are responsible for determining whether a program meets the requirements to be considered a professional degree or not, says Sarah Austin, a policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.Professional organizations respondSome professional organizations have expressed concern over the list of degrees eligible for the $200,000 aggregate federal loan limit and the Department of Education's definition of professional programs.\"Despite broad recognition of the complexity, rigor, and necessity of post-baccalaureate nursing education, the Department's proposal defines professional programs so narrowly that nursing, the nation's largest healthcare profession, remains excluded,\" The American Association of Colleges of Nursing said in a press release on Nov. 7. \"Should this proposal be finalized, the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.\"\"Declassifying the [Master of Social Work] and [Doctorate of Social Work] degrees will reduce access to affordable social work education, thereby increasing reliance on high-interest private loans,\" the National Association of Social Workers' Florida chapter said in a press release on Nov. 20.In a fact sheet released on Nov. 24, the Department of Education said, \"The definition of a 'professional degree' is an internal definition used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.\"The intention behind the loan limits is to discourage borrowers from taking on more debt than they will be able to handle and to encourage institutions to rein in tuition costs, the department said. The loan limit regulation is not final, however. The Department of Education will publish the regulation in its current form in the federal register in the coming months where the public will have the opportunity to give feedback before it becomes final.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesConsumers soured on the current economy and their prospects for the future, with worries growing over the ability to find a job, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday.The board's Consumer Confidence Index for November slumped to 88.7, a drop of 6.8 points from the prior month for its lowest reading since April. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for a reading of 93.2.In addition, the expectations index tumbled 8.6 points to 63.2, while the present situation index slipped to 126.9, a decline of 4.3 points.\"Consumers were notably more pessimistic about business conditions six months from now,\" said Dana Peterson, the board's chief economist. \"Mid-2026 expectations for labor market conditions remained decidedly negative, and expectations for increased household incomes shrunk dramatically, after six months of strongly positive readings.\"A key reading within the report that measures job expectations showed deterioration.The share of workers saying that jobs are \"plentiful\" slid to 6%, down from 28.6% in October and reflective of the \"no hire, no fire\" current job climate showing in other data points. Another question asking whether jobs were \"hard to get\" edged lower to 17.9%, a drop of 0.4 percentage point.Those results come the same day that payrolls processing firm ADP reported that private companies shed an average 13,500 jobs over the past four weeks. Moreover, the Conference Board survey is consistent with other measures showing weakening sentiment among consumers.For instance, the University of Michigan's sentiment gauge dropped 4.9% in November on a monthly basis and was off 29% from a year ago.The weakening numbers have coincided with public statements from several key Federal Reserve officials who believe further interest rate reductions are warranted. Traders are pricing in a high probability that the Fed lowers its key borrowing rate by another quarter percentage point in December.In the Conference Board survey, Peterson noted weakness across income and political groups.\"Consumers' write-in responses pertaining to factors affecting the economy continued to be led by references to prices and inflation, tariffs and trade, and politics, with increased mentions of the federal government shutdown,\" Peterson said. \"Mentions of the labor market eased somewhat but still stood out among all other frequent themes not already cited.\"Inflation expectations rose, with respondents predicting a 4.8% rate one year from now, well above the Fed's 2% target and topping the Michigan survey outlook for 4.5%. Respondents also expressed \"strongly positive\" expectations for the stock market over the next year.Economic data has been hampered by the recently ended shutdown. Government agencies responsible for the reports suspended all data collection and releases while the impasse continued, with a trickle of mostly dated reports coming out in recent days.",

    "body": "Apple CEO Tim Cook holds up a new iPhone 17 Pro during an Apple special event at Apple headquarters on September 09, 2025 in Cupertino, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApple is set to ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025, the first time it will have done so in 14 years, Counterpoint Research said in a note on Wednesday.Apple will ship around 243 million iPhone units this year versus 235 million shipments from Samsung, Counterpoint told CNBC. Apple is likely to end up with a 19.4% share of the global smartphone market while Samsung's share will be 18.7%.Shipments refer to the number of devices vendors ship to retail channels and do not directly equal sales. However, they provide insights into demand and expectations of sales from smartphone makers.Apple's success is being driven by its iPhone 17 series launched in September, which, according to Counterpoint, had a \"bumper\" holiday sales season.Sales of the iPhone 17 series in the U.S. — including the iPhone Air — during the first four weeks after launch was 12% higher than that of the iPhone 16 series, excluding the iPhone 16e, the research firm said. In China, a critical market for Apple, sales of the iPhone 17 series during the same period were 18% higher than its predecessor.\"Beyond the highly positive market reception for the iPhone 17 series, the key driver behind the upgraded shipment outlook lies in the replacement cycle reaching its inflection point. Consumers who purchased smartphones during the COVID-19 boom are now entering their upgrade phase,\" Counterpoint Research Senior Analyst Yang Wang, said in the note. Samsung meanwhile, could face challenges in the low-to-mid tier of the smartphone market from Chinese players, which could hamper the South Korean giant's ability to reclaim the top spot, Counterpoint said. Apple longer-term boostCounterpoint Research forecasts Apple will hold the top spot in the global smartphone market through 2029. The analysts laid out a few reasons why.Firstly, 358 million second-hand iPhones were sold between 2023 and the second quarter of 2025. \"These users are also likely to upgrade to a new iPhone in the coming years. These factors will form a sizable demand base, which is expected to sustain iPhone shipment growth over the coming quarters,\" Counterpoint Research said.Apple benefited from a lower-than-expected impact from tariffs given the trade truce between the U.S. and China. This helped Apple's broader supply chain and growth in certain regions, such as emerging markets. The tech giant also benefited from a weaker U.S. dollar and a \"resilient economic outlook\" that boosted consumer confidence.\"With these structural tailwinds, Apple is well-positioned to surpass Samsung in annual shipments in 2025,\" Wang said.Meanwhile, Apple is expected to launch the entry level iPhone 17e next year as well as a foldable smartphone, Counterpoint forecast. The research firm said it expects the previously-announced improvements to Apple's virtual assistant Siri as well as a \"major iPhone design revamp\" in 2027, to also underpin Apple's dominance over the next few years.\"By expanding its lineup across multiple price tiers, including the growing \"e\" series, and potential adjustments to the Pro and Base launch cycles, Apple is strategically positioning itself to capture rising demand from aspirational consumers, particularly in emerging markets, and to strengthen its presence in the lower premium segment, which is projected to grow faster than the overall market,\" Counterpoint said.\"Given an increasing preference for the iOS ecosystem, compatibility between devices and a substantial number of older models within Apple's installed base due for renewal, Apple will retain the lead over other smartphone OEMs through the end of the decade.\"",

Ann Wang | ReutersPC and printer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday it'll lower its headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 people, representing a cut of up to 10%. HP also issued a lower-than-expected earnings projection for the new fiscal year. Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.Here's how HP did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: 93 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expectedRevenue: $14.64 billion vs. $14.48 billion expectedHP's revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income of $795 million, or 84 cents per share, was up from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.For the first quarter of HP's fiscal 2026, the company called for 73 cents to 81 cents in adjusted net earnings per share, while the LSEG consensus was 79 cents. For all of fiscal 2026, HP sees $2.90 to $3.20 in adjusted per share, below the LSEG consensus of $3.33.\"HP's outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. trade-related regulations in place, and associated mitigations,\" the company said in the statement.The company's personal systems unit that includes desktop and laptop computers contributed $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above StreetAccount's $10.15 billion consensus.HP said it expects to complete the headcount reduction by the end of fiscal 2028. The company said the restructuring will result in savings of at least $1 billion in annualized gross run rate by the end of fiscal 2028. HP said it expects to incur about $650 million in charges, of which $250 million will happen in fiscal 2026.\"As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said on a conference call with analysts. Corporate executives across industries are hoping to draw on generative artificial intelligence products to speed up software developers and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to a rise in the cost per gigabyte of RAM this year. HP, whose headcount stood at 58,000 as of December, announced a similarly sized round of layoffs in 2022. Several other technology companies have announced layoffs in recent months as U.S. consumers face higher prices and interest rates.\"Memory costs are currently 15 to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,\" Lores said.The company does expect to benefit after Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows 10 operating system in October, which will lead people to buy new machines, Lores said. Around 60% of HP's installed base has moved to Windows 11, he said.HP's printing business did $4.3 billion in revenue, down 4%. The pricing environment is competitive, and customers are putting off purchases of new models, said Karen Parkhill, the company's finance chief.As of Tuesday's close, HP shares were down 25% for the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 15% in the same period.WATCH: HP CEO: Tariffs are mostly nonmaterialwatch now",

We're grateful for his contributions and wish him continued success. With hardware and software engineering unified under Global Product, we're integrating product management with engineering to accelerate the delivery of exceptional in-vehicle experiences,\" GM said in an emailed statement to CNBC.Cetinok, who joined GM in September 2023 after stints with companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, could not immediately be reached for comment. The announcement of his departure comes a month after he described his position as \"a product person's dream\" in an interview with CNBC.GM's senior vice president of software and services engineering, Dave Richardson, and its head of GM artificial intelligence, Barak Turovsky, have also left the company since October.

He told CNBC last month that in order for the automaker to succeed, software and product must be thought of as one and the same.\"That's the point of the role, I think, is it brings together all of these pieces into a unified approach to how we do product going forward,\" Anderson said during an Oct. 22 interview at a GM technology event in New York.Anderson, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who later led Tesla's AutoPilot program, said his goal is to accelerate the pace of GM's innovations.When Anderson's appointment with GM was announced in May, Cetinok said in a LinkedIn post he was \"delighted to welcome\" the executive to the company. GM CEO Mary Barra and GM President Mark Reuss also hailed Anderson as being equipped to \"evolve\" and \"reinvent\" the automaker's operations.The global automotive industry has battled for years to better integrate technology into vehicles – from their production to consumer-facing software and remote, or \"over-the-air,\" updates like Tesla pioneered.GM has taken an aggressive approach to combat such challenges by hiring leaders from Tesla and technology companies such as Apple and Google. However, many times, such executives have had short tenures with the company.",

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWorkday shares slid more than 5% in extended trading Tuesday after the finance and human resources software maker issued quarterly margin guidance that came in below Wall Street projections.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.32 adjusted vs. $2.18 expectedRevenue: $2.43 billion vs. $2.42 billion expectedThe company forecast a fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin of at least 28.5% and $2.355 billion in subscription revenue, according to a statement. The StreetAccount consensus was a 28.7% margin and $2.35 billion in subscription revenue.Workday's revenue grew about 13% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Net income of $252 million, or 94 cents per share, was up from $193 million, or 72 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.Subscription revenue in the third quarter totaled $2.24 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 28.5%. Analysts polled by StreetAccount had anticipated $2.24 billion in subscription revenue and a 28.1% margin.During the fiscal third quarter, Workday announced artificial intelligence agents for analyzing employee performance testing financial health, and the company revealed plans to buy AI and learning software startup Sana for $1.1 billion. Also, activist investor Elliott Management said it had built a Workday stake worth over $2 billion.Workday encountered some turbulence with higher education institutions that rely on U.S. funding, CEO Carl Eschenbach said on a conference call with analysts. Workday has seen its stock decline this year as pundits discuss the risk of generative AI tools threatening the growth prospects for cloud software incumbents. Company shares have fallen 9% so far in 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite index has gained 19%.\"The narrative we've been hearing in the last couple of quarters is changing, and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise already providing value and are deeply trusted by our customers,\" Eschenbach said. Despite rounds of layoffs that companies have been carrying out in recent months, the headcount in Workday's customer base is up year over year, he said.WATCH: Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach: There's a narrative that AI is eating into software, that is falsewatch now",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlack Friday is proving more popular for younger consumers than for their elders, according to a new report provided exclusively to CNBC.AT&T Business' 2025 Holiday Shopping Survey, conducted by Morning Consult, found that 40% of Generation Z members and 32% of millennials plan to do most of their shopping on Black Friday. Older generations, on the other hand, prefer to shop later in the season, just a week or two before Christmas, the survey found.  \"Black Friday is always such a big deal, and the pricing and the offers and advertising that's done during that time is probably what would draw Gen Z, especially things done on social media,\" said Angela Rutherford, AT&T's vice president of mid-market sales.The enthusiasm for Black Friday comes even as Gen Z plans to pull back their spending. Read more CNBC Black Friday newsShoppers curtail Black Friday spending: 'They are using every tool that they can,' expert saysBlack Friday is most popular with Gen Z, even as the holiday loses its shine, new survey findsBlack Friday car deals are sparser this year, analyst says: ‘Buyers may be a little disappointed’Pro: Wall Street’s favorite holiday shopping stocks as Black Friday nearsConsulting firm PwC reported in September that Gen Z shoppers plan to spend 23% less on average this holiday season than a year ago – the sharpest decline of any generation and a significant change from the previous year, when Gen Z said they planned to spend 37% more.And as non-wealthy Americans face pressures of higher prices and economic uncertainty, some reports are showing signs of a \"K-shaped\" economy that may stretch into the holiday season, with wealthier consumers spending more and lower-income consumers shopping more conservatively.A new Deloitte survey found that consumers at large plan to spend 4% less on Black Friday than they did last year, primarily due to concerns of financial constraints and a higher cost of living.Still, Rutherford said consumers are being more \"intentional and value-driven\" in their holiday shopping this year. That spending is translating into more support for small businesses rather than large legacy retailers, with 77% of consumers reporting they would do all of their holiday shopping at small businesses if they could and if the pricing was the same, according to AT&T's survey. Compared with last year, the number of survey respondents who said they shop at small businesses to boost their local economies grew by 8 percentage points. \"I think there's a price consciousness out there, combined with a, 'If I can still save money or get a good price, I will still shop local,' type of mentality out there,\" Rutherford said. The AT&T survey also found that 72% of people reported getting their gift ideas from in-person shopping rather than from social media. And even as artificial intelligence begins to reshape the way people shop, more than half of shoppers said they were more likely to use traditional online search methods for their gifting this holiday season than AI – just 9% of those surveyed said they are more likely to use AI to find gifts. \"AI has exploded over the last couple years, and it's infiltrating all aspects of life,\" Rutherford said. \"I think as time goes on, you will see a shift from the traditional search to AI for shopping.\"",

    "body": "Zhao Changpeng, founder and chief executive officer of Binance, attends the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France June 16, 2022. Benoit Tessier | ReutersDozens of families of the victims of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel by Hamas sued Binance, alleging the top cryptocurrency trading platform knowingly helped transfer hundreds of millions of dollars in support of terrorist activities.The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in North Dakota came one month after President Donald Trump pardoned Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who had pleaded guilty to failing to combat money laundering on the crypto exchange.Defendants Zhao, known as CZ, and close associate Guangying \"Heina\" Chen intentionally designed Binance \"as a criminal enterprise to facilitate money laundering on a global scale,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"Years before October 7, Binance knew that Hamas, the [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran], Hezbollah, [Palestinian Islamic Jihad] and other terrorist organizations were all transacting regularly on its platform and nevertheless actively assisted their use of the platform,\" the plaintiffs allege. \"It did so at a time when Hamas, in particular, was publicly directing its donors to send funds to so-called 'crypto wallets' held with Binance,\" they allege.The plaintiffs, who are U.S. nationals and their close family members, seek compensatory damages to be determined at trial. They are seeking \"treble damages\" under a law allowing victims of international terrorism to recover three times the damages they sustained.Binance was legally required to flag the U.S. government by filing \"Suspicious Activity Reports,\" or SARs, on the terror groups' activities. But instead, the company attempted to manipulate how the transactions were reported \"to avoid attracting scrutiny,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"Binance not only knowingly provided financial services to Hamas; it actively tried to shield its Hamas customers and their funds from scrutiny by U.S. regulators or law enforcement—a practice that continues to this day,\" according to the lawsuit.The legal complaint says that since the Oct. 7 attacks, Binance \"knowingly facilitated the equivalent of more than $50 million U.S. dollars in transactions ... for Hamas, the IRGC, Hezbollah, and PIJ on public blockchains.\"Binance declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement that it fully complies with international sanctions laws and has \"executed a wide-ranging transformation\" of its sanctions framework in recent years.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen. Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'The suit cites the findings of the federal government's investigations into Binance, which culminated in late 2023 with the company agreeing to pay more than $4.3 billion — one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland said at the time. Additionally, then-CEO CZ agreed to step down and plead guilty to a charge of failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program. CZ was sentenced to four months in jail and released in September 2024.The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network said in November 2023 that Binance failed to file SARs on \"significant sums being transmitted to and from entities officially designated as terrorist organizations\" by the U.S. and United Nations.Trump, on Oct. 23, pardoned CZ, whom the White House declared was a casualty of the Biden administration's \"war on cryptocurrency.\"Trump later denied knowing anything about CZ. But the president suggested granting a pardon to help the crypto industry flourish in the U.S., even as he stressed that he knows little about the industry and that his adult sons are much more involved.Indeed, Trump's family is heavily invested in the crypto industry and has financial ties to Binance itself. In May, the co-founder of the Trump family's crypto finance platform, World Liberty Financial, said the company's stablecoin would be used to facilitate a $2 billion investment in Binance by Emirati state investment firm MGX.",

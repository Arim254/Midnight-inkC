    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., holds a news conference in the Mansfield Room in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, December 1, 2025. Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's \"seditious\" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  \"reckless misconduct\" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.\"Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.\"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action,\" Hegseth said.Kelly previously scoffed at the Pentagon's investigation of his involvement with the video.In an X post in November, Kelly said that the Pentagon's probe \"won't work\" if \"this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable.\"In the video, which was posted on X on Nov. 18, Kelly says, \"Our laws are clear: you can refuse illegal orders.\"The five other Democratic members of Congress who delivered similar messages on the same video are Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of  Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA  analyst. Dekluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"This is breaking news.

President Donald Trump said Saturday that US forces had captured Venezuela's leader Nicolas Maduro after bombing the capital Caracas and other cities in a dramatic climax to a months-long standoff between Trump and his Venezuelan arch-foe. (Photo by ADALBERTO ROQUE / AFP via Getty Images)Adalberto Roque | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba announced on Monday that 32 of its citizens were killed in combat during the U.S. raid on Venezuela.The raid on Saturday, which saw U.S. forces arrest and extract Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to New York, reportedly saw a large part of his security team killed. The Cubans were performing missions on behalf of the Cuban Armed Forces and interior ministry, the country's presidential office said on Facebook.\"Faithful to their responsibilities with security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroically and fell, after ferocious resistance, into direct combat against the attackers or as a result of the bombings of the facilities,\" the statement said, according to a translation by Facebook. Cuba also called the U.S. strikes a \"criminal act of aggression and state terrorism,\" and said the Cuban government will pay tribute to the dead.The U.S. strikes came after weeks of military buildup in the region and threats by U.S. President Donald Trump against Maduro. After the raid, Trump said that the U.S. was going to \"run\" Venezuela, \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. will use leverage gained from its oil blockade on the country and regional military buildup to achieve its policy aims.\"We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction,\" Rubio told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" host Kristen Welker.Seperately, Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" that as the U.S. has a \"quaratine\" on Venezuelan oil. \"That means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" he added.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean.— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A motorcycle passes in front of an oil-themed mural in Caracas, Venezuela on May 9, 2022.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesCrude oil prices rose modestly Monday, as the overthrow of President Nicolas Maduro by the Trump administration has cast deep uncertainty over oil-rich Venezuela. U.S. crude oil rose 46 cents, or 0.8%, to $57.78 per barrel by 7:53 a.m. ET. Global benchmark Brent gained 41 cents, or 0.67%, to $60.16 per barrel. President Donald Trump made it clear Saturday that U.S. investment in Venezuela's oil sector is a key objective of the regime change operation that ousted Maduro.\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure,\" Trump said in a press conference from his Mar-a-Lago residence in Palm Beach, Florida.The president said Saturday that the U.S. embargo of Venezuelan oil remains in place. Venezuela, a founding member of OPEC, sits on the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world at 303 billion barrels or about 17% of the global total, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Caracas produced about 3.5 million barrels per day at its peak in the late 1990s, but output has declined significantly since then, according to energy consulting firm Kpler. The South American nation is currently producing about 800,000 bpd, Kpler data shows. Chevron is the only U.S. oil major operating in Venezuela. It was exporting about 140,000 bpd at the end of the fourth quarter of 2025, according to Kpler. The impact of Maduro's overthrow on oil prices is ambiguous in the short run, said Daan Struyven, head of oil research at Goldman Sachs. Production could edge higher if a U.S.-supported government is installed and the Trump administration lifts sanctions against Venezuela, Struveyn told clients in a Sunday note. But Maduro's ouster could also lead to supply disruptions in the short term, the analyst said. Long term, U.S. investment that boosts Venezuelan production would put downward pressure on oil prices, Struvyven said. A recovery of production, however, will likely be gradual and partial, he said. Oil executives operating in Venezuela say it will cost $10 billion annually to turn production around and a stable security environment is essential to grow production back to historic levels, said Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets. Full sanctions relief could bring several hundred thousand barrels of production back over a 12-month period if there is an orderly transition of power, Croft told clients in a Saturday note. \"However, all bets are off in a chaotic change of power scenario like what occurred in Libya or Iraq,\" she said.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersThe traditional role of an investment banker is to provide advice on deals and financings. But JPMorgan's bankers recently began noticing that clients were asking for more from the firm – like how the nation's largest bank was navigating artificial intelligence or what cybersecurity practices it used. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon had an idea: formalize a group that can give certain clients access to much of JPMorgan's \"secret sauce.\" They're calling the initiative the \"Special Advisory Services,\" which launches Monday, with Liz Myers, who also serves as the global chair of investment banking, at the helm. \"These capabilities are on par or better with some of the specialized consulting firms out there,\" said Myers in an interview with CNBC. \"We think it could help C-suite executives be more effective in their roles and learn from our best practices.\" JPMorgan identified several dozen adjacent capabilities to offer clients, ranging from investor relations to real estate selection to health-care benefits to technology procurement. At the outset, the firm does not plan to charge for these services. However, if a client seeks a more time-consuming project or a service that exists on an ongoing basis, they may negotiate some sort of fee structure. The services are intended for clients that \"have, or seek to have, deep and long-term relationships with the firm,\" the company said in a press release. That cohort may include, \"companies considering JPMorgan as their lead IPO adviser, long-tenured clients preparing for transformational deals, or growing mid-sized clients looking to use JPMorgan as their primary operating bank,\" according to the release. \"More than two-thirds of our experts are internally facing people – their No. 1 job is to make sure they're delivering for our firm,\" Myers said. \"They're a precious resource, to some extent, so we have to be thoughtful about who gets it.\" Myers, a 30-year veteran of the firm, had previously served as global head of equity capital markets, and in her expanded role, she'll work with advisory teams and experts across JPMorgan. She said that in the beginning, the Special Advisory Services group will have a \"handful\" of people. And then over time, the firm may scale it if there's a sizable uptake in client demand. JPMorgan is scheduled to report fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week. LSEG estimates that for the year through Dec. 11, JPMorgan raked in $9.44 billion in investment banking fees, making the firm No. 1 worldwide, with 7.4% of wallet share. ",

    "body": "Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta Platforms Inc., at the VivaTech conference in Paris, France, on Wednesday, May 22, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta's former chief AI scientist, Yann Lecun, has called its 29-year-old AI boss \"inexperienced,\" and warned of a staff exodus from the company.Alexander Wang, the billionaire co-founder of Scale AI, joined Meta as its chief AI officer in 2025 after the tech giant bought a 49% stake in his startup. His hiring came amid an intensifying AI talent war, in which Meta reportedly offered $100 million signing bonuses to poach top talent from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, as it raced other hyperscalers to dominate the multibillion-dollar AI market with the most advanced models.Lecun, who's known as one of the \"godfathers of AI\" and quit Meta in November, called Wang \"young\" and \"inexperienced\" in an interview with the Financial Times.\"He learns fast, he knows what he doesn't know,\" Lecun said of Wang, who heads up Meta's new AI research unit TBD Labs and is tasked with building new AI models. But Lecun added: \"There's no experience with research or how you practise research, how you do it. Or what would be attractive or repulsive to a researcher.\"Lecun, 65, added that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg \"basically lost confidence in everyone who was involved\" after the company was accused of gaming benchmarks to make its Llama 4 model look more impressive. Zuckerberg \"basically sidelined the entire Gen AI organization,\" Lecun said.\"A lot of people have left, a lot of people who haven't yet left will leave,\" Lecun added.\"We had a lot of new ideas and really cool stuff that they should implement. But they were just going for things that were essentially safe and proved,\" he added. \"When you do this, you fall behind.\"CNBC contacted Meta for a response, but had not received a response as this story went live.AI superintelligence is a 'dead end' for LLMsWhen asked about Meta's AI hiring drive, Lecun said: \"The future will say whether that was a good idea or not.\"But he added that \"LLMs basically are a dead end when it comes to superintelligence.\" \"I'm sure there's a lot of people at Meta, including perhaps Alex, who would like me to not tell the world that,\" Lecun said.Lecun's new startup, Advanced Machine Intelligence Labs, is focusing on \"world models:\" AI systems that learn from videos and al data as well as language. Nabla, a health tech AI startup that partnered with Lecun's company in December, said in a press release that, unlike world models, LLMs \"still face some structural constraints, including hallucinations, non-deterministic reasoning, and limited handling of continuous multimodal data, which make autonomous decision-making challenging.\" ",

    "body": "Limited-time retro packaging will highlight Chick-fil-A's heritage, the company said.Source: Chick-fil-AFor Chick-fil-A's 80th anniversary, the chicken chain is going all out: retro packaging, collectible cups, themed merch and even the chance to win free food for a year.The chain's anniversary comes as the restaurant industry struggles with declining traffic. To win back diners, many restaurants have leaned into deals, buzzy promotions and larger marketing budgets. As a privately held company, Chick-fil-A does not disclose quarterly financial results, but franchise disclosure documents show that the company's system sales growth slowed to 5.4% in 2024, making it the first year in more than a decade with less than double-digit sales growth.Chick-fil-A has stayed out of the so-called value wars other restaurants have leaned into to compete, but the anniversary gives the chain the opportunity to attract more customers to its restaurants. The yearlong marketing campaign kicks off on Monday and represents the biggest promotional push ever for Chick-fil-A. Khalilah Cooper, Chick-fil-A's vice president of brand strategy, advertising and media, told CNBC that new advertising will spotlight the anniversary in both national TV spots and on social media.At the center of the campaign is what the company is calling \"newstalgia,\" a portmanteau of \"new\" and nostalgia.\"\"We've thought about this as a way to celebrate our heritage with customers who've been with us, potentially for decades, for all 80 years, or whether they've been with us for eight days or have never tried Chick-fil-A before,\" Cooper said.To start, Chick-fil-A is also rolling out four retro collectible cup designs every few weeks, inspired by the company's archives and the shape of its 32-ounce cup. The chain is selling the cups for $3.99 at restaurants nationwide. Plus, Chick-fil-A has come up with its own riff on Willy Wonka's famous golden ticket: the Golden Fan Cup. The 3,000 customers who buy a collectible cup and receive the Golden Fan Cup will receive free Chick-fil-A for a year.The chain will also give its iconic chicken sandwich limited-time, vintage-inspired packaging.Chick-fil-A plans to sell themed merch through its website over the course of the year. Customers who visit its restaurants will also be able to purchase limited-edition designs of its stuffed cows. Also as part of the campaign, Chick-fil-A is adding its frosted sodas and floats to its menu permanently, starting Monday. Customers can also expect to see more limited-time menu items throughout the year than Chick-fil-A typically offers, according to Cooper.The focus on \"newstalgia\" will also be front and center at the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Friday, when the Oregon Ducks face off against the Indiana Hoosiers in the College Football Playoff semifinal.Chick-fil-A traces its roots to 1946, when S. Truett Cathy and his brother opened a restaurant called The Dwarf Grill in Hapeville, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. More than two decades later, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A location, with its trademark chicken sandwich. The business is still family owned, and Cathy's grandson Andrew serves as its CEO.The privately held chain's system sales reached $22.74 billion in 2024, making it the third-largest restaurant chain in the U.S., trailing only McDonald's and Starbucks. Over the past decade, Chick-fil-A has expanded far beyond its Southeastern stronghold, opening locations all across the U.S. and planning to expand its international business into the United Kingdom and Singapore.",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., Jan. 2, 2026. Jeenah Moon | ReutersThe stock market showed little reaction to President Donald Trump's extraordinary action in Venezuela as investors bet the attack, as well as the capture of leader Nicolas Maduro, would not lead to a bigger geopolitical conflict. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 343 points, or 0.7%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Monday, up 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively. The oil market rose just modestly, and energy stocks helped lift the market, as traders bet the takeover of Venezuela, which has the world's largest proven oil reserves, will benefit oil and gas companies. Chevron, which already has an established presence in the country, rallied more than 7%. Shares of Exxon Mobil climbed more than 4%.Historically speaking, geopolitical shocks have little lasting impact on the stock market. A review of the last 11 major geopolitical events showed that the S&P 500 on average was just 0.3% lower one week after the event, and 7.7% higher 12 months later, according to UBS. Indeed, markets historically have looked past even major developments, such as the U.S. bombing of Iran, the firm noted. \"While volatility is expected as the Venezuelan headlines will dominate the landscape, the overall market seems relatively unfazed by events so far,\" said Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets. \"A quick resolution with little escalation threat has calmed any investor jitters for now.\" The event has put other countries on high alert. One analyst noted Denmark is in \"full crisis mode\" after Trump set his sights on Greenland following the attack. Russia's reaction to the ouster of Maduro has been cautious. But the lackluster response to a significant geopolitical development suggests investors do not expect the attack to escalate any further, in part because of Trump's prior criticisms of conflicts drawn out in Iraq and Afghanistan.Indeed, Evercore ISI's Matthew Aks agreed that the event is unlikely to be a major market mover, as he considers Trump's threats to take over the country as more of a negotiating tactic. He added that Venezuela's current oil exports are small and any efforts to develop the country's infrastructure will be a longer-term story. \"Trump's statement about the U.S. running Venezuela is getting a lot of attention, but we do not expect any immediate large-scale U.S. military action,\" Aks said. \"Rather, we interpret it as a colorful metaphor and negotiating tactic intended to maintain pressure on the remnants of the Maduro regime to cede power voluntarily.\" Instead, investors are remaining focused on the fundamentals in the stock market. Many find artificial intelligence, earnings growth, and easier monetary policy as reasons for optimism to start the new year.  UBS said any underexposed investors should put any excess cash or bonds toward stocks, though the firm also said gold should remain an allocation.\"While developments in Venezuela may cause volatility, especially in oil markets, we expect the focus of investors to remain on fundamentals. We forecast nearly 10% earnings growth for the MSCI All Country World for both 2026 and 2027, contributing to further stock gains this year,\" wrote Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Financial Services. \"Against this backdrop, we rate global equities as Attractive,\" she continued. \"If investors are currently underallocated, we believe they should reallocate excess cash, bond, or high yield credit holdings to stocks.\" Read more CNBC coverage on VenezuelaDeposed Venezuelan leader Maduro, wife to appear in New York court after U.S. captureCrude prices rise as Maduro overthrow casts uncertainty over oil-rich VenezuelaWhat investors are watching after Venezuela: Five signals that matter for marketsTreasury yields are little changed after U.S. ousts Maduro in VenezuelaWho controls Venezuela’s oil now?

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro (L) and China's President Xi Jinping wave during a meeting in Miraflores Presidential Palace, in Caracas on July 20, 2014.Leo Ramirez | Afp | Getty ImagesThe ancient Greek historian Thucydides once wrote that \"the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.\" On Jan. 3, the United States appeared to echo that maxim when it launched strikes on Venezuela and, in a lightning raid, arrested President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.The couple was flown to New York to face drug and terrorism charges, drawing sharp criticism from foreign governments about the legality of the attack. The operation also reignited debate over whether Washington is reviving a world where might makes right. David Roche of Quantum Strategy told CNBC the operation could weaken U.S. arguments against similar actions by rivals.\"If Donald Trump can walk into a country and take it over… then why is Putin wrong about Ukraine, and why is China not entitled to take over Taiwan?\" Roche said.The U.S. has asserted what it calls a \"Trump Corollary\" in its recently released National Security Strategy, reviving the Monroe Doctrine of the 1820s, where the U.S. had a sphere of influence over the so-called \"Western Hemisphere.\"A sphere of influence refers to a region where a powerful country seeks to dominate political, military or economic decisions without formally annexing territory.The concept echoes the Roosevelt Corollary, which historically justified U.S. intervention in Latin America.A statement from United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that he was \"deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,\" calling the developments in Venezuela a \"dangerous precedent.\"Roche warned the action could create unintended consequences. \"On one hand, you've created a series of threats, and on the other, you've created a series of permissions to every dictatorial, autocratic regime, who wants to act to take over territory which is not currently within its ambit.\"The Taiwan questionIn Asia, attention has turned to whether China could be emboldened to increase pressure on Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.China staged live-fire drills around Taiwan in December, framing them as a warning against foreign interference. In his New Year's address, Chinese President Xi Jinping declared Taiwan's unification \"unstoppable,\" echoing U.S. intelligence assessments that Beijing could attempt to seize the island by force within this decade.Ryan Hass, a former U.S. diplomat and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, cautioned against drawing direct parallels. \"There will be an impulse among foreign policy analysts to draw analogies to Taiwan and to warn about Trump setting a precedent Beijing could use against Taiwan. I would caution against that impulse,\" he  wrote on X.Russian President Vladimir Putin (C), Chinese President Xi Jinping (R), Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro (L) and other leaders lay flowers on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier during Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2015 in Moscow, Russia.Sasha Mordovets | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesHass said China has avoided direct military action against Taiwan, not out of deference for international law or norms, but has instead relied on a strategy of coercion short of violence.\"Beijing will be more focused on protecting its interests, condemning US actions, and sharpening the contrast with the US in the international system than it will be on drawing inspiration from today's events to alter its approach on Taiwan,\" Hass wrote. China's foreign ministry, in a statement after the strike, said it was \"deeply shocked by and strongly condemns the U.S.'s blatant use of force against a sovereign state and action against its president.\"Beijing called the strike a  \"hegemonic act\" and called on Washington to \"stop violating other countries' sovereignty and security.\"\"The Trump administration, more so than any American administration in recent memory, is comfortable with great powers like China and Russia having a sphere of influence,\" said Marko Papic, chief strategist of macro-geopolitical at BCA Research. However, it does not mean that Washington is okay with these countries expanding their orbits, he added.Moreover, there does not seem to be an \"abandonment\" of Taiwan by the Trump administration, Papic told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\", pointing to the $11 billion arms sale that was announced by Taiwan in December. The U.S. does not have a mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, but the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act commits Washington to providing weapons necessary for Taiwan's self-defense.Rules for thee, not for meEvan Feigenbaum of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argued the U.S. would likely pursue its own sphere of influence while denying one to China.\"The United States is NOT going to 'consent' to a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia,\" Feigenbaum wrote on X. \"Instead, I suspect it will attempt to insist on an American sphere of influence in its own Hemisphere while trying to deny one to China in Asia.\"\"Let's not pretend the U.S. is consistent and that contradiction and hypocrisy in U.S. foreign policy aren't a thing,\" he added in a separate post.BCA Research's Papic said that time was on China's side, and added it did not have to immediately act on Taiwan, while the U.S. is likely to focus on its \"Western Hemisphere.\"\"Why risk getting the entire Western world to unite against [China] by effectively trying to militarily reunify with Taiwan in January of 2026? Why risk it when time is likely on China's side over the next 10 years, as the U.S. continues to focus on the near abroad, and less so on the entire world.\"— CNBC's Chery Kang, Martin Soong and Amitoj Singh contributed to this report.",

Tim Walz of Minnesota is dropping his bid for reelection, he announced Monday morning. The announcement came as Walz, who was Kamala Harris' vice presidential pick for her failed 2024 White House bid, continues to weather heated criticism over a sweeping fraud scandal in his state.\"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all,\" Walz said in the statement.\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" he said.\"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work,\" the governor said.Sen.

Picture date: Sunday January 4, 2026.Danny Lawson - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty ImagesEnglish soccer giant Manchester United has parted ways with head coach Ruben Amorim, just after he raised questions over his role at the club amid rumors of tensions with the club hierarchy. Appointed in November 2024, the 40-year-old had overseen one of the club's worst finishes in recent history last season, 15th out of 20 in the Premier League, the top division of English soccer.A statement from the club, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange, said the move would \"give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\"The stock was steady in premarket trading as of 7 a.m. ET, up around 0.1%.Amorim was Manchester United's first managerial appointment following billionaire Jim Ratcliffe's acquisition of a minority stake in the club in February 2024 from the Glazer family. Ratcliffe took an initial 27.7% stake, before ramping that up to 28.94% in December 2024, and has since assumed control of all football operations.Since the initial deal, worth $1.6 billion, Ratcliffe has also made a series of changes to the club's structure, hiring a new CEO and Director of Football.Speaking before his departure, Amorim hinted at frustrations over his role at the club following a draw with Leeds United on Sunday.\"I just want to say that I'm going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. I was really clear on that. That is going to finish in 18 months (when his contract expires) and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal. That is my job. Not to be a coach.\"The club is currently 6th in the Premier League.Manchester United said former player Darren Fletcher will lead the club in its next game against Burnley on Wednesday.",

He did not say the U.S. would directly govern Venezuela.The U.S. in recent months has seized tankers associated with the country and moved military ships and warplanes into the Caribbean. \"What's going to happen here is we have a quarantine on their oil, that means their economy will not be able to move forward until the conditions that are in the national interest of the United States and the interests of the Venezuelan people are met, and that's what we intend to do,\" Rubio said on ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos.\" \"That leverage remains, that leverage is ongoing and we expect that it's going to lead to results here,\" Rubio said. Pressed by the host of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Kristen Welker, on who is running Venezuela, Rubio was more direct. \"Well, it's not running,\" Rubio said. \"It's running policy, the policy with regard to this. We want Venezuela to move in a certain direction.\"Trump said on Saturday said the U.S. would \"run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\" The comments sparked a firestorm of criticism from Trump's adversaries and some allies, who warned against a nation-building exercise in Venezuela. \"We have learned through the years when America tries to do regime change and nation building in this way, the American people pay the price in both blood and dollars,\" Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on ABC on Sunday. Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as president following Maduro's capture. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, arrived in New York on Saturday night to face charges related to drug trafficking.

Asked on \"Meet the Press\" about further military action in Venezuela, Rubio said Trump \"retains all his optionality.\"Rubio also extrapolated on the U.S.' aims with Venezuela's oil reserves. Trump on Saturday said the U.S. is \"going to have our very large United States oil companies — the biggest anywhere in the world — go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure.\"Venezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world. \"Ultimately, this is not about securing the oil fields; this is about ensuring that no sanctioned oil can come in and out until they make changes to the governance of that entire industry,\" Rubio said on ABC. \"The way to address it to the benefit of the Venezuelan people is to get private companies that are not from Iran or somewhere else to go in and invest in the equipment.\" Rubio said he has not spoken to specific U.S. oil companies about the prospect of starting business in Venezuela. Currently, only Chevron operates in the country. \"We're pretty certain that there will be dramatic interest from Western companies,\" Rubio said. Rubio said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright will be \"taking an assessment and speaking to some of these companies.\"Clarification: The U.S. military captured Nicolas Maduro and removed him from Venezuela. That was not clear in a reference in an earlier version of this article.",

Hyunjoo Jin | ReutersLucid Group significantly increased its production and sales last year as it continues to ramp up production of its new Gravity SUV.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer on Monday said its deliveries last year increased to 15,841 units, up 55% compared with 2024, including a more than 70% year-over-year increase during the fourth quarter.The automaker also achieved a previously lowered production target of roughly 18,000 vehicles in 2025, down from an initial expectation of as much as 20,000 vehicles. It produced 18,378 units last year, including 8,412 EVs during the fourth quarter.Much of that increase is likely due to a prolonged ramp-up of its Gravity SUV, which has faced a slew of challenges, primarily supply chain shortages, the company has said. In addition to Lucid's own challenges, EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs because of tariffs and slower forecast sales of EVs, as well as regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.watch now",

    "body": "The logo of pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is displayed in front of its offices in Bagsvaerd, on the outskirts of Copenhagen, Nov. 24, 2025.Tom Little | ReutersNovo Nordisk will start rolling out the first-ever GLP-1 pill for weight loss in the U.S. on Monday, the company announced, marking a new chapter of obesity treatment in the U.S. The drug's cash prices are among the lowest on the market, ranging from $149 to $299 per month, depending on the dose. That fuels hopes that pills could help address the long-standing affordability hurdles tied to the weekly injections dominating the weight loss drug market. The official launch of the oral drug, called the Wegovy pill, comes just two weeks after U.S. regulators cleared the treatment. The starting dose of 1.5 milligrams is available at more than 70,000 U.S. pharmacies such as CVS and Costco, as well as select telehealth providers, including Ro, LifeMD, Weight Watchers, GoodRx and Novo Nordisk's NovoCare Pharmacy. The higher, remaining doses of the pill will be available to patients by the end of the week, Novo Nordisk said. Cash-paying patients can pay $149 per month for the starting dose. The 4-milligram dose of the pill will also be available for $149 per month through April 15, then $199 per month after that. The highest doses of the Wegovy pill – 9 milligrams and 25 milligrams – will be available for $299 per month. Patients with insurance coverage for the drug can pay as little as $25 per month for the treatment. Cash-paying patients will also be able to access the starting dose of the pill for $149 per month on President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, under a deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration in November. The site also launches in January, though it's unclear when. Novo Nordisk on Monday said the pill's availability \"opens new possibilities\" for the more than 100 million Americans living with obesity. Injections from Novo Nordisk and its chief rival, Eli Lilly, carry a list price of roughly $1,000 per month. But both companies offer lower cash-pay prices for their shots that range from $299 to $499 monthly, depending on the dose. Pills are the next battleground for the two companies, which established the booming GLP-1 space that some analysts say could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s. Goldman Sachs analysts said in August that oral drugs could capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market.The launch of Novo Nordisk's daily oral drug on Monday gives the company a clear head start. The Food and Drug Administration approved the treatment on Dec. 22 and will decide whether to clear a rival pill from Eli Lilly later this year. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsThe FDA also approved Novo Nordisk's pill for use to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events, such as death, heart attack or stroke, in adults with obesity and established cardiovascular disease. That's consistent with the approval label of the company's blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy, which shares the same active ingredient, semaglutide. Both work by mimicking the gut hormone GLP-1 to suppress appetite.\"This moment is about changing what's possible in weight management, and to make that possible, we have worked to ensure [the Wegovy pill] is affordable and accessible to those who need it, however they choose to receive their care,\" said Ed Cinca, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions, in a release. People who take Novo Nordisk's pill have to wait 30 minutes before eating or drinking each day.In a phase three trial that followed more than 300 adults with obesity and not diabetes, the highest dose of Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide helped patients lose up to 16.6% of their weight on average after 64 weeks. That weight loss was 13.6% when the company analyzed all patients regardless of whether they stopped the drug.The pill appears to be slightly more effective than Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug, which does not have dietary restrictions. ",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Trump administration is facing renewed questions over its recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the U.S. captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro on Saturday and charged him with crimes related to drug trafficking.  Hernandez in 2024 was convicted of conspiring with drug traffickers and using his government position to help hundreds of tons of cocaine enter the United States. He was sentenced to 45 years in prison. President Donald Trump pardoned Hernandez in November, saying in a post to his Truth Social account that he had been \"treated very harshly and unfairly.\" Maduro was charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy, along with four other charges: cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machine guns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday was pressed on the apparent contradiction of Hernandez' pardon now that the U.S. is seeking similar charges against Maduro, another head of state of a South American nation with ties to the drug trade. \"I don't do the pardon file, I'm not against it or for it, I didn't review the file, so I can't speak to you about the dynamics that led the president to make the decision that he made,\" Rubio said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"He reviewed the file, he went through the arguments in it and he felt that the former president of Honduras was treated very unfairly by the previous administration,\" Rubio said. Rubio said that \"whether you agree with that decision or not ... that doesn't mean you leave Maduro in place.\"\"The answer to that, whether you have a problem with it or not, is not to leave in play someone who has been indicted who hasn't even faced American justice yet,\" Rubio said.

Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the \"hypocrisy underlying this decision is especially glaring.\"\"This same president recently pardoned former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was convicted in a U.S. court on serious drug trafficking charges, including conspiring with narcotics traffickers while in office,\" Warner said. \"Yet now, the administration claims that similar allegations justify the use of military force against another sovereign nation. You cannot credibly argue that drug trafficking charges demand invasion in one case, while issuing a pardon in another.\"At a press conference on Saturday after Maduro's capture, Trump was pressed on the pardon. He said Hernandez was \"persecuted very unfairly.\" \"He was treated like the Biden administration treated a man named Trump,\" Trump said, referring to his own criminal prosecutions for allegedly hoarding classified documents and attempting to overturn the 2020 election after leaving office following his first term as president. Trump also cited his endorsement of Nasry Asfura, the president-elect of Honduras, as another reason for the pardon. \"He's also a party member of the man who won, so obviously the people liked what I did,\" Trump said. \"And one of the reasons that was done is because of the fact that the party in power felt very strongly that that man was treated very badly.\"Trump also gestured at Rubio and other members of his national security team when explaining why he issued the pardon. \"I went to a lot of the people standing behind me, and they felt that that man was persecuted and treated very badly,\" he said.

    "body": "A growing number of workers are primed to leave their jobs if their companies require them to return to office, a new report found.According to FlexJobs' 2025 State of the Workforce Report, 76% of American workers said they would look for a new job if they were no longer allowed to work remotely, based on a survey of 3,000 professionals in the U.S.That's a nearly 20% increase from last year's report, in which 57% of workers said that they would \"absolutely\" look for another job if they couldn't continue to work remotely.And of those looking for jobs, 85% said remote work is the number one factor motivating them to apply for a job, even above salary and benefits and work-life balance.It's unsurprising that remote work has remained popular among American professionals, according to FlexJobs career expert Toni Frana: It offers benefits like \"greater work-life balance, more flexibility and even cost savings,\" she says.Citing the survey, Frana points out that only 2% of surveyed workers prefer working in office full-time, as opposed to fully remote or hybrid.Companies continue to push RTO mandates in an effort to \"strengthen collaboration\" among employees and improve visibility, Frana says, but many workers aren't having it: 27% of employees say that they know someone who has quit or is planning to quit due to return-to-office requirements.Navigating an RTO pushIf your company is pursuing a return-to-office plan, Frana suggests opening a constructive conversation with your manager about what RTO would mean for your role:\"What challenges are we trying to address by returning to the office? How will success be measured? Is there any amount of flexibility that would still be offered?\"Another option could be putting together a proposal for why you should be allowed to continue working remotely, Frana says.\"I think the main thing to bring to a conversation like this is your results: any feedback that you have from clients or other co-workers, and any goals that you've met or exceeded,\" she says.The goal is to demonstrate to your manager that \"you've been productive, efficient and a stellar employee\" despite not working in-person, she says.If remote work is non-negotiable for you, it may be time to look for a new job \"that better meets your needs,\" Frana says.Plenty of companies offer fully remote work, Frana says, but competition can be fierce for those roles. She advises job seekers to polish up their resumes, reach out to their network and do their research on remote-friendly workplaces.For workers committed to staying remote, it's crucial \"to be proactive in looking for the type of work environment and position that they want in the future,\" she says.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "UNITED STATES - NOVEMBER 10: Jeremy Siegel, the Russell E. Palmer Professor of Finance at the Wharton School, addresses the Securities Industry Association during their annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, Thursday, November 10, 2005. Matt Stroshane | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's control over crucial rare earth materials has been a \"threat for a long time\" to Western supply chains and the U.S. should create a strategic reserve of the metals, University of Pennsylvania professor emeritus of finance Jeremy Siegel told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" Monday.\"It's scandalous that we don't have a rare earth strategic reserve [and] that we let China monopolize 90% of refining rare earth materials,\" Siegel said. \"Where were we, realizing the importance of these?\"Siegel's strategic reserve proposal comes as the U.S.-China trade war intensified Friday, with President Donald Trump vowing to impose \"massive tariffs\" on Beijing in response to its limits on rare earth mineral exports to the U.S., and threatening to cancel a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump's announcement erased $2 trillion in value from the stock market.The U.S. created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975 in response to the 1973 Arab Oil Embargo. Today, almost three quarters of the world's rare earth minerals, used in everything from smartphones to fighter jets, are mined in China, which processes 90% of the metals, according to Bank of America analysts.\"Export controls could create a choke point in global supply chains,\" BofA global economist Claudio Irigoyen wrote Sunday in a note to clients.But Siegel said he's confident the U.S. and China will resolve their latest trade conflict before Trump's Nov. 1 deadline for more tariffs.   \"It'll be worked out, and it won't be too negative for either country,\" Siegel said. Trump's remarks were \"just a prelude to saying, 'All right there are our chips, we've got cards [and] you've got cards...and let's negotiate.'\"Siegel, author of 1994's Stocks for the Long Run, said the November 1 deadline is actually a sign that Trump hopes to negotiate with his Chinese counterpart. \"Trump said 100% [tariffs] but he said, 'Listen, I said the November 1 date, which for me is like forever,'\" Siegel said. \"It's actually the farthest date he's ever set for the start of a tariff, which means he wants to have that solved.\" Siegel added that the market will likely snap back following trade talks between Washington D.C. and Beijing. The S&P 500 is about 1.2% higher in early trading Monday after crumbling 2.7% on Friday.\"Once it's resolved, given all the other good things that are happening, I see no reason why we can't continue on to new highs,\" Siegel said.The S&P 500 is regaining some 40% of its Friday losses early Monday, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed about 2% as technology stocks rebound from last week's retreat.

    "body": "watch nowVeteran investor Howard Marks isn't calling the artificial intelligence boom a bubble — at least not for now.\"My response to date has been that the valuations are ... high but not crazy\" the Oaktree Capital Management co-founder said Monday in an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen. \"Expensive and going down tomorrow are not synonymous.\"Marks, known for his memos on market cycles and investor psychology, said while enthusiasm for AI stocks is undeniable, it hasn't yet crossed into the realm of mania that defines a true bubble.\"To me, the main ingredient in bubbles is psychological excess ... some kind of temporary mania,\" he said. \"For a company in this sector or industry, there's no such thing as a price too high. And I don't detect that level of mania at this time, so I have not put the bubble label on this incident ... it just hasn't reached that critical mass of mania.\"(You can view the full interview with Marks here on CNBC PRO.)Investors have piled into AI-linked names this year, driving valuations of chipmakers and software companies to historic highs amid fears of missing out. Marks believes that investor optimism doesn't automatically signal irrational exuberance.Marks drew a parallel to the late 1990s internet boom, which promised to transform the world — and ultimately did — yet left a trail of worthless companies in its wake.\"Back in '99, people said the internet will change the world. And it certainly did,\" he said. \"But the vast majority of the companies that went public for the internet and e-commerce in '98, '99, early 2000 ended up worthless.\"He warned that the same psychological patterns often reappear in bubbles. Investors assume the current leaders will remain dominant, that even the laggards will prosper, and that any company with a small chance of massive success is worth backing.\"A company with a 2% chance of going up 100x is still a winner. And I think that's a reach too far,\" Marks said. \"That's bubble psychology.\"For now, he doesn't see the AI rally fitting that mold.\"I think people are counting on AI for a lot,\" he said. \"I think that it's probably going to deliver a lot. We have no idea what it's going to deliver, when, or in what form. And I've made the judgment that it's not manic behavior.\"",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Argentina's President Javier Milei during the 80th United Nations General Assembly, in New York City, New York, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.Alexander Drago | ReutersThe Treasury Department has extended a financial lifeline to Argentina in apparent hopes of heading off an emerging market financial crisis that could spread to U.S. shores.In a move that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced Thursday on social media site X, the U.S. is providing a $20 billion currency swap line with Argentina's central bank — essentially exchanging stable U.S. dollars with volatile pesos.The move comes amid liquidity concerns in Argentina that threatened stability for the country as it faces key midterm elections.Providing the swap line \"marks a pivotal moment for Argentina's financial stability,\" Diego Celedon, head of equity strategy for the region at JPMorgan Chase, said in a client note. \"The U.S. support acts as a circuit breaker, halting the negative feedback loop that had threatened to deepen Argentina's economic strain.\"Economics, markets and politicsThere are equal parts economic and political stakes with the venture, which marks the first U.S. intervention of this nature since rescuing Mexico in 1995.While Argentina poses little systemic risk, it can still matter in terms of possible capital flight along with volatility in debt and commodity markets. That chance was deemed worth the risk of potential Argentinian default.\"Overall, the American intervention has transformed Argentina's short-term outlook, but the administration must now leverage its political capital to fully capitalize on this window of opportunity,\" Celedon wrote.The immediate market reaction was for the peso to appreciate sharply against the dollar Friday.However, an exchange-traded fund pegged to the country's industrial leaders, the Global X MSCI Argentina ETF, slumped Friday, indicating concerns that the American backstop may not be enough.\"It's unclear why the Trump administration is providing a de facto bailout of the Argentinian peso when there is no significant financial or economic relationship between the two economies,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"It's entirely unclear to me that Argentina will not choose to devalue its peso after its election later this month,\" he added. \"Therein lies one of the greater risks of providing $20 billion Treasury supported swap line to Buenos Aires.\"In addition to economic and market matters, the U.S. has a significant political stake in what's happening in Argentina.Oct. 26 elections will determine the fate of President Javier Milei's government, which has become an important ally for the U.S. in the region. With investors jittery over global growth and election-year uncertainty, the bailout shows Washington is committed to keeping credit markets calm at home.Defending the dealIn his announcement of the deal, Bessent said it was in response to \"a moment of acute illiquidity\" and said the U.S. was in a unique position to help.He further mentioned the country's efforts at fiscal reform that \"will generate significant dollar-denominated exports and foreign exchange reserves.\"Still, the country's shaky fiscal history generated caution that the U.S. essentially could be throwing good money after bad as Argentina has a long history of defaulting on its debts.\"Milei has succeeded in sharply reducing inflation but has struggled to stabilize the peso's exchange rate against the dollar,\" said Lourdes Casanova, director of the Emerging Markets Institute at Cornell University. \"Given that currency trading is the largest financial market in the world ... no amount of reserves can single-handedly offset that pressure.\"The move also was met with criticism elsewhere, ranging from the soundness of the Argentinian political and economic system to the White House's use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the liquidity measure.\"While the government is 'shut down,' the Treasury Department officially started its bailout of Argentina,\" Rohit Chopra, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said in a statement. \"We are now actively pumping dollars into Argentina in exchange for the country's plummeting peso, rather than helping people here at home.\"Bessent, though, said Milei's fiscal policies are \"sound\" and the success of the country is systemically important.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the name of the Exchange Stabilization Fund.",

    "body": "People depart a Lego store in Manhattan on August 29, 2024 in New York City. Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesIn July 2023, just two months after his mother fought and won a battle against breast cancer, Sam Lane began to get sick.Sam underwent several rounds of testing, and the now 14-year-old finally received a diagnosis: a rare brain and spine cancer.\"They said 'cancer,' and before I started crying, I said, 'Dang it, I was going to guess that, but I didn't want it to be that bad,'\" Sam said.But at his lowest point, on a feeding tube and unable to walk, a nurse offered Sam a bright spot: She said she needed his help to build a Lego MRI scanner set for fellow patients at Boston Children's Hospital to play with and learn from.Sam's mom said she was \"blown away\" by the level of detail in the play set, made of specialized Lego bricks.\"I remember sitting there saying to him, 'Sammy, why don't you take a break? You've been working at that straight for some time,'\" Christina Lane said. \"And he just didn't even look at me and was like, 'Nope, this is important... I need to help other kids.'\"Lego's MRI scanner sets, which feature a scanner, patient bed, waiting room, staff figures and medical instruments, were designed specifically to help children learn about the procedure through hands-on play. The miniature MRI machine table moves back and forth, mimicking a real procedure.On Monday, the toy company announced that more than 1 million children globally have used the sets to help them prepare for their medical procedures. New Lego research found that 96% of healthcare professionals said the model helps to reduce children's anxiety, and 46% reported a lesser need to use sedation after the children played with the set.Lego MRI Scanner play setCourtesy: LegoMRIs, which don't involve radiation, are often used in pediatric care – but with the bright light, loud noises and requirement to stay still, the machines often frighten children and introduce the need for sedation, according to Sam's child life specialists, Laura Boegler and Alyssa Sachs.They focus on ways to support psychosocial and emotional wellbeing of patients and families at Boston Children's Hospital and said opportunities to play are key.\"We often say that play is a universal language, and so the play-based approach of being able to touch and ask questions really helps ease anxieties and misconceptions that any kids have,\" Sachs said.Boegler said having children play with the Lego set before their own MRI scans has significantly helped decrease anxiety and increase familiarity with the procedure.The set that Sam built is being used to ease other patients' worries in a way that feels authentic to them.\"An MRI machine, that's not something that kids are seeing in school, that's not what they're talking about at home, so it's kind of like this new scary thing,\" Boegler said. \"Using the MRI Lego set, we're able to show kids in a way that's comfortable for them.\"Lego doesn't sell the sets and instead has donated more than 10,000 of the kits to hospitals around the world.Over the past few years, Lego has worked on expanding its customer base and deepened its strategy to achieve a streak of positive annual growth. The company has begun to cater more to adults as well as kids with more sophisticated and bespoke kits, including a wide range of sets aligned with pop culture like \"Harry Potter\" to \"Wicked.\"The company's botanical and F1 racing sets, in particular, have brought new customers into the fold.Icons Tiny Plants by Lego.James Manning - Pa Images | Pa Images | Getty ImagesChristina Lane said the MRI play set her son built helped him feel connected to other children battling cancer.\"To have a little Lego buddy that they can identify with that is going through the same things that they are is really incredible,\" she said. \"As a mom, as a nurse, as a human being, to be able to support our kids during such a challenging and difficult time through play – truly, it's essential.\"And the set has even helped Sam in his own journey. Now celebrating over a year cancer-free, he reflected on how his relationship with the machines has changed.In his first MRI, Sam said he felt claustrophobic and scared, and the noises felt too loud for him to comprehend.But now, he has a simple and reliable strategy for all of his MRI sessions: \"I fall asleep.\"Correction: This story has been updated to correct details of Sam Lane's cancer diagnosis and treatment.

The construction sector also softened, rising 3.1% year on year compared with 6.2% in the prior quarter.\"Growth was weighed down by output declines in the biomedical manufacturing and general manufacturing clusters, even as output in the other manufacturing clusters expanded,\" MTI said in a statement.The slowdown comes as Singapore's central bank left its policy settings unchanged, maintaining its stance from July.The Monetary Authority of Singapore said that GDP growth is expected to moderate as activity \"normalises\" in trade-related sectors.Global investment in artificial intelligence is expected to support Singapore's manufacturing sector, the central bank said, while construction and financial services should benefit from infrastructure spending and accommodative financial conditions.\"In 2026, GDP growth is projected to slow in line with external developments to a near-trend pace, such that the output gap narrows to around 0%,\" MAS said in a statement.Exports from Singapore recorded an 11.3% decline in non-oil domestic exports in August, the sharpest drop since March 2024.Non-oil exports to Indonesia, the U.S. and China fell in August, but rose to the European Union, Taiwan and South Korea, government data showed.Singapore's exports to the United States dropped by 28.8% year on year in August, following a 42.8% fall in July.—This is breaking news, please check back for updates.",

The missiles reportedly cost an average of $1.3 million each.Trump was traveling in the Middle East on Monday.He first visited Israel and then flew to Egypt as talks on a peace deal for Gaza are being finalized.",

CNBCOracle CEO Clay Magouyrk, one of the two people tapped last month to lead the software company, is confident that OpenAI will be able to cover the costs of the massive amount of cloud infrastructure services it consumes.In an interview with CNBC's David Faber at Oracle's AI World conference on Monday, Magouyrk said \"of course\" OpenAI can pay $60 billion for a year's worth of cloud resources. In July, OpenAI agreed to a five-year deal with Oracle that's worth more than $300 billion.\"Just look at the rate at which they've grown to, you know, almost a billion users. That's just unheard of,\" said Magouyrk, who sat alongside fellow Oracle CEO Mike Sicilia for the interview in Las Vegas.OpenAI said last week that its flagship ChatGPT chatbot, which was publicly launched less than three years ago, now has 800 million weekly active users. In 2024, OpenAI recorded a $5 billion net loss.Sicilia said Oracle has started integrating OpenAI artificial intelligence models into a patient portal for viewing electronic health records. Oracle acquired EHR vendor Cerner for about $28 billion in 2022.\"I've seen the results, and I really do think that they're going to have a dramatic impact on industries, on enterprises of all types,\" Sicilia said of OpenAI.OpenAI rents out Nvidia graphics chips to run models through Oracle, as well as CoreWeave, Google and Microsoft. At the same time, the company is designing a custom AI processor that Broadcom will build. Earlier on Monday, Broadcom and OpenAI said they will jointly deploy 10 gigawatts worth of the new OpenAI chips.Building out that much infrastructure requires a hefty amount of new energy.\"I think it's a factor of time, not a factor of if we'll have enough power,\" Sicilia said.Oracle shares rose 5% on Monday. The stock has gained 84% this year, lifting Oracle's market cap close to $900 billion.WATCH: Oracle CEO Magouyrk: ‘Of course’ OpenAI can pay $60 billion per yearwatch now",

    "body": "A top loader moves a container at the Fenix Marine Services terminal at the Port of Los Angeles in Los Angeles, California, US, on Friday, Aug. 15, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith less than 24 hours ahead of new U.S. government port fees on Chinese-made freight vessels, importers are grappling with additional tariffs that include other Chinese-made machinery key to the supply chain.On Friday, the U.S. Trade Representative announced modifications following a review of public comments on the prior rule, which include an additional 150% tariffs on rubber tire gantry cranes, rail-mounted gantry cranes, automatic stacking cranes, reachstackers, straddle carriers, terminal tractors, top loaders, and the components that make up the pieces of equipment.Factoring in the layering of prior tariffs on the cranes, the new tariff rate can be as high as 270%.In addition to the port crane fees, additional changes include the fee structure changes for vehicle carriers, otherwise known as roll-on roll-off vessels, which help to carry automobiles, farm equipment and other heavy machinery.Now, a fee will be charged based on the vessel's net tonnage capacity instead of the number of vehicles being carried. One ocean carrier that owns and operates RoRos said the change could cost them millions.That will be on top of the new USTR port fees, set to go into effect on Tuesday. The USTR, under the Biden administration, investigated China's maritime practices in both shipbuilding and crane manufacturing; the Trump Administration pursued the trade actions. According to trade experts, payments on these new tariffs can be deferred until December 10 but the fees will begin applying on October 14.In an email to CNBC, a spokesperson for the American Association of Port Authorities wrote the seaport industry is challenged by yet more taxes on the equipment necessary for supply chain expansion and resilience.\"Ports large and small struggle to finance large, modern, world-class equipment like cranes when government policies double the price overnight. The choice is literally between affordable equipment or lagging behind,\" the spokesperson said. \"The industry has always worked with the government to try to shift the sourcing domestically or to allied countries - the industry has always been in favor of a supply-side manufacturing incentive for that purpose - and we expect Congress will eventually pass it on a bipartisan basis with support from the Trump Administration. Until then, we're going to see a dearth of readily available and affordable equipment. I hope and trust these challenges to global supply chains and mutually beneficial trade can get worked out by the negotiators soon.\"Lars Jensen, founder of Vespucci Maritime, told CNBC the fees on cranes and port equipment are merely another element added to the costs of the U.S. supply chain.\"Effectively, the tariffs are another headwind and making imports more expensive and exports less competitive,\" said Jensen. \"In recent months, we have seen how containerized volumes to and from the U.S. are declining while volume in the rest of the world is increasing strongly. Every new headwind will serve to solidify that development.\"Thomas Kazakos, secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, which represents the world's national shipowner associations and over 80% of the world's merchant fleet, told CNBC they are still reviewing the modifications.\"ICS supports the ambition to increase U.S. shipbuilding capacity and to make the United States Shipbuilding industry strong, as additional commercial tonnage strengthens the global maritime sector's efficiency and competitiveness, said Kazakos. \"However, the service or port fees proposed by the USTR will have a huge impact on US exports. It could damage US export competitiveness and raise costs for US businesses and consumers, as the proposed port fees are essentially a protectionist measure.\"In a global maritime study conducted by ICS and Professor Craig VanGrasstek from the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, researched suggested that a lower level of trade restrictive measures affecting maritime transport could increase some economies' GDP by up to 3.4%.      \"Removing tariff and non-tariff barriers are quick and easy tools available to policymakers to increase levels of GDP,\" Kazakos said. \"Countries at all levels of economic development would be better off if even modest reductions were made to the existing barriers.   As we are seeing, these measures also often inspire retaliatory measures. Ultimately, no one will win if these tactics are pursued.\"China recently announced counter tariff measures. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there have been \"substantial communications\" with China over past weekend on trade, adding that President Trump is still expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later in the month.For the U.S. energy market, the modifications are good news; USTR eliminated a clause for suspension of licensing of LNG shipments. The provision in the April announcement mandated that increasing proportions of US LNG exports must be moved on U.S.-built vessels.Other vessels in the U.S. Maritime Security Program that transport military use vehicles and built in non-U.S. yards will continue to benefit from a \"targeted exemption\" through 2029.Carl Bentzel, CEO of the National Association of Waterfront Employers, told CNBC that the trade association is \"disheartened, but not surprised based on discussions with the White House, that USTR did not grant the 3-year waiver we requested they requested.\" Bentzel said they are still evaluating the 150% penalty on the tariffs impacting the very wide range of additional argo handling equipment. \"That seemingly came out of nowhere,\" said Bentzel.\"It is clear now that the hammer has been dropped on Chinese cargo handling equipment, and this will make it more important than ever to get government support to develop a U.S.-based cargo handling technology,\" he said.",

And honestly, Russia does not need that,\" he said, according to comments reported by Sky News.U.S. President Donald Trump holds an umbrella before boarding Air Force One, as he departs for Israel, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Oct. 12, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersTrump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy have discussed the potential provision on Tomahawk missiles, which would allow Ukraine to launch robust counter-attacks against Russia.But the U.S. president is keeping his cards close to his chest regarding whether he will actually send the missiles to Ukraine. He said Monday that he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the matter. No such call has been scheduled, as yet, according to comments from the Kremlin on Monday.Russia has warned that any provision of long-range cruise missiles to Kyiv would be seen as a \"serious escalation.\"What are Tomahawks?Tomahawks are subsonic cruise missiles and can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace, according to U.S. manufacturer Raytheon.Designed for striking high value or heavily defended land targets, Tomahawks can be fired from ground launchers but are typically launched from ships or submarines, and can be armed with conventional or nuclear warheads. The missiles don't come cheap, with a reported average cost of $1.3 million each.Sailors aboard the guided-missile destroyer USS Preble conduct an operational tomahawk missile launch while underway in a training area off the coast of California.U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Woody PaschallFirst developed in the 1970s, they are used by the U.S. military and have been purchased — or with agreements to purchase — by a number of allies, including the U.K., Japan, Australia and the Netherlands.The latest version, called the Block IV Tactical Tomahawk, or TACTOM, has a data link that allows it to switch targets while in flight. It can loiter for hours and change course instantly on command.Raytheon notes that U.S. and Allied militaries have flight tested the GPS-enabled Tomahawk over 550 times and used it in an operational environment more than 2,350 times. Its most recent use came in 2024, when the U.S. and British navies launched Tomahawk missiles at Houthi rebel sites in Yemen.Russian reactionKremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week that Moscow's leadership was waiting to see the specifics of any deal to supply Tomahawks, but was scathing about the prospect.\"This would be a serious escalation which, however, wouldn't change the situation for the Kyiv regime on the front lines. But it's important to understand that, leaving aside the details, we're talking about nuclear capable missiles. Therefore, this is truly a serious escalation.\"Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov during a summit of leaders of nations, which are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), in Moscow, Russia October 8, 2024. Sergei Ilnitsky | Via ReutersOn Monday, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said that any Tomahawk supply could end badly for everyone, including Trump. He noted that it's impossible to distinguish between Tomahawk missiles carrying nuclear warheads and conventional ones after they are launched.\"How should Russia respond? Exactly!\" Medvedev said on Telegram, in comments translated by Reuters, seeming to hint that Moscow's response would be a nuclear one.Asked on Monday about Trump's comments that he would talk to Putin about Tomahawks, Peskov said \"there are no clear agreements on a phone call.\"Could they be a game-changer?Ukraine and its supporters say the supply of Tomahawks would greatly enhance the country's strike capabilities and the threat it poses to Russian assets, such as military bases, energy infrastructure and logistics hubs.Supplying Tomahawks could, as such, be another push factor that brings Russia to the negotiating table with Ukraine and its Western allies, particularly the U.S., wanting to see an end to a war that Moscow began in February 2022.Ukrainian leader Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Sunday that Kyiv was working closely with the White House to strengthen its defensive capabilities, including its long-range capabilities.\"We see and hear that Russia fears the possibility of the United States providing us with Tomahawks. It is a signal that this kind of pressure can be effective in achieving peace. President Trump and I agreed that our teams and our military will be working on all the matters we discussed,\" he said.A U.S. ship launches a Tomahawk cruise missile in this undated file photo.U.S. Navy | Getty ImagesAs Trump looks to cement an end of hostilities between Israel and Hamas, his attention could well turn back to Russia, with the president already signaling waning patience with Putin.In addition, Trump's publicized coveting of the Nobel Peace Prize (which he missed out on this year) could help spur the president on to deliver peace in Ukraine.\"That Trump did not get the Nobel peace prize this time could turn into good news for Europe. He wants the prize. But he still has to earn it,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank, noted Monday.\"If Trump were to put enough pressure on Putin to stop the war against Ukraine, the U.S. president would indeed be the top candidate for the prize next year ... Media reports about potential deliveries of U.S. Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine suggest that Trump is getting tougher with Putin. That would be a start,\" Schmieding said.",

    "body": "Marc Benioff, chief executive officer of Salesforce, speaks during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 18, 2024.Halil Sagirkaya | Anadolu | Getty ImagesAs Salesforce welcomes tens of thousands of people to San Francisco for its annual Dreamforce conference, CEO Marc Benioff has found himself in the center of local controversy on a national issue.In an interview with The New York Times published on Friday, Benioff appeared eager for President Donald Trump to send federal troops to his company's hometown, inserting himself into a national debate about whether the president should call the National Guard into various Democrat-led cities that Trump has maligned.The Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Portland and Chicago, sparking protests and lawsuits.\"We don't have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I'm all for it,\" Benioff told the Times.Benioff subsequently softened his comments, writing on X on Sunday that safety is \"first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.\" But a heated online conversation was already well underway.Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who moved to Texas from California, said federal intervention is needed to deal with crime in San Francisco. In posts on his social network X on Sunday, he said it would be \"the only solution at this point,\" and that \"nothing else has or will work.\" A day earlier, Musk, who has drawn criticism for his own drug use, characterized downtown San Francisco as a \"drug zombie apocalypse.\"Musk still has big business in and around San Francisco. His artificial intelligence startup xAI, which owns X, has a sizable office in the city, and his brain computer interface company, Neuralink, recently leased a large property in South San Francisco. Tesla relocated to Texas, but the automaker's engineering headquarters remains in Palo Alto, just south of San Francisco.Musk's call for U.S. troops came in response to social media posts by Tom Wolf, who describes himself as a \"a formerly homeless recovering addict in San Francisco,\" and an \"advocate for addiction recovery.\"\"If you want to keep federal troops out of San Francisco, remove the organized drug dealers and 80% of the problem goes away,\" Wolf wrote. \"If you don't, you reap what you sow.\"Musk shared Wolf's post to his more than 227 million listed followers on X.Neither Benioff nor Musk immediately responded to requests for comment. CNBC also reached out to Tesla, xAI and Salesforce for comment but did not hear back.watch nowLocal officials loudly opposed the idea of bringing in federal troops.Brooke Jenkins, San Francisco's district attorney, wrote on X after the Benioff interview that, \"I can't be silent any longer.\"Jenkins accused Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem of turning \"so-called public safety and immigration enforcement into a form of government sponsored violence against U.S. citizens, families, and ethnic groups,\" and said that if anyone is using excessive force or illegally harassing residents, \"I will not hesitate to do my job and hold you accountable just like I do other violators of the law every single day.\"San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who defeated incumbent London Breed in November in part by promising to clean up San Francisco's streets, wrote on X on Sunday that \"crime is down 30% and tent encampments are at an all-time low.\" He didn't directly address Benioff or Dreamforce, but noted that tens of thousand of people are coming to the city for activities including concerts and Fleet Week, and that public safety is critical.\"San Francisco is on the rise,\" he wroteIn Benioff's follow-up comments after his interview with the Times, the Salesforce CEO praised Lurie's efforts to increase police hiring and retain law enforcement.Dreamforce, which launched in 2003, kicks off on Tuesday and runs through Thursday. The event is being held at the Moscone Center and occupies much of the surrounding area in downtown San Francisco.Garry Tan, CEO of startup incubator Y Combinator, wrote on X that \"We don't need the National Guard,\" but he used his post to go after a frequent local target for techies: Chesa Boudin and progressives.Boudin was district attorney in San Francisco until 2022, when he was removed in a recall election after critics railed against what they viewed as his unwillingness to prosecute violent criminals. Now the judges are the problem, Tan said.\"We need new judges who are not hardcore Chesa Boudin-style activists who work to keep drug dealers out of jail even though the police, the district attorney and the people of SF want them locked up,\" he wrote. \"It's shockingly that simple in SF.\"WATCH: President Trump to activate the National Guard in Washington, D.C.watch now",

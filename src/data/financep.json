Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered the Defense Department to purchase power from coal plants, his latest effort to revivte an industry that has struggled to compete against cheaper energy resources.Trump signed the executive order at a White House event attended by Peabody Energy CEO James Grech. The order directs the Pentagon to secure long-term power purchase agreements with coal plants for military installations.\"We're going to be buying a lot of coal through the military now,\" Trump said. Shares of Peabody rose 4% in extended trading. The president said he also directed the Department of Energy to issue funds to keep coal plants open in West Virginia, Ohio, North Carolina and Kentucky.Trump declared coal essential to U.S. national and economic security last April. He issued several executive orders at the time that aimed boost coal production. The coal industry has been in state of decline for years as it has struggled to compete against natural gas and renewable energy. About 16% of U.S. electricity generation came from burning coal in 2023, down from 51% in 2001, according to the Energy Information Administration. ",

    "body": "A cargo ship is loading and unloading foreign trade containers at Qingdao Port in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, Jan. 13, 2026.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesThe U.S. government in January ran up a smaller deficit than a year ago, while tariff collections surged and provided a reminder of how pivotal a long-awaited Supreme Court decision could be to federal fiscal health.Customs duties collected through tariffs totaled $30 billion for the month, putting the fiscal year-to-date tally at $124 billion, or 304% more than the same period in 2025. President Donald Trump first levied the duties in April 2025 with an across-the-board rate on all goods and services entering the U.S. along with a menu of so-called reciprocal tariffs on individual countries. Since then, the White House has been negotiating with its trading partners, backing off on some of the more aggressive charges while maintaining tough talk on issues.Last November, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments challenging the auspices under which Trump justified the tariffs. The decision was expected in January. The high court hasn't ruled yet, and there's concern in the White House that a negative ruling could force the U.S. into reimbursing the duties collected so far.The tariffs helped put a dent in the pace of the budget deficit.In the fourth month of the fiscal year, the shortfall totaled roughly $95 billion, down about 26% from the same period a year ago, the Treasury Department reported Year to date, that put federal red ink at $697 billion, or down 17% from the same period of fiscal 2025, according to numbers not adjusted for calendar. Calendar adjustments put the deficit reduction at 21%. Interest on the $38.6 trillion U.S. debt continues to be a burden on the national finances. Net interest paid totaled $76 billion for the month, more than all other expenditures except Medicare, Social Security and health care. Year to date, gross interest has totaled $426.5 billion, up from $392.2 billion the year before.",

    "body": "A McDonald's cheeseburger, fries and soda arranged in Celina, Texas, Sept. 2, 2025.Jake Dockins | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMcDonald's on Wednesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations as its value push wins back customers.\"By listening to customers and taking action, we have improved traffic and strengthened our value & affordability scores,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a statement.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.12 adjusted vs. $3.05 expectedRevenue: $7 billion vs. $6.84 billion expectedThe fast-food giant reported fourth-quarter net income of $2.16 billion, or $3.03 per share, up from $2.02 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier.Excluding restructuring charges and other items, McDonald's earned $3.12 per share.Net revenue climbed 10% to $7 billion.The company's same-store sales increased 5.7%, fueled by strong growth in its home market. Wall Street was projecting same-store sales growth of 3.9%, according to StreetAccount estimates.U.S. same-store sales increased 6.8%. In the year-ago period, its domestic same-store sales shrank 1.4% after an E. coli outbreak weeks into the quarter weighed on traffic. McDonald's credited buzzy promotions — like its Grinch Meal and Monopoly promotion — that boosted both traffic and sales this year. For nearly a week, McDonald's was the largest seller of socks in the world, thanks to the popularity of the Grinch Meal, which included the special-edition clothing item in many of its markets. Kempczinski said the company sold 50 million pairs globally in the first few days of the promotion. It was also the catalyst for McDonald's highest-ever sales day, according to Chief Financial Officer Ian Borden. The chain also expanded its value offerings by relaunching Extra Value Meals, which offer a roughly 15% discount on combo meals.Outside the U.S., McDonald's saw same-store sales growth in nearly all markets. The company's international operated markets segment, which includes Germany and Australia, reported same-store sales growth of 5.2%. Its international developmental licensed markets division saw same-store sales rise 4.5%.Looking to 2026, McDonald's is \"off to a strong start,\" according to Borden. But executives expect weaker first-quarter same-store sales growth compared with the fourth quarter. While Extra Value Meals are drawing in diners, the winter storm that swept across the country in late January scared some away and caused temporary restaurant closures.For the full year, McDonald's is planning to spend between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion on capital expenditures, according to a regulatory filing. Most of that will be spent opening approximately 2,600 new locations. The addition of 2,100 net new restaurants is expected to raise systemwide sales about 2.5%, excluding currency fluctuations. McDonald's plans to open about 750 restaurants in the U.S. and its international operated markets, while licensees and affiliates will open more than 1,800 restaurants in other markets.\"We believe the underlying assumptions for our 2026 outlook are prudent and reflect our expectations that the [quick-service restaurant] industry environments in the U.S. and across many markets will remain challenging,\" Borden said. The chain also has big plans for its menu in 2026. Later this year, McDonald's will roll out new beverages, including energy drinks, fruity refreshers and crafted sodas in the U.S. and select international markets. The new drinks are the result of lessons learned from its now-shuttered CosMc's spinoff and a 500-restaurant test that took place last summer. Like Taco Bell and Chick-fil-A, McDonald's is hoping that fun drinks will attract diners and lift sales.The chain has also been leaning into chicken, which is more popular with U.S. consumers than beef. Recently, several Chicago-area locations began testing hand-breaded chicken strips, wings and grilled sandwiches. Still, the experiment is still in the early stages, Global Chief Restaurant Experience Officer Jill McDonald said on the company's conference call.Longer term, McDonald's is also looking to add menu items that would interest diners who are using GLP-1 drugs, McDonald said. Plus, the chain will highlight the high protein content of its existing menu.\"We'll be led by the customers and what they what they want from us, but there's plenty [for] them to enjoy on our menu currently,\" she said.",

    "body": "A recruiter displays information while speaking to a jobseeker during the WorkSource North Seattle Career Fair in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026.David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJanuary job gains were better than anything the U.S. economy saw in 2025 but not still enough to sound an all-clear on what has otherwise been a stagnant labor market.With a gain of 130,000 nonfarm payrolls and the unemployment rate slipping to 4.3%, the lowest since August, the numbers indicated that hiring is at least hanging in there while layoffs appear contained.However, beneath the hood there were some trouble spots: A continued concentration in just a few fields where hiring is happening; revisions that meant virtually no gains in the second half of 2025, and questions over what happens from here as companies contend with a high level of uncertainty.\"I would anticipate that for the rest of the year, job growth is going to be quite subdued,\" said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon. \"Whether it's as subdued as 2025 ... is still an open question. But I would not expect job growth to be higher than 50,000 for the remainder of 2026.\"Indeed, revisions the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday put job gains last year at just 15,000 a month. The last six months of the year produced a net loss of 1,000 jobs. In the recent words of Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, the year's job growth was close to \"Zero. Zip. Nada.\"Also, nearly all the January jobs came from health care-related sectors, raising questions over the ability of displaced and new workers to be able to get hired. On top of the anemic gains, Daco has another worry. He sees trouble brewing with the receding income gains for cash-strapped consumers possibly causing damage not readily visible in headline economic numbers.Average hourly earnings advanced 0.4% in January, slightly higher than expected, but the annual gain of 3.71% was the lowest since July 2024. With retail sales unexpectedly flat in December, and consumer spending responsible for more than two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, that could spell a potential danger sign.\"We're heading from a jobless expansion to potentially an income-less expansion, because income is essentially the combination of jobs and wages. With both under pressure, that means that for many families, income and income growth prospects are muted,\" Daco said.Questions for the futureSo while the monthly numbers are good, whether they are an outlier, or even if they will stand up, remains to be seen. After all, every month in 2025 saw a negative revision from the initial estimate. The release comes with other economic signs looking strong. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of growth, is on pace to post a solid 3.7% gain in the fourth quarter after posting 4.4% and 3.8% increases in the prior two periods in 2025, according to the Atlanta Fed.However, that kind of growth is hard to sustain without stronger job gains, said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock.\"One key warning sign is that in past cycles, GDP growth like this has usually required far more hiring. The fact that hiring has slowed while growth has advanced may potentially be an early signal of a productivity boom that we expect to continue,\" Rieder said in a note. \"While areas like healthcare are still labor intensive, the more interest-sensitive parts of the economy are clearly still under pressure, particularly the lower income segment.\"The state of the labor market and its relation to inflation sets up a policy challenge at the Federal Reserve, which already has seen significant divisions over how to proceed.Most recently, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland said Tuesday that they don't see a need to cut rates further with inflation still above the Fed's target and the labor market stable. As voters this year on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, their positions conflict with those of Governor Waller, who is advocating for more cuts, a position also held by Fed Chair-designate Kevin Warsh.\"I think there is room for the Fed to get a little bit closer to median estimates of neutral policy,\" EY's Daco said. \"I don't necessarily think that that will be the case ... in part because a majority of Fed policy makers are more focused on the inflation mandate than on the employment mandate.\"For their part, markets took the view Wednesday that the January payrolls report will temper any urges to cut rates soon. According to the CME Group's FedWatch tracker, trades are pricing in the likelihood of a cut in March at roughly 6%, though they still see two reductions before the end of the year.",

    "body": "Jobseekers speak with recruiters past event signage during the WorkSource North Seattle Career Fair in Seattle, Washington, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 10, 2026. David Ryder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe January nonfarm payrolls report beat Wall Street expectations in both job creation and the unemployment rate. Here are the top five takeaways:From a headline perspective, the news was good. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 130,000 and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3%, the latter thanks to a boom of 528,000 in household employment. The Dow Jones consensus was for 55,000 jobs and a 4.4% unemployment rate.Wages also rose, climbing a higher-than-expected 0.4% for the month and 3.7% annually. Hours worked, a productivity gauge, increased to 34.3 hours, up by 0.1 hour.Along with the sunshine came some rain. Annual revisions to the jobs count benchmarked against Census data showed that for the April 2024-March 2025 period, payrolls growth was 898,000 lower than initially stated. Moreover, November's previous estimate fell by 15,000 and December was off 2,000. For the final six months of 2025, the economy lost a net 1,000 jobs.Payroll growth again was concentrated in health care-related fields: There were 82,000 jobs in ambulatory health-care services, hospitals, and nursing and residential care facilities, and another 42,000 in social assistance. Only construction, which added 33,000 positions, showed any noticeable improvement.Traders increased their bets that the strong headline payrolls number and decline in the unemployment rate would keep the Federal Reserve on the sidelines until the summer. Futures market trading implied just an 8% probability of a cut in March, with the next reduction not likely happening until at least June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.They said it:\"Just in: GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED! The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far. This would be an INTEREST COST SAVINGS OF AT LEAST ONE TRILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR - BALANCED BUDGET, PLUS. WOW! The Golden Age of America is upon us!!!\" — President Donald Trump, in a Truth Social post\"The strong payrolls print in January may be somewhat exaggerated: construction payrolls jumped, sensitive to warmer January weather; healthcare payrolls were well above trend; and retail stabilized. The  underlying pace for private payrolls is probably closer to 50k per month after accounting for the temporary strength in those areas, close to the recent pace.\" — Michael Gapen, Morgan Stanley chief economist\"The strong jobs growth in January assuages some concerns around the softening labor market and supports the outlook for consumption. But we'll need to see more data to determine whether January is a brief deviation from an overall trend or a reversal of the weakening employment outlook.\" — Atsi Sheth, Moody's Ratings chief credit officerCorrection: The previous December estimate was off by 2,000. An earlier version misstated the figure.",

    "body": "Professor David Gelernter sits in his office at Yale University in New Haven, Conn., on Aug. 28, 1997.Brad Clift | Hartford Courant | APYale University said Wednesday that it has barred professor David Gelernter from teaching computer science classes, for now, as the university conducts a review of his contacts with Jeffrey Epstein, which included mentioning a Yale student for a potential project.Gelernter's extensive email correspondence with Epstein came to light after the release of files related to Epstein by the Department of Justice in late January.Among those files is an October 2011 email to Epstein, in which Gelernter mentions a software project to be built.\"I have a perfect editoress in mind: Yale sr, worked at Vogue last summer, runs her own campus mag, art major, completely connected, v small goodlooking blonde,\" Gelernter wrote.The email was sent three years after Epstein pleaded guilty in Florida state court to soliciting an underage girl for prostitution. Epstein served 13 months in jail in that case.The Yale Daily News reported Tuesday that Gelernter had been barred from teaching classes pending a review.CNBC on Wednesday asked Yale about the status of Gelernter at the university and his contact with Epstein.In an email statement to CNBC, a Yale spokeswoman said, \"Yale is committed to excellence in the classroom and to fostering an environment in which all members of our community feel respected and valued.\"\"Last week, leadership in the School of Engineering and Applied Science became aware of reports regarding communication between a professor and a party external to the Yale community; the professor later both acknowledged and defended this communication and the action he took in connection with the communication.\"\"The university does not condone the action taken by the professor or his described manner of providing recommendations for his students.\"\"The professor's conduct is under review. Until the review is completed, the professor will not teach his class.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens. Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS NowGelernter did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from CNBC.Gelernter was seriously wounded in June 1993 when he opened a package containing an explosive device mailed to him by Ted Kaczynski, the so-called Unabomber. Gelernter lost the use of his right hand from the explosion.Yale's action against the professor comes nearly three months after former Harvard University President Larry Summers said he was stepping back from all public commitments because of fallout over the release of emails between him and Epstein.The correspondence included Summers seeking guidance from Epstein about pursuing a romantic relationship with a woman he described as a mentee, the Harvard Crimson newspaper reported at the time.Summers, who is also a former U.S. Treasury secretary, took a leave from teaching classes at Harvard, as well as from his post as the director of Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at the Harvard Kennedy School.\"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein,\" Summers said in a statement obtained by CNBC at the time.Harvard said in November that it would investigate Summers' relationship with Epstein in light of the disclosure by Congress of emails between them.Epstein killed himself in a federal jail in New York City in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.",

    "body": "Nio cars are seen displayed at Nio House, at the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker's manufacturing hub in Hefei, Anhui province, China April 2, 2025. Florence Lo | ReutersDETROIT — The largest U.S. auto dealer isn't interested in selling vehicles from China-based brands domestically right now, its CEO said Wednesday.But it's not necessarily because of politics, logistics or potential consumer backlash, according to Lithia Motors CEO Bryan DeBoer. His company already has at least 10 stores selling vehicles from three Chinese companies in the United Kingdom.DeBoer, who has grown Lithia exponentially in recent years, said the potential cost, return-on-investment and needed infrastructure, largely due to franchise rules in the U.S., are the biggest hindrances right now.\"We're quite excited that we've got that opportunity in the United Kingdom, but there's a big fundamental difference,\" DeBoer told investors Wednesday, citing \"dueling of franchises\" practices in the U.K. that allow Lithia to offer brands from different companies in the same showroom if they're deemed competitors.DeBoer said the dealer can be allowed to put vehicles from a company such as China's Chery Automobile, which is growing in Europe, into an existing showroom in the UK, and it would cost less than $100,000.That's not the case for the U.S., where franchised dealer laws are strict, vary by state and companies can have more influence in, if not rules against, such decisions. His comments come as Chinese automotive brands are increasingly exporting and expanding outside of their home market. Global market share for Chinese brands has jumped nearly 70% in five years, and many experts see a threat to U.S. automakers, including the anticipated entrance of Chinese brands into America. There have been China-produced vehicles on sale in the U.S. from brands such as Buick and Volvo, but none are from Chinese brands such as BYD, Nio or others.In the U.S., Lithia would need to establish new retail locations and service operations to support sales of Chinese brands, which would mean having to make completely new investments. He noted that roughly 50% to 60% of the company's profits come from service and parts. \"I think we would probably not be early adopters when it comes to the United States or possibly even Canada, primarily because we're usually not in a dual franchise situation,\" he said. China's most recent announced expansion is to Canada, a relatively small vehicle market that removed 100% tariffs on imported vehicles from China amid a trade dispute with the Trump administration.But DeBoer said the Oregon-based company isn't completely shutting the door, as Chinese brands continue to grow globally.\"We do have building relationships with a number of Chinese brands,\" he said. \"We'll keep our minds open and look at what the opportunities that present us in the future.\"DeBoer comments occurred on the company's call to discuss its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings, which included annual increases of 4% in revenue and 3.1% in gross profit.",

Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., slammed her and the Department of Justice for the lack of indictments of possible co-conspirators of the convicted sex predator Epstein.The S&P 500 is also up and the Nasdaq is \"smashing records,\" while Americans' retirement accounts are \"booming,\" Bondi said after celebrating the Dow Jones Industrial Average's gains. \"That's what we should be talking about.\"Democrats balked at the rhetoric, but Bondi doubled down.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinTrump Canada tariffs face House vote after Republican leaders fail to block rebellionThese Democrats aren’t ready to jettison big business as party stalwarts shift leftDC grand jury declines to indict Sens. Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS Now\"What does the Dow have to do with anything? That's what they just asked. Are you kidding?\" she said as Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, banged a gavel and called for order in the hearing room.Trump has repeatedly cited stock market gains as a barometer for his presidency after being elected to a second term amid voter concerns about rising prices for consumer goods. The Dow closed above 50,000 for the first time on Friday and added to that record each day this week.The DOJ oversight hearing had already devolved into partisan shouting matches on multiple occasions prior to Bondi's references to the stock market.Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the panel's ranking member, in his opening remarks accused Bondi of \"running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice.\"Raskin pointed to the DOJ's failure to release millions of files that it is legally bound to disclose under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Trump signed into law in November after reversing his opposition to the bill.The lawmaker also slammed the DOJ for redacting the names of alleged Epstein co-conspirators and enablers in the records it did release, while failing to black out victims' identifying information.\"So you ignored the law, and even with over 100,000 employees at your disposal, you acted with some mixture of staggering incompetence, cold indifference and jaded cruelty towards more than 1,000 victims, raped, abused and trafficked,\" Raskin said. \"This performance screams cover-up.\"Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, the first Democratic member to question Bondi, asked a group of Epstein survivors in the hearing room to stand up and raise their hands if they had been unable to meet with the DOJ. After numerous women stood and all raised their hands, Jayapal asked Bondi to apologize for the \"unacceptable release\" of victims' information in the Epstein files.Bondi began to respond that former Attorney General Merrick Garland \"sat in this chair twice,\" at which point the congresswoman interrupted and pushed her to answer the question, and a back-and-forth ensued.\"I'm not gonna get in the gutter for her theatrics,\" Bondi said.More acrimonious exchanges followed as Bondi and Democrats continued to clash.After Nadler's speaking time expired, Bondi admonished the Democrats who participated in the impeachment hearings against Trump during his first administration, saying, \"You all should be apologizing.\"\"You sit here and you attack the president, and I am not going to have it. I'm not going to put up with it,\" Bondi said.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a co-sponsor of the Epstein files bill, laced into Bondi as he called the DOJ's redaction issues a \"massive failure.\"He homed in on redactions that obscured the name of Les Wexner, the former CEO of Victoria's Secret, \"as a co-conspirator in an FBI document.\"Bondi said that redaction was corrected \"within 40 minutes.\" Massie shot back, \"40 minutes of me catching you red-handed.\"Bondi said Massie has \"Trump derangement syndrome.\"",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, the Threads logo is displayed on a cell phone in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on September 4, 2024. Mauro Pimentel | AFP | Getty ImagesMeta on Wednesday debuted an AI feature called \"Dear Algo\" that lets Threads users personalize their content-recommendation algorithms.Threads users will be able to tell the Dear Algo tool what kinds of posts they want to see similar to how people use written prompts to interact with chat bots like OpenAI's ChatGPT.The feature is the latest example of how Meta is continuing to incorporate artificial intelligence into its various apps like Threads. The social media company on Tuesday also released AI features for its Facebook service that let users animate their profile photos and alter other images with the Meta AI digital assistant.Meta last month told investors that it plans to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion this year on AI-related capital expenditures. That's nearly double the amount of capex that Meta spent last year when it overhauled its AI unit.Dear Algo is the latest addition to Threads, the micro-blogging platform that Meta launched in July 2023 to compete against Twitter, which is now called X and was part of the merger between Elon Musk's xAI and SpaceX earlier this month. Last month, Meta said Threads had 400 million monthly active users and would begin rolling out ads globally. CEO Mark Zuckerberg in January also told analysts that Meta plans to debut and test new AI products and features in 2026 as the company continues to spend big on data center and related computing infrastructure.To use the new tool, Threads users have to to craft a public post on the platform that begins with the phrase \"Dear Algo\" and then explains the kind of content they want to see more or less of. A spokesman for the company said Meta was inspired by a trend of people publicly sharing posts that included the phrase \"Dear Algo,\" a company spokesperson told CNBC.\"Once you share your request, Dear Algo adjusts your feed for three days, so you can stay connected to the most current conversations,' Meta said in a blog post. \"You can also repost someone else's Dear Algo request to apply their content preferences to your own feed.\"Meta said that it will begin testing Dear Algo with users in the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand before rolling it out to more countries at later dates.WATCH: New Mexico AG Raul Torrez discusses the Meta trial on child safety.watch now",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEssilorLuxottica's more than tripled its Meta artificial intelligence glasses sales last year, the Ray-Ban maker said on Wednesday in its fourth-quarter results. The French-Italian eyewear brand said it sold over 7 million AI glasses last year.That's up from the 2 million that the company sold in 2023 and 2024 combined, according to its quarterly report last February. The figure reported Wednesday includes smart glasses sold under the brands for Ray-Ban and Oakley, the latter of which was unveiled in June. The company's smart glasses success is the latest sign that the adoption of wearable AI devices is gaining momentum with consumers. \"Our success in wearables is helping to propel the AI-glasses revolution, with our iconic brands being a powerful driver of demand,\" the company said in a release.EssilorLuxottica has been working on the wearable devices with the social media company since 2019, CNBC reported at the time. The two companies launched the first edition of the glasses in September 2021, but the device didn't gain widespread attention until the second-generation launch in 2023. In September, EssilorLuxottica and Meta introduced a new Ray-Ban iteration, controllable through hand gestures and neural technology. That device retails for $799 and features a small display in one of the lenses. Meta in January said it would pushback the international launch of the Ray-Ban Display glasses, originally slated for early 2026, due to \"unprecedented\" demand in the U.S.Last month, Bloomberg reported that Meta and EssilorLuxottica were discussing doubling production to at least 20 million by the end of this year to meet growing demand.

Earlier this week, xAI co-founders Jimmy Ba and Tony Wu announced their exits after several other founding members, including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic, Christian Szegedy and Greg Yang, previously departed.Last week, Musk announced a record-setting, all-stock transaction in which SpaceX, the aerospace and defense juggernaut, acquired xAI, which owns and operates social network X and is the developer of Grok, the embattled AI chatbot and image generator. The deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion post merger, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The co-founder departures and the reorganization this week come as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year and while xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S.The probes are looking into whether xAI violated regional regulations after Grok enabled mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time. WATCH: Calculating Elon Musk's wealth: Here's what to knowwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday passed a resolution disapproving of President Donald Trump's tariffs against Canada, a blow to Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and a rare Republican rebuke of the president's signature economic policy.The resolution cleared the House 219-211, with several Republicans crossing the aisle to support it. One Democrat, Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, voted against the measure.The tariff resolution, introduced by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., was considered a day after a procedural vote on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.Trump warned Republicans during the vote that there would be consequences for overriding him on tariffs. \"Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!\" Trump posted to his TRUTH social account during the vote. \"TARIFFS have given us Economic and National Security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege.\"The risk was worth it for some Republicans, especially those in swing districts where tariffs are deeply unpopular. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who is retiring at the end of his term and voted for the anti-tariff resolution, told reporters earlier in the day that the White House tried and failed to flip his vote. \"I voted on principle,\" Bacon said of a Tuesday procedural vote that allowed the measure to proceed. \"They were trying to do sweeteners for Nebraska, but I said what about the other 49 states?\" The Democratic side of the House chamber erupted in cheers when the resolution passed.

Kelly, Slotkin for seditious conspiracy: MS Now\"The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump,\" Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. \"Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them.\"The measure now heads to the Senate, which approved similar resolutions last year. \"Congress has spoken with bipartisan clarity: it's time to give Americans relief and end Trump's tariff tax,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"This price-spiking tariff tax is raising costs on everything from groceries prices to energy bills — all because Trump chose chaos over common sense. It's time to deliver relief.\"The vote on Trump's tariffs forced House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.\"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying,\" Bacon posted to X after the Tuesday vote.Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approves Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.\"This is life with a razor-thin majority,\" Johnson said in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business. \"I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world.\"",

    "body": "watch nowJob growth was stronger than expected to start 2026, providing some relief to concerns about the state of the U.S. labor market.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 for January, above the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 55,000, according to seasonally adjusted figures the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. The total also was an improvement over December, which saw a gain of 48,000 after a slight downward revision.The unemployment rate edged lower to 4.3%, below the forecast to stay unchanged at 4.4% from the prior month. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons slipped to 8%, down 0.4 percentage point from December.Markets rose following the news, with stock market futures ticking higher. Treasury yields also posted strong gains.The report, delayed nearly a week by the partial government shutdown that ended Feb. 3, held consistent with a labor market in a low-growth mode, though with only scattered signs of increasing layoffs. January was the best month for payroll growth since December 2024, following a year in which job creation averaged just 15,000 a month.President Donald Trump touted the numbers as the sign of a strong economy, and again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\"GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far.\"In addition to the monthly numbers, the BLS released final benchmark revisions for the period of April 2024 to March 2025. Those numbers saw the initial counts revised lower by a total 898,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was a bit lower than the 911,000 figure for the initial estimate last September but around Wall Street expectations.As has often been the case for the U.S. labor market, health care led job gains in January, adding 82,000 positions. Social assistance also rose, up 42,000 as the two categories were responsible for almost all the net job creation. Construction saw a gain of 33,000 following a year in which the sector saw little increase.Several categories posted losses.Federal government jobs fell by 34,000 as some of those laid off last year through Department of Government Efficiency cuts but accepted deferred resignations fell off the payroll count, the BLS said. Financial activities saw a decline of 22,000. \"It was a January job surge,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The surprisingly strong job gains in January were driven mainly by health care and social assistance. But it is enough to stabilize the job market and send the unemployment rate slightly lower. This is still a largely frozen job market, but it is stabilizing. That's an encouraging sign to start the year, especially after the hiring recession in 2025.\"On wages, average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, 0.1 percentage point higher than expected, and 3.7% annually, in line with the forecast.Wall Street expectations were muted for the report, following a series of other releases showing slow private sector gains, elevated layoff plans and shrinking job openings. Even White House officials, such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, had been tamping down expectations.\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson InvestorsThe prior year featured consistently modest gains and several months of negative growth for payrolls. Every month in 2025 saw negative revisions, even after President Donald Trump sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in early August after he criticized large downward adjustments to the job totals. November also saw a downward revision that took the final number down to 41,000, a cut of 15,000 from the prior estimate.Amid the labor market slowness, a White House crackdown on illegal immigration helped dampen labor demand, while a general climate of uncertainty over tariffs and inflation also pushed businesses into tabling plans for workforce growth.However, the January numbers provide some reason for optimism.While the establishment survey showed more jobs than expected, the household survey was even stronger. Used to calculate the unemployment rate, the survey showed a gain of 528,000 workers for the month as the labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.5%.The data likely solidifies the Federal Reserve staying on hold with interest rates. Futures traders raised bets that the Fed would hold the line at its March meeting, though the expectation is still titled toward a cut in June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.Correction: This story has been updated to correct the month of the jobs report.",

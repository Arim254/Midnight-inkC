    "body": "Dustin Muskovitz, co-founder and chairman at Asana.Stefanie Keenan | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesMeta's co-founder Dustin Moskovitz opened up about the pains of leadership and admitted that 13 years of being a CEO was \"exhausting.\"Moskovitz, one of the original founders of Meta, formerly Facebook, co-founded the social platform in 2004 alongside Mark Zuckerberg, Eduardo Saverin, Chris Hughes, and Andrew McCollum.After leaving Facebook in 2008, he retained a stake of just over 8%, making him a billionaire with a net worth of $12 billion, according to the most recent data from Forbes. He went on to become a co-founder and CEO of work management software platform Asana the same year.Moskovitz announced his departure as Asana's CEO earlier this year and has transitioned into the role of chairman, while retaining an ownership of 53% of the company's outstanding shares between Class A and Class B holdings. The billionaire recently opened up about what it was like to be a CEO at Asana, while also having an introverted personality, on an episode of the Stratechery podcast by Ben Thompson, released on Monday.\"I don't like to manage teams, and it wasn't my intention when we started Asana,\" Moskovitz said during the episode.\"I'd intended to be more of a independent or head of engineering or something again. Then one thing led to another and I was CEO for 13 years and I just found it quite exhausting.\"He added: \"I'm an introvert, I had to just kind of put on this face day after day and then in the beginning I was like, 'Oh, it's going to get easier, the company will get more mature,' and then the world just kept getting more chaotic — the first Trump presidency and the pandemic and all the race stuff, it made it just a lot less of the company building, being a CEO is a lot more reacting to problems and doing this sort of thing.\"Many famous leaders are introvertsVarious notable business leaders have described themselves as being introverts, from Meta's Zuckerberg, to Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Warren Buffett.Susan Cain, author of \"Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\" said introverts are often passed over for leadership positions and thrive more in quieter and less stimulating environments.She said introverts have some hidden traits that can make them well suited for leadership positions, including taking fewer risks, being more creative, and being better at problem solving.Cain said that introverted leaders can be \"slow\" and \"circumspect\" when making decisions which helps them to avoid impulsive or reckless moves.They also tend to seek out solitude more which is \"a real catalyst to creativity,\" according to Cain.\"This two-tier structure of how we view personality leads to a colossal waste of talent, and of energy and of happiness,\" Cain said. \"We need to be adopting much more of a yin and yang approach of balance between the two styles.\"",

    "body": "One quality separates the most successful business owners from all others, according to billionaire Jimmy John Liautaud: They work really, really hard.In that vein, the 61-year-old founder and former chairman of the Jimmy John's sandwich chain doesn't believe in work-life balance, he said in a TikTok video posted by The School of Hardknocks on Oct. 9. \"Work-life balance [for entrepreneurs] is the biggest line of bulls--- that's ever been created,\" he said. \"There's no such thing as work-life balance. When you're going to squeeze lemonade out of horses---, you've got to squeeze really, really hard ... To create something from nothing, there is no such thing.\"Liautaud speaks from experience: Despite graduating second-to-last in his high school class, he created a billion-dollar brand, he said. He launched his first sandwich shop in Charleston, Illinois in 1983, as a 19-year-old with a $25,000 loan from his father — and spent the next 36 years carefully and persistently growing his business, he told the \"American Optimist\" podcast during an October 2024 episode.In his first 10 years of business, for example, Liautaud only opened stores that he operated himself — 10 of them, all in Illinois, he said. From that foundation, he eventually franchised out additional locations across the country. Jimmy John's now has over 2,600 locations across 45 states.In September 2016, Liautaud sold his majority stake in the company, 65% of the business, to Atlanta-based private equity firm Roark Capital Group at a valuation of \"about $3.5 billion,\" he said in the TikTok video. He stepped down as chairman in October 2019, after Roark-owned Inspire Brands acquired the rest of Jimmy John's for an undisclosed sum.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterAs with any business, the sandwich chain's growth path was hardly linear or straightforward, Liautaud noted. In 2002, for example, 70 of the then-200 Jimmy John's locations were struggling to become profitable, he said.His response: Teach the franchise owners a lesson in work ethic, he said. \"I said, 'If you're going to go into the sandwich business, this is 24/7 365. If you're in the cattle business, cattle need to get fed on Sunday. They need to get fed on Christmas day,'\" said Liautaud.\"I started telling people the truth about the business,\" he continued. \"If you're going to do this, you better be ready to be a grinder.\"Liautaud currently has an estimated net worth of $2.4 billion, according to Forbes.Other highly successful entrepreneurs built their businesses using a similar mindset. Bill Gates didn't believe in vacations or weekends during Microsoft's early days, and Elon Musk has been known to occasionally sleep at the office and work throughout the night. Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang works \"from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep,\" he said during a May 2024 interview with Stripe CEO Patrick Collision.Now, some of them opt for more sleep and better time-management. Gates regrets his previous workaholic lifestyle, he told students at Northern Arizona University's commencement ceremony in May 2023.\"Don't wait as long as I did to learn this lesson,\" Gates said. \"Take time to nurture your relationships. To celebrate your successes. And to recover from your losses. Take a break when you need to. Take it easy on the people around you when they need it, too.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Don't feel guilty if you can't make it to your kids' after-school sports practices, says two-time Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach.Leaving your kids with their teammates and coaches — without your supervision — can make them more resilient, conscientious and internally motivated athletes, the former U.S. Women's National Team soccer star said in an Oct. 21 interview on NBC's \"TODAY Show.\" All of those traits can help them grow up to become successful adults, parenting experts say.\"Drop your kids off ... Sit in your car, play on your phone, do whatever you want to do, read a book, go for a walk, but do not go to the practice,\" said Wambach, a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame who now has three step-children of her own. \"This is a time for your kids to play, to not be looking over their shoulders [to see if a parent is watching].\"If a child looks over and sees their parent looking at them on the sideline, it could \"outsource their motivation\" and make them either nervous or overly driven to impress, Wambach said in a Sept. 23 episode of her \"Welcome to the Party\" podcast.Nothing should \"encumber them from trying something new, taking a risk, making a mistake, trying something, being successful,\" said Wambach, adding: \"We want our kids to be self-starters and internally motivated.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterInternally motivated children are more likely to become adults who always strive to do their best, no matter who's watching. Encouraging kids to develop a sense of agency can similarly help them become self-motivated and successful adults, neuropsychologist William Stixrud said in a March 28 episode of the \"Raising Good Humans\" podcast. ″[Your] mission is not to make sure that they turn out a certain way or that they always do well, [but] to help them figure out who they want to be, what kind of life they want and how to create the life that they want,\" said Stixrud. \"So that they can ultimately run their own life before they leave home.\"When you do go to your kids' sports games, don't give them pointers on how to run faster or kick harder, Wambach recommended on her podcast. Instead, \"deemphasize the outcomes of winning or losing and overemphasize the acts of leadership\" by pointing out when they or other players are good teammates.Ask your child, \"What did you see out there today that was a special win that had nothing to do with the score line?\" Wambach said. \"Did you see your teammate cheering? Did you pick up the cones for your coach without being asked?\"Disclosure: NBC and CNBC are divisions of NBCUniversal.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "One in seven people have never spoken to their relatives about their family's health history, according to a recent global study from Bupa, a health insurance company. The survey polled 8,000 adults and 169 health professionals from the UK, Australia, Spain and more.Of the respondents, 30% said having a conversation about family health history had never crossed their minds and 20% said their families don't talk about health openly. \"Even though it's one in seven people, that person is connected to a family who hasn't had those conversations. So in some ways, it's kind of like one in seven families,\" says Sherry Pagoto, a licensed clinical psychologist who was involved in the study.About four in five (79%) of healthcare professionals polled agree that \"more lives could be saved if patients had better knowledge of their family health history,\" according to the study.With the knowledge of genetic health risks, doctors can make informed decisions like screening patients for specific conditions that run in their family, Pagoto says. But patients may not understand the importance of having those conversations or they may be uncomfortable to learn about their health histories, she adds.Another issue is \"not really knowing how to bring it up,\" says Pagoto who is also a professor in the department of Allied Health Sciences at the University of Connecticut. Some people may struggle with how to approach the topic and what to do with the information once they have it.Here are Pagoto's tips for starting the conversation about your genetic health risks with your family, and what she suggests for next steps.6 tips for talking to your family about genetic health risksBelieve that loved ones may be open to the conversation: \"People would be surprised at how open they may find family members to be of talking about themselves,\" Pagoto says. \"Particularly elderly family members.\"Check in with them about how they're currently feeling: Start with what's comfortable by asking, \"How are you feeling today?\" she suggests. You can ask about their most recent check-ups and what they discussed with their doctor.Introduce the topic of your family's health history: You can start the conversation with something like, \"I'd love to know more about any health conditions that you've had because those could run in the family,\" she suggests. Or you can ask what caused the death of specific family members to get more context.Take notes and document the information after: Approach this conversation \"almost like you're constructing this family tree, but of health conditions,\" Pagoto says. Having all of the information in one place makes it easy for you to share it with your doctor or with your siblings or your own children.Get other family members on board: If you speak to your maternal grandmother about that side of your family, maybe you can ask your siblings to speak to your paternal side, she notes. Delegating tasks will make it easier for you to get the knowledge you all need.Share what you learn with the right people: Once you know about your genetic health risks, it's important to share what you've learned with your doctor and your family members. Ask your doctor questions like \"Are there any tests or screenings that we should do for me right now?\" or \"What recommendations do you have for [prevention]?\"Remember that what you learn about your family's health history is only context, and not a prediction of what you can expect in your own future, Pagoto says. \"Your genes are not your fate. They're one part of an equation. Your lifestyle and your health care is a big part of that equation,\" she explains.\"It might actually make you feel more motivated to do these healthy lifestyle behaviors that we sometimes feel like 'I'm not motivated for that' or 'I don't have time for that'. It really pops it up on the top of your priority list.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "When Rick Senko started re-selling used items on eBay, he was \"flat broke\" — a recently unemployed single father who was desperate to earn enough money to support his 5-year-old son.That was 2008, and the first item he sold — a cell phone he bought for $35 on Craigslist and flipped on eBay for $75 — felt like discovering a \"glitch in the Matrix,\" says Senko, now 41 and based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Realizing he could turn a tidy profit by flipping used items online, he went all in. He studied brands and sales trends, exploiting market inefficiencies and often working up to 20 hours a day \"just going to the flea market, going to the thrift store, making relationships, studying my craft, learning, listing [items] every single day,\" he says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to using AI to communicate betterWhat started as a way to make ends meet slowly grew into a reselling empire, bringing in millions of dollars a year in sales as one of eBay's top sellers. In 2023, Senko started a wholesale business called Technsports that sells up to 5,000 items of used clothing per day to other professional resellers. Technsports brought in more than $6.5 million in 2024 revenue, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Technsports is profitable overall, with a profit margin of roughly 50% per item sold, Senko says.\"I have not taken a day off in almost 20 years,\" says Senko. \"It is not lost on me how fortunate I am. But it also took a tremendous amount of work, a tremendous amount of commitment, and a tremendous amount of sacrifice to get from where I came from to now selling millions of dollars per year and living a very, very fortunate life.\"'You don't need a lot of money to start'After becoming a father at age 18, Senko worked as a CVS photography lab supervisor for five years to make ends meet for himself and his son. He attended a vocational school to earn a computer repair certificate, which landed him a better-paying job at Circuit City in Fall 2008.Two weeks later, Circuit City filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Senko found himself out of work and unable to find a new job during the Great Recession. Then, his cellphone broke. \"I didn't have a lot of money, so I went onto eBay to get a pre-owned [phone],\" says Senko.He saw one on eBay listed for $75, and then spotted the same model of phone on Craigslist for $35. It was a \"lightbulb moment\" that seemed too good to be true, he says: \"I would double the money. I would get a phone for free, and then I would get my original $35 back.\"Senko bought the Craigslist phone and sold it on eBay for $70, he says. He used the profits to buy another phone on Craigslist, which he flipped on eBay to double his money again. \"I've been doing that ever since, for almost 20 years. Rinse and repeat,\" says Senko, adding: \"You don't need a lot of money to start. You don't need a lot of knowledge to start. You just need to start.\"He initially focused on electronics — from phones to video games, broken or functional, any low-priced item that he could resell within days, he says. As he learned more about which items sold better than others — and where to find in-demand stock — his earnings grew considerably, topping $100,000 in 2010, he says.Around that time, he began shifting his focus to pre-owned clothing, which requires far less \"customer support,\" he says. \"A T-shirt is not going to break in the mail.\" Clothing required a level of research that Senko was willing to do, he notes: While most people understand that electronics can be valuable, \"not everybody knows a particular Polo Ralph Lauren shirt could be worth more [than a gaming console] ... Oftentimes those [clothes] are discarded in a pile on the floor at the flea market.\"Senko started leaving home before dawn and spending most of each day picking through piles of used clothing at South Florida thrift shops, consignment shops, flea markets and garage sales, he says. Reselling gave him freedom and control over his schedule, and tapped into his competitive desire to win at all costs, he adds.'I get after it every single day'Over time, Senko built relationships with sellers at flea markets and thrift stores to ensure he got the first crack at picking through new stock. He listed and sold roughly 250 items per day, or tens of thousands of products each year, and hired up to five contract employees at a time to help him photograph items, list them online and handle shipping.In 2023, he brought in more than $2.5 million in eBay sales, documents show — up from $500,000 in 2017. But he had a feeling that he'd hit a ceiling of how many items he could list and sell per day, he says.So, that same year, Senko decided to switch up his business model. Rather than buying select pieces and selling them each individually online, he began buying clothes in bulk and selling them wholesale to other resellers willing to spend time carefully sifting through each batch. Clients sometimes buy up to 1,000 items per week, he says.\"They process it, they fulfill it and they sell it one at a time on eBay,\" Senko explains, adding: \"The most valuable asset for my business became the inventory. I'm more profitable selling more items at a smaller margin.\"The lesser time commitment also helped Senko fulfill a promise to his wife, who he met during his brief time at Circuit City, he says: that they'd work as hard as they could until his son graduated high school, and then pursue an early retirement. \"[We wanted to] be able to take a 50-year vacation,\" says Senko.He and his wife finally took time off last year to travel the country, visiting places like New York, California and Las Vegas. \"We are starting to enjoy the fruits of the labor,\" he says. But he's reluctant to actually retire, he notes: \"To say that I am mentally on the 50-year vacation? Not even close.\"Senko says it's difficult for him to shut off his competitive drive, especially when he knows there is money to be made and that he has the means and expertise to do it. And if he keeps working on Technsports, he could try to ensure that his current level of financial stability lasts for the rest of his life, he says.\"I get after it every single day. Because when you unlock [that] ability to multiply money, to take $5, put it onto eBay and sell something and get $25 back, how in the world can you rest?\" he says. \"Did I work a lot? Absolutely ... I needed to grow the business. And, ultimately, I needed to be the best.\"Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Timothy Mellon, seen outside an inspection train during a property tour in 1981. Exact date and location unknown.AP PhotoThe mystery donor whose $130 million contribution is meant to pay U.S. military troops during the government shutdown is Timothy Mellon, an heir to a renowned Gilded Age banking family, The New York Times reported Saturday.But Mellon's donation works out to only about $100 per service member. It costs nearly $6.4 billion to pay U.S. troops every two weeks.And using his money might run afoul of federal law, according to the Times, which cited two people familiar with the matter in identifying the billionaire railroad magnate as the donor.When President Donald Trump announced the donation at the White House on Thursday, he did not identify the man by name, but described him as a \"great patriot\" and a \"friend of mine.\"\"And he's a big supporter of mine,\" Trump told reporters on Friday night. \"He's a wonderful man, and he doesn't want publicity.\"Mellon has an estimated net worth close to $1 billion, according to Forbes.But in an email to the news outlet in 2024, Mellon wrote, \"Billionaire NOT! ... Never have been, never will be.\"Mellon's contribution aims to help cover the cost of U.S. military personnel's salaries and benefits as the federal shutdown drags on.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe donation might have violated the Antideficiency Act, which bars federal agencies from spending funds that have not been appropriated by Congress, the Times reported.Mellon's gift is also unlikely to go far in offsetting the cost of military pay.There are more than 1.3 million troops in the active-duty military, and the Trump administration's 2025 budget included a request of around $600 billion in military compensation, the Times reported.Mellon, whose grandfather, Andrew Mellon, was one of the longest-serving Treasury secretaries, is a longtime Trump donor.He contributed $50 million to Trump's super PAC during the 2024 election cycle, one of the biggest single donations ever publicly shared, The Times reported.A spokesman for Sen. Chris Coons told NBC News that the Delaware Democrat is concerned about allowing anonymous donors to fund government spending.\"Using anonymous donations to fund our military raises troubling questions of whether our own troops are at risk of literally being bought and paid for by foreign powers,\" the spokesman said.Read the complete Times report here.",

    "body": "European consumers are facing higher prices when going to the supermarket.Andia | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesRelations between the the U.K. and European Union are arguably at the best they've been since the Brexit vote in 2016 but there's an ongoing cold front between the neighbors over a ban on continental cheese and meat imports.In April, Britain banned people from bringing all dairy products and a range of meats from the EU into the country for personal consumption, saying the prohibition was needed in order to prevent the possible spread of Foot and Mouth Disease among British livestock after outbreaks in Europe earlier this year.British holidaymakers travelling to the continent were warned not to bring home foodstuffs such as cheese, chorizo, Serrano ham or sandwiches containing any of a wide range of banned products, even if they were sealed or bought in duty-free shops at airports. The ban extends to cakes, biscuits and chocolate containing a high level of unprocessed dairy products or fresh cream.Those found with banned items were told they'd have to surrender them at the border, or have them seized and destroyed. Anyone flouting the restriction could receive a £5,000 fine (around $6,700), the government said.The Brits' ban did not apply to commercial food imports because they undergo more stringent biosecurity requirements, such as heat treatment and veterinary health certificates, the U.K. said.Cheese shops in Paris — and particularly those situated around the Gare du Nord where Eurostar trains travel to and from the U.K. — say the restrictions have hit sales to a vital customer base.\"Tourists are very important, and especially English people,\" Alexandre Vilaca, founder and manager of Fromagerie Ferdinand in Paris, told CNBC, noting that when he opened his cheese shop eight years ago, he had chosen the Gare du Nord neighborhood for its international visitors.\"These past few years, it was very important to have English clients. We vacuum-packed the cheese so they could travel easily to the U.K., and we started to have regular clients who used to pass by our shop in order to bring some gifts to the families and friends ... But a few months ago, clients told me that it was forbidden to bring cheese back home,\" he said.\"And it's had a huge impact on our sales to U.K. clients,\" he added.A cheesemonger working in a cheese store in Paris, France, in 2022. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVilaca said the ban was largely nonsensical, given that the French authorities were \"very, very strict\" about sanitary controls and regular checks on cheese producers, their products and their distribution. English cheese producers Vilaca worked with were also upset by the ban, he noted.\"We are proud when clients take home some souvenirs, maybe some wine, some cheese — a bit of France in their bags, so to speak. So we don't understand [the ban], we are quite upset and it is bad news because, in terms of business, it's not great.\"Why the ban?Temporary bans on continental food products entering or exiting the U.K., or vice versa, are nothing new and it's worth noting that the EU introduced a permanent ban on Brits bringing animal and dairy products, for personal consumption, into the bloc following Brexit for the same reasons: to prevent the spread of diseases.Foot and Mouth Disease, or FMD, is a serious concern for a close-knit continent like the EU as it can spread very quickly, particularly given the region's interconnected agricultural market and multiple transmission routes.FMD does not pose a risk to humans but is highly contagious to cattle, sheep and pigs, with the disease able to spread rapidly among livestock, with devastating consequences.Outbreaks of FMD were confirmed in Germany, Hungary and Slovakia earlier this year but they were contained after the countries' rapidly implemented animal health control measures in the affected establishments, including the culling of livestock and protection and surveillance zones.Not taking any chances: Cars pass through at a disinfection checkpoint set up on the border crossing between Hungary and Slovakia on March 28, 2025 in Medvedov, Slovakia. The country declared a state of emergency after several cases of foot and mouth disease in the region, including a new outbreak detected in Hungary, close to the Slovak border near Bratislava.Robert Nemeti | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThose emergency measures were lifted after Germany was declared free of FMD in April, and Hungary and Slovakia have seen no new outbreaks since April.In late July, the U.K. government's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) said in an assessment that \"while the incursions of FMD into Europe earlier in the year were undoubtedly concerning, there have been no further reports since April, suggesting that the situation in Hungary and Slovakia is under control.\"While the report's authors said the risk of incursion of FMD to the U.K. was, in July, was considered a 'low (rare but can occur)' risk, the report cautioned that FMD can remain undetected for several months.The U.K. government told CNBC that, despite the containment of European FMD outbreaks, the ongoing ban on personal imports of cheese and many meats aimed to protect British farmers and U.K. food security.\"Earlier this year, we took immediate action to ban personal imports of meat and dairy from Europe after a wave of foot and mouth cases. We are also investing £1 billion [$1.3 billion] in a new National Biosecurity Centre to boost our world leading facilities and protect our farmers, food supply and economy,\" a spokesman for Defra told CNBC.\"We will do whatever it takes to protect our farmers from animal disease,\" the spokesperson added.Almost six months into the ban, however, and questions are being asked whether the ongoing restrictions are excessive, and no longer necessary.Defra stressed its not alone in implementing the current restrictions, and is only doing what the EU has been doing for several years, since Brexit, as standard practice.Asked when the ban might be lifted, given that cases of FMD are now contained on the continent, Defra said the government's \"FMD response remains under constant review\" and that it will \"retain restrictions in England while personal imports of affected products pose biosecurity risks to Great Britain.\"Hard lessonsThe U.K. and EU have learned the hard way what an outbreak of FMD can cause.Cows of Breier Cattle Farm are pictured at a farm near Budapest on March 11, 2025. Hungary detected its first foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in over 50 years on March 7, 2025, at a cattle farm near the Slovak border. The country's food safety agency, introduced extremely strict measures to prevent the further spread of the disease, including a ban on the movement of susceptible species. Ferenc Isza | Afp | Getty ImagesThe 2001 epidemic, which first broke out in the U.K. before spreading to the continent, had a devastating impact on the British farming community with over six million animals having to be destroyed and estimated to have cost the U.K.'s public and private sector a combined £8 billion.In the EU, four million animals were destroyed and the outbreak is estimated to have cost member states 2.7 billion euros in terms of eradication measures and compensation to farmers.The U.K.'s last outbreak, in 2007, only affected eight farms but was estimated to have cost £147 million overall, due to large-scale livestock movement bans.",

Gabriela Bhaskar | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Advanced Micro Devices jumped nearly 8% on Friday following a report that IBM can utilize the company's chips to run a quantum computing error correction algorithm.IBM shares gained about 8% and headed for their best day since January.Reuters reported on Friday that a paper will publish next week showing that IBM can run a quantum error correction algorithm on AMD's field-programmable gate array chips. An IBM spokesman confirmed the report to CNBC.In August, the two companies announced an agreement to develop quantum computing capabilities and integrate technologies. IBM said it plans to debut a \"large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer\" by 2029.IBM called the new development a \"milestone in our clear path\" toward the 2029 projection.\"Designing and implementing a way to do this at scale, and without requiring expensive GPU clusters, is a significant achievement to scaling useful quantum computers,\" the company said in a statement.AMD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.The technology utilizes quantum mechanics to address problems that traditional computers are unable to solve. Technology giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon are also racing to develop quantum computing.Last year, Microsoft rolled out its first quantum computing chip, while Google launched its breakthrough chip named WIllow. A top quantum executive at Google told CNBC in March that the technology was \"five years out from a real breakout.\"The various announcements have brought renewed interest to the quantum space, boosting stocks like D-Wave Quantum, Rigetti Computing and IonQ, which all climbed on Friday.The Trump administration on Thursday refuted a report that it was negotiating stakes in quantum companies.Correction: This story has been updated after Reuters corrected its report about what IBM will be able to do with AMD's chips.WATCH: Commerce Department denies it is currently in talks for stakes in quantum companieswatch now",

But for now, many services are on hold.\"Because of the shutdown and cuts, core disability services that people rely on every week are either paused, reduced or running with unpaid labor,\" said Timothy Miles, the organization's director and board liaison.As the standoff in Washington drags on, many nonprofits have lost access to federal grants and must make tough decisions about what aid they can offer and for how long.At the same time, the shutdown has put some federal assistance, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, at risk just when the need for help is increasing. With hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contract workers furloughed and without pay, that adds to the strain on nonprofits that are needed to help fill the gap.\"Nonprofits are on the frontlines of serving communities, but a government shutdown makes it harder for them to fulfill their missions,\" said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, an industry association. \"The longer this shutdown lasts, the more people and communities are left without the critical services they depend on,\" she said.The current government shutdown is now the second-longest federal funding lapse in U.S. history.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHere's the inflation breakdown for September 2025 — in one chartInherited IRAs have a key change for 2025.

The organization has a workforce of seven and serves hundreds of people in the area.'Real long-term consequences'The longer the shutdown continues, the harder it will be for nonprofits to continue serving their communities, Saadian said.  In many cases, if an organization lays off staff or puts a program or service on pause, it can be difficult to resume operations once the shutdown ends and funding kicks in.\"Once those organizations suffer those kinds of impacts, there can be real long-term consequences, because they've lost that infrastructure, they've lost that staff,\" Saadian said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Saying \"no\" is essential in parenting. But setting limits shouldn't start and end with that one word.As a certified child life specialist and licensed therapist, I know that saying \"no\" is meant to help kids feel safe, supported, and understood. I often help kids understand: \"Your parents aren't saying 'no' to control you, they're saying 'no' to support you.\"Boundaries deepen trust and cooperation over time. When we say \"no\" with calm, consistency, and care, we're setting limits. But we're also teaching emotion regulation, self-control, and connection. These are crucial skills our kids will carry far beyond childhood. Here's how to say no in ways that build connection instead of conflict. Turn 'no' into a teachable momentThink about a curious one-year-old who's putting sand in their mouth, pulling the dog's tail, or standing on a chair. If we just say \"no\" or \"stop\" without explaining, we might leave them feeling confusion, shame, or doubt.Instead we might say \"not in the mouth,\" \"gentle hands,\" or \"sit down.\" It's still a boundary but it teaches and guides them in a way they can learn and understand. When kids aren't adhering to limits, they might need firmer boundaries. But those can still help them figure out what to do, rather than just what not to do. For example: \"No helmet, no bike.\" \"It's not safe to ride without a helmet, so I'm going to put the bike away for now.\" \"As soon as you put your helmet on, you can ride your bike.\"Explain the 'why'Kids crave reasoning to make sense of things. Limits work best when kids understand them. With my two young children, I always lead with limits related to safety and kindness. This helps me stay mindful of when and why I'm saying \"no\" in the first place, and whether or not certain limits are negotiable. Recently, my five-year-old asked for emotional support while I was driving. I said, \"I can't hold your hand when I'm driving because it's not safe. But as soon as we get home, I can give you a hug.\" It was still a \"no,\" but it prioritized connection and safety. When kids know why, they're more likely to accept the limit even if they don't like it. This can teach them perspective-taking. For screens, helmets, and more, it might also mean explaining that \"every family has different rules, and these are ours.\" Offer control through choicesWhen kids hear the word \"no,\" they immediately feel stripped of autonomy and control — often when they're trying to explore their world and build their identity.Pair limits with choices. That can sound like:\"The park isn't a choice right now, you can choose to play in the backyard or in the basement.\"\"Choose one more thing to do and then it's time to leave.\"When kids struggle to decide, you can always resort to: \"You can choose or I can choose for you.\"Kids will feel empowered by being able to make a choice within the boundaries you've clearly set. Be consistent Toddlers test every limit, every day. And it doesn't stop after toddlerhood. It's a sign of healthy development, and it looks different at different ages and stages.This is how kids learn what's safe and where the boundaries are. When limits change easily, kids push harder. When limits are consistent, they learn to trust and expect them.Our job as parents is to communicate consistently, calmly, and clearly even when kids melt down or fight back. It teaches them that their world is safe and predictable, even when it's upsetting, and shows them unwavering support in the face of challenges.Repair when you react Sometimes we shout \"no!\" instinctively in moments of stress or fear, like when a child is running toward the street.It's natural to react that way, but it's essential to follow up with an explanation and perhaps even an apology. When my daughter recently tugged on a necklace that's already broken twice, I added: \"I'm worried it will break. It's special to me and costs money to fix.\" She said, \"I'm sorry mama. It was an accident. I won't do it again.\"Repairing and explaining after an emotional \"no\" can teach kids about accountability and empathy in a relationship and demonstrate reflection and correction.Stay firm as they get olderAs kids grow and develop, boundaries may look and sound different but the underlying message is the same.A \"no\" to going to the park after school might sound like, \"I hear you, but that's not an option today. We already have plans.\" Similarly, when it's time to end an activity: \"We're all done now\" or \"It's time to go home.\" You can even validate their feelings while staying firm: \"It's okay to be upset, but it's not going to change the plans. I'm right here with you.\"These honest conversations around limits teach kids that boundaries and connection can exist together — a lesson that will serve them through every stage of life. Kelsey Mora is Certified Child Life Specialist and Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor who provides custom support, guidance, and resources to parents, families, and communities impacted by medical conditions, trauma, grief, and everyday life stress.

    "body": "There are nearly 4 million health and personal care aides in the U.S.In fact, health and personal care aides were the most common job Americans held as of May 2024, earning an annual median salary of $34,000, according to a CNBC Make It analysis of the latest data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Other common occupations held by Americans include retail salespeople, registered nurses, customer service representatives and fast food and counter workers, though the results vary slightly by geography.The most popular job in Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city by population, involves manual labor. Workers who move freight, stock, luggage or perform general labor tasks have an annual median wage of $40,030 in the Windy City. In Los Angeles, manual freight and stock movers are paid a median annual salary of $39,200, and in Phoenix they bring in a marginally higher annual median salary of $39,630.Of the five most common jobs in America's most populous cities, registered nurses and general and operations managers bring in the highest salaries.

    "body": "An American Airlines Airbus A321 taxis at San Diego International Airport as a United Airlines airplane departs on August 24, 2024 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFORT WORTH, Texas — American Airlines started pouring customers Champagne Bollinger in its top-tier lounges and cabins this fall. But at headquarters, it's not time to celebrate — yet.American has fallen behind large rivals Delta Air Lines and United Airlines in the post-Covid luxury travel boom that has taken Seoul spa vacations and 40th birthday bashes abroad out of the chat and armed millions of consumers with high-end rewards credit cards.In the first nine months of this year, Delta made $3.8 billion and United made $2.3 billion. American made $12 million. That means that American, which offers more flights than any other airline, according to OAG, accounted for just 2% of the profit the biggest three U.S. carriers generated so far in 2025.American ranked last in a J.D. Power's North American airline customer satisfaction ranking this year. The carrier has also been working to undo damage from a failed business-travel sales strategy.And American, which branded itself the \"on-time machine\" in the 1980s, in the first half of this year ranked ninth out of 10 airlines for on-time arrivals, according to the Department of Transportation.The airline is trying to change all of that and uplift its brand after strategy errors, some skittishness about spending, and at times being late to capitalize on industry trends, like travelers' willingness to pay up to sit in bigger seats, according to current and former executives and industry watchers.To make that happen, CEO Robert Isom will have to rally American's more than 130,000 employees around the airline's plans and win over both customers and investors. American's stock is down 20% this year through Friday's close, compared with modest gains posted by Delta and United.Last week, however, some investors noticed a change within American, whose fourth-quarter profit forecast surpassed Wall Street analysts' expectations. Shares rose more than 16%, their biggest weekly percentage gain in almost a year.\"You're going to have a three-month period where you have to be crystal clear on your story,\" said Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham, referring to the airline's leaders.The bigger changes are going to take time and money.\"American hasn't been paying attention to the customer for the longest time,\" said Henry Harteveldt, founder of the Atmosphere Research Group travel consulting firm. \"I believe there is the beginning of a meaningful turnaround … but a large airline like American is not going to be turned around overnight.\"'Everyone felt it was price and schedule, and that's it'American has tasked Heather Garboden — who has worked for more than two decades at American and US Airways, including roles in the cargo and finance departments, and now is chief customer officer — with leading a lot of a nose-to-tail revamp of the nearly century-old airline.\"Fifteen years ago, I don't think in the industry, there was much of a belief that customer experience … really drove a differentiation between airlines. I think everyone felt it was price and schedule, and that's it,\" she said in an interview. \"That has changed, and we understand that.\"American fell behind with both retailing fares and technology compared with large U.S. rivals. At Delta, the most profitable U.S. airline, its executives were early to notice how customers were paying up for pricier first-class seats, precious real estate it and other airlines used to give away to frequent flyers as free upgrades. Now, offering buy-ups is more common among all three, and American is looking for more ways to sell those seats and to make sure its planes have enough of them to offer.One challenge for American has been that it was last of the big three airlines to complete a mega merger in 2013 when it combined with US Airways, while Delta and United had years-long head starts to get through their integrations and improve their products.New lounges, coffee and suitesGarboden spent much of her career in the finance departments and said it's tough to provide that team with the return-on-investment of something like Champagne but that it's still important.\"Customer experience, it's not just Champagne. It's not just a nice seat. It's not just having the best lounge,\" she said. \"It's the whole holistic view of it, and from end to end, [how] we want it to feel.\"Including new aircraft, American expects its capital spending to total $3.8 billion this year, and rise to about $4.5 billion next year, the carrier said Thursday. It said it has nearly $37 billion in total debt, and plans to cut that down by about at least $2 billion before 2028.One example of how things have changed: American's management team nearly a decade ago decided to remove seat-back screens from its aircraft, saving money on the equipment (and the fuel-sucking weight they add to the plane) because at the time they said customers would likely use their own mobile phones, tablets or laptop to watch entertainment.United, some of whose senior leadership team, including its chief executive, Scott Kirby, came from American, has done the opposite and is in the process of adding thousands of screens to narrow-body planes both new and old, including Bluetooth technology for wireless headphones.American might be changing its tune. \"I think of where the technology was a decade ago, and where it can be today, or even a few years from today,\" Garboden said. \"Hopefully the complexity is less.\"An seatback on an American Airlines Boeing 737.Leslie Josephs/CNBCAmerican is working to make its website and app better, with features like a way to toggle between paying for tickets with cash or miles, Garboden said, among other revamps that executives hope will drive sales — and paid upgrades. Another goal: using artificial intelligence and allowing customers to search for vacation themes, such as \"best wine tasting in spring\" instead of searching for flights between cities, she said.American is also in the middle of a push to refresh many of its longer-haul premium cabins and announced on Thursday that it will refurbish its Boeing 777-200 aircraft with a new business class, adding to an upgrade, first unveiled three years ago, of its larger Boeing 777-300 jets.\"That is a big deal for us because extending the lives of those and putting those into service really gives us a capital spending holiday in terms of fleet replacement,\" Isom said in an earnings call with analysts on Thursday. \"So it's a win-win-win for our customers, for our company and, most certainly, our investors.\"Those plans are made years in advance, and high demand, supply chain problems and long certification wait times have delayed plusher cabins, exasperating airline executives.On Thursday, American's first Airbus A321 XLR, a long-range narrow-body plane it plans to fly across the country and, eventually to Europe, touched down at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. On all three aircraft types, it will do without first class in favor of a larger business class. For flights over the Atlantic it can cost $600 in the back and well over $6,000 up front.The new suites that feature sliding doors, larger screens and a palette of dark browns, navy blue and tan, started flying this year on some of American's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, subset P, for \"premium.\"American Airlines new business-class suite.American AirlinesMeanwhile, the union that represents American's attendants is pushing the carrier add more crew members on board to cater to the larger business-class cabins.\"Staff your airplanes the way a world-class airline should — and deliver a competitive onboard experience in every cabin,\" the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, the pilots' union and unions at the carrier said in a message on Friday that was sent to staff but directed at the carrier, targeting the airline's underperformance compared with rivals.American's updates even have it rethinking beverages throughout the plane. The airline signed a coffee provider deal with Italy's Lavazza recently, and to test out the brews, it brought airplane water to its headquarters in Fort Worth so staff could evaluate what it would taste like brewed on board. Lavazza made the cut.watch nowThe airline on Thursday named Nat Pieper as is chief commercial officer, a nearly three-decade airline veteran who's worked at Alaska Airlines and Delta and who Isom described as \"exactly the kind of leader we want at American.\" American fired its former CCO, Vasu Raja, last year after his business-travel strategy backfired and sparked outrage from travel agencies.There are signs of progress.\"Exiting this year, we expect to have fully recovered the revenue share that was lost by our prior sales and distribution strategy,\" Isom said Thursday.American also just inked a new credit card deal with Citi and last week said it would introduce a new mid-tier card, with a $350 annual fee.One-time pioneer, new challengesAmerican Airlines was an industry leader for decades. It was the first to launch a frequent flyer program, AAdvantage. Loyalty programs, which in large part make money from selling frequent flyer miles to banks, have now become the lifeblood of many airlines.The airline this year announced new measures to improve reliability. One change: five additional minutes of boarding time. An American spokeswoman said that helps avoid bottlenecks and last-minute gate-checked bags, which she said are down 25% since May 1.watch nowSome of American's challenges are fairly recent. A federal judge in 2023 blocked American's regional tie-up with JetBlue Airways, leaving it without a partner in key, wealthy markets like Boston and New York, where United and Delta had made inroads.United this year scooped up a partnership with JetBlue that allows customers to earn and burn miles on each others airline, but stops short of coordinating schedules or routes. It took effect on Thursday, as American was reporting its third-quarter results.American dominates its fortress hubs in Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, profitable operations, though it has fallen behind in the Northeast. Other companies have looked to the Sun Belt for growth as the population there grew.United and Delta executives have credited some of their success to having lots of flights in big coastal hubs with affluent travelers, though United has also built up flying in key markets like Denver, Houston and Chicago.'Generational lead'An American Airlines Airbus A321-231 airplane taxis to depart from San Diego International Airport to Dallas at sunset on November 22, 2024 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesWhile American has been reluctant to make big investments, United's CEO Kirby earlier this month told investors that the airline is plowing more than $1 billion a year into improving customer experience.United recently started flying planes with free Wi-Fi provided by SpaceX's Starlink, following Delta and JetBlue in making the service complimentary. American plans to roll out complimentary Wi-Fi next year for most of its fleet.United said such investments take years.\"We have built up a generational lead on this front,\" United's chief commercial officer, Andrew Nocella, said in an interview, adding that new products are coming in the next few years. (He declined to provide details.) \"We think it's substantial, and I don't want to give an inch of that ground up, no matter what our competitors do to innovate over the next decade.\"Some customers, however, continue to value the convenience American offers them, and have remained loyal.Todd Bryan, 41, who has Executive Platinum status on American, said he chooses the carrier in large part because it has the most frequencies out of where he lives, in Fayetteville, Arkansas.The 41-year-old sales account manager who works in the consumer packaged goods industry, said he gets upgraded on most of his flights, but he has noticed that American has been more aggressive about offering buy-ups with cash or miles.Even though he's usually at the top of the list, he now considers taking the offer instead of gambling on a free upgrade on personal trips if \"it feels cheap enough that I assume someone else would buy it too.\"",

One in three condo resales between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold at a loss, according to the report. When including inflation, transaction costs and renovations, the share of losses by condo sellers is likely even higher, according to real estate analysts.While the data didn't include co-ops, analysts say co-op prices have generally fared the same or slightly worse than condos.\"For the last decade, Manhattan has essentially been moving sideways,\" said Jonathan Miller, CEO of Miller Samuel, the appraisal and real estate research firm.The long-term price weakness in Manhattan stands in stark contrast to much of the country, where home prices are up substantially since the pandemic, creating a widespread affordability crisis. Only 2% of home sellers nationally who purchased homes before the pandemic are at risk of selling at a loss, according to Redfin.Manhattan is still among the most expensive markets in the country, especially on a per-square-foot basis. The median price for Manhattan sales in the third quarter was $1.2 million, while the average is just under $2 million, according to Miller Samuel and Douglas Elliman. Yet over the longer term, an analysis of resales finds that the timing of purchases in Manhattan typically matters more than location.Condo owners who bought before 2010 have fared the best. The median gains for those in that cohort who sold over roughly the past year were between 29% and 45%, according to the Brown Harris report. Prices started to rise after the financial crisis, peaking in 2016. That means for those who bought between 2011 and 2015, the sale gains in the past year were modest, around 11%.The biggest losers were those who bought after 2016. Half of the buyers who bought between 2016 and 2020 sold at a loss over the surveyed period. Among those who bought between 2021 and 2024, the gains were slim – although some buyers who got deals during the depths of the Covid downturn in late 2020 and early 2021 may fare better.Adding in other costs of buying, selling and ownership would further add to the losses. Transaction costs in Manhattan can range from 6% to 10%, according to brokers. Renovations and improvements also aren't counted in the losses, nor are maintenance fees or taxes. Adjusting for inflation would also increase the losses and lower returns.Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh, co-director of the Paul Milstein Center for Real Estate at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University, said inflation has increased 36% over the past decade.\"So if I had invested in a Manhattan condo in September 2015 (close to the peak) and sold it in August 2025 for the same nominal price, a 0% nominal return, I actually lost 36% in real terms,\" he said. \"This is surprising since many people think of real estate as a good inflation hedge.\"He noted that the Case-Shiller national home price index went up 89% in the 10 years between September 2015 and August 2025, \"a lot better than in NYC and also far higher than the 36% inflation.\"The reasons for Manhattan's \"lost decade\" in condo prices are as varied as they are disputed. The cap on state and local tax deductions that began in 2018 put pressure on prices and demand, as did a 2019 rent law. The migration of some higher earners to Florida during Covid also added to real estate fears, although the population and demand quickly rebounded.The one exception to the trend was the top of the market. Those who bought and sold apartments for $10 million or more made double-digit profits, no matter when they initially bought.Brokers and analysts say the increased concentration of wealth at the top, rising stock markets and ceaseless demand from those who are less affected by economic and market cycles has powered continued gains in the luxury market.\"The higher end has fared better over the decade, especially in, let's say, the top 4% of the market,\" Miller said. \"The reason is Wall Street and financial markets. And the ability to buy in cash, independent of interest rates.\"Two thirds of the apartment deals done in the third quarter were done in cash, Miller said, far above the historical average of around 53% and showing the continued dependence of the Manhattan market on wealthy buyers who don't need mortgages.In a market defined by frequent ups and downs, brokers say the current upswing presents an opportunity for both buyers and sellers.\"I'm bullish and have a very positive outlook for New York real estate,\" said Jared Antin, executive director at Brown Harris Stevens and a co-author of the report. \"While some people may have lost money on the deals [over the decade], the losses were negligible. It speaks to the blue chip nature of the Manhattan market. Does everyone want to make money on their real estate? Of course. But this market is incredibly stable.\"Sellers who bought during the dip in 2020 and early 2021 could also see profits when they start to sell, Antin said.Still, with median prices hovering near all-time highs and uncertainty around the upcoming mayoral election, many potential buyers prefer to stay on the sidelines and rent, even if they can afford to buy. The number of households in New York City making more than $1 million a year who are renting more than doubled between 2019 and 2023, to 5,661, according to a report from RentCafe.What's more, signed contracts for high-end apartments — priced at $4 million or more — fell 39% in September, according to Olshan Realty, following increases in August and July. Brokers blame a rapid decline in inventory and lack of new supply from condo developments rather than a decline in demand or fears that Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, would become the next mayor of New York City.\"There certainly is a downside risk to policy,\" Miller said. \"But as we've seen in the past, those fears are usually overblown.\"",

Starboard has taken a total of 162 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.13% versus 14.24% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Starboard announced a nearly 5% position in Fluor and stated their intention to unlock value from the company's ~39% holding in NuScale Power, which represents more than 60% of the company's market capitalization, including through a potential separation.Behind the scenesFluor delivers integrated engineering, procurement, construction, and project management services, spanning a diversified set of end markets. Historically, the EPCM market was a highly competitive landscape that led to heavy risk taking, where growth was often prioritized over discipline and profitability. For Fluor, as well as much of the industry, this led to management aggressively increasing their backlog of higher-risk lump-sum and guaranteed minimum contracts, leading to execution risks, thin margins and cost overruns. Ultimately, this industry-wide shift caused many companies to scale back their construction efforts or even enter bankruptcy, and Fluor was no exception, with the company's share price falling below $4 in March 2020.However, this started to change when the company appointed David Constable as CEO at the start of 2021. Under his leadership, Fluor immediately pivoted to lower-risk reimbursable projects, growing from 45% of its backlog to 80%, while exposure to loss-making legacy projects have declined from $1.8 billion to $558 million today, materially reducing its risk profile. Additionally, while largely associated with legacy energy projects, the company has levered into faster growing markets within its urban solutions segment, now 73% of its backlog compared to 37% in fiscal year 2021. As a result, even with this derisking effort, Fluor was still able to maintain a steady backlog and achieve meaningful EBITDA growth, a 14% compound annual growth rate from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal 2024, with analysts projecting a ~9% CAGR from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2028. With many of the large construction and EPCM players having exited the market, Fluor's operational turnaround has allowed it to come out the other side of this turmoil on top, now operating in a duopoly of global end-to-end EPCM players with Bechtel, while the construction market has grown rapidly, now over $918 billion. As a result of this successful operational overhaul, the market currently values Fluor at 8.9 time its enterprise value to calendar year 2027 estimates for consensus EBITDA, in between its EPCM (13x) and legacy construction peers (6x). So, Fluor appears to be a great business with a great management team operating in a duopoly in a growing industry that is fairly valued with a $6.7 billion enterprise value. However, Fluor also owns a 39% stake in NuScale, a publicly traded small modular nuclear reactor company. Fluor invested in NuScale more than a decade ago, and its $30 million early investment played a pivotal in NuScale becoming the first U.S.-listed SMR company, and the only company of its kind with U.S. Nuclear Reactor Commission design approval. As global power demand continues to rise, particularly alongside the data center boom, nuclear generation will be vital, and SMRs will play an essential role in providing energy to meet this growth. As a result, Fluor's investment in NuScale has been highly lucrative – valued at approximately $4.3 billion ($3.4 billion post tax). That's more than half Fluor's current enterprise value. If you were to back out the NuScale stake from Fluor's valuation, then Fluor's enterprise value would drop to $3.3 billion, implying an extremely depressed discount of just 4.6x, with peers trading from 6 to 13 times. Starboard has amassed a nearly 5% position in Fluor and is urging management to unlock the value from its NuScale holdings. Starboard believes that Fluor has multiple paths to monetize its remaining NuScale stake. These options include simply selling their position through open-market sales, an exchange offer or a mandatory exchangeable bond, with proceeds potentially funding a large share buyback, which would be highly accretive to Fluor's EPS, especially at its currently depressed valuation. Alternatively, Starboard has proposed a tax-free spinoff of Fluor's NuScale position, which could trigger a similar rerating of the core business while providing Fluor shareholders with the option to retain their exposure to NuScale's long-term potential. Thus, assuming Fluor maintains an 8.9x EBITDA multiple, which still could be improved upon given its discount to EPCM peers, the rerating that could come from this separation could yield over 200% of upside. Starboard is a very experienced activist and also has a history in this industry. In June 2019, Starboard engaged another construction player, AECOM, where over the ensuing multiyear engagement, AECOM refreshed its board, appointed a new CEO, exited self-perform construction, and divested management services. This became one of Starboard's most lucrative engagements in its history, returning 147% over its 13D filling versus 26% for the Russell 2000. But more importantly, this is when they met David Constable for the first time. Constable is the executive chairman of Fluor, and until February, was its CEO. So, we expect that the mutual respect between Starboard and Constable will be conducive to an amicable, constructive relationship and beneficial to shareholders.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "The headquaters of US auto company General Motos (GM) in Detroit, Michigan.Uli Deck | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesDETROIT – General Motors laid off more than 200 salaried employees on Friday, as the automaker continues to reevaluate its businesses and cut costs to boost profits.The impacted employees were largely Computer-Aided Design, or CAD, engineers who worked at the company's global tech campus in metro Detroit, according to GM.\"We're restructuring our design engineering team to strengthen our core architectural design engineering capabilities,\" GM said in an emailed statement. \"As a result, a number of CAD execution roles have been eliminated. We recognize the efforts and accomplishments of the impacted team members, and we thank them for their contributions.\"GM declined to comment on the number of employees affected, but a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC that it was more than 200 employees, which was first reported by Bloomberg News. The person spoke anonymously because the number had not yet been made public.The employees were told their roles were being eliminated due to \"business conditions\" and not their performance via Microsoft Teams calls on Friday, the source said.The Detroit automaker has been regularly reviewing its business units and organizations for years in an effort to cut costs, boost profits and eliminate what it considers unneeded or overstaffed roles for future operations.The most recent layoffs represent a small percentage of the automaker's salaried workforce, but continue a trend of white-collar U.S. headcount reductions. GM's U.S. salaried headcount fell from 53,000 in 2023 to 50,000 to end last year.GM's layoffs also come a day after all-electric vehicle maker Rivian laid off roughly 4.5% of its workforce, or more than 600 people, to restructure some teams as the EV market faces growing challenges amid policy changes and slower-than-expected demand.The most recent cuts come as President Donald Trump touted on social media Friday that Ford Motor and GM are \"UP BIG on Tariffs\" amid tariff changes last week for heavy- and medium-duty trucks, which he referred to as \"Big and Midsized Trucks.\"While both Ford and GM, including CEO Mary Barra, this week praised the tariff changes, which also included extending offsets on U.S.-produced vehicles, the automakers are still seeing additional cost burdens from the levies. These changes are simply helping to lower those added costs.The layoffs come days after GM raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday as it beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, causing the stock to have its second-best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Shares of GM are up more than 29% this year, while Ford's stock is up roughly 38%. Both hit new 52-week highs on Friday.",

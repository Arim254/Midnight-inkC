Tingshu Wang | ReutersThe U.S. deficit with its global trading partners nearly doubled in November as the shortfall with the European Union swelled and the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs worked their way through the economy, the Census Bureau reported Thursday.Following a month where the trade deficit hit its lowest level since early 2009, it shot up to $56.8 billion, an increase of 94.6% from October. Of that gain, about one-third came with the European Union, where the goods deficit rose by $8.2 billion. The goods deficit with China decreased by about $1 billion to $13.9 billion.On a year-over-year basis, the deficit through November stood at $839.5 billion, or about 4% higher than the same period in 2024.The increase in the deficit counters Trump's efforts to use tariffs to reduce imbalances around the globe. When announcing so-called reciprocal tariffs in April 2025, the White House used the level of trade deficits with varying countries as a baseline for determining the duties.As the year went by, Trump softened his stance. A framework agreement between the U.S. and the EU in August put the tariff rate at 15% on most European goods and sought to stabilize relations between the two sides.",

No purchase price was disclosed.Q.ai was secretive and had not publicly shared a product, but its website suggests it was working on something related to audio. The startup was led by CEO Aviad Maizels, who previously sold PrimeSense to Apple in 2013. \"We're thrilled to acquire the company, with Aviad at the helm, and are even more excited for what's to come,\" Johny Srouji, Apple senior vice president of hardware technologies, told Reuters, which first reported the news. Srouji leads Apple's chip development. The company was backed by investors including GV (Google Ventures), Kleiner Perkins and Spark Capital, according to PitchBook, which says Q.ai was working on a \"communication enhancement technology.\"Apple's AirPods have been upgraded with AI in recent years, including a live translation feature and intelligent noise cancelling that can tell when the user is in a conversation. Some investors have called on Apple to make a big acquisition in AI as its megacap peers pour money into cutting-edge models and the infrastructure to run them. Meanwhile, Apple's products, like a more personal Siri that can use apps, have faced delays. Apple more commonly buys smaller companies with specific technologies that it can integrate into its products. Apple also announced a deal with Google earlier this month to have its Gemini models power some Apple Intelligence features. \"We're very open to M&A that accelerates our roadmap,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in July.PrimeSense, Maizels' prior startup, developed technology that allowed sensors to detect the distance between objects, and was integrated into Apple's Face ID sensor starting in 2017.WATCH: What to watch from Big Tech earnings",

    "body": "Elon Musk announced his new company xAI which he says has the goal to understand the true nature of the universe. Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesTesla sold $430 million worth of its giant backup batteries called Megapacks to xAI, Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, in 2025, according to a filing on Thursday. The sales to xAI accounted for around 3.4% of Tesla's energy business revenue, which climbed 27% to $12.8 billion last year from $10.1 billion in 2024, the filing said. Tesla's energy division, which sells solar photovoltaics and battery storage systems of various sizes, was a bright spot for the company, as auto revenue dropped 10% to $69.5 billion, weighed down by a tarnished brand reputation and an aging lineup. Because autos remain Tesla's predominant source of revenue, total sales fell roughly 3% for the year, declining for the first time on record. Musk first incorporated xAI in March 2023, and revealed its existence publicly four months later,  describing it as a politically incorrect competitor to OpenAI. Musk co-founded OpenAI as an AI lab in 2015, and left in 2018, years before the company released ChatGPT. The two sides are now involved in heated litigation, with a trial expected to begin in April. In its fourth-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, Tesla said it was investing $2 billion in xAI as part of the startup's latest round of funding. Tesla's investment came after the announcement of a number of investigations across the globe into xAI's Grok chatbot and image generator, which enabled the widespread nonconsensual creation and distribution of explicit deepfake images Earlier this month, xAI said that it raised $20 billion in its recent funding round from a number of investors, including Nvidia and Cisco. Reuters reported on Thursday that SpaceX is weighing a merger with xAI ahead of a planned IPO for Musk's aerospace and defense companyXAI previously announced it was using Tesla Megapacks to help power its data infrastructure in and around Memphis, Tennessee, home to its data center called Colossus. Megapacks are used for business and utility-scale developments, and Tesla's newer Megablocks are a combination of four Megapacks around one transformer. The systems use lithium-ion or other battery cells, helping data centers and utilities avoid blackouts, allowing for energy storage from sources like solar and wind. In 2025, xAI installed and was using 35 natural gas-burning turbines to power operations at the Colossus facility, according to aerial video obtained by the Southern Environmental Law Center. Emissions from the turbines led to community uproar, with residents complaining of a stench, health problems and an inability to keep their windows open at home. The Environmental Protection Agency recently updated a rule concerning the use of such turbines, making clear that they are not exempt from the need for Clean Air Act permits.In a lawsuit that's pending in Delaware, Musk has been accused of violating his fiduciary duty to Tesla shareholders by diverting the automaker's resources to xAI.WATCH: Musk's xAI closes $20 billion funding roundwatch now",

The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dropped about 5% in morning trading, on pace for its biggest one-day decline since last April during the tariff-triggered downturn. The fund is now down about 21% from its recent high, pushing the software industry into bear-market territory and underscoring how quickly sentiment has turned against one of Wall Street's former favorite industries.Month to date, IGV is down almost 14%, on pace for its worst month since October 2008 when the fund fell 23%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF over one yearThe concern about the AI threat outweighed solid earnings from bellwether names like ServiceNow, whose shares plunged more than 12% Thursday. The enterprise software maker topped Wall Street's fourth-quarter earnings expectations and issued better-than-expected guidance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconServiceNow 5 days\"Good, but not good enough,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note of ServiceNow's report. \"In an environment of heightened investor skepticism on incumbent application vendors, stable growth, in line with expectations, likely falls short of shifting the narrative.\"The pressure has deepened across the sector as investors question whether AI competitors and automation tools could erode demand for traditional software licenses and workflows. Valuations once justified by steady subscription growth are being recast as investors assess the possibility that AI could permanently shrink long-term revenue potential.Megacap Microsoft  added to the pressure, sliding about 10% after reporting a slowdown in cloud growth for the fiscal second quarter, putting the stock on track for its steepest one-day drop since March 2020. The company also issued softer-than-expected guidance on operating margin for the fiscal third quarter.Investor unease has been amplified by the rapid pace of AI development itself. Anthropic released Claude Opus 4.5 late last year, its third major model launch in just two months. The company said the model excels at coding, operating computers and assisting with complex enterprise tasks, with ideal users including professional software developers and knowledge workers such as financial analysts, consultants and accountants.\"It is a little embarrassing that in 10 days, Anthropic was able to invent, co-work, put it out and everybody ... could look at it and go, 'Wow, why isn't Microsoft doing that? Why don't I know about that?' And that is a narrative they need to fix,\" Ben Reitzes, head of technology research at Melius Research, said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" \"I think patience is going to run thin on the Street.\"Also on Thursday, SAP slid as much as 14% after the German software giant reported weaker-than-expected growth in its cloud contract backlog for the fourth quarter. Current cloud backlog rose 16% to 21.1 billion euro (US$25.3 billion), falling short of expectations for about 26% growth, which UBS analysts called a \"disappointment.\"ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott sought to counter investor fears on the company's earnings call Thursday, saying concerns that AI will displace software vendors are misplaced. \"The real payoff comes when trillions of tokens move beyond pilots to be embedded directly into the workflows where business decisions are made,\" McDermott said. \"ServiceNow is the gateway to this shift, serving as the semantic layer that makes AI ubiquitous in the enterprise.\"He added that because AI systems are probabilistic, companies still need workflow software to ensure consistent business outcomes.— With assistance from CNBC's Samantha Subin.",

    "body": "An apartment for rent sign hangs outside of an apartment building on Dec. 4, 2025 in San Francisco, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesApartment rents continued their slide into the new year, as fresh supply still makes its way through the market, and landlords strive to gain pricing power over a struggling consumer. The national median rent in January was $1,353, a drop of 1.4% compared with one year ago, according to Apartment List. This is now the fourth consecutive winter with a \"pronounced\" offseason dip, and is the largest annual drop since September 2023 and the lowest January rent since 2022. Rents are now 6.2% lower than their last peak in the summer of 2022. The national vacancy rate was 7.3% in January, a record high on Apartment List's index, which dates to 2017. Units are also taking an average of 41 days to get leased, four days more than in January 2025 and another high for the index. \"Early last year, it appeared that annual rent growth was on track to flip positive for the first time since mid-2023; however, that rebound stalled out and reversed course during a slow summer moving season that has now dragged into the winter,\" wrote Chris Salviati, chief economist at Apartment List.The record supply of new apartment units has peaked, but there is still a good amount coming through the pipeline. That is coming up against weaker demand because of a tighter job market and slower household formation.

Markets in the Northeast, Midwest and parts of the West Coast continue to see rising rents despite the general winter slowdown.Austin, Texas, wins the dubious distinction of the softest rental market in the nation, with the median rent there down 6.3% from the year before. It is followed by New Orleans; San Antonio; Tucson, Arizona; and Denver.Virginia Beach, Virginia, is seeing the fastest rent growth at 5%. It is followed by San Jose and San Francisco, California; Chicago; and Providence, Rhode Island.\"The wave of construction that has been driving these conditions is waning, but whether or not market conditions shift will now depend on rental demand, whose outlook has grown shakier due to weakness in the labor market and general economic uncertainty,\" Salviati wrote.

    "body": "watch nowThe Senate on Thursday failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on a crucial government funding package, with a shutdown set to begin on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET. The procedural vote on the six-bill package was widely expected to fail as Democrats demand that the Republican majority strip funding for the Department of Homeland Security from the measure. Democrats want new restrictions on federal immigration enforcement after agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens this month in Minneapolis. The vote was 45-55, with seven Republicans joining Democrats in filibustering it. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., voted no to reserve a motion to reconsider. The vote increases the likelihood of a government shutdown this week and will likely send Senate Republicans into negotiations with Democrats to find a solution.In addition to Homeland Security, the package that failed would also fund the departments of Defense, Treasury, State, Health and Human Services, Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, and Education. Spending measures need at least 60 votes to avert the Senate filibuster.

    "body": "watch nowStarbucks is reintroducing tiers to its North American loyalty program in a bid to encourage coffee drinkers to visit more frequently as part of its broader turnaround strategy.The company made the announcement on Thursday at its investor day. Executives across the business are sharing more details on Starbucks' plans to drive future sales growth and profitability, including through its all-important loyalty program.Starbucks Rewards has existed since 2009. The company, long seen as a leader in restaurant technology, relies on its loyalty program to encourage members to visit more frequently and spend more money. In fiscal 2025, the transactions linked to the Rewards program accounted for 60% of the company's revenue.But the coffee chain also has to balance offering members enticing rewards with maintaining profit margins. In 2019, the company eliminated the two-tiered system, saying that the change was meant to encourage new members to become more engaged. The company now feels that system does not appropriately reward its most loyal customers.\"Our very best customers are coming 200 times a year, and we were treating them the same as someone who comes once a year,\" Starbucks Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman, who joined the company in November 2024, told CNBC's Kate Rogers. \"So we've introduced tiers.\"The tiered program will return on March 10, this time with three levels.How Starbucks loyalty tiers will workStarbucks Rewards members with fewer than 500 \"stars\" — or points — will belong to the green tier. They can enjoy a free drink or food item on their birthday, receive early access to select menu items and get personalized offers. Green-tier members' stars won't expire for six months, and they can keep them from expiring in several ways, like redeeming a reward or making a purchase.Once a customer earns 500 stars over a 12-month period, Starbucks upgrades them to the gold tier. Their points never expire, and they earn 1.2 stars for every dollar they spend.Members can level up to reserve tier after earning 2,500 stars over a 12-month period. Customers at this level get access to exclusive merchandise and events, and they earn 1.7 points per dollar spent.The current Starbucks Rewards program gives members two stars for every dollar they spend when they pay with a preloaded Starbucks gift card. If they pay with a credit or debit card, members earn just one star per dollar spent.The rewards available for redemption are largely staying the same, although Starbucks is adding the option for a $2 discount on any order in exchange for 60 stars. The company is also adding \"Free Mod Mondays,\" which give loyalty program members a complimentary modification to any drink on a select Monday, once per month.The announcement comes on the heels of the company releasing its earnings report on Wednesday morning. For the first time in nearly four years, Starbucks saw traffic from both Rewards members and nonmembers grow during the quarter. \"You have to win both with your Rewards customers and — call it — the light or infrequent customer,\" CEO Brian Niccol said on the company's earnings call on Wednesday.",

Eric Thayer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTesla CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the automaker is ending production of its Model S and X vehicles, and will use the factory in Fremont, California, to build Optimus humanoid robots. \"It's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to an end with an honorable discharge,\" Musk said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call. \"If you're interested in buying a Model S and X, now would be the time to order it.\"After the original Roadster, the two models are Tesla's oldest vehicles, and in recent years the company has slashed prices as global competition for electric vehicles has soared. Tesla started selling the Model S sedan in 2012, and the Model X SUV three years later. On Tesla's website, the Model S currently starts at about $95,000, while the Model X starts at around $100,000Tesla's far more popular models are the 3 and Y, which accounted for 97% of the company's 1.59 million deliveries last year. The Model 3 now starts at about $37,000, and the Model Y is around $40,000. Tesla debuted more affordable versions of the vehicles late last year. In its earnings announcement on Wednesday, Tesla reported its first annual revenue decline on record, with sales falling in three of the past four quarters. Musk has been trying to turn attention away from traditional EVs and toward a future of driverless cars and humanoid robots, areas where the company currently has virtually no business.A crowd watches and interacts with a Tesla Optimus robot outside the Nasdaq Market site in New York City, U.S., Oct. 27, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersTesla is developing Optimus with the aim of someday selling it as a bipedal, intelligent robot capable of everything from factory work to babysitting. The company said in the release that it plans to unveil the third generation of Optimus this quarter, its \"first design meant for mass production.\"Musk said on the call that Tesla is replacing its production line for S and X in Fremont \"with a 1 million unit per year line of Optimus.\"\"Because it is a completely new supply chain,\" Musk said, \"there's really nothing from the existing supply chain that exists in Optimus.\"Tesla expects to boost headcount at the Fremont facility, Musk added, \"and to significantly increase output.\"WATCH: How traders are playing Teslawatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is followed by reporters as he walks to the Senate Chambers in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 27, 2026.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesRepublican senators appear to be opening the door to preventing a partial government shutdown as the chamber prepares to start voting on a House-passed package to fully fund a group of federal agencies through the remaining fiscal year. The Senate is set to start voting on the funding bills Thursday morning. If the chamber doesn't pass all of them, much of the federal government would shut down Saturday at 12:01 ET.The bills would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, including the Treasury and Defense departments. While the package once looked certain to clear the Senate and avoid a shutdown, the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents Saturday in Minneapolis derailed it. Democrats are demanding that the DHS portion of the bill be stripped from the package and weighed separately to make changes to how the agency operates, a move that Republicans have so far resisted. On Wednesday, some Senate Republicans began to embrace the idea of splitting off DHS, as a shutdown looms just months after a record 43-day closure last year. The measure will require 60 votes to clear the Senate filibuster. Republicans hold only 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning Democrats can block it if they withhold their votes.\"Rather than scuttling the whole package, I say let's go and pass what we can,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said in an interview with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday. \"I think all the bills will pass except Homeland Security, and then we can sit down and talk about Homeland Security,\" said Kennedy, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Asked how many of his Republican colleagues support such a move, Kennedy said: \"A bunch.\"Indeed, numerous Republicans said Wednesday that while they would like to see the entire package pass the Senate, splitting off DHS is a palatable off-ramp. \"We are going to see what happens when that vote comes up,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., another member of the appropriations committee. \"[But] if the Democrats block it, [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer has already said that he's willing to move the five, and so I certainly have an open mind on that.\"Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC that if Democrats are \"okay with five of the six bills,\" then \"we ought to figure out a way to get those done.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a press conference Wednesday that such proposals are so far \"hypotheticals\" and that he would \"reserve optionality.\" \"I think the best path forward, as I've said, is to keep the package intact,\" Thune said. \"If there are things that the Democrats want that the administration can agree with them about, then let's do that.\"Democrats are warning that a separate negotiation with the administration would not be enough to assuage their concerns. President Donald Trump has attempted a turnabout in recent days after the fallout from the shooting of Pretti in Minnesota, recently saying he will deescalate his immigration crackdown in the state. \"This has to be in the bill,\" said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I don't think we could settle for promises.\" King repeatedly voted to reopen the government during the last shutdown, bucking his caucus. \"I can't in good conscience vote for a DHS budget under these circumstances,\" King said, calling for the DHS component to be separated so the rest of the bills can pass. DHS is conducting immigration operations in Maine. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, arrives for a vote in the Capitol on Thursday, September 28, 2023.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesSchumer, D-N.Y., listed Democrats' demands in a press conference Wednesday. He said Democrats want a DHS funding package to include new guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Those guardrails include a requirement for warrants for arrests, a ban on federal agents wearing masks, mandatory body cameras and a uniform code of conduct for federal agents. \"Democrats stand ready today to pass the five bipartisan bills in the Senate, but the DHS bill needs serious work,\" Schumer said. \"It's now on Leader Thune to separate out the DHS bill ... and start working with Democrats to rein in ICE.\"Republicans appear to be plowing ahead with plans to vote on all six bills. \"We're voting on this tomorrow,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"Anything can change in 24 hours, but our plan is to vote on six bills.\" Should that vote fail and Senate Republicans decide to split off the DHS portion, it would likely require a unanimous consent request on the Senate floor to alter the bill, given the short timeline. Any one senator could object to such a move, drawing out the timeline and further risking a shutdown. \"I've got concerns with that, but I'd have to examine it,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, when asked by CNBC if he would object to stripping out the DHS bill from the package. Republicans also note that a shutdown at DHS would also mean that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would go unfunded during a winter cold snap that has brought bitter temperatures, ice and snow to a large part of the country. King suggested that a short-term continuing resolution could keep FEMA and other agencies afloat. Any changes the Senate makes to the package would also require reapproval by the House. The House is out of Washington on recess, with plans to return next week — after the shutdown deadline. \"If the bill changes much from what the House already passed, then you've got another steep hill to climb over there,\" Thune said. DHS would largely also be able to keep operating its immigration enforcement apparatus even if it enters into a shutdown. Republicans gave the agency hundreds of billions of dollars in supplemental appropriations as part of the tax and spending package passed last year.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct day of the shutdown.",

Curtis Means | Via ReutersA Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly showing up Wednesday night at a New York federal jail while claiming to be an FBI agent and saying he had a court order from a judge to release Luigi Mangione, who is accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to a new criminal complaint Thursday.The man, 36-year-old Mark Anderson of Mankato, when asked by Bureau of Prisons personnel at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn for his credentials, produced a Minnesota driver's license, prosecutors said. Mangione is being held at that jail without bail.Anderson also allegedly said he had weapons in a bag he was carrying. Inside the bag was a barbecue fork and a circular steel blade, which resembled a pizza cutter, according to the criminal complaint filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn.\"Anderson also displayed and threw at the BOP officers numerous documents,\" an FBI agent who signed the complaint wrote. \"I have reviewed those papers and they appear to be related to filing of claims against the United States Department of Justice,\" the agent wrote.Anderson is being charged with impersonating an FBI agent and is scheduled to be presented on Thursday afternoon in Brooklyn federal court, where he is charged in a complaint.The complaint does not identify by name the inmate that Anderson allegedly hoped to free. But a person in law enforcement confirmed that it was the 27-year-old Mangione.Anderson had traveled to New York City for a job opportunity that did not work out and had been working in a pizzeria, according to that person.Read more CNBC politics coverageWatch live: Trump holds Cabinet meeting at White HouseHoman: ICE and CBP crafting drawdown plan in Minnesota, says improvements neededDenmark lauds talks with U.S. over Greenland: 'Now we are back on track'Government shutdown: Republicans mull escape hatch as Congress careens toward deadline'ICE is not a law unto itself,' Minnesota judge says after immigrant releasedCrypto PAC Fairshake touts $193M war chest as regulatory bill faces first voteFed has not yet complied with subpoenas as Powell probe continues: SourceTrump lowered 'temperature' on Minnesota, wants to avoid shutdown: BessentNYC Mayor Mamdani says city must hike taxes on wealthy to fill $12B deficitTrump warns Iran an 'armada' is heading its way and to agree to a nuclear deal, or elseHis arrest came hours after state prosecutors in Manhattan Supreme Court urged a judge there to set Mangione's murder trial for July. That is two months before jury selection is set to begin in the Manhattan federal court case where the University of Pennsylvania graduate is also charged with multiple crimes related to killing Thompson, a Minnesota resident whose company is the largest private health insurer in the United States.Prosecutors alleged that Mangione stalked and then fatally shot Thompson on the morning of Dec. 4, 2024, as the CEO was walking into a midtown Manhattan hotel for an investors' event by UnitedHealth Group, the parent of UnitedHealthcare.Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, five days after the slaying.He has pleaded not guilty in both cases.Federal prosecutors are seeking to impose the death penalty on Mangione if he is convicted in their case.

    "body": "watch nowYork Space Systems began trading as a public company on Thursday, with founder and CEO Dirk Wallinger touting the company's potential to be a key contributor to President Trump's 'Golden Dome' project.The Denver-based space company opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $38, up 11.7% from its $34 offering price. It was valued at $4.75 billion.\"Golden Dome is essentially making disparate systems that weren't intended to talk to one another, talk to one another, which is what we do,\" Wallinger told CNBC's Morgan Brennan. \"York's already delivering on that, so we're looking for the opportunity to deliver on the Golden Dome for our country.\"York has already built low-earth orbit satellites for the U.S. Space Development Agency, launching 21 craft as part of a September launch.Space technology has steadily been gaining momentum in 2025 and looks set for a big 2026. The sector saw several IPOs last year, including Firefly Aerospace, Voyager Technologies and Karman Holdings.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta shares jump on stronger-than-expected revenue forecastTesla tops estimates for quarter, but wraps up first annual revenue drop on recordIBM stock jumps on earnings beatServiceNow posts better-than-expected fourth-quarter resultsThe industry has also seen a boost from Trump's renewed interest in upgrading military technology and bringing astronauts back to the moon after more than half a century. SpaceX's expected IPO this year is poised to be the largest ever.Wallinger said SpaceX going public will be great for everyone in the sector.\"I think there's a lot of excitement in the market for defense tech and space,\" Wallinger said.York Space Systems has done 74 missions to space since its founding in 2012. The company currently works with the U.S. Department of Defense, and entered a contract with the U.S. Space Development Agency in 2022.Trump announced plans for a $175 billion 'Golden Dome' missile defense system in May. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the project could cost up to $831 billion.\"Historically, people kind of view us solely as a spacecraft manufacturer, but we're really a complete, holistic solution,\" Wallinger said. \"And that kind of turnkey solution is really what national defense needs.\"watch now",

    "body": "A Waymo vehicle exits a charging lot on Jan. 15, 2026 in Austin, Texas.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesAlphabet-owned Waymo has informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that one of its driverless vehicles \"struck a child near an elementary school\" in Santa Monica, CaliforniaThe Jan. 23 incident is now being investigated by the U.S. vehicle safety authority.According to records posted to the NHTSA website, the child sustained minor injuries. The Waymo collision occurred within two blocks of an elementary school during normal school drop-off hours, while other children, a crossing guard and several double-parked vehicles were nearby. \"The child ran across the street from behind a double-parked SUV towards the school and was struck by the Waymo AV,\" NHTSA said in a document describing the incident that necessitated their \"preliminary evaluation.\"The vehicle was running on Waymo's 5th Generation Automated Driving System with no human safety supervisor in the vehicle. NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigations plans to assess \"whether the Waymo AV exercised appropriate caution given, among other things, its proximity to the elementary school during drop off hours, and the presence of young pedestrians and other potential vulnerable road users.\" The agency's investigation will include analysis of the \"intended behavior\" of Waymo's driverless vehicles in school zones and neighboring areas, especially during normal school pick-up and drop-off times, as well as the company's post-impact response.\"Our technology immediately detected the individual as soon as they began to emerge from behind the stopped vehicle. The Waymo Driver braked hard, reducing speed from approximately 17 mph to under 6 mph before contact was made,\" Waymo said in a statement on their blog.The company wrote that a fully attentive human driver in the same situation would have likely \"made contact with the pedestrian\" at a higher speed of 14 miles per hour.\"This significant reduction in impact speed and severity is a demonstration of the material safety benefit of the Waymo Driver,\" the company said.Read more CNBC tech newsMeta shares jump on stronger-than-expected revenue forecastTesla tops estimates for quarter, but wraps up first annual revenue drop on recordIBM stock jumps on earnings beatServiceNow posts better-than-expected fourth-quarter resultsAfter the robotaxi struck the child at low speed, the pedestrian \"stood up immediately, walked to the sidewalk, and we called 911,\" Waymo said. The company also reported that its vehicle \"remained stopped, moved to the side of the road, and stayed there until law enforcement cleared the vehicle to leave the scene.\"Waymo was involved in a separate incident on Jan. 25 in Los Angeles, where one of its Zeekr vehicles sped through a one-way residential street near Dodger Stadium. The vehicle struck several parked cars, including one that had a person in it.There were no reported injuries, Waymo said in an emailed response.The vehicle was being operated in manual mode by a human specialist at the time of the event. Waymo did not respond to questions about how the vehicle ended up speeding in the incident.Waymo is already facing regulatory scrutiny for the behavior of its robotaxis around school buses. Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board initiated an investigation after reports of Waymo robotaxis illegally passing stopped school buses in several different locations. In a statement posted on X on January 23, the NTSB said it \"opened a safety investigation to examine the interaction between Waymo vehicles and school buses stopped for loading and unloading students in Austin, Texas.\"The Austin Independent School District previously identified at least 19 incidents where Waymo vehicles passed its school buses, and demanded that Waymo stop using its driverless vehicles during school bus hours in Austin until the safety concerns could be resolved.NHTSA had earlier started \"to investigate the performance of the Waymo ADS around stopped school buses and the system's ability to follow traffic safety laws concerning school buses,\" it said in a letter the agency sent to Waymo.While both the NTSB and NHTSA are vehicle safety watchdogs in the U.S. government, their roles are distinct.The NTSB investigates accidents to determine underlying causes of damaging or concerning incidents. The board also makes safety recommendations to regulators (including NHTSA) and the auto industry.-- CNBC's Jennifer Elias contributed to this reportWATCH: 2025: The year that the robotaxi went mainstream with Waymo leading the packwatch now",

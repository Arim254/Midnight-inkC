    "body": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his push to restrict large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that Wall Street firms have crowded out would-be homebuyers.\"You have these big companies, these big corporations, buying up thousands of homes and renting them or doing whatever they do with them,\" Trump told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview in Davos, Switzerland. \"Some of them are flipping them for a big profit, but it got to be too much. We want people to be able to buy a home.\"Trump's comments followed an executive order he signed Tuesday directing federal agencies to curb institutional investor activity in the single-family housing market. The order gives the Treasury Department 30 days to define \"large institutional investor\" and \"single-family home,\" and directs federal agencies to issue guidance within 60 days to implement restrictions, including limits on acquisitions and the sale of federally owned single-family homes to institutional investors.However, housing analysts remain skeptical, saying a lack of affordability is being driven far more by a lack of supply than by investor demand.Institutional investors are not 'market movers'While Trump said Wednesday that institutional investors are \"gobbling up all the homes,\" they make up only a small share of the U.S. housing market. Firms that own 100 or more single-family homes control roughly 2% of the nation's single-family housing stock, according to John Burns Research and Consulting.In theory, widespread and growing corporate homebuying could drive up prices and make it tougher for families to elbow their way into a competitive housing market. However, the share of home purchases by institutional investors has declined from its pandemic peak, falling from about 3% in the first quarter of 2023 to closer to 1% a year later, as higher interest rates cooled investor activity, John Burns Research and Consulting's data shows.\"The real problem is that we've added far more households than we've built single-family homes,\" Jay Parsons, an analyst who tracks rental housing and development trends, tells CNBC Make It. \"It's all about supply and demand.\"Limiting investor demand does not add new homes to the market, and many housing economists say affordability will not improve without a significant increase in supply. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research estimate the U.S. would need millions of additional homes above current construction levels to meaningfully ease price pressures.In markets where institutional investors are most concentrated, analysts say their impact on prices and rents appears limited. A 2024 analysis by Parsons found that many of the most investor-saturated markets posted rent growth below the U.S. average, a pattern he linked to higher levels of housing construction.\"Institutional investors are just not the main market movers,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute. \"It's mainly a supply issue.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 21: Delegates watch as U.S. President Donald Trump speaks onstage at the World Economic Forum (WEF) on January 21, 2026 in Davos, Switzerland. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesMarkets and some European leaders welcomed the news that U.S. President Donald Trump was standing down from imposing further tariffs on European countries — but others were left bewildered.Trump told CNBC on Wednesday that he had the \"concept of a deal\" with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, shortly after declaring on Truth Social that he would not proceed with the levies he threatened on eight European countries from Feb. 1.Markets on Thursday rose on the news, but questions remain about the supposed agreement on Greenland.As the president didn't share details of the framework — or who agreed to it — one strategist told CNBC: \"Nobody's going to believe him anymore.\"A 'deal' without a dealTrump outlined the Greenland agreement in sweeping terms, casting it as an \"ultimate long-term deal\" that locks in U.S. national security and gives access to \"minerals.\"Greenland's location matters for Arctic military posture, but climate change is making the island more accessible — sparking a renewed interest in its rare earths and other critical mineral reserves.But Trump did not say whether Denmark, which is responsible for the island's defense, or Greenland had signed up to anything.NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told Fox News that the issue of Greenland's ownership did not come up in his talks with Trump, which were about Arctic security as Chinese and Russian activity increases.Ed Price, senior non-resident fellow at New York University, told CNBC Thursday that striking a deal \"requires two people to tango,\" describing Trump's Davos speech as \"a monologue not a dialogue.\" Price also said the framework was \"the start of a process, not the end,\" warning that a precedent of bargaining over disputed territories could tempt future attempts elsewhere. Chinese state media, meanwhile, urged the EU on Wednesday to reassess its security reliance on the U.S. and pursue greater \"strategic autonomy.\"Trump has \"advantaged\" China in the long run by signaling that U.S. commitments can swing wildly with political incentives, Price added. Why Trump blinked: Treasury yieldsRobin Brooks, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's toned-down rhetoric had \"nothing to do with Europe\" and was more likely driven by concerns about the recent spikes in global bond yields, which jumped on fears of a fresh trade war.Brooks also said Europeans had limited leverage in negotiations with Trump. \"Europeans have, by all accounts, been freeriding on the U.S. security umbrella. They need to spend more. They will,\" Brooks said, caveating that most countries, except for Germany, lack fiscal space. \"A lot of these countries have no fiscal firepower whatsoever,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"In his Wednesday speech at Davos, Trump acknowledged financial markets' discomfort with his threats over Greenland as he publicly ruled out using force to take it for the first time.'The biggest taco that you could get'Whatever ultimately happens with tariffs, European leaders should plan for worst-case outcomes, said David Roche, veteran investor from Quantum Strategy. Trump's Greenland threat is \"the biggest 'taco' that you could get,\" Roche said, referring to the phrase 'Trump Always Chickens Out,' which has come to define a market strategy anticipating the president reneging on his threats.But Roche said this was becoming a problem — the bigger Trump's threat, the more allies expect him to \"march his troops up the hill and then down the hill.\"\"What the European Union has learned is that if you face up to them, you win,\" Roche said. \"Nobody's going to believe him anymore.\" ",

    "body": "Vehicles bound for shipment parked in front of the Dream Angel vehicles carrier ship at the Nagoya Port in Nagoya, Japan, on Tuesday, June 18, 2024.Fred Mery | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's exports growth in the final month of 2025 missed analysts' estimates, rising 5.1% year on year, as shipments to the U.S. saw a double-digit decline. Reuters-polled analysts had estimated exports growth would remain unchanged from November at 6.1%.  Japanese exports fell during the middle of 2025, hit by U.S. tariff worries, but saw a rebound toward the end of the year after a trade deal with the U.S. was announced that saw duties slashed to 15%. Exports to the U.S. in December, however, resumed their decline, dropping 11.1%, after an 8.8% jump in the prior month. The gain in November was the first time exports to the U.S. rose since March.Shipments to mainland China, Japan's largest trading partner, climbed 5.6%, while exports to Hong Kong surged 31.1% compared to the same period last year. Exports to the wider Asia region gained 10.2%.Imports in December rose 5.1% year on year, jumping sharply from the 1.3% rise seen in November, and beating Reuters estimates of a 3.6% rise.For full-year 2025, Japan's exports rose 3.1%, a softer rise compared to the 6.2% increase seen in 2024, as shipments to mainland China and the U.S. — Tokyo's top two trading partners — fell 0.4% and 4.1% respectively. Exports to Hong Kong and Taiwan climbed 17.8% and 15.1% for the whole year, partially offsetting declines in the U.S. and China. The rise in overall exports in 2025 was partly due to front-loading of U.S. shipments ahead of tariff hikes, an artificial intelligence boom that's boosted electronics and machinery shipments, and a weak yen, said Stefan Angrick, head of Japan at Moody's Analytics.  \"Although shipments are holding up for now, the outlook is fraught with risks,\" he warned, pointing out that higher U.S. import levies and fierce competition from abroad are weighing on industrial production and export volumes.Trade threats from China are an added concern, Angrick added. Relations between Tokyo and Beijing have chilled since November after comments from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan could intervene militarily if China attempted to seize Taiwan by force.China had suspended imports of seafood from Japan, and early this year, announcing restrictions on the export of dual-use goods to Japan.The trade data comes at a time when Japan is bracing for snap elections on Feb. 8 called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with its Lower House set to be dissolved Friday.  A victory for Takaichi will allow her to push her fiscal agenda through Japan's parliament with little opposition, analysts have said. It could also involve keeping the yen weak, as it supports Japan's exports.Since the announcement of the elections, Japanese markets have been fueled by the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" that has seen stocks mostly rise, and the yen stay weak.

    "body": "A drone view shows Netflix logos on buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026. Daniel Cole | ReutersNetflix jumped into the advertising business later than its media peers, but its strategy shift is starting to pay off.This week Netflix reported its fourth-quarter earnings, which were mostly overshadowed by the company's recent pursuit to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets. However, beyond the headlines, metrics like customer engagement, subscriber numbers and advertising revenue paint a promising picture. The earnings report provided some long-awaited clarity on the progress of Netflix's advertising strategy, and how it has been factoring into the overall business. On Tuesday Netflix said 2025 advertising revenue exceeded $1.5 billion — about 3% of total full-year revenue for the streaming giant — and is expected to double this year. Overall company revenue jumped almost 16% percent for 2025, while net income rose 26%. \"We're making good progress and the opportunity ahead of us is massive,\" Co-CEO Greg Peters said on Tuesday's call with investors. Wall Street analysts, however, noted that ad revenue disclosure fell short of their previous forecasts, indicating that it could be taking longer than expected to get the ad business off the ground. \"The last couple of years were slower out of the gate than we had estimated. However, advertising revenue growth is hitting its stride and should yield a similar contribution to revenue growth as we had estimated in our pre-4Q forecast,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a research note Wednesday. Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson noted total ad revenue was lower than the research firm had forecast but welcomed the fresh insights into the company's ad business. \"At least now we can finally have a better understanding of the contribution from advertising to total growth and can back into core subscription revenues,\" Fishman said in a note on Wednesday. Netflix's stock fell about 2% on Wednesday.Advertising has come front and center for media companies after it became clear that a subscription-only streaming model wouldn't be enough to support profitability. Advertisers, despite various headwinds, have been eager to find a place on streaming platforms, especially Netflix. Yet the industry leader was late to the advertising game after leadership long rejected the business model. It launched its cheaper, ad-supported tier in late 2022, coinciding with a brief slowdown in subscriber additions. Advertising and a crackdown on password sharing were put forth as measures to drive growth. And it has, even if slowly. Netflix said Tuesday it had 325 million global subscribers at the end of 2025. That marks an increase of roughly 23 million from the end of 2024, when Netflix last disclosed its global paid memberships. For comparison, Netflix added roughly 41 million subscribers in 2024 and almost 30 million in 2023. Against a backdrop of consistent price increases for streaming services, companies are increasingly leaning on the belief that consumers will opt for cheaper, ad-supported plans rather than drop out altogether. Peters said Tuesday that while there remains a gap between average revenue per membership of the company's standard, no-ads plan subscription and its ad-supported plan, \"that gap is narrowing.\" \"And while, because there's a gap, it means we're under-realizing revenue growth in the near time, it also, therefore, represents an opportunity for us,\" Peters said, pointing to upgrading the tech stack and ad capabilities to help drive growth.

If the EU gives in here, it will only encourage the American president to make the next ludicrous demand and threaten further tariffs,\" he said, adding that the European Commission should examine whether the ACI can be used.Economic impactWere tariffs to go ahead on February 1, as Trump had previously threatened, the impact of European businesses could be significant, business leaders have warned.Analysis by the British Chambers of Commerce found that 10% tariffs on U.S. exports could cost U.K. businesses £6 billion, rising to £15 billion, or $20 billion, in June — when Trump has said tariffs would increase to 25% if the countries continue to resist his Greenland plans.\"The UK is not without influence, our bilateral trade with the US is worth £300bn, we have £500bn invested in its economy and it has £700bn tied up in ours,\" BCC Director General Shevaun Haviland said. \"There is a high-level of co-dependency. The government should keep everything on the table during talks.\"Deutsche Bank analysts on Monday said European countries' huge holdings in U.S. assets give it an advantage, as it weighed counter-measures.But new tariffs from the U.S. would result in further \"significant\" cuts to trade and transatlantic business for German companies, Treier told CNBC. The European mechanical and plant engineering industry is already disproportionately affected by U.S. tariffs because many products are subject to 50% levies on steel and aluminium, Kawlath said. \"Added to this are high bureaucratic costs, which prevent many transactions,\" he added. \"More than half of all exported machinery could be affected.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday he is nearing the end of a search to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and hinted he has his candidate in mind.In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the president said a search that began in September and once included as many as 11 candidates is nearly over.\"I'd say we're down to three, but we're down to two. And I probably can tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,\" the president said to CNBC's Joe Kernen. Still, Trump declined to name the one.The candidate list included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investors.The finalists had been widely believed to be Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett and BlackRock fixed income head Rick Rieder. Trump in the interview said Rieder, the last to interview, is \"impressive\" and praised all the candidates.In recent days, Trump said he preferred Hassett stay at the NEC, likely eliminating him from contention. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent led the interview process. Trump in the past has expressed support for Bessent to take the Fed job, but said Wednesday, \"Scott only wants to stay where he is.\"The statement on the Fed chair is the latest in a series of dramatic twists and turns in the saga following a year of unprecedented tumult for the central bank. Though Trump criticized Powell and his colleagues heavily during his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, he ramped up the pressure considerably in 2025. That included more verbal assaults on policymakers as well as threats to fire Powell and an actual attempt to sack Governor Lisa Cook, a move that was the subject of a Supreme Court hearing earlier Wednesday on presidential authority over the institution.With Powell's removal as chair a near certainty, the next question turns to whether he'll stay on another two years to serve out his remaining term as governor. Staying on would give Powell a continued say over monetary policy and interest rates and could act a bulwark against Trump's efforts to exert control over Fed decisions. Trump indicated some indifference as to what Powell decides.\"We live with the cards you're dealt,\" he said. \"If that happens, his life won't be very, very happy, I don't think, by doing it. I think he wants to get out. He has not done a good job.\"Trump again criticized Powell for the renovation project at Fed headquarters, the price of which has run north of $2.5 billion. The Justice Department has subpoenaed Powell relative to the project.\"I could have done it for $25 million and it would have been nicer than what they're doing,\" Trump said.",

    "body": "Niphon | Istock | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump's plan to grant Nvidia licenses to ship some of its more powerful artificial intelligence chips to China is ruffling the feathers of some of Washington's most prominent China hawks, including members of his own party. The pushback intensified this week with the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee advancing a bill that seeks to expand congressional oversight of AI chip exports.The proposal, known as the AI Overwatch Act, was introduced last month by Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., the committee chairman.It would require both the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Banking Committee to approve any shipment licenses for advanced chips in 30 days, giving lawmakers the power to block sales through a joint resolution.The bill comes as the Trump Administration plans to grant licenses allowing Nvidia to sell its H200 chips to China, which are far more powerful than the processors previously permitted for export. If passed, the AI Overwatch Act would revoke existing licenses for such AI chip transfers and impose a temporary ban until the administration submits a national security strategy on AI exports. It includes exemptions for \"trusted\" U.S. companies shipping chips abroad under U.S. control, provided they meet security standards.\"Companies like Nvidia are requesting to sell millions of advanced AI chips, which are the cutting edge of warfare, to Chinese military companies like Alibaba and Tencent,\" said Chairman Mast, framing it as a national security risk. The bill was also cosponsored by the Republican Chairman of the Select Committee on China, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., who called it a \"critical step toward protecting America's technological edge.\"Still, it remains unclear the extent of support that the AI Overwatch Act can attract in the House and Senate. Disagreement in WashingtonThe act is likely to serve as a linchpin in a larger battle developing in Washington between lawmakers who see Nvidia chip exports as a national security risk and officials who argue that the exports help maintain U.S. technological dominance.Among the latter camp is White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, who has already criticized the AI Overwatch Act. The Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor recently reposted a viral social media claim that the bill would undermine Trump's authority over AI chip exports.Sacks and those in the Trump administration who support more Nvidia shipments overseas have argued that U.S. chip restrictions have been counterproductive and have ceded ground to Chinese competitors. Instead, they say it is advantageous for U.S.-designed chips to remain at the center of global AI infrastructure.  This is consistent with arguments made by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and industry lobbyists.Bipartisan lawmakers on the other side, however, have argued that Nvidia's H200s could bolster China's AI capabilities and be leveraged by its military. Current U.S. chip controls require individual licenses from the Commerce Department for any exports or transfers of high-performance AI chips to entities in \"countries of concern,\" including China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.These controls have covered Nvidia's H200, one of its most powerful AI chips. But last week, Trump confirmed his administration would approve sales of the processors to China, provided the U.S. receives a 25% cut of the proceeds.Mounting pushback Much of the pushback from lawmakers has come from the opposition party. In December, Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner, D-Va., criticized Trump's approval of H200 exports as evidence of a \"haphazard and transactional approach\" lacking a coherent strategy against China. \"American companies must remain the undisputed leader in AI hardware because our strategic competition with China on AI will boil down to whose ecosystem drives adoption and innovation globally,\" he said.Meanwhile, Senate Banking Committee ranking member Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has also warned that China seeks such chips for military modernization, weapons design and AI surveillance, citing Justice Department assessments.However, Trump has also faced bipartisan resistance. Before the H200, the president had also announced he would allow Nvidia to resume its sales of the H20 to China, a chip the President had restricted just months earlier. At the time, lawmakers had also responded with additional AI chip proposals, including the GAIN AI Act, introduced in November by a bipartisan group that included Warren and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. The bill would require U.S. firms to prioritize domestic sales of advanced chips before exporting to China. Despite Trump's policy shifts on chip exports, Chinese regulators have not allowed Nvidia's chips to flow back into the country freely. Reuters reported last week that Chinese customs authorities have been instructed to block imports of H200 chips and warned tech companies against purchasing them unless necessary. ",

The round is expected to total around $50 billion, but the numbers could change and term sheets have not been signed, according to a source familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. Bloomberg was first to report the discussions. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is in the United Arab Emirates to participate in the investment talks, the person said. The round is expected to close in the first quarter of the year. OpenAI kickstarted the AI boom by launching its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, and has since become one of the fastest growing commercial entities on the planet. The company has raised billions of dollars from investors as it's worked to scale and develop new models and roll out new features. Last year, OpenAI closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.OpenAI also finalized a $6.6 billion share sale in October that boosted its valuation to $500 billion.

Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStagnant mortgage rates, falling housing supply and ongoing economic uncertainty weighed heavily on homebuyers in December. Pending home sales, a measure of signed contracts on existing homes, dropped 9.3% last month from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts were expecting a slight gain. Sales were 3% lower than December 2024.\"The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"After several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.\"Sales fell month to month in all regions of U.S. and were higher annually only in the South. Homes also stayed on the market longer in December, at an average of 39 days compared with 35 days in December 2024.Mortgage rates in December, when these deals were inked, barely moved at all.

Chung Sung-jun | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's economic growth slowed in the final quarter of last year as a sharp slump in construction investment and a pullback in exports outweighed modest gains in consumption.The economy expanded 1.5% in the October to December period from a year earlier, according to the central bank's advance estimates, missing economists' forecast of 1.9%. That compared with 1.8% growth in the prior quarter, when the economy expanded at its fastest pace in over a year. On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product contracted 0.3%, marking the steepest slowdown since the fourth quarter of 2022. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% expansion. For the full year, South Korea's economy grew 1%, its slowest annual expansion since 2020, when output contracted 0.7% during the pandemic.Construction investment shrank 3.9% from the previous quarter as both building and civil engineering activity declined, according to data from the Bank of Korea. Facilities investment fell 1.8%, led by a drop in transportation equipment. Exports pulled back 2.1% from the previous quarter as motor vehicles and machinery shipments fell. Manufacturing and utilities supply, including electricity, gas and water, dropped 1.5% and 9.2%, respectively.  Meanwhile, private consumption expanded 0.3% on services expenditures while government spending rose 0.6%, driven by health care benefits. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, reached a trade agreement in November that included $150 billion in Korean investment in the U.S. shipbuilding sector and an additional $200 billion in investment pledges. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to reduce tariffs on South Korean cars and auto parts to 15% from 25%. The country's exports have largely held up last year despite heightened trade uncertainties. Its exports rose to a record $709.7 billion in 2025, up 3.8% from a year earlier, driven by semiconductor shipments, which jumped 22% amid surging demand for artificial intelligence chips.Tariff tensions continued to cloud the outlook for the export-oriented economy. Last week, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on certain imported AI chips as part of his push to encourage semiconductor production in the U.S.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers could face tariffs of up to 100% unless they commit to increased production in America.Lee on Wednesday downplayed the renewed threat of semiconductor tariffs, saying the costs would likely be passed on to American consumers. watch nowInflation has remained subdued, easing to 2.1% last year from 2.3% in 2024, broadly in line with the central bank's 2% target. The Bank of Korea last week kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5%, as policymakers prioritize financial stability amid a sharply weakening won and accelerating capital outflows. The won has faltered more than 6% against the dollar since July last year, hovering near 16-year lows, driven in part by Korean retail investors piling into U.S. equities. Market intervention efforts, including waiving the foreign-exchange stability levy for banks to boost the supply of U.S. dollars, have so far failed to halt the currency's decline. The won has lost nearly 2% against the greenback this year as of Thursday, making it one of Asia's worst-performing currencies.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance last week raised its 2026 GDP forecast, expecting the economic growth to accelerate to 2%, up from its August projection of 1.8%. ",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesFacebook and Instagram parent company Meta on Wednesday said it will begin to show advertising on its Threads microblogging service to all users globally starting next week. \"With ads on Threads, businesses can authentically join this conversation while finding new ways to connect with the people most interested in their business,\" the company wrote in a blog. Wall Street analysts expect Threads to become a significant revenue driver for Meta as the company monetizes the platform. The company is set to report its fourth quarter earnings results next week.Meta said the full launch will be \"gradual\" and potentially take a few months to roll out. The social media company first tested ads on Threads with users in the U.S. and Japan last January. Since its launch in July 2023, Threads has been a direct competitor to Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter. Meta's service has amassed more than 400 million active monthly users globally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in August.Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported that Threads had lured more daily mobile users worldwide than X, citing data from Similarweb.Meta said it plans to continue bringing new features to Threads. That includes new ad formats and third-party verification services that are already available on Facebook and Instagram. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Threads has more daily mobile users worldwide than X. A previous version misidentified the category of user in which Threads had surpassed X.watch nowRead more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule update",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump reacts as he leaves the congress centre during the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos on Jan. 21, 2026. Fabrice Coffrini | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday gave an interview to CNBC's Joe Kernen on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The conversation came hours after Trump addressed foreign leaders and business executives in Davos, and shortly after he made headlines by announcing he had \"formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland,\" the Danish-owned island that he had insisted must belong to the United States.Here are the five top five takeaways from Trump's interview: 1. Greenland deal will last 'forever'Trump told CNBC that he struck a \"concept of a deal\" on Greenland after meeting with North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Mark Rutte on Wednesday.Trump, in announcing on Truth Social that a framework was now in place, also said that tariffs he announced last week on imports from European countries that opposed a U.S. takeover of Greenland would not take effect.President Donald Trump speaks with CNBC’s Joe Kernen at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21, 2026.CNBC\"I think it's going to be a very good deal for the United States, also for them, and we're going to work together on something having to do with the Arctic as a whole, but also Greenland, and it has to do with the security ... and other things,\" Trump said.\"They're going to be involved in the Golden Dome, and they're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we.\"Trump said the framework around Greenland will last \"forever.\" 2. The next Fed chair may have already been pickedTrump said he may have made his pick for the next chair of the Federal Reserve — but declined to identify that person.\"I'd say we're down to three, but we're down to two,\" he said.\"And I probably can tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,\" Trump said. Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett, and BlackRock fixed income head Rick Rieder are all in the mix for the position. Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May. Powell recently revealed he was under investigation by the Justice Department in connection with the costly renovation of the Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, D.C.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Kelly sues DOD Sec. Hegseth, says he was punished for 'disfavored political speech'GOP Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probeSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has threatened to block any Fed nominee until Powell's investigation is over. \"I don't know about Thom Tillis, but you know, he's not going to be a senator too much longer,\" Trump said. \"Whatever, I mean, whatever it is, you know, life, whatever.\"3. Trump loves a strict credit card rate capThe president doubled down on his proposal to cap credit card interest at 10% for one year, while acknowledging that the idea \"sounds like\" something proposed by New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist.\"I love it,\" Trump said of his plan.He said that during a recent phone call with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat who has been a staunch critic of his, \"she was very happy\" with his proposal.Trump said that the interest rates that millions of Americans face when they do not, or cannot, pay off their monthly credit card balance are too high.\"You know, whatever happened to usury? They can't pay 28%,\" he said.\"I've had calls from credit card companies, people that are friends of mine, actually, and I treat them good. I respect them greatly, but they  make a lot of money,\" Trump said. \"You know, people go out, they buy something, and if they're a little bit  late, they're paying 28%, they end up filing for bankruptcy.\"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, during a talk earlier Wednesday at Davos, said that Trump's cap would be a disaster.Trump has been making a push to address affordability in recent weeks as polls continue to show lower approval ratings for his handling of the economy.4. Iran 'hopes' Trump said he hopes there will be no need for further U.S. military action in Iran as the Iranian government responds to domestic protests.\"We hope there's not going to be further action,\" the president said, while declining to rule out such action. Trump launched a strike in Iran in June targeting sites related to the country's nuclear program.\"They gotta stop with the nuclear,\" Trump told CNBC on Wednesday. Trump has weighed strikes in Iran since the initial action, and he has ratcheted up his threats in response to protests there that were met with lethal force by the regime. 5. 'We want people to be able to buy a home'Trump elaborated on his plan to block large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, a day after signing an executive order aimed at stopping Wall Street from competing with homebuyers. \"You have these big companies, these big corporations, buying up thousands of homes and renting them or doing whatever they do with them,\" Trump said. \"It got to be too much ... we want people to be able to buy a home.\" Blocking Wall Street from buying homes has been a priority for some Democratic elected officials.Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., last week introduced a bill to block such buy-ups.\"People say are you a conservative, yeah but I'm a common-sense person,\" Trump said, referring to his proposals aimed at increasing affordability.",

Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said late Tuesday the island and its people should be prepared for \"everything,\" not ruling out a U.S. military action as President Donald Trump doubles down on taking control of the semi-autonomous Arctic island, part of Denmark.Speaking at a news conference, Nielsen said that while the scenario was unlikely, Greenland has to be prepared as \"the other side\" has not ruled out the use of military force, in an apparent reference to the United States. \"It is not likely that there will be a use of military force, but it has not been ruled out yet. This leader from the other side has made it very clear that it is not ruled out. And therefore we must of course be prepared for everything,\" he said, according to a Google translation of his remarks.Nielsen said that Greenland's government was preparing an information campaign for its people, including guidelines on what individuals can do, including recommendation to have at least five days of food in their homes. Greenland will also be forming an emergency response team consisting of departments from municipal authorities, the police and Denmark's Joint Arctic Command.\"We must emphasize that we are in a difficult, a difficult time, a stressful time, and we cannot rule out that it can escalate even [to something] worse,\" Nielsen said.Read moreTrump on Tuesday refused to detail what actions he would take to realize his aim of taking over Greenland. \"You'll find out,\" Trump said in response to a question on how far he would go to acquire the Arctic island. Denmark's armed forces on Tuesday put out releases of European and Danish military training in Greenland, and said that it was \"strengthening its presence in Greenland and the North Atlantic.\"\"The increased presence in Greenland is a consequence of the changed security policy situation, which places new demands on the defence of the Arctic and the North Atlantic by Denmark and NATO,\" the armed forces said. The U.S. is part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump has downplayed the likelihood of resistance from European leaders if he were to take over the island. \"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" he said on Tuesday in Florida. \"We have to have it ...They can't protect it.\"On Saturday, Trump threatened eight European countries with higher tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal was not reached allowing the U.S. to acquire GreenlandIn response, European states are weighing retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

    "body": "Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the December quarter.Sheldon Cooper | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIndia's largest business group, Reliance Industries, has been battling geopolitical headwinds in its oil refining and, reportedly, in one of its new energy ventures. But those are not the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's biggest worries. The slowdown in its retail business, the group's third largest vertical, has had analysts reduce earnings estimates and cut stock target price, even as they maintain a buy rating on Reliance shares.Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the last quarter, raising doubts over its ability to deliver high growth.\"We are confident of delivering 20%+ plus CAGR [compound annual growth rate] in retail revenues over the next three years,\" Isha Ambani, who heads the retail business, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting last year.     Macquarie Capital has removed Reliance from its Asia Marquee list. Reliance Retail \"is a key swing factor\" in the group's sum-of-the-parts valuation due to the slowdown in its growth momentum, the global brokerage said in a report on Monday.Citi has cut its target price to 1,815 rupees ($19.9) per share from 1,860 rupees while UBS has lowered it to 1,790 rupees from 1,820 rupees. UBS was expecting the retail business to grow 10% on year in the December quarter.Just ahead of the festive season, in September, the Indian government slashed goods and service tax rates in order to spur domestic consumption. But the pick up in demand has been uneven across segments with sales of gold and cars increasing in the December quarter while fashion and consumer staples reported softer growth.\"We don't see any incremental near-term catalyst for consumer demand and go into 2026 with somber expectations. While we hope for a delayed impact of the stimulus measures, we expect only a gradual recovery at best, not a dramatic rebound,\" Bernstein said in a note earlier this week. Reliance Retail peers such as Avenue Supermarkets and Tata Group's Trent have also reported slower growth in the December quarter. Reliance has said festive season demand last year was split across second and third quarters, resulting in softer growth numbers. Reliance Retail has also argued that its December quarter results are not comparable year on year as its consumer staples business was demerged and now is a direct subsidy of Reliance Industries.  The gross revenue of consumer staples business was 50.65 billion rupees ($556.8 million)  in the December quarter, or roughly 5% of Reliance Retail's revenue of 976 billion rupee. Brokerages do not see the December quarter results as blip in the company's growth, but more of a secular downtrend. Citi on Monday pared its estimates for Reliance's consolidated EBITDA, from financial year 2026 to 2028 by 1%-2%, citing \"moderation\" in the retail business.Reliance Industries' shares have lost nearly 5% since its earnings were announced, even though the company's core oil refining business appears to be navigating well a tough business environment and its large telecom business reported steady growth.   Weathering headwindsReliance had to cut back on imports of cheap Russian oil as the U.S. imposed sanctions on oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil, one of which had a long-term supply contract with the Indian firm.The company has been one of the largest consumers of Russian crude oil, which accounted for 40%-45% of its crude mix at its peak, said Pankaj Srivastava, senior vice president of commodity markets-oil at Rystad Energy.EBITDA for oil-to-chemicals business, which includes refining and petrochemicals, rose 15% year on year and as \"refining cracks [margins] strength more than offset lower Russian crude intake, higher freight rates and petchem weakness,\" Goldman Sachs said in a report on Monday. Geopolitical concerns appear to have also weighed on the company's new energy business. A report from Bloomberg last week claimed that the company's plans of setting up a battery storage plant with an annual capacity of 40 gigawatt were put on hold. The report claimed that the Indian company was unable to procure technology from China owing to Beijing's curbs on technology transfer.During its earnings call the company denied any delays in the project. Karan Suri, senior vice president of new energy business, said the company was \"fast progressing on setting up our 40 gigawatt battery storage plant and the commissioning will happen over \"next few quarters.\"Untouched by domestic consumption worries or geopolitical tensions, the telecom business of Reliance, continued to deliver a steady performance, in line with expectations of brokerages such as UBS and Citi.The business, which is looking to list this year, reported a 12.7% year on year rise in its revenue and 16.4% rise in EBITDA. It added 8.9 million customers in the quarter taking its total subscriber base to 515 million. ",

(Photo by Press Information Bureau (PIB)/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIndia said it plans to double bilateral trade with the UAE to $200 billion by 2032, in a step toward diversifying its partnerships as a deal with the Asian country's biggest trading partner, the U.S., remains elusive.In a whirlwind, three-hour long meeting late Monday between UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, both countries' state-owned companies signed a 10-year liquefied natural gas supply agreement. Under the deal, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, will supply LNG worth up to $3 billion for a period of 10 years, starting 2028, to India's state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. With this deal, India is now UAE's largest customer of LNG and will account for 20% of sales by 2029, ADNOC said in a release.Both countries also discussed \"a wide range of issues aimed at further strengthening the multifaceted India-UAE friendship,\" Prime Minister Modi said in a post on X.\"It was a productive visit in terms of outcome,\" said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation told CNBC's Inside India.He added that India-UAE ties have evolved to a point where \"regular high-level interaction at relatively short notice is going to become more common\".Trade between India and UAE touched $100 billion in fiscal year 2025. Both countries signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in 2022.India is the Middle Eastern country's second-largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 9% of its total trade and 14% of non-oil exports as of September 2025, according to India Brand Equity Foundation, an initiative backed by the commerce ministry. UAE was India's third largest trading partner after the U.S. and China in fiscal year 2025, and is home to 3.5 million Indian expatriates.Diversifying alliesIndia's plan to expand its trade with UAE comes at a time when the country's exports to the U.S. are under pressure owing to the 50% tariff imposed by Washington on Indian goods since August last year.\"Even with a trade deal [with the U.S.] there is no guarantee that President Trump's \"unpredictability would end,\" said Pant, adding that it is the reason that India has been reaching out to finalise trade deal with other countries.Last year, following the U.S. tariffs, India entered trade pacts with the UK and Oman, and said it will sign a deal with New Zealand in the first half of 2026.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks as he meets with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, Oct. 22, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe looming U.S. Supreme Court ruling on President Donald Trump's tariffs could affect Trump's threats to levy new tariffs on NATO members over the issue of Greenland's sovereignty, trade attorneys told CNBC.The targeted tariff threats Trump made over the weekend would likely rest on the same legal authority as the tariffs he imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, the attorneys said. The legality of that strategy will be decided by the Supreme Court, with a ruling expected as early as this week.\"Although the president hasn't specified if these tariffs would be IEEPA-based, the U.S. Supreme Court decision on IEEPA would likely affect the outcome of the threatened Greenland tariffs,\" said Michael Lowell, partner and chair of the Global Regulatory Enforcement Group at Reed Smith.\"Similar to the Brazil tariffs; if the Supreme Court rules IEEPA doesn't give the president tariff power, then these tariffs being threatened on NATO members would be illegal,\" Lowell said.Trump announced Saturday that if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1. The court's latest batch of decisions issued Tuesday morning did not include the tariffs case.If the court overturns the tariffs, \"it may still be necessary for companies that import from those countries to bring suit to enforce,\" Lowell said. But \"that would be a quick lawsuit since the law would be clear by the ruling.\"watch nowTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. Even if the administration loses, Trump officials have said new tariffs will go into effect immediately.One of the other strategies the administration may turn to is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Trade attorneys say the president could use the recently completed Section 232 investigation on critical minerals to levy tariffs. Greenland is a mineral-rich island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.In a Jan. 14 proclamation, Trump invoked Section 232 authority to direct the negotiation of agreements with foreign nations to \"ensure the United States has adequate critical mineral supplies and to mitigate the supply chain vulnerabilities as quickly as possible.\"If negotiations do not work, the proclamation says, \"it may be appropriate to impose import restrictions, such as tariffs, if satisfactory agreements are not reached in a timely manner.\"While recent Section 232 actions from Trump included the immediate imposition of tariffs on products, in the latest Section 232 policy on critical minerals the language says that the executive branch of the government reserves the right of the president to impose tariffs.\"Regardless of the IEEPA outcome, Section 232 remains a powerful and unaffected tool that the administration will likely continue to deploy for additional tariffs. Importantly, we note that these tariffs do not stack on top of IEEPA tariffs,\" TD Cowen analysts wrote in a recent note to clients. ",

The Danish Defense will continue the increased presence with exercise activities together with a number of NATO allies in and around Greenland in 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of the European Union resisting his push to annex Greenland \"too much,\" shortly after Denmark sent additional troops to the Arctic island.Speaking ahead of his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum, Trump repeated his desire to take the self-governing Danish territory. The issue has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions and rattled the NATO military alliance.\"I don't think they are going to push back too much,\" Trump told reporters in Florida on Monday evening, referring to EU opposition over Greenland. \"Look, we have to have it,\" he added.The U.S. president, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., reiterated his interest in the sparsely populated territory following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela on Jan. 3.Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence.The comments have raised alarm across Europe and prompted demonstrations in Copenhagen and Greenland's capital, Nuuk, over the weekend.  watch nowTrump sought to raise the stakes even further on Saturday when he announced a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they oppose his bid to acquire Greenland. An extra levy of 10% will apply to the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1, Trump said, before rising to 25% from June 1.European political leaders called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to back Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.The EU is also reportedly considering retaliatory measures against the Trump administration's fresh import levies, including a so-called trade \"bazooka\" and broader economic countermeasures. 'Arctic Endurance' exerciseDenmark has sought to beef up its military presence in Greenland, according to local media reports.  A \"substantial contribution\" of Danish combat troops were expected to arrive in Greenland's Kangerlussuaq on Monday evening, Danish broadcaster TV2 reported. Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland, is home to the island's major international transport hub.Denmark's top military commander in the Arctic, Major General Søren Andersen, reportedly said that 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk and a similar number in Kangerlussuaq. The troops are expected to take part in an a military exercise dubbed \"Arctic Endurance.\"  Danish soldiers disembark an airplane at Nuuk airport, Greenland, on January 19, 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesThe operation, which is centered on countering potential Russian activity, Reuters reported last week, rather than in response to the Trump administration, comes less than a week after several NATO allies deployed small numbers of troops to Greenland for a separate joint military exercise.Danish government representatives are not expected to attend the World Economic Forum this week, a WEF spokesperson confirmed, as the dispute over Greenland intensifies.Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.",

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote.

    "body": "watch nowAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs are starting to be reflected in the price of some items, as sellers weigh how to absorb the shock of the added costs.Amazon and many of its third-party merchants pre-purchased inventory to try to get ahead of the tariffs and keep prices low for customers, but most of that supply ran out last fall, Jassy said in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Becky Quick at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"So you start to see some of the tariffs creep into some of the prices, some of the items, and you see some sellers are deciding that they're passing on those higher costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, some are deciding that they'll absorb it to drive demand and some are doing something in between,\" Jassy said. \"I think you're starting to see more of that impact.\" The comments are a notable shift from last year, when Jassy said Amazon hadn't seen \"prices appreciably go up\" a few months after Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs. Last April, Jassy also predicted that some sellers may be forced to pass the added cost of the tariffs on to consumers because some businesses \"don't have 50% extra margin that you can play with.\" Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateAmazon sellers previously told CNBC they were considering or had already raised the price of some items due to higher import costs in the wake of the tariffs. A major retail trade association warned last August that the trade war would loom over companies' inventory ordering plans this Spring, which could lead to higher prices, fewer products on the shelves and job losses.  Amazon is trying to \"keep prices as low as possible\" for consumers, but in some cases, price hikes may be unavoidable, Jassy said Tuesday.\"At a certain point, because retail is, as you know, a mid-single digit operating margin business, if people's costs go up by 10%, there aren't a lot of places to absorb it,\" Jassy said. \"You don't have endless options,\" he added.Consumers remain \"pretty resilient\" and are still spending amid the tariffs, Jassy said. But they have impacted some shoppers' purchasing habits, with Amazon observing some people trading down to lower priced items and bargain hunting, while others are holding off from buying higher-priced discretionary products, he said.watch now",

    "body": "Protesters with Danish and Greenlandic flags attend a demonstration in Copenhagen, Denmark, Jan. 17, 2026.Nichlas Pollier | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish pension operator AkademikerPension said it is exiting U.S. Treasurys because of finance concerns as Denmark spars with President Donald Trump over his threats to take over Greenland.Anders Schelde, AkademikerPension's investing chief, said the decision was driven by what it sees as \"poor [U.S.] government finances\" amid America's debt crisis. But it also comes as tensions escalate between the U.S. and Denmark after Trump's latest threats to tariff European countries if Greenland, an arctic territory of Denmark, isn't sold to the U.S.\"It is not directly related to the ongoing rift between the [U.S.] and Europe, but of course that didn't make it more difficult to take the decision,\" Schelde said in a statement to CNBC.The fund currently has a position of around $100 million in U.S. Treasurys, an AkademikerPension spokesperson confirmed to CNBC. The academics-focused fund plans to have exited that holding by the end of the month.Schelde chiefly cited the ballooning debt bill facing the U.S. after decades of government overspending. The U.S. recorded a budget shortfall of $1.78 trillion last year, down just over 2% from 2024's fiscal year as Trump's broad and steep tariffs took effect.Moody's Ratings cut the United States' sovereign credit rating down to Aa1 from Aaa in May, citing the budget deficit and high borrowing costs associated with rolling over debt at lofty interest rates.The U.S.' finances made \"us think that we need to make an effort to find an alternative way of conducting our liquidity and risk management,\" Schelde said. \"Now we have found such a way and we [are] executing on that.\"Denmark has grown increasingly hostile toward the U.S. as Trump has ratcheted up his calls for control of Greenland to be given to the U.S. Trump said over the weekend that he would institute tariffs on several European nations beginning Feb. 1 if the U.S. did not take control of Greenland and that those levies could rise to 25% on June 1.European leaders have reportedly considered using counter-tariffs and other punitive economic measures as a result. Some investors have worried that European countries could dump their U.S. asset holdings in response to Trump's new tariffs.Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Monday that it would \"not be pressured\" and \"stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law.\"Treasury yields in the U.S. and abroad surged Tuesday, a sign of investors feeling geopolitical turmoil rising. The U.S. dollar and stocks fell, and gold rose to new all-time highs in a session defined by the \"sell America\" trade.Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio told CNBC on Tuesday that sovereign funds could start to dump U.S. investments if they stop seeing the U.S. as a stable trading partner.\"On the other side of trade, deficits, and trade wars, there are capital and capital wars,\" Dalio told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you take the conflicts, you can't ignore the possibility of the capital wars.

    "body": "Algi Febri Sugita | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix said on Tuesday it had reached 325 million global paid subscribers, a new milestone for the streaming giant that last reported membership numbers a year ago. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly beat Wall Street estimates. Here's how Netflix performed for the period ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 55 cents, estimatedRevenue: $12.05 billion vs $11.97 billion, estimatedNet income for the fourth quarter was $2.42 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.87 billion, or 43 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. Netflix said revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing and increased advertising revenue. In recent years Netflix has been focused on growing its ad-supported membership tier. Netflix launched its ad-supported option in late 2022. On Tuesday, it said 2025 ad revenue grew by more than 2.5-times from 2024 to over $1.5 billion.The company said it expects 2026 overall revenue to range between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, due to increases in membership and pricing, as well as \"a projected rough doubling of ad revenue in 2026\" compared to the prior year. On Tuesday's earnings call with investors, Netflix leaders noted what they described as heated competition among industry peers when it comes to gaining subscribers and growing profitability. \"Looking ahead to '26 we're focused on improving the core business, you know, and we do that by increasing the variety and quality of our series and films,\" said co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Still, Netflix's stock was down more than 4% in after-market trading on Tuesday. Netflix's report drew comparisons to a Wall Street Journal report from April that outlined ambitious internal financial targets at the streamer. By those lofty standards, Netflix's growth underwhelmed. But co-CEO Greg Peters said Tuesday the internal targets were considered \"long-term aspirations\" and not to be confused with a forecast. \"Having said that, those goals were based on organic process,\" Peters added, noting they didn't take into account the impact of mergers and acquisitions. WBD deal updateNetflix's quarterly report comes against the backdrop of its proposed transaction of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and film studio assets. The company announcement in December that it had agreed to acquire streamer HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per WBD share, or an equity value of $72 billion.Earlier on Tuesday Netflix amended its offer to be all-cash. The company said Tuesday it would pause share repurchases to fund the acquisition. Netflix said in its letter to shareholders that it believes the transaction will \"allow us to accelerate our business strategy.\" Netflix said Warner Bros.' library, development and intellectual property will allow it to boost its content selection for members and that HBO Max will help to \"offer more personalized and flexible subscription options.\" However, the proposed acquisition came as a shock to the market as the streaming giant has long stayed away from industry consolidation and mega deals. Since October, when Netflix was first rumored to be interested in the assets, the company's stock has dropped nearly 30%.And the potential acquisition has not been without its bumps. Soon after announcing the deal with Netflix, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile effort to buy all of WBD. Lawmakers and industry insiders have also raised questions about whether the Netflix deal could win necessary regulatory approval. \"We're working really hard to close the acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, which we see as a strategic accelerant,\" Sarandos said on Tuesday's call. \"And we're doing all this while we're driving and sustaining healthy growth.\"Netflix has started the regulatory process, Sarandos said, adding he is confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer, ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\" The company has repeatedly argued the combination would preserve jobs during a time of heavy layoffs across media. On Tuesday, Sarandos said the Warner Bros. assets would bring the addition of businesses that don't already exist for Netflix. \"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"Sarandos and Peters both discussed the high level of competition in the media industry, which they said spans various platforms — from traditional TV to social media platforms like YouTube. Proving that Netflix is a small part of an expansive competitive landscape is likely to be key to Netflix's argument to antitrust regulators, CNBC previously reported. ",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is pictured on Sept. 25, 2025, in Berlin.Florian Gaertner | Photothek | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Tuesday said it is rolling out an age prediction model to its ChatGPT consumer plans to help the artificial intelligence company identify accounts that belong to users under 18 years old.The model relies on a combination of account-level signals and behavioral signals, OpenAI said. Some of those signals include usage patterns over time, how long an account has existed, the typical times of day a user is active and the user's stated age. OpenAI has rolled out several new safety features in recent months as it faces mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors. The AI startup and other tech companies are facing a probe from the FTC over how their AI chatbots potentially negatively affect children and teenagers, and OpenAI is named in several wrongful death lawsuits, including one that centers around a teenage boy's death by suicide. Once OpenAI's age prediction model suggests that a user is under 18, OpenAI said, ChatGPT will automatically apply protections designed to reduce exposure to \"sensitive content,\" like depictions of self-harm. If users are incorrectly identified as being under 18, they will be able to use the identity-verification service Persona to restore their full access.

In August, OpenAI said it would release parental controls to help them understand and shape how their teens are using ChatGPT. The following month, OpenAI rolled out its parental controls and said it was working to build an age prediction system. The company also convened a council of eight experts in October who will provide insight into how AI could affect users' mental health, emotions and motivation. OpenAI said Tuesday that it will continue to improve the accuracy of its age prediction model over time.

    "body": "Water is a finite resource — and increasingly a national security issue, analysts told CNBC. Water demand is expected to outpace supply by as much as 40% in 2030, according to a 2023 landmark report on the economics of water. At the same time, climate change is affecting weather patterns and once water-abundant areas are running dry. As a result, more water needs to be moved around to ensure access.Freshwater is used in everything from manufacturing to agriculture, and demand is set to increase as the population grows and thirsty AI data centers are built.As water is increasingly seen as a strategic asset, market watchers are looking to Greenland's freshwater reserves as a potential resource. The Danish territory has itself recognized the strategic potential and has long looked to capitalize on the asset.\"The potential for water is manifold, since clean, fresh water can be used as drinking water and water for food production, for example, but also as bulk water for factories, farms or a contribution to bulk water supply,\" according to a statement from the government of Greenland on its website. \"There are many possibilities.\" CNBC reached out to Greenland officials for further comment.The changing flow of waterOnly about 3% of the world's water is freshwater, providing the basis for suitable drinking water, and an even smaller amount of that can be readily accessed. \"Historically we have just continued to drill down water tables deeper and deeper, but now we're at the point where the aquifers cannot replenish themselves. It takes a long time for the surface water to percolate down,\" said Noah Ramos, an analyst who covers innovation at Alpine Macro with expertise in water technology. He added that simply drilling deeper can no longer be \"relied on.\" Resource nationalism has become a \"defining\" geopolitical play, he said — and that includes water. \"So water has inherently become a strategic asset.\"watch now\"In my view, right now, the nations that don't have it as a strategic asset are better positioned in the long run\" because it forces them to innovate, Ramos added. He pointed to the Middle East and its investment in technologies like desalination, which converts seawater into drinking water, and Israel, which recycles most of its water. The United States, South America, and Canada have historically had abundant water but are facing new levels of water stress, putting them in a sticky position, Ramos said. To be sure, half of the world's population experiences water scarcity for at least one month a year, throwing public health and food security into question. Notably, China is bolstering its water infrastructure. Investment hit around $182 billion alone in 2025 as part of the country's National Water Network strategy, per a government release. The eastern power has uneven distribution of water, as does the U.S. The U.S. has its own water strategy, while the European Commission has instigated a \"water resilience\" plan. Attempts to tap 'frozen capital'The majority of the world's freshwater is locked up in glaciers and ice caps, primarily in Antarctica and Greenland; each year up to 300 billion tons of water melt from the Greenlandic ice sheet, per the territory's government.\"Greenland's freshwater reserves, a massive 10% of all reserves found on Earth, can mostly be understood as frozen capital, not a readily available supply,\" Nick Kraft, senior analyst working on water, agriculture and responsible investing at Eurasia Group, told CNBC.\"Greenland's water is a strategic asset and a niche business opportunity, but it's not a practical near-term fix for global water stress or demand,\" he said. Still, some are hoping to capitalize on the meltwater as climate change accelerates. Notably, Arctic Water Bank, a startup, planned to build a dam to capture meltwater and export it internationally. It is unclear what happened to the company, but no dam has been built. A different company, Inland Ice, bottles it as premium high-purity drinking water, to Kraft's point. Five businesses currently have active 20-year licenses, including Greenland Water Bank, which is reportedly associated with Ronald Lauder, the billionaire Estée Lauder heir. \"Authorities have entertained proposals as ambitious as building a dam for water export,\" Kraft said. \"But the real-world track record is telling: what's actually happened so far has been small, premium boutique exports, while many bigger export-at-scale ideas have been announced and then stalled.\"Exporting water isn't easy due to its weight, Erik Swyngedouw, a University of Manchester professor who covers the intersection of resources and governance, told CNBC. \"The cost is gigantic,\" he said. \"There have been attempts to bulk water transport [overseas]; none of them have been viable in any kind of way.\" Pipes containing drinking water are shown at the Poseidon Water desalination plant in Carlsbad, California, U.S., June 22, 2021. Picture taken June 22, 2021.Mike Blake | ReutersIt is common to move water by land, be it via canal systems or huge infrastructure networks. However, it has been shipped in emergency situations, notably to Barcelona in 2008 and 2024 during severe drought.\"It's actually extremely difficult to make money from water — very, very difficult. Despite 20 years of attempts to privatize water, it has not been a great success,\" Swyngedouw said. While some geopolitical tensions have involved water disputes — China's plans for the world's largest dam sparked concerns from India and Bangladesh, for instance — Swyngedouw said it is more likely that intra-state frictions would arise due to the inequitable distribution of water. \"I'm sure that part of the uprising that is going on in Iran has to do with the gigantic drought that has been going on in Iran for a while now, and makes life in Iran extremely difficult,\" he added.The country is experiencing its sixth year of drought, with some cities facing regular interruptions to water access.When asked if it is in a government's interest to secure water resources to prevent civil unrest, Swyngedouw said that \"not all the states are the same.\"Read more\"So the Iranian state has systematically neglected the provision of these basic infrastructures, with the consequences that we know, and it has done that for geopolitical reasons. It is putting all its money in the military, that's basically the choice they had,\" he added. Swyngedouw called for greater emphasis by governments on provisioning water as a public service. Kraft added: \"Water is increasingly treated like a strategic asset — closer to critical infrastructure than a commodity — as climate volatility and demand growth turn water insecurity into a national security issue. This will likely bring more headlines on its water export potential, but I don't suspect anything material [will] change through the end of the decade.\"\"Even if Greenland's freshwater won't be exported at scale anytime soon, it still matters geopolitically.\"",

Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold jumped to a record high as Asia-Pacific markets slid Wednesday, with investors seeking safe havens after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened fresh tariffs on countries resisting the transfer of Greenland to the United States.Spot gold prices rose over 1% to an all-time high of $4,813 per ounce.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was 0.12% lower,  while the mainland's CSI 300 inched 0.11% higher.Japan's Nikkei 225 lost 1.28%, while the Topix declined 1.09%. South Korea's Kospi was 1.09% lower while the small-cap Kosdaq fell 2.2%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.34%.Trump said Saturday that exports from eight European countries would face tariffs of 10% from Feb. 1, rising to 25% by June 1 if talks fail to deliver U.S. control of mineral-rich Greenland.He also threatened to slap 200% tariffs on French wine and champagne, following reports that President Emmanuel Macron was unwilling to join his proposed \"Board of Peace.\" Trump further criticized the U.K., calling its plan to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, which is home to a joint U.K.-U.S. military base, to Mauritius an \"act of great stupidity,\" citing the move as further justification for acquiring Greenland on national security grounds.European leaders have labeled President Donald Trump's latest tariff threats \"unacceptable\" and are reportedly weighing retaliatory measures. France is said to be urging the European Union to deploy its strongest economic response tool, the so-called Anti-Coercion Instrument.U.S. stock futures rose slightly in early Asian hours after major averages saw their worst day in three months.Overnight in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 870.74 points, or 1.76%, to end the session at 48,488.59.

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe saga over President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape the Federal Reserve has another twist to it, revolving over whether current Chair Jerome Powell will leave after his term at the helm is finished.Powell is done as the central bank leader on May 15, and it's highly likely Trump will nominate his successor long before then. In fact, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that the long-awaited pick could come as soon as next week.However, Powell's 14-year term as governor stretches to Jan. 31, 2028. Historical precedent has been for almost all outgoing Fed chairs to leave their governor roles as well, but Powell could decide to buck that pattern if he feels threats to central bank independence are stark enough to necessitate him staying. That's what Marriner Eccles did in the late 1940s as he viewed his removal by then-President Harry Truman as a political move.Increasingly vocal Trump has gotten increasingly vocal about controlling the Fed. That has happened through persistent criticism of Powell and his colleagues, his own appointments, as well as saying that he thinks the president should be consulted on interest rate decisions.Some on Wall Street think the prospect of Trump gaining further control of the Fed Board of Governors and using that to steer monetary policy might convince Powell to stay on. Such speculation has heightened in recent days following revelations that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential criminal prosecution and Powell's public statement that a related subpoena is \"pretext\" for Trump in his push to control the Fed.The sequence of events \"makes it much more likely that Powell, [Fed Governor Michael] Barr and others will stay on after May,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a recent note. Though Barr's term runs into 2032, there also had been some chatter that he might choose to walk away. Barr previously had been the vice chair of bank supervision but left the post shortly after Trump's second stint as president began, heading off a potential move by Trump to replace him. He was replaced in the supervisory post by Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee during his first term.Similarly, Philip Jefferson, the vice chair of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, also could choose to stay or leave a seat that doesn't expire until January 2036. watch nowBut speculation on the Street is increasing that the threats to Fed independence could raise the possibility that all the current governors stay on. \"We think the probability of Chair Powell remaining on the Board as a governor after his chairmanship expires in May has increased with the release of his statement,\" Nomura economists said in a note. \"Trump's attempt to influence monetary policy could encourage pushback from current FOMC participants.\"Markets see Powell outTraders, though, are betting that Powell leaves.Prediction markets site Kalshi currently has odds on Powell leaving before August 2026 at 70%, a bet that implies he would leave the seat either immediately or shortly after being replaced as chair, assuming Trump's nominee clears the Senate. Sen. Thom Tillis, R- N.C., has vowed to block any Fed appointments until the Department of Justice issue is resolved.For his part, Powell has refrained from addressing the issue. A Fed spokesman contacted by CNBC.com said there would be no comment from the chair's office.At a news conference after the Fed's last meeting in December, Powell also dodged a question about the issue, saying only, \"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair. I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"In the meantime, Trump's efforts to push Powell out of his office could backfire, hardening the position of other Fed officials at a time when the president continues to push for lower rates.\"The bottom line is that Trump's push for Fed compliance ironically may lead to more Fed independence,\" wrote market veteran Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research. \"Accordingly, President Trump's appointee for Fed chair may be less able to forge a consensus around his or her views than past Fed chairs have been — giving Trump less control over the Fed's actions than Trump may anticipate.\"watch now",

    "body": "A United Airlines airplane at the George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Nov. 6, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines on Tuesday said it could generate record earnings this year thanks to strong travel demand, with sales of premium seats, business travel and no-frills tickets robust in recent weeks.The carrier expects adjusted earnings per share of between $12 and $14 this year, in line with the $13.16 analysts expected. For the first quarter, United forecast per-share earnings of $1 to $1.50, while analysts had estimated $1.13 a share. United joined its rival Delta Air Lines in forecasting potential record earnings for the year. The two carriers accounted for almost all of the U.S. airline industry's profit in the first nine months of 2025. Other airlines are set to report later this month.watch nowUnited's unit revenue fell 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared with last year. Still, United said premium revenue rose 9% in the fourth quarter and 11% for the full year over 2024. Restrictive basic-economy ticket sales, which compete with discount airlines, were up 7% in the last three months of 2025.Most airlines are chasing revenue from higher-priced tickets like first class, racing to add in fresh, new cabins that command a premium. Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $3.10 adjusted vs. $2.94 expectedRevenue: $15.4 billion vs. $15.4 billion expectedThe carrier's fourth-quarter profit rose 6% from a year earlier to $1.04 billion, or $3.19 a share, while capacity rose 6.5% from the same period in 2024. Adjusting for one-time items, United posted earnings of $1.01 billion, or $3.10 a share.United CEO Scott Kirby has expressed confidence in the airline's growth plan, saying in an interview with CNBC last year that \"customers are choosing us.\"The longest-ever government shutdown, in the fourth quarter, hit pretax United results by $250 million, the company said. Air traffic controller shortages sparked delays and dented bookings but travel recovered, airline executives said.  United reported adjusted, full-year 2025 earnings of $10.20 a share, up 8% year over year, after the carrier had previously lowered its forecast for the year.

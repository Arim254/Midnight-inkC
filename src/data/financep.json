    "body": "With open enrollment season in full swing, more Americans than ever will be able to fund tax-advantaged accounts aimed at health-care costs next year.Embedded in the so-called \"big beautiful\" bill passed in July are three provisions that expand access to health savings accounts, accounts available to those enrolled in a high-deductible health insurance plan.The changes are likely to attract 3 to 4 million new HSA participants in 2026, according to estimates from Morningstar.Like a flexible spending account, an HSA is funded with pre-tax dollars and can be used to cover medical costs throughout the year. Unlike an FSA, the money doesn't have a \"use it or lose it\" provision. Rather, the funds sit in an account you own and can take with you should you switch jobs.Another feature that sets HSAs apart: You can invest the money in the likes of stocks, bonds or exchange-traded funds. And if you invest the money rather than spending it on pressing health-care needs, that's where some serious advantages kick in, experts say.\"An HSA is indeed one of the most powerful, yet underutilized, financial tools available, especially considering its unique triple tax advantage — contributions are tax-deductible, growth is tax-free and withdrawals for qualified medical expenses are also tax-free,\" Sean Lovison, a certified financial planner and founder of Purpose Built Financial Services, previously told CNBC Make It.HSAs are expanding to three groups of peopleGenerally, to qualify for an HSA, you have to be enrolled in a high-deductible plan. For 2026, that means one with a deductible of at least $1,700 for individuals or $3,400 for families. You can't have any disqualifying health-care coverage, be enrolled in Medicare or be claimed as a dependent on someone else's tax return, among other requirements.Under the new bill, three groups of people are now eligible for an HSA for whom rules had previously been either murky or prohibitive.1. Everyone enrolled in bronze and catastrophic plansInsurance plans available on the Affordable Care Act marketplace generally fall into one of five categories: platinum, gold, silver, bronze and catastrophic. Generally, platinum plans have higher premiums and lower deductibles, and bronze and catastrophic plans (the latter are only available to people under 30 and some people with limited incomes) have lower premiums and higher deductibles.Until recently, enrollees in these plans were HSA-eligible on a case-by-case basis. The new bill makes anyone covered under a bronze or catastrophic plan eligible for an HSA.While catastrophic plans aren't widely used, about 7.2 million Americans are currently covered under bronze plans, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.   2. People who use direct primary care servicesUnder the new law, people enrolled in direct primary care services are eligible for an HSA, provided that their coverage meets the other HDHP requirements.Under the DPC model, offered through providers such as One Medical, patients pay a recurring fee for a series of services that don't get billed to insurance — a convention that put it in a legal gray area when it came to HSA eligibility.\"This is really more clearing up an ambiguity issue rather than something that's going to be a paradigm shift for folks,\" says Jake Spiegel, senior research associate at the Employee Benefits Research Institute. \"What the bill says is, you can do this and still contribute to an HSA, and that's totally OK.\"3. Some people who use telehealthUnder pandemic-era legislation, including the CARES Act, high-deductible plans could waive the deductible on telehealth services — regardless of whether they were preventative — and still qualify for HSA eligibility.Those rules lapsed at the end of 2024, but the new bill reinstated them and made them permanent.That doesn't mean that high-deductible plans must offer telehealth services for enrollees to be eligible for an HSA. Rather, such plans cannot be excluded simply because they allow participants to receive telehealth without contributing toward the deductible.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Signage is displayed outside the Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. headquarters in Cockeysville, Maryland, U.S.Andrew Harrer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSinclair disclosed a stake in fellow broadcast station owner E.W. Scripps on Monday, in a move to push toward a merger of the companies.Sinclair, which acquired a roughly 8% position in Scripps per the filing, recently launched a strategic review of its own business that could result in a tie-up. Scripps, for its part, has seen its struggles mount in the competitive industry and is among the smallest of its peers.In the filing, Sinclair said it has been engaged in \"constructive\" discussions regarding a deal and believes that, if it were to reach an agreement, a transaction could be completed within nine to 12 months.Sinclair said in the filing that based on trading multiples, there would be an expected $300 million in synergies if a merger were to take place.Scripps' stock rose more than 40% on Monday while Sinclair's stock was up 7%.Sinclair, which acquired the stake for about $15.6 million, declined to comment beyond the SEC filing.In a statement on Monday, Scripps said its board \"will take all steps appropriate to protect the company and the company's shareholders from the opportunistic actions of Sinclair or anyone else.\"\"Scripps' board of directors and management are focused on driving value for all of the company's shareholders through the continued execution of its strategic plan,\" the company said in its statement. \"The board and management are aligned on doing only what is in the best interest of all of the company's shareholders as well as its employees and the many communities and audiences it serves across the United States.\"The statement added that the board continues to evaluate \"any transactions and other alternatives that would enhance the value of the company and would be in the best interest of all company shareholders.\"Broadcast TV station group owners have suffered like the rest of media companies in recent years due to the shift away from the traditional pay-TV bundles and toward streaming. These broadcast stations, for the most part, make the majority of their money from so-called retransmission fees, which are paid on a per-subscriber rate by traditional TV distributors.Broadcast station owners like Sinclair have been eager to do mergers as they push for deregulation under the Trump administration.In August, Nexstar Media Group, the biggest owner of these stations, agreed to acquire Tegna for $3.54 billion.Sinclair, meanwhile, is also considering spinning off or splitting its ventures unit, which includes pay-TV network The Tennis Channel and marketing technology business Compulse, which was recently rebranded to Digital Remedy.Sinclair and its advisors held discussions with potential merger partners earlier this year, CNBC previously reported.",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testified in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee in the Senate Hart building on Capitol Hill, on Thursday, June 8, 2017.Cheriss May | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA federal magistrate judge on Monday raised the possibility that the indictment against former FBI director James Comey on charges of lying to Congress — which was obtained at the behest of President Donald Trump — could soon be dismissed because of potential \"misconduct\" by the prosecution.The suggestion by Judge William Fitzpatrick came as he ordered the Department of Justice to release all grand jury material related to Comey's case to him by the end of the day.Comey's defense lawyers had requested that material in order to move that the indictment be tossed based on alleged irregularities by interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan when she presented the case to the grand jury and asked it to charge him.Fitzpatrick said Halligan had potentially violated court orders and Comey's Fourth Amendment rights, which \"establish a reasonable basis to question whether the government's conduct was willful or in reckless disregard of the law.\"\"The facts set forth herein and the particularized findings of the Court establish that 'ground[s] may exist to dismiss the indictment because of a matter that occurred before the grand jury,'\" Fitzpatrick wrote in his ruling in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.Read more CNBC politics coverageAI could be causing ‘quiet time’ in labor market, top Trump economic aide Hassett saysTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseFormer Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler violated trading rules while at central bank: ethics reportWoman pleads guilty to lying about astronaut wife accessing bank account from Space StationThe judge said he \"is finding that the government's actions in this case — whether purposeful, reckless or negligent — raise genuine issues of misconduct.\"The judge said that he recognized that ordering the DOJ to release to Comey all material related to the grand jury that indicted him, as well as an audio recording of the proceedings, is \"an extraordinary remedy.\"\"But given the factually based challenges the defense has raised to the government's conduct and the prospect that government misconduct may have tainted the grand jury proceedings, disclosure of grand jury materials under these unique circumstances is necessary to fully protect the rights of the accused,\" Fitzpatrick wrote.The judge noted that the only witness to testify before the grand jury, who was an FBI agent, was notified by another agent shortly before he testified that evidence obtained in the investigation of Comey might have included material protected by attorney-client privilege.Fitzpatrick also said he had identified two statements by Halligan made to the grand jury \"that on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\" One of the statements, which the judge called \"a fundamental and highly prejudicial misstatement of the law,\" suggested to the grand jury that Comey does not have a Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial.CNBC has requested comment from Halligan's office.Comey was indicted on Sept. 25 in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on charges of making a false statement and obstruction, in connection with his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020.During that testimony, Comey had denied authorizing another person at the FBI to act as an anonymous source for news reports about an investigation of 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her emails.Comey, who denies any wrongdoing, was indicted only days after Trump urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute the former FBI director, who has been a longtime foe of the president.Halligan was handpicked by Trump to lead the Eastern District of Virginia's office after her predecessor balked at seeking an indictment of Comey.Comey's trial is currently set for Jan. 5.",

Eduardo Munoz | ReutersNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams met with Wall Street's dealers last week about a key lending facility, the Financial Times reported, citing three individuals familiar with the matter.The meeting, which took place on the sidelines on Wednesday at the Fed's annual Treasury market conference, included representatives from many of the 25 primary dealers of banks that underwrite the government's debt, according to the report. The meeting participants were members of banks' teams that specialize in fixed income markets, the report said.CNBC has confirmed the meeting took place.Williams sought feedback from these dealers on the use of the Fed's standing repo facility — a permanent lending tool that allows eligible financial institutions to borrow cash from the central bank in return for high-quality collateral such as Treasury bonds. The tool would allow institutions to sell securities to the Fed with an agreement to repurchase them at a later time, essentially acting as a backstop for markets.\"President Williams convened the New York Fed's primary trading counterparties [primary dealers] to continue engagement on the purpose of the standing repo facility as a tool of monetary policy implementation and to solicit feedback that ensures it remains effective for rate control,\" a spokesperson for the New York Fed told the Financial Times, which reported the news on Friday.The meeting took place amid brewing concerns about stress in parts of the U.S. financial system and signs of tighter market liquidity.Roberto Perli, who manages the Fed's System Open Market Account, which is the central bank's bonds and cash holdings, said Wednesday that firms in need of the central bank's standing repo facility should \"be used whenever it is economically sensible to do so.\"The New York Fed did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.Read the complete Financial Times report here.",

But Novo Nordisk said the cash-pay cost of the highest dose of Ozempic will remain $499 per month. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk launched a temporary introductory offer, which will allow new cash-paying patients to access the two lowest doses of Wegovy and Ozempic for $199 per month for the first two months of treatment. After that period, people move to the new standard monthly direct-to-consumer price. The company's introductory offer ends on March 31. The announcements come days after President Donald Trump struck deals with Novo Nordisk and chief rival Eli Lilly to make their popular GLP-1 drugs easier for Americans to access and afford. Those agreements will involve cutting the prices the government pays for the drugs, introducing Medicare coverage of obesity drugs for the first time for certain patients and offering discounted medicines on the government's new direct-to-consumer website launching in January called TrumpRx. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugs\"Our new savings offers provide immediate impact, bringing forward greater cost savings for those who are currently without coverage or choose to self-pay,\" said Dave Moore, Novo Nordisk's head of U.S. operations, said in a release. \"It is part of a larger strategy to expand access that includes building relationships with telehealth providers and major retailers, expanding coverage, and working with the Administration to lower costs for people living with chronic diseases like obesity.\"The Trump administration said starting doses of existing injections like Wegovy and Eli Lilly's weight loss drug Zepbound will be $350 per month on TrumpRx, but will \"trend down\" to $245 per month over a two-year period. On the day the deals were announced, Eli Lilly said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available at $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month.Novo Nordisk's new cash-pay offers are available through Wegovy.com or Ozempic.com, the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, NovoCare, and other participating organizations and telehealth providers that work directly with the drugmaker, including Costco, GoodRx, WeightWatchers, Ro, LifeMD and eMed. ",

    "body": "Warren Buffett ahead of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholder Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, in 2023.David A. Grogan | CNBCAlphabet shares jumped Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new stake in the Google parent, marking one of the conglomerate's most significant technology bets in years.Alphabet shares were up about 3%, bucking some weakness in most technology shares to start the week.A quarterly 13F filing showed Berkshire owned roughly $4.3 billion worth of Alphabet as of Sept. 30, making it the firm's 10th largest equity holding. The move surprised many Buffett watchers given the billionaire's decades-long hesitation toward high-growth tech companies. Buffett has always seen Apple, Berkshire's largest holding, as a consumer products company.The Alphabet investment likely came from one of his two lieutenants, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who increasingly influence Berkshire's $300 billion stock portfolio. Though its size suggests it likely had the blessing of Buffett, who is stepping down as CEO at the end of this year. The pair have been responsible for many of Berkshire's tech-leaning investments, including a stake in Amazon initiated in 2019. Berkshire still owns $2.2 billion worth of Amazon today.Alphabet has been one of the stock market's biggest winners this year, rising 46% as investors reward its accelerating artificial intelligence push and rapidly improving cloud profitability. Revenue growth from Google Cloud, once a margin drag, has turned into a key earnings driver.Changing of the guard?Bill Stone, Glenview Trust Company's chief investment officer, said the Alphabet purchase could reflect a broader approach to technology investments as leadership transitions to the next generation.\"Perhaps the purchase of Alphabet signals a widening of the circle of competence into technology,\" Stone said.Longtime lieutenant Greg Abel is set to take the reins for 95-year-old Buffett in January. The Oracle of Omaha will remain chairman of the board.Despite the stellar rally in 2025, Alphabet's valuation remains lower than many of its AI-driven megacap peers. The stock trades at 25.5 times next year's earnings, compared with Microsoft at 32.0, Broadcom at 50.8 and Nvidia at 41.9, according to FactSet.That relative discount, combined with Alphabet's massive cash flow and dominant market position, may have made the shares particularly attractive to Buffett's team.\"We think Berkshire likely finds more comfort investing in GOOG over other tech plays given the high free cash flow potential of its core business coupled with an attractive valuation at about 22x 2027 EPS amid a healthy top-line growth trajectory,\" Angelo Zino, Alphabet analyst at CFRA, said in a note to clients.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAlphabet year to dateBuffett has admitted missing Google was one of his biggest investing mistakes. He had a front-row seat: Geico, Berkshire's auto insurance unit, was one of Google's earliest major advertisers. The company paid about $10 every time a user clicked one of its search ads in the early days of online marketing.\"I had seen the product work, and I knew the kind of margins [they had],\" Buffett said in 2018. \"I didn't know enough about technology to know whether this really was the one that would stop the competitive race.\"",

    "body": "Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital LP, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange in New York City, U.S., May 7, 2025.Brendan McDermid | ReutersWall Street veteran Jeffrey Gundlach said many assets are extremely overpriced right now, urging investors to keep about 20% of their portfolios in cash to protect against a major downturn.Speaking on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast released Monday, the DoubleLine Capital CEO warned that the stock market looks dangerously speculative, saying it's among the least healthy he's seen in his entire career. The Dartmouth grad, who started his Wall Street career in the mid-1980s at TCW Group, today sees speculative excess in AI-related stocks and data-center investments, cautioning that momentum investing during a boom can end badly.Gundlach said he is especially worried about the rapid growth of private credit, a $1.7 trillion market that lends directly to companies. He said lenders are making \"garbage loans\" similar to what happened before the 2008 mortgage crisis, pointing to recent failures like auto lender Tricolor and car parts supplier First Brands Group as early warning signs.\"The next big crisis in the financial markets is going to be private credit,\" he said. \"It has the same trappings as subprime mortgage repackaging had back in 2006.\"Gundlach also criticized the push to sell private credit funds to retail investors, calling it a \"perfect mismatch\" where there's a promise for easy withdrawals despite the fact those assets can't typically be sold quickly. If investors pull money out, funds may be forced to sell at steep losses, he said.Despite his warnings, Gundlach admits it's hard to profit directly from this view. He won't short junk bonds, for example, because the trade keeps losing money, he said.He said he still likes gold but has reduced his recommended allocation to 15%. Gundlach had recommended a 25% gold position in mid-September, based on his belief that inflation would stay stubbornly elevated because of the impact of tariffs on import prices.",

    "body": "A SK Hynix Inc. 12-layer HBM3E memory chip displayed at the Semiconductor Exhibition in Seoul, South Korea. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChipmakers and analysts are warning of a memory chip shortage that could hit the consumer electronics and automotive industries next year, as companies prioritize massive demand from the artificial intelligence boom. In an earnings call on Friday, the CEO of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp, China's largest contract chipmaker, said that fears of a memory chip shortage were prompting its customers to hold back orders for other types of chips used in their products.\"Everyone is hesitant to place too many orders or ship too much in the first quarter of next year because they don't know how many mobile phones, cars, or other products [the memory chip industry] can supply,\" said Zhao Haijun, SMIC's co-CEO, according to a Google translation. Analysts say these supply constraint concerns come as chip manufacturers focus on advanced memory chips used in artificial intelligence computing, with less focus on production needed for consumer products. \"The AI build-out is absolutely eating up a lot of the available chip supply, and 2026 looks to be far bigger than this year in terms of overall demand,\" Dan Nystedt, vice president of research at TriOrient, told CNBC. AI servers primarily run on processors from chip designers like Nvidia. These AI processors heavily rely on a type of memory known as High-Bandwidth Memory or HBM, which has proven extremely lucrative for memory companies like SK Hynix and Micron to pursue. Memory suppliers have been chasing as much of this AI demand as possible thanks to typically high margins, Nystedt said, noting that AI server companies are willing to pay top dollar for premium chips. \"It could be very bad for PCs, laptops, consumer electronics and automotive, which depend on cheap memory chips,\" he said. Perhaps a bigger issue, however, is that the memory industry suffered some severe downturns in 2023 and part of 2024, leading to under-investment in the industry. \"They're building new capacity now, but it will take time to get running.\"Broader impacts In the face of supply constraints, memory companies have reportedly been raising prices of their chips. Just last Friday, Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics had quietly raised prices on select memory chips by as much as 60% compared to September. Samsung didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \"With memory prices rising and availability shrinking, concerns about production bottlenecks are gaining traction,\" M.S. Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC. \"Supply tightness is already hitting low-end smartphones and set-top boxes, but we think the risk could broaden,\" he added. China is \"feeling the pinch more acutely\" due to high reliance on low-cost devices, but Hwang cautioned that the supply constraints were a global problem.  In the meantime, consumers could pay the price of memory shortages. In a report on Monday, tech-focused market intelligence and consulting firm TrendForce predicted that the memory industry has begun a \"robust upward pricing cycle,\" which could force downstream brands to hike retail prices, adding pressure on the consumer market.As a result, the research group predicted increased price and demand pressures for consumer products like smartphones and notebooks. ",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesThe standard Medicare Part B premium will increase to $202.90 per month in 2026, up $17.90, or 9.7%, from $185 per month in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The increase marks the second-highest Part B premium increase in dollars, according to Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. The highest increase of $21.60 per month happened in 2022.Retirees may see this as a \"continuation in relentless cost increases,\" Johnson said via email.Medicare Part B is medical insurance that covers both medically necessary and preventive services.Part B premiums are typically deducted directly from Social Security checks. Any increase to those monthly premium payments affects how much of an increase Social Security beneficiaries may see in their monthly checks in 2026.The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment for 2026, which is expected to add about $56 per month on average to retirement benefits.The Part B premium for 2026 may be seen by beneficiaries as \"taking a significant chunk of or even most of their COLA,\" Johnson said.A hold harmless provision ensures that Social Security benefit payments do not decrease from one year to the next as a result of Medicare Part B premium increases. That said, other automatic deductions from Social Security checks for premiums tied to private Medicare Advantage insurance plans or Part D prescription drug coverage may reduce benefits, according to Johnson.The $202.90 standard Part B premium rate will apply to individuals with modified adjusted gross income less than or equal to $109,000, and for married couples who file taxes jointly with modified AGI less than or equal to $218,000.Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries pay what is called an income-related monthly adjustment amount that is added to their monthly premiums if their incomes are higher, according to CMS.The annual deductible for Part B will be $283 in 2026, according to the agency, a 10% increase from the $257 annual deductible in effect for 2025.The increases to both Medicare Part B premiums and deductibles are primarily due to \"projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,\" according to the CMS fact sheet on the price changes.Income-related adjustment amounts are typically based on tax returns filed two years prior. Beneficiaries who have since had their income go down, or who have experienced a qualifying life event, may report that by submitting a form to the Social Security Administration.",

    "body": "Joe TerranovaScott Mlyn | CNBCJoe Terranova plans to stick by the winning quantitative approach that's allowed his Virtus Terranova U.S. Quality Momentum ETF (JOET) to identify stocks like Palantir early before the rest of the market has piled in over the last five years.The ETF — created by Terranova, chief market strategist for Virtus Investment Partners — has risen 10.9% this year, beating the 6.8% gain in the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) in that time.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJOET, RSP YTD chartTo select the ETF's holdings, Terranova follows a strict set of rules-based principles. First, he and his team screen the 500 largest U.S. companies for stocks with the highest positive momentum, calculated using their total returns over 12 months. The top 250 stocks are then included in the selection list.The securities are then graded on three quality factors — return on equity, debt-to-equity ratio and annualized sales growth rate over the past three years. The top 125 stocks with the highest composite scores make up the equal-weighted ETF's holdings.Although the fund isn't actively managed in a traditional sense, it is rebalanced every quarter. Terranova said he doesn't miss the emotions of actively managing a fund, since his rules-based strategy has helped him capture alpha that he otherwise might have missed.\"In January of '24, Palantir qualified. Wasn't in the S&P at this point, because we're not scanning the S&P,\" Terranova said in the \"Quality in the Streets, Momentum in the Sheets\" episode of The Compound and Friends podcast with fellow CNBC contributor Josh Brown. \"I am telling you 100% I would have sold the stock if I had discretion six times over. I would have found six different times to sell that stock, the strategy, the discipline.\"Terranova estimated that he bought into Palantir while it was trading around $16.76. Shares of the analytics tools builder traded around $173 on Monday and have soared 129% in 2025.The investor also thanked his approach for capturing the market's \"personality\" and helping him get in early on other themes, like the current healthcare rally. On the flip side, Terranova's strategy has also helped him sell out of positions that he otherwise might have grown attached to.\"I have more affection towards the holdings that have been there for multiple quarters,\" he told CNBC on the sidelines of the podcast episode recording. \"Tesla's a great example. Tesla's revenue growth flattened out, and I could see what was coming — that we were going to sell Tesla. And on Halloween, the strategy liquidated Tesla, which looks like a pretty good move.\"Going forward, Terranova intends to build a suite of ETF products that applies his investing rules to other assets outside of U.S. large-cap stocks, such as small-caps and European equities. He believes his strategy will continue to succeed in allowing him to create a core equity holding and shock absorber for investors' portfolios.\"Momentum is a reflection of technical confidence. Quality is a reflection of fundamental confidence. And you want to invest around the confidence,\" Terranova said to CNBC. \"To me, that's where you get the long-term success.\"The JOET fund has an expense ratio of 0.29% and has around $240 million in assets under management.",

I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom.\"Gaming company Valve garnered significant buzz last week after announcing its new Steam Machine, a console-PC hybrid that can run PC games on a television or as a normal gaming computer.\"Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start,\" Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer wrote in an X post congratulating Valve.Read more CNBC tech newsDespite Coinbase departure, only 28 companies have left Delaware this yearThe question everyone in AI is asking: How long before a GPU depreciates?'Vibe revenue': AI companies admit they're worried about a bubbleWall Street cools on Oracle's buildout plans as debt concerns mount: 'AI sentiment is waning'Although Take-Two's most high-profile titles, such as its \"Grand Auto Theft\" and \"Borderlands\" series, are largely played through console and PC, the company has invested heavily in its mobile segment after the mobile gaming industry rocketed during the pandemic.In 2022, the company bought mobile developer Zynga for $12.7 billion, the largest gaming acquisition at the time.The lofty purchase has since paid off, with Take-Two's mobile division leading the company's revenue during the second quarter despite the release of notable titles including \"Borderlands 4,\" \"NBA 2K26\" and \"Mafia: The Old Country.\"Mobile games from developers like Zynga, Rollic and Nordeus accounted for 46% of Take-Two's net revenue during the quarter, while console sold slightly less at 41% and PC and other platforms contributed 13%.\"Mobile, of course, is taken with you, it's repeatable, and it's enjoyable,\" Zelnick said Monday. \"And I do think because it appeals to the broadest possible audience, it will probably continue to grow more rapidly.\"The CEO said during the earnings call that the company expected the mobile unit to increase by around 10% in the next quarter.Although mobile gaming slowed down after seeing unprecedented highs during Covid, the market is seeing some reacceleration this year.Global mobile game revenue is expected to generate $188.8 billion this year, increasing 3.4% from last year, according to research from Newzoo.

By comparison, bachelor's degree recipients from private institutions graduate with an average debt of roughly $34,420 per borrower, the College Board found.\"Public universities provide the most affordable path to a high-quality college education,\" said Waded Cruzado, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. \"There has been even more progress on net tuition and fees, what students actually pay,\" he said.In fact, few families pay the school's sticker cost. Altogether, nearly 75% of all undergraduates receive some type of financial aid, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.'College affordability is a huge concern'Still, with the price at some schools nearing six figures a year, cost can be a major deterrent. \"College affordability is a huge concern,\" said Robert Franek, editor-in-chief of The Princeton Review.For a majority of students and their families, financial aid is the most important factor in decisions about choosing where to attend school and how to pay for it. The amount of aid offered matters, as does the breakdown between grants, scholarships, work-study opportunities and student loans. \"What matters to parents and students shopping for colleges is the sticker prices of the schools they are considering, not how those prices compare to those of previous years — or even decades ago,\" Franek said.To that end, it may be a mistake to rule out private colleges based on cost alone, according to Franek. When it comes to offering aid, private schools typically have more money to spend, and many schools are giving out substantial aid packages — often in the form of merit aid, or \"free money,\" he said.At the end of the day, \"It's not the sticker price that matters most but what the family will need to pay, based on — hopefully — the financial aid the student gets.\"Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "A Ford logo on a Ford F-150 pickup truck for sale in Encinitas, California, U.S. Oct. 20, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — Ford Motor is partnering with Amazon to let the automaker's franchised dealers sell certified preowned vehicles through the online retail giant.The new program will allow customers to secure financing, start paperwork and schedule a pickup time for the vehicles at participating Ford dealers, the companies announced Monday. Some steps, such as a final signature, may still need to be completed in person, Ford said.The deal comes two years after Amazon said it would allow auto dealers to sell cars through its site, starting with vehicles from South Korean automaker Hyundai.The deals between Amazon and the two automakers differ, though, as Hyundai's involves new vehicles rather than certified preowned. CPO vehicles are used but have been inspected, refurbished and certified by the manufacturer or dealer. They're considered a better quality of used vehicles than cars without the designation and have warranties, like a new vehicle.Amazon earlier this year also partnered with car rental company Hertz to sell used vehicles through its site.watch nowFord on Monday said more than 160 of its roughly 2,900 U.S. retailers have \"raised their hands\" and started the process with Amazon. Thus far, about a dozen have fully onboarded and launched, with about 10 more launching next week, the company said.\"The addition of Ford certified pre-owned vehicles to Amazon Autos represents an exciting expansion of our store, giving customers access to thousands of quality vehicles backed by Ford's comprehensive inspection and warranty programs,\" Fan Jin, global leader of Amazon Autos, said in a release.Read more CNBC auto newsInside Ford’s new HQ: Rotisserie chickens and design secretsFord partners with Amazon for dealers to sell used vehicles onlineJeep eyes U.S. comeback following yearslong sales troublesTesla recalls 10,500 Powerwall 2 battery systems due to overheating, fire riskFord said it will offer a 14-day or 1,000-mile money-back guarantee, whichever comes first, on vehicles sold through the Amazon tie-up. The automaker also will offer three CPO certification levels of vehicles, with varying warranty coverages.Ford said CPO vehicles are now available on Amazon Autos in Los Angeles, Seattle and Dallas, with plans to expand to additional cities in the coming months.With Amazon's partnerships with Hyundai and Ford, the franchised dealer is still the end seller. Traditional automakers have complex relationships with dealers that are backed in many states by laws that make it difficult or illegal to bypass franchised dealers and sell new vehicles directly to consumers.There are less stringent laws regarding used vehicle sales, which makes it easier for companies such as Carvana, Hertz and others to sell preowned cars and trucks online directly to consumers.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang attends a reception for the 2025 Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering, at St James' Palace in London, Brirain, Nov. 5, 2025.  Yui Mok | Via ReutersNvidia CEO Jensen Huang revealed in October that his company has $500 billion in orders, in 2025 and 2026 combined, for its chips that are at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom.For a company that has seen its quarterly revenue grow nearly 600% over the past four years, Huang's statement was a sign that Nvidia is confident of another year of strong — but slowing — growth for its next cycle of chips, implying that the AI boom still has room to run.\"This is how much business is on the books. Half a trillion dollars worth so far,\" Huang said at the company's GTC conference in Washington.Huang included 2025 revenue so far, sales of Nvidia's current Blackwell graphics processing units and next year's Rubin GPUs and also related parts like networking. After parsing through the details of Huang's remarks, analysts concluded that the statement signaled a meaningfully higher year by revenue in 2026 than Wall Street had previously expected.\"NVDA's disclosures suggest clear upside to current consensus estimates,\" wrote Wolfe Research analyst Chris Caso in a November note. Caso estimated that Huang's data point suggested data center sales that could be $60 billion over prior calendar 2026 estimates. He has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.But Nvidia stock is trading 5% under where it was when Huang called the company's shot on Oct. 28.It's a reflection of the continued debate among investors about the AI boom, and whether a handful of big cloud companies called hyperscalers and AI labs are overspending on infrastructure.When Nvidia reports third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, analysts polled by LSEG are expecting $1.25 in earnings per share on $54.9 billion of sales, which would be a 56% increase on a year-over-year basis. They're also looking for guidance in the January quarter of $61.44 billion, which would indicate a reacceleration of growth.Nvidia doesn't provide more than one quarter of forward-looking guidance at earnings. But anything Huang says about the company's sales backlog and outlook for calendar 2026 will be scrutinized not just for Nvidia's outlook but also that of the broader tech industry. Analysts polled by LSEG currently expect $286.7 billion in sales for Nvidia in 2026.'Insatiable AI appetite'At the Washington conference, Huang said the company has \"visibility\" into that revenue. That's not surprising — Nvidia counts nearly every multitrillion-dollar tech company as a customer, including Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta.During October earnings, all of those companies said they were boosting their capital expenditure spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure, which means Nvidia chips.Hyperscalers' rising capex reflects \"insatiable AI appetite,\" wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer in a note earlier this month. He has a buy rating on Nvidia stock.Nvidia has also been an aggressive dealmaker during the quarter, and analysts will want to hear from Huang about the details of these partnerships.The biggest deal was Nvidia agreeing to invest up to $10 billion in OpenAI equity in exchange for the AI startup buying between 4 million and 5 million GPUs over a period of years. Nvidia also agreed to invest $5 billion in former rival Intel. That deal would see the two chipmakers team up to enable Intel chips to work better with Nvidia GPUs.Nvidia announced in late October it took a $1 billion stake in Nokia to team up to integrate its GPUs into cellular network hardware of the Finnish company. Nvidia also continued investing in various startups.Citi analyst Atif Malik said in a November note that the deal with OpenAI, in particular, will be an investor focus on Wednesday.\"Although concerns around the mix of debt and circular financing around AI capex froth exist, we fundamentally see AI supply below demand,\" Malik wrote. He has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock.Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for AI GPUs. But some of its customers — including Amazon with its Tranium chips, Google with its TPU chips and OpenAI with forthcoming chips made in partnership with Broadcom — have promoted their custom semiconductors, application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, increasingly over the past three months.Huang often speaks generally about Nvidia's views on earnings calls with analysts and could elaborate about how the company sees rising competition, which investors would welcome, according to Citi.All of these projections are without any China sales. The company's Chinese-oriented chip, called the H20, was effectively restricted from being exported earlier this year before Huang made a deal with President Donald Trump in August to get export licenses in exchange for the government getting 15% of China sales.But since then, Nvidia representatives have made gloomy comments about the possibility of significant sales to China, and the company hasn't announced a successor chip to the H20, which is getting old by AI chip standards. Schafer, the Oppenheimer analyst, said he believes China could represent an over $50 billion annual revenue opportunity.When asked by CNBC in late October whether he wants to sell current Blackwell-generation chips to China, Huang said: \"I hope so. But that's a decision for President Trump to make.\"WATCH: It's unlikely that we're in an AI bubble as the market is still behaving rationally: JPM AMwatch now",

    "body": "watch nowActor-entrepreneur Mark Wahlberg paid $37 million for a fully furnished mansion in Delray Beach, Florida, last month. The deal piqued interest and prompted coverage from TMZ to Architectural Digest, with most of the focus on the celebrity buyer.But aside from the name recognition, the home's skyrocketing price over the past five years also makes it stand out.The actor's transaction in October marks the home's fourth sale in that same time period, and a dramatic 118% price increase from its sale in January 2020 when the fully furnished mansion traded for $17 million.The grand entrance to the almost 17,800 sq ft estate known as Palazzo di Lago.Daniel PetroniThe estate, located at 9200 Rockybrook Way, saw a rise in value that outpaced not just the local market, but also many of the top luxury markets in America.In Delray Beach, the average sale price for a single-family luxury home, represented by the top 10% of closed sales, rose by just over 78%; Los Angeles was up 30%; the Hamptons rose 44%; and Manhattan increased just 4.5% according to Elliman Report data from the first quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2025.The home's steep rise in value even outperformed the S&P 500, which was up about 100% over the same time period.One mansion, four salesThe massive resort-style pool in the backyard is flanked by adult palms, a jumbo chess set, fire features, and a waterfall with a grotto below and a hot tub on top.Daniel PetroniRemarkably, the residence has traded hands four times since 2020. Just one real estate broker represented the listing in all four transactions, making the soaring value of the seven-bedroom, 10-bath mansion even more unique.Back in 2020, Douglas Elliman real estate broker Senada Adzem represented the original owners of 9200 Rockybrook, when the house was known as the Sundara estate. Three years later, Adzem represented the mansion's second owners who listed the home again, when it sold for $26 million, up 53% in just three years.A little over a year after buying the place, public records show a trust connected to William Cafaro, the co-president of a retail property development company in Niles, Ohio, and the home's third resident decided to sell. Adzem was once again the listing agent.This transaction was more unusual. Cafaro sold the home as part of a larger $50.5 million deal to purchase a Ferrari-inspired mansion less than half mile up the road in Stone Creek Ranch. Casa Maranello, as it's known, was being sold by local developer Aldo Stark, of Prestige Design Homes, with Adzem as the listing agent.Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash, plus the deed to 9200 Rockybrook Way, which was valued in the deal at the same price he'd paid for it: $26 million. When that sale closed in January 2025, Stark became the fourth owner of the mansion and he immediately started a dramatic multimillion-dollar renovation of the almost 17,800-square-foot megahome. He scrapped the old Sundara name and clad the home's old sheet-rocked walls in polished rare stones and bold high-gloss Guyana wood from Brazil.A side-by-side before and after of the foyer's grand staircase. Stark added a 30-ft tall vegetation wall and finished the adjacent walls in high-gloss Brazilian wood.He installed vibrant green vegetation above a grand stairway and into the ceilings.Stark completely reimagined everything from the kitchen to the clubroom and filled the residence with bespoke furniture.The kitchen before.Daniel PetroniThe kitchen after. The new-look includes counters clad in Orobico Grigio marble, floor-to-ceiling walnut cabinetry, vegetation accents in the ceiling and 30 tear-drop shaped light fixtures.And about two moths after closing, the megahome was listed for sale for a fourth time.  Reemerging with a new look, new name and a new price tag, one of the few things to remain the same was that Adzem was once again the listing agent.  The lounge bar before.Daniel PetroniThe lounge bar after.Daniel PetroniThe home, now called Palazzo di Lago, debuted with an ambitious $45 million asking price, $19 million more than what Stark paid for it two months earlier and 165% more than what it sold for in 2020.By October Adzem closed the fourth deal and delivered Palazzo di Lago to its fifth owner, who the buyer's broker, Michael Costello of Compass, confirmed to CNBC was Mark Wahlberg.One of the mansion's two home offices clad in great wave marble.Daniel PetroniAccording to Florida's Multiple Listing Service, the fully furnished mansion closed at $37 million, $11 million more than what Stark bought it for seven months earlier, and up 118% from its 2020 sale. And Adzem pulled off an uncommon feat in real estate, selling the same house four times in five years in transactions totaling $106 million.Primary bedroomDaniel PetroniFive owners across five years seems like an unusually high turnover rate, but Adzem has a simple explanation.\"People's circumstances change and they have different chapters in their life. So we were privileged to be able to guide this home through different evolutions and different owners and be able to add value to it,\" Adzem said.According to Adzem, the mansion's remarkable appreciation was fueled by a multitude of factors. Here are the top five:1. The pandemicAdzem attributed a large part of the 53% rise in price from 2020 to 2023 to the pandemic, which made demand and prices for homes in South Florida surge.\"After Covid, our market definitely accelerated,\" she told CNBC.Her walk-in closet is Chanel-boutique inspiredDaniel Petroni2. The 'micro-market'Some of the other market dynamics driving the price of Palazzo di Lago are unique to Stone Creek Ranch, which Adzem described as a luxury \"micro-market.\"The exclusive gated community spans about 187 acres with 37 luxury homes each on about 2.5 acre lots. It's a tight supply that's seen pricing dramatically impacted by a wave of new construction homes that have traded at record-breaking prices. Those recent comps helped push the price of Palazzo di Lago higher.Even the price of dirt in Stone Creek Ranch is on a steep rise. Back in 2013, the empty lot at 9200 Rockybrook Way traded for $800,000. In 2021, Adzem sold a comparable 2.5-acre lot for $1.7 million.\"The last one they traded was $6 million,\" Adzem told CNBC. \"However ... there are no vacant lots left in this community.\"And Adzem believes a more than threefold rise in the price of dirt here is just the beginning. She points to the fact that 2.5-acre lots worthy of a megahome are hard to come by in Palm Beach County, and the dwindling supply in this neighborhood in particular will push lot prices even higher. \"I feel like the dirt is going to double because the only upcoming potential sales would be teardowns.\"His closet takes inspiration from Tom Ford.Daniel Petroni3. The power of VIP neighborsAnother market driver: the tiny community's growing list of VIP owners.In 2021, billionaire hedge fund manager and owner of the New York Mets, Steve Cohen purchased the home next door to 9200 Rockybrook Way for about $22 million, according to MLS.\"[Potential buyers] typically do look to know who else owns in the community. That's important to them,\" Adzem said. Rich and famous residents can create a halo effect and make nearby real estate more desirable to potential buyers. And there's no shortage of ultra-high-net-worth neighbors living nearby, including several present and former CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, a former NFL player, and a pop star, according to Adzem and public records.And now some might even see Walhberg's new ownership as adding to the community's allure. Meanwhile, developer Stark just finished construction and recently moved into his own 32,000-square-foot mansion.Daniel Petroni4. Wealth migrationWealthy buyers looking to escape the tax burdens of their home states continue to see the tax advantages offered in Florida as a big draw and that helps drive and sustain demand.\"We saw a big influx and continued influx of buyers from California, from New York, from Connecticut, and they want what you see here,\" Adzem told CNBC.  The open-concept kitchen flows into a family room with faux vegetation that accents the ceiling.Daniel Petroni5. The multimillion-dollar renovationAdzem also credited Stark's renovation with adding to the estate's value.\"He didn't go neutral and he didn't go very light with color scheme. He really wanted to make an impact and put his own taste here,\" Adzem said.Adzem and Stark would only characterize the expense as \"a multimillion-dollar renovation,\" so it's unclear exactly how much it took to turn a home built in 2017 into the new Palazzo di Lago.But Adzem told CNBC the dramatic renovation and the new \"James-Bond-inspired vibe\" were the final catalysts that delivered a buyer willing to pay a premium.Correction: William Cafaro paid for the new home with $24.5 million in cash. A previous version of this story omitted the million. The price of the home rose 53% from 2020 to 2023. An earlier version misstated the percentage.",

Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5% Thursday, extending a pause since May, as policymakers continued to flag household debt as a key risk.The decision was in line with expectations from economists polled by Reuters, and followed the introduction of tighter property measures in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing.In a statement released Thursday, the Bank of Korea cited stable inflation and improving economic growth outlook as the main reasons to extend the pause, while flagging that it was monitoring stability in the housing market and household debt.\"Domestic demand is expected to continue its recovery, led by consumption, and exports are likely to remain favorable for some time owing to the strong semiconductor sector, the central bank said.Still, the BOK warned that uncertainties for the economic growth have increased due to the ongoing trade talks with the U.S., noting that the impacts of U.S. tariffs on exports are likely to \"expand gradually.\"The central bank's Monetary Policy Board said it will \"maintain its rate cut stance to mitigate downside risks to economic growth and adjust the timing and pace of any further Base Rate cuts.\"Household debt also remained a major concern for the BOK, which has been reluctant to cut rates for fear of fueling housing demand and pushing debt levels higher.On Oct. 15, South Korean media reported that stricter property rules, including tighter loan limits, will now apply across all 25 districts of Seoul, as well as 12 more areas in the surrounding Gyeonggi Province.Previously, the tightened rules only applied to four of Seoul's 25 districts.Bank of America analysts wrote in an Oct. 20 note that \"housing inflation in Seoul has been the top of mind for policymakers this year, a critical constraint for additional easing in 2H25.\"They noted that home prices in central Seoul accelerated again in mid-September, despite earlier rounds of cooling measures in June and September.\"With such measures, a sequential decline in home transactions is expected in coming months, but it is still hard to tell if the price increase could be fully contained, in our view,\" they said.The BofA economists, however, penciled in a rate cut by the BOK in November to bolster growth in the economy, particularly if progress is made in trade talks and housing policy.South Korea's Kospi index and the small-cap Kosdaq were flat following the announcement. The Korean won weakened 0.19% against the greenback to 1,434.70, its lowest level since May.The decision came as the central bank treads cautiously to avoid further depreciation of the won, which has weakened by over 4% in the last three months against the greenback, as trade negotiations with the U.S. dragged on.Stalled trade talksThe rate decision also came as South Korea faces uncertainty over its trade relationship with the U.S., after both sides struggled to finalize details of an agreement reached on July 30.Under the deal, the Asian nation is set to invest $350 billion in the U.S. in exchange for a lower tariff rate of 15% on its U.S.-bound shipments. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned in a Reuters interview that transferring the full amount in cash could trigger a financial crisis reminiscent of 1997.Tariffs on the country's auto exports will also be cut to 15%, according to the preliminary agreement.Negotiators are reportedly due to visit Washington this week to finalize terms ahead of the APEC Summit on Oct. 31 in South Korea.At its last meeting in August, the BOK raised its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% from its May forecast of 1.9%, while the GDP growth outlook for the year was also revised to 0.9% from 0.8% previously.Consumer inflation in South Korea climbed 2.1% in September from a year earlier, accelerating from a 1.7% rise in August, with core inflation advancing 2%.The BOK expects domestic demand to make a \"modest recovery,\" due to a supplementary budget and improvement in consumer sentiment.\"Exports are likely to show favorable movements for some time, but are likely to gradually slow as the impacts of U.S. tariffs expand,\" the central bank said.",

    "body": "A man tries on a jacket at a store at Chicago Fashion Outlets in Chicago, the United States, on Nov. 25, 2022.Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesPrices are rising across the fashion industry – with jackets and outerwear seeing the steepest year-over-year increases, according to a new report from consulting firm AlixPartners published Wednesday. The firm analyzed how much prices have climbed between 2024 and 2025 across nine categories, from swimsuits to dresses. Prices in all of the categories it tracked have risen by an average of $17 year over year. Jackets and outerwear saw the largest increase, with prices on average 24% higher, while swimwear saw the smallest hike at 2% on average. As the U.S. starts to cool down and winter approaches, consumers looking for new coats and jackets could be spending a lot more at the register – if they choose to buy. One factor that's weighed on the category is a late start to fall, which typically leads to weak demand for outerwear. Coupled with higher prices, retailers that bet big on outerwear in the fall and winter months might have a harder time moving product, which could lead to inventory challenges in the spring, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author.\"[Retailers] have a normal discounting cadence that says by late November, early December, you're already starting to put this stuff on sale, on discount, and a consumer may not have even thought about it by then,\" said Lapinsky.\"We've had so many discussions with retailers about the whole flow of their seasons, and some have made decisions to push some product out further because fall is starting to feel more like late summer,\" she added. \"Not all of them have been that reactive. So it's absolutely a cause for concern if they haven't made any adjustments.\"Here's how much prices have risen in the fashion industry by category. ",

Kim | Chicago Tribune | Getty ImagesSouthwest Airlines on Wednesday posted a surprise profit for the third quarter and said it expects to generate record sales in the last three months of the year thanks to better travel demand and higher fares.The carrier said it expects unit revenue to rise between 1% and 3% for the fourth quarter, with capacity up 6% over the same period last year.\"This guidance range assumes demand strength remains at current levels through the end of the quarter,\" Southwest said.Here's how Southwest performed in the period ended September 30 compared with Wall Street expectations, according to consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 11 cents adjusted vs. loss of 3 cents expectedRevenue: $6.95 billion vs. $6.92 billion expectedIn July, Southwest joined other airlines in cutting its 2025 profit forecast. The Dallas carrier said it expected full-year earnings before taxes of $600 million to $800 million, down from an earlier forecast of $1.7 billion. It reaffirmed that earnings outlook on Wednesday.The carrier has been working to better compete with rivals and increase sales, abandoning longtime policies like open seating and two free checked bags for each traveler.Southwest CFO Tom Doxey told CNBC in an interview that increased sales from selling seat assignments would show up in the first quarter, when the first flights without open seating begin.Southwest's third-quarter profit fell more than 19% year over year to $54 million from $67 million. On a per-share basis, Southwest's earnings fell to 10 cents from 11 cents a year earlier.Adjusting for one-time items, Southwest reported $58 million in earnings for the third-quarter, or 11 cents a share. Revenue rose 1% to $6.95 billion from the year-earlier period. Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing gets FAA approval to hike 737 Max output Air traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit wins court approval for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alerts",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesWestern Alliance, one of the regional banks at the center of concerns over loans made to non-bank financial players, said Wednesday it believes the loan that sparked last week's selloff is an isolated case.The bank reported third-quarter earnings Tuesday afternoon and noted it had set aside $30 million in reserves for possible losses on a $98 million loan made to the Cantor Group. Last week, Western Alliance disclosed that it had sued the borrowers behind the Cantor Group for alleged fraud related to the collateral for the loans.\"While incredibly frustrating, we believe this is a one-off issue in our note finance business and have adjusted our onboarding and ongoing portfolio monitoring practices,\" Western Alliance CEO Kenneth Vecchione told analysts on Wednesday.Shares of Western Alliance rose almost 2% in midday trading.Regional banks are getting a reprieve this week after Western Alliance and Zions, which also had exposure to the alleged loan fraud, reported results that didn't include any new loan meltdowns. Each of the banks posted rising hauls from net interest income on lower funding costs, while some of their metrics around credit quality actually improved from previous quarters.The Cantor Group episode forced Western Alliance to review other loans in its note finance portfolio, Vecchione said Wednesday.\"Today we have reverified titles and liens for all notes greater than $10 million and have found no irregularities,\" he said.Analysts grilled Vecchione during the Wednesday call for more details around the bank's loan collateral and lending to non-depository financial institutions, or NDFIs.\"What are you doing to validate your collateral and safeguard against future frauds?\" Autonomous Research analyst Casey Haire asked. \"It just seems like as long as you're not afraid to go to jail, it seems easy to double pledge collateral.\"Besides the recent review, Western Alliance periodically checks collateral to make sure the bank is still in a position to collect if the loan sours, executives said. Much of the bank's NDFI book is tied to residential mortgages, which Western Alliance considers low-risk, they added.'Can't unsee'Western Alliance is also exposed to another recent blowup, the bankruptcy of the auto parts maker First Brands.But in this case, a loan facility made to a fund managed by a subsidiary of the investment bank Jefferies \"remains current, and we continue to receive principal and interest payments as modeled,\" said Vecchione.While this week's reassurances have calmed markets for now, the sharp selloff in regionals last week is leaving a lasting mark on the industry. Shares of both Western Alliance and Zions plunged on Thursday after the banks disclosed problems with the Cantor Group.Investors are ready to hit \"sell\" on any signs that the losses aren't isolated, and share gains for the group will be capped for the foreseeable future because of these worries, said Timur Braziler, who covers mid-cap banks for Wells Fargo. He cut his recommendation on Western Alliance to \"sell\" on September 29.\"You can't unsee these events,\" Braziler said in an interview. \"The timer for any kind of sustainable outperformance within the regional group has gotten reset once again.\"",

    "body": "A Walmart store is shown in Oceanside, California, on May 15, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersWalmart is pausing the hiring of job candidates who need H-1B visas to work in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the decision, an example of the ways the Trump administration's immigration policies are shaping corporate strategy.Walmart's decision comes after President Donald Trump in September announced higher fees for the visas, which allow companies to temporarily hire skilled workers from other countries such as China and India. The Trump administration said it would now require companies to pay a $100,000 fee for each new visa application. It said the decision was intended to protect American workers' jobs and end abuse of the visa.In a statement, a Walmart spokesperson said, \"Walmart is committed to hiring and investing in the best talent to serve our customers while remaining thoughtful about our H-1B hiring approach.\"Exceptions to the pause on H-1B hiring are possible in some cases, said the person familiar with the decision, who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. H-1B visas, which Congress created in 1990, have been a way for companies to bring in skilled workers from other countries when they can't find qualified applicants in the U.S. It's been frequently used for filling science, technology, engineering and math roles.The program has an annual cap of 65,000, along with an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If demand is above the cap, a lottery system is used.For the Trump administration, the steeper fee on H-1Bs is intended as a deterrant for companies who are weighing whether to hire a foreign worker over an American. It fits into Trump's broader goal of using trade policy and an immigration crackdown to compel companies to invest in their U.S. operations and hire U.S.-born workers. Read moreWalmart is the nation's largest private employer with about 1.6 million employees in the country at the end of the most recent fiscal year, and most work in the company's big-box stores and warehouses. However, H-1B visas are typically used for a small portion of Walmart's corporate ranks. The retail giant's corporate workforce is based in its headquarters of Bentonville, Arkansas, as well as major U.S. cities like the San Francisco Bay Area.Walmart had 2,390 employees on H-1B visas, making it the ninth largest U.S. employer to issue the visas, according to U.S. government data as of June 30. Microsoft is No. 1 with 5,189, followed closely by Meta, the parent company of Facebook.Yet the decision has faced pushback by some in the corporate world. Earlier this month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit challenging the new H-1B visa fee.In a news release, the U.S. Chamber's Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley said the fee \"will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.\"Walmart's policy change was first reported by Bloomberg.",

    "body": "Visitors are caught in the reflection of a store offering 50% off on all items on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica on July 16, 2024. Genaro Molina | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA steady stream of promotions across the fashion industry has left consumers suffering from \"discount burnout\" ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to a new report from consulting firm AlixPartners released Wednesday. The firm surveyed more than 9,000 U.S. consumers on their preferences and priorities across 140 retailers and nine fashion sectors. The report found shoppers see price increases as \"inevitable,\" and cost has become less important to them when they are deciding whether to buy new clothes or accessories.On average, the value of importance respondents assigned to price dropped 13% compared with last year and fell across all sectors except for luxury and beauty, the survey found. Meanwhile, 30% fewer consumers ranked sales and finding the best deal as \"very important\" compared with last year, even in the off-price sector, where deal hunting fell from the top factor respondents were considering to number 19In the aftermath of President Donald Trump's tariff increases on dozens of countries in April, retailers leaned on discounts and promotions to alleviate consumer concerns that prices were rising because of trade policy, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author. But now there's \"fatigue\" around promotions and shoppers are looking for more than just a discount, she said. Consistent pricing between stores and online, value for the money, and quality are among the top things shoppers are prioritizing when spending, she said. They're also looking for a better store experience. While more than 60% of shoppers surveyed plan to make over half of their fashion purchases in stores this holiday, the amount of time shoppers are spending in stores dropped 3% and basket size fell 5% over the last two years, the report found. \"We have higher foot track traffic and lower baskets. Something's missing that they're not converting,\" said Lapinsky. \"So what is it about that experience in-store that's not helping them convert?\"The findings come as the retail industry prepares for a holiday shopping season that could be weaker than previous years amid falling consumer sentiment, an uncertain job market and persistent inflation. The tough economic backdrop coloring the holiday season is putting a renewed focus on execution, quality and brand strength, especially as many retailers raise prices to offset the cost of tariffs. Lapinsky said the survey's findings are a \"warning\" for retailers that discounts won't be enough to drive demand this holiday season. \"They've always had this lever of discount to drive traffic and get folks into the store, but when you're compounding it with tariffs and their need to raise prices … that lever for them is going to become even more risky,\" said Lapinsky. \"It's not necessarily going to work the way it has, because of this fatigue.\" The luxury sector, where price rose in importance for shoppers as a factor when they are spending, provides a cautionary tale for the retail industry, the report said. Over the last few years, brands \"dramatically raised prices,\" the firm said, citing Chanel's decision to increase the price of one of its bags from $5,800 to $11,300 between 2019 and 2025 as an example. The sudden spike led consumers to pull back from the sector and trade down to premium brands \"that felt more rationally priced,\" the report said. \"The same dynamic applies across other sectors,\" the report said. \"Retailers who attempt to hold the line on pricing by reducing quality risk losing credibility.\"",

    "body": "Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBeyond Meat shares closed lower Wednesday, erasing a triple-digit gain, as the meme stock rally faltered.The food company known for its plant-based burgers and sausages fell 1.1% on Wednesday, after surging 112% at one point in the session. The stock reached a high of $7.69 during the session, after closing Tuesday at $3.62. It ended Wednesday's session at $3.58.It's the latest in a volatile week for the company. On Monday, the stock rallied more than 127% after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).That decision appeared to have the added effect of driving a short squeeze in the stock, as investors rushed to cover their positions. According to FactSet data, more than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short.On Tuesday, Beyond Meat soared 146% in its best day ever, after saying it will expand distribution at Walmart's stores.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, year-to-date performanceShares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time. After making its public debut in 2019, when the name soared past $230 per share, it has since become a penny stock. The shares have slid in each of the last five years, falling more than 47% in 2021, 81% in 2022, 27% in 2023, and 57% in 2024. The name is down more than 3% in 2025.The latest bad news for the stock came last week, when shares tumbled more than 67% to end the week at just 65 cents after Beyond Meat said it has finalized a debt deal.This week's comeback, however, is reminiscent of the height of the pandemic, when retail traders took on online message boards such as Reddit's WallStreetBets to coordinate moves behind high-risk, aggressive trades.In 2021, Bank of America said Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock to watch, though it ended that same year with losses.The return of Beyond Meat could be the latest signal of a frothy market, one that is relentlessly climbing higher in spite of concerns around elevated valuations and a possible artificial intelligence bubble. Indeed, Roundhill shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest. It revived it earlier this month as retail traders dove back into the bull market.In response to someone on WallStreetBets saying they bought 10,000 shares of Beyond Meat for $7.50, one commenter wrote earlier Wednesday, \"Youre already down 7k, impressive.\"Another posted: \"You know the economy is cooked when BYND stock is making a comeback.\"",

Still, the stock dropped about 6% in extended trading.Here's how the company performed versus LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: $2.65 adjusted vs. $2.45 expectedRevenue: $16.33 billion vs. $16.09 billion expected.Revenue increased 9% from about $15 billion in the year-ago period, IBM said. The company reported net income of $1.74 billion, or $1.84 per share, after recording a loss of $330 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. The results from last year included the impact of a $2.7 billion pension settlement charge.\"Clients globally continue to leverage our technology and domain expertise to drive productivity in their operations and deliver real business value with AI,\" CEO Arvind Krishna said in release.IBM upped its revenue guidance and said it now expects \"more than\" 5% revenue growth, up from \"at least\" 5%. Free cash flow for the year is expected to hit $14 billion, up from a $13.5 billion estimate last quarter.Krishna also said the company's AI book of business has surpassed $9.5 billion, up from $7.5 billion during the second quarter.Like many technology companies, IBM has harnessed AI to streamline productivity and slash costs. In May, Krishna told the Wall Street Journal that it replaced 200 human resources roles.IBM's software revenue rose 10% to $7.21 billion, meeting a StreetAccount estimate. Consulting revenue totaled $5.3 billion, surpassing a $5.24 billion projection.Infrastructure, which includes its mainframe computers business, jumped 17% to $3.6 billion.IBM's board also approved a $1.68 per share quarterly dividend.Correction: Due to a typo, an earlier version of this story had an incorrect figure of the company's AI book of business.

But Atkins said the agency still can deploy limited levels of essential staff and services as it looks to help companies through the regulatory process — and watch for any shenanigans on Wall Street that need attention.\"What we're concerned about is manipulative behavior,\" Atkins said in a CNBC interview. \"We have stopped trading on eight foreign companies on Nasdaq that showed indicia of manipulative behavior — ramp and dump, we call it. And so those have been shut down. So we are monitoring the market for the behavior that indicates, you know, hanky-panky going on in the marketplace.\"As Atkins spoke, Beyond Meat, a small-cap stock with a fairly high level of short interest, was the apparent subject of speculative meme-stock betting on Wall Street.Though analysts generally frown on the plant-based meant manufacturer, trading exploded Wednesday and was briefly halted on the Nasdaq. At one point, the stock soared 112%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat surgeIt was the fourth day in a row for Beyond Market to soar, on no news other than Roundhill Investments adding it as its biggest holding to the Roundhill Meme Stock exchange-traded fund.\"When you're looking at trading, if there is no news or about a company, and then suddenly there's a ramp up, or a real pump up in the price, that's inexplicable. Then we start looking at that,\" Atkins said, without mentioning Beyond Meat spefifically. \"We have a lot of different tools that we can use to analyze this, and we work closely with the self-regulatory organizations, the exchanges and so forth, because they are the immediate ones looking at their markets and doing surveillance over that.\"Outside of watching for irregular trading, Atkins said the agency continues to look for ways to streamline the regulatory process, adding that it is soliciting opinions on President Donald Trump's push for the end of quarterly reporting requirements.He said the SEC also is considering ways to reform litigation rules that are holding companies back from going public.(Learn the best 2026 strategies from inside the NYSE with Josh Brown and others at CNBC PRO Live.

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.The company announced the cuts in a memo from its chief AI officer, Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit (FAIR) and other product-related positions will be impacted.However, the cuts did not impact employees within TBD Labs, which includes many of the top-tier AI hires brought into the social media company this summer, people familiar with the matter told CNBC. Those employees, overseen by Wang, were spared by the layoffs, underscoring Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's bet on his expensive hires versus the legacy employees, the people said.Within Meta, the AI unit was considered to be bloated, with teams like FAIR and more product-oriented groups often vying for computing resources, the people said. When the company's new hires joined the company to create Superintelligence Labs, it inherited the oversized Meta AI unit, they said. The layoffs are an attempt by Meta to continue trim the department and further cement Wang's role in steering the company's AI strategy.Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.Following the cuts, Meta's Superintelligence Labs' workforce now sits at just under 3,000, the people said.Meta notified at least some employees on Wednesday that Nov. 21 is their termination date and, until then, they're in a \"non-working notice period.\"\"During this time, your internal access will be removed and you do not need to do any additional work for Meta,\" said the message, which was viewed by CNBC. \"You may use this time to search for another role at Meta.\"The company also said it's paying 16 weeks of severance plus two weeks for every completed year of service, \"minus your notice period.\"CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week.On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a \"significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.Axios was first to report the layoffs.— CNBC's Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this reportWATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

It is a relationship that continues to evolve,\" Strazik told CNBC in a phone interview Wednesday, following the release of the company's third-quarter results. \"I've been with his team over the last 72 hours. Clearly, OpenAI is a critical piece of this growth trajectory with a lot of ambition.\"Strazik said the talks have focused on OpenAI's power needs, \"both with power generation and the electrical equipment required to do it.\"GE Vernova shares fell about 6% on Wednesday. The company's third-quarter results topped expectations, helped by a 55% increase in power equipment orders. However, the company didn't raise its 2025 forecast, disappointing some investors. Also, onshore wind remains soft, but analysts say that was largely expected due to ongoing regulatory hurdles.Melius Research analyst Rob Wertheimer told CNBC there was nothing negative in this report.The \"bar was set high,\" he said, noting that GE Vernova shares have doubled over the past year.Wall Street remains optimistic about GE Vernova capitalizing on growing demand from big tech. According to LSEG, the average analyst price target is $658, or about 20% higher than where the stock is trading now.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGE Vernova shares year to dateThe company has quickly become the key power equipment provider to every major hyperscaler including OpenAI, Oracle, Nvidia, Google, XAI, according to people familiar to the situation.According to Strazik, $900 million in electrical equipment orders have come from the hyperscalers year to date versus $600 million in orders in all of 2024.\"When we add in Q4 orders, our electric equipment orders will be directionally double with them [hyperscalers],\" Strazik said.Analysts say some of the key challenges GE Vernova is facing right now are capacity constraints, evolving tariff policy and regulations that have slowed down orders for onshore wind turbines.GE Vernova is mostly sold out of its power generation equipment through 2028, Strazik said. The company has ballparked $300 million to $400 million in tariff-related costs this year. At the company's upcoming investor day in early November, Strazik is expected to detail more forward looking numbers.The company also has $8 billion of cash and no debt, which means it's keeping an eye out for opportunities, Strazik said.On Tuesday, GE Vernova said it would buy the 50% it didn't already own in transformer manufacturer Prolec GE for more than $5 billion. Transformers are key to increasing power voltage to accelerate transportation of electricity.",

    "body": "Rupert Murdoch looks on, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. Feb. 3, 2025.Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersWhy let a $10 billion lawsuit get in the way of old friends having some chicken and gravy for dinner?President Donald Trump last week dined at the White House with Rupert Murdoch and that media baron's key lieutenants, despite Trump's ongoing defamation lawsuit over Murdoch's Wall Street Journal reporting that he sent a \"bawdy\" 50th birthday letter to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to a new report.Breaker Media on Tuesday night reported that Trump hosted his fellow billionaire Murdoch and company at the White House last Thursday.Guests included Murdoch's wife, Elena Zhukova, New York Post editor Keith Poole and Post columnists Miranda Devine and Douglas Murray, News UK CEO Rebekah Brooks, The Sun editor-at-large Harry Cole, as well as Vice President JD Vance and White House Susie Wiles, Breaker reported. Murdoch's News Corp owns The Post, The Sun, and News UK, along with the Journal.The outlet said the group ate chicken and gravy.Three months before the dinner, Trump, in a social media post, wrote, \"I look forward to getting Rupert Murdoch to testify in my lawsuit against him and his 'pile of garbage' newspaper, the WSJ.\"\"That will be an interesting experience!!!\" the president wrote.CNBC has requested comment on the report from News Corp and the White House. A spokesman for Trump's legal team declined to comment.The reported dinner came five days before Trump's legal team filed a blistering response to a request by Murdoch's lawyers that a federal judge in Miami dismiss the president's defamation lawsuit.That suit is a glaring exception to the often cozy relationship Trump has with Murdoch's conservative media empire, which includes Fox News. The Post and Fox have acted as cheerleaders for Trump and his policies for years, and Trump, for decades, has been an avid reader of and fixture in The Post's tabloid pages.The current dispute stems from a July 17 report by the Journal, which said that a risqué letter bearing Trump's signature was included in an album of letters that Epstein was given for his 50th birthday party in 2003.At the time of the party, Trump was a friend of Epstein. The two later had a falling out; Epstein died from a jailhouse suicide in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump to demolish entire East Wing of White House for ballroom: 'Plans changed'Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyTrump special counsel nominee Paul Ingrassia withdraws after racist texts flapTrump says U.S. cattle ranchers 'don't understand' tariffs, must lower pricesOil jumps 3% after Trump administration sanctions big Russian oil companiesRussia was smug about Trump-Putin talks.

This is a fake thing. It's a fake Wall Street Journal story,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"I never wrote a picture in my life. I don't draw pictures of women,\" he said. \"It's not my language. It's not my words.\"Trump also said that he had personally warned Murdoch that Trump would sue him if the Journal printed the story.\"Mr. Murdoch stated that he would take care of it but, obviously, did not have the power to do so,\" Trump claimed on Truth Social.On July 18, Trump sued Murdoch, the Journal, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson, and the two reporters who wrote the article.The lawsuit denied that Trump authored the letter, and that, \"Despite the glaring failures in journalistic ethics and standards of accurate reporting, Defendants Dow Jones and News Corp — at the direction of Defendants Murdoch and Thomson — published to the world the false, defamatory, and malignant statements authored by Defendants.\"Trump has continued denying he wrote the letter even after Democrats in the House of Representatives in early September released a screenshot of the missive that the Journal reported on. The letter was obtained by the House Oversight Committee from Epstein's estate, pursuant to a subpoena.Murdoch's lawyers flagged that letter to the judge overseeing Trump's lawsuit.In their motion to dismiss that case, Murdoch's lawyers said that the article is true, and that the letter released by the House panel contains a \"letter identical to the one described in the Article.\"The lawyers also argued that the article is not defamatory.The motion noted that Trump has acknowledged being a longtime friend of Epstein, and that he was quoted by New York magazine three months before the birthday party, calling Epstein a \"terrific guy\" who \"likes beautiful women as much as I do.\"\"President Trump has also publicly admitted to 'locker room' talk and has made numerous bawdy public statements,\" Murdoch's lawyers wrote.\"The Article is therefore consistent with President Trump's self-described reputation.\"Trump's lawyers, in their response to that motion, called the arguments by Murdoch's lawyers \"disjointed\" and incorrect.\"The Article was fully driven by Defendants' salacious and scandal-driven narratives that prioritize gossip, clicks, and profit over truth,\" Trump's lawyers said.",

That shutdown stemmed from a dispute about funding Trump's contentious immigration policy.The current shutdown resulted from Senate Democrats refusing to vote for a short-term government funding bill sponsored by Republicans, because it lacks additional spending on health care and other provisions.That GOP-backed stopgap bill, which would resume funding at current levels until Nov. 21, failed to pass in the Senate for a 12th time Wednesday evening. The 54-46 vote fell mostly along party lines.Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. But 60 votes are needed to pass any funding bill.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

    "body": "Mary Barra speaks onstage during WSJ's Future of Everything 2025 at The Glasshouse on May 28, 2025 in New York City.Dia Dipasupil | Getty ImagesNEW YORK — General Motors is targeting a suite of new software initiatives for its vehicles over the next three years, including an in-vehicle artificial intelligence assistant from Google and a driver-assistance system that can largely control the vehicle without human interaction or monitoring.GM said the conversational Google Gemini AI will begin launching in its vehicles next year, followed by the new driver-assistance system, which will allow drivers to be hands-free and take their eyes off the road under certain circumstances, in 2028.GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives made the announcements Wednesday as part of a \"GM Forward\" software event that also showcased other initiatives designed to \"transform the car from a mode of transportation into an intelligent assistant,\" the automaker said.The company also announced that it is working on a new centralized computing platform, which is planned to roll out starting with the Escalade IQ in 2028; increased use of collaborative robots, also known as cobots, that can work alongside humans; and expanding availability of products from its GM Energy business.GM displays its plans for a new centralized computing platform during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025, in New York City.Michael Wayland | CNBC\"Today we'll share our vision for our vehicles, our industry and how we're driving the future of transportation forward,\" Barra said to kick off the event in lower Manhattan.'New era of mobility'GM said the announcements are meant to usher in a \"new era of mobility\" for the company, which has struggled to achieve such initiatives in the past. Its previous efforts included announcing plans in 2021 to double revenue by 2030, led by many now-defunct growth businesses, as well as growing annual software and services revenue to between $20 billion and $25 billion.In recent years, it also killed an \"Ultra Cruise\" system meant to be able to drive in 95% of circumstances that was initially due to come out in 2023 and folded its Cruise robotaxi business.GM executives on Wednesday declined to discuss revenue potential of the new announcements. CFO Paul Jacobson has previously walked back the doubling revenue goal, but has noted the company's growing revenue, up 9.1% last year to $187.44 billion.GM graphic of the automaker's upcoming centralized computing design that's set to debut in the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028.GMGM President Mark Reuss on Wednesday said the company's revenue plans are \"pretty much on track … maybe a year or two different\" as it plans to continue to grow revenue, especially with the technologies announced Wednesday. He also said these initiatives are \"very different\" than prior announcements, as they're tangible products that are entering the market shortly.As of the third quarter of this year, GM recognized $2 billion from software services. That's up from 2021, when the plans were announced and it took the full year to hit that mark. It also cited $5 billion in deferred revenue, up 90% from a year earlier, to end the third quarter.The event comes a day after GM reported standout third-quarter earnings and upped its guidance, pushing the stock to have its second-best day on record since the automaker's 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.GM stock on Wednesday was trading relatively flat.AIGM said the artificial intelligence system from Google, which its infotainment system is developed on, will make \"it possible to talk to your car as naturally as you would to a fellow passenger.\"\"Our vision is to create a car that knows you, that looks out for you, and just meets your needs, even before you say,\" Sterling Anderson, GM chief product officer, said during the event.Anderson called the centralized computing a \"foundational piece\" of the company's plans in increasing the capabilities of its vehicles.GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.Michael Wayland / CNBCThe Detroit automaker said it expects to update select vehicles from the 2016 model year to all new models in the U.S. beginning next year with the AI tech.GM also said it plans to develop its own \"AI, custom-built\" technology in the years to come but did not provide an exact time frame.\"In the future, we will introduce our own AI fine-tuned to your vehicle,\" said David Richardson, a former Apple executive who is now GM vice president of software and services engineering. \"Think of this as an assistant. It's going to anticipate your needs, offer timely help and make every journey more personable and more enjoyable.\"Hands-free, 'eyes-off'GM said it plans for its upgraded advanced driver-assistance system, also known as ADAS, to feature hands-free, \"eyes-off\" driving technology, beginning on the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV, which currently starts around $127,500, in 2028.The automaker then expects to expand the availability of the tech to other models, company executives said.\"Autonomy will make our roads safer. They'll give customers back their most valuable asset: time. It'll be a cornerstone of GM product portfolio going forward,\" Anderson said.Cadillac Escalade IQ with lidarGMThe vehicle will use lidar, or light detection and ranging, systems that allow it to better detect or \"see\" its surroundings. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has notably been a critic of the technology, and his company's vehicles rely on camera-based systems and computer vision.\"Just be clear, we're developing a self driving product,\" Anderson, a former Tesla executive, told CNBC. \"It's an eyes-off, self-driving system. As it relates to use of lidar in it, your product will be better with multiple modes of sensing, period. Full stop.\"Anderson, calling it an \"ocean that's too big to boil,\" said the system is expected to evolve incrementally to its full potential.GM declined to say whether the new technology will be called \"Super Cruise,\" which is its current system that allows drivers to be hands-free on 600,000 miles of pre-mapped roads in North America.The current Super Cruise system monitors a driver's attentiveness through the use of sensors and eye-detection cameras.GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016, but it was slow to roll out the technology until recent years.Barra said the rollout of the new system will be significantly faster than the company's initial expansion of Super Cruise.GM EnergyStarting in 2026, GM said it will make its \"Energy Home System\" — which includes bidirectional electric vehicle charging and a stationary home battery — available via leasing, compared with outright purchasing the equipment.The leasing will begin with GM all-electric vehicles owners and later roll out to other homeowners interested in backup power and solar integration, the company said.GM Energy launched in 2022 as one of the automaker's growth initiatives involving EVs. It was started to rival Tesla's home energy systems and provide battery packs, EV chargers and software to help customers optimize charging and ride out electric grid disruptions.GM has not disclosed the size or revenue of its GM Energy business other than a blog by Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy, that said momentum for its services are growing.\"It's really incredible to see all the great things that are right on the horizon, and I know we will deliver for our customers, and that's what matters most,\" Barra said. \"This moment builds on our history and sets the course.\"",

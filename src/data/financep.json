    "body": "In September, The Economist released its third annual \"Carrie Bradshaw index,\" named after the protagonist of the hit TV show \"Sex and the City.\" The report ranks the U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live alone.The index was named after the character because, on the show, she lives in a studio apartment in the West Village and it is highly unlikely that she could afford it on a writer's salary now, Lizzy Peet, a data researcher at The Economist, tells CNBC Make It.\"It all came about from a sort of snappy way to sum up the aspiration, a sort of quality of living by yourself in a big city for the first time. How much would you have to earn to afford that? And how much is that a realist prospect?\" she says.To rank the U.S. cities, The Economist used the rule that a tenant should spend no more than 30% of their gross income on rent. That, in combination with using rental prices from Zumper, led to the calculation of the salary needed to afford a typical studio in each city. Each city was given a \"Bradshaw score\" where a value more than one means an average studio apartment is affordable and less than one means housing is unaffordable.\"Cities that build a lot or maybe that have less demand or maybe have less population demand on rent are the kind of cities that are looking more affordable,\" Peet says.One big change in this year's index is that some cities that were affordable last year have slid into the unaffordable category this year, Peet adds.A lot of cities in Texas, like Dallas, Houston, and Austin, moved from what was deemed affordable to what is now deemed unaffordable.\"There are loads of factors at work here. It's important to know that rental markets can be quite random, but they can fluctuate a lot in a very short space of time,\" Peet says. \"It's pretty well documented that Texas has seen this influx of middle-class workers, and that would drive rent up.\"In this year's index, 41 cities were unaffordable, up from 38 cities last year.Wichita, KansasCweimer4 | E+ | Getty Images10 U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live aloneWichita, Kan.Baton Rouge, La.Lincoln, Neb.Des Moines, IowaAkron, OhioTucson, Ariz.Tulsa, Okla.St. Louis, Mo.Albuquerque, N.M.Aurora, Colo.Wichita, Kansas, is the most affordable city in the index. It has a Bradshaw score of around 1.75, which means that median wages in the city are 75% higher than needed to afford an average studio apartment.The average monthly rent for studio apartments in Wichita is $580, up 1.64% from last month, but down 10.54% year-over-year, according to Zumper.Residents of Wichita need to earn $26,400 a year to afford a studio, which is $20,250 less than the median wage.\"I'm not that surprised Wichita is the most affordable. A lot of the cities in the bottom 10 are off the beaten track and not huge economic powerhouses. It's an interesting dynamic,\" Peet says.\"There are still some perhaps less desirable cities that are surprisingly unaffordable and vice versa.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 20, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday signed an agreement on critical minerals and rare earths that Albanese said includes plans for projects worth a total of up to $8.5 billion.Albanese, during a meeting with Trump at the White House, said, \"There will be $1 billion contributed from Australia and the United States over the next six months with projects that are immediately available.\"But the White House subsequently issued a fact sheet that said the countries would invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the next six months. It described the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.CNBC has asked the White House and the Australian prime minister's office for clarification on the discrepancy between what Albanese said and what the fact sheet said.The framework agreement between Australia and the U.S. comes as the Trump administration is seeking to establish a critical mineral and rare earths supply chain that is not dependent on China.Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals. They are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, robotics and electric vehicles among other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, particularly refining and processing. The U.S. is dependent on Beijing for rare earths imports. Australia, a close U.S. ally, is one of the few countries in the world other than China that processes rare earths.Pentagon investment in AustraliaAlbanese said there will be three groups of joint projects between the two countries, which will include companies such as Alcoa. The U.S. will invest in rare earths processing in Australia, the prime minister said. One project is a joint venture between Australia, the U.S. and Japan, he said.\"What we're trying to do here is to take the opportunities which are there,\" Albanese told reporters.The Pentagon will invest in building a gallium refinery in western Australia with a capacity of 100 metric tons per year, according to the White House. Alcoa announced in August that it is exploring the feasability of a gallium project with Japan at one of the company's alumina refineries in western Australia.\"In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them,\" Trump told reporters. The U.S. is also working with other nations to build a supply chain that isn't dependent on China, the president said.China-U.S. tensionsChina announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, pushing Beijing and Washington to the brink of a renewed trade war. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 or sooner if Beijing does not back down.\"They threatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs, but I could also threaten them with many other things, like airplanes,\" Trump said Monday.Trump confirmed he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. The U.S. president said he will visit China early next year.\"We had presidents that allowed China and other countries get away with murder,\" Trump said. \"We're not going to allow that, but we're going to have a fair deal. I want to be good to China. I love my relationship with President Xi. We have a great relationship.\"",

    "body": "When it comes to the workplace, \"just be yourself\" is bad advice, according to psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic.Authenticity is often touted as a desirable trait, says Chamorro-Premuzic, who is a professor of business psychology at Columbia University, but if you're hoping to boost your career, you're better off mastering skills like tact and self-control.Having high emotional intelligence, which Chamorro-Premuzic defines as \"the ability to understand and manage yourself and others,\" is a \"fundamental currency\" in the workplace, he says.\"It makes you more employable, and it makes you more rewarding to deal with,\" he says.People who are successful at work know how to blend \"social skills, empathy and attention to others' perception,\" as Chamorro-Premuzic says in his latest book \"Don't Be Yourself: Why Authenticity Is Overrated (and What to Do Instead),\" published on Oct. 7.According to Chamorro-Premuzic, these are the top three social skills everyone should practice in the workplace. or building social connections and growing your career.1. Being receptive to feedbackThe most successful people Chamorro-Premuzic knows \"solicit honest, critical feedback from others, particularly those who are in a position to judge what you do, and who are comfortable enough to tell you what you need to hear, not what you want to hear,\" he says.Most people are primed to offer positive feedback, rather than honest observations, he says, so asking the right questions is key.Instead of saying 'How was my presentation?' Chamorro-Premuzic recommends putting a finer point on your query.\"The way to ask is, what could I have done better? What could I have done differently? What would you have done differently in my situation?\" he says.It's crucial to maintain your composure while listening to criticism, Chamorro-Premuzic says: otherwise, you're unlikely to receive honest feedback again.\"It's difficult, but if you have the courage to invite negative, constructive, critical feedback, you're going to close the gap between how good you think you are and how good you actually are,\" he says.2. Social awarenessBeing socially savvy can have major benefits for your career, Chamorro-Premuzic says.When navigating workplace dynamics, a crucial tactic he recommends is to \"focus less on yourself\" and more on other people.Being able to identify and respond to others' feelings is a key component of emotional intelligence, he says. Socially aware people are able to analyze an interpersonal situation and adjust their behavior without seeming phony.Chamorro-Premuzic calls this skill \"strategic self-presentation\": \"making an effort to act in a prosocial way and take into account what other people expect.\"Being attuned to others' feelings and needs will make you stand out from the crowd, he says: \"Other people are only thinking about themselves, so if you think about them, you have a big advantage.\"3. AdaptabilityIt's tempting to play to your strengths, Chamorro-Premuzic says, but enduring discomfort while learning new skills will help you grow.A key trait of successful people is that they're willing to say \"I'm going to try to do things differently, or try something else out even if I don't like it,\" he says.All too often, we view traits like introversion, flexibility or sociability as permanent aspects of our personalities, but that belief can prevent us from developing new skills.\"If you're limiting your choices and your decisions to your past and present selves, you're not going to create a future self that is richer, more diverse, broader,\" he says.It may feel \"unpleasant and difficult\" to leave your comfort zone, Chamorro-Premuzic says, but it will ultimately open up new avenues for your career.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "Working for (or with) someone who scrutinizes everything you do and demands that you run it past them for approval can push anyone to the brink. But don't despair. I'm the author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need From the People in Charge,\" a human behavior professor, and an executive coach who's spent the last 15 years coaching leaders at Google, Amazon, and other Fortune 500 companies.I've seen firsthand how difficult it can be for people to navigate the challenges of working with a control freak. I teach them some simple strategies to make the situation work in their favor — without leaving them exhausted and frustrated every day.If you also work for a controlling and impatient taskmaster, try these five steps:1. Run with rough draftsRather than toiling away for days — or weeks — to craft the perfect deliverable, do a first pass and say, \"Here's what I've put together so far. It's a bit rough around the edges, but I wanted to capture the core ideas and structure so we can shape it into something outstanding.\" Your boss will be happy to have input, and you'll conserve your energy.2. Reinforce their authorityUse phrases like, \"What we ultimately do is up to you,\" or, \"I'll share my two cents so that you can make the final decision.\" This allows you to emphasize you know who's the boss. Pose your ideas as inquiries. Try, \"What if…\" or, \"How about we…\" Asking questions in conversation boosts feelings of control in the other person, which is called the question-behavior effect in psychology. 3. OvershareSend a breakdown of items you plan to tackle each week every Monday or shoot over a quick heads-up if you'll be late to a meeting. While sometimes tedious, sharing this information will satiate your boss's desire for oversight, while saving you the effort of justifying yourself later. You might share your update with: \"To keep you in the loop about our progress, I've prepped a weekly status memo with a snapshot of recent developments.\" Or say: \"I'm confirming that we're moving ahead with [X]. Let me know by Friday if there are any changes.\"4. Get ahead of their criticismYou might say, \"I'm planning to approach [X task] this way. Do you have initial thoughts?\" When your boss corrects you, use the classic \"yes, and…\" improv technique. Acknowledge their input (\"yes\") and then add your perspective or suggestion (\"and\") to subtly assert your ideas while taking their feedback into account. It might sound like this: \"Yes, I appreciate the need to be more concise in my emails, and I believe a brief context section is still beneficial for clarity, especially for people less familiar with the project.\"5. Ask for the praise you needTry emphasizing the significance of their approval: \"I enjoy hearing how I can improve. It's also important for me to know what's going well so I can do more of that. Is there room for you to share your perspective on what I'm getting right, or do you prefer to keep the focus on what needs adjusting?\"Melody Wilding, LMSW is an executive coach, human behavior professor, and author of \"Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge.\" Get her free training, 5 Steps to Speak Like a Senior Leader, here. Want to catch up on our CNBC Make It Book Club discussion with Melody Wilding?

    "body": "Electric vehicles are cheaper to maintain than cars with internal combustion engines, but they tend to lose money — fast.It varies by model, but in general EVs depreciate by 13% more over a five-year period than the overall market, and some plummet in value even more rapidly, according to iSeeCars, which tracks the used car market.It's enough to make a new car buyer hesitate if they are worried about how much they will get back when they try to sell the car. In addition, automakers have said they're trying to broaden the appeal of EVs to more cost-conscious mainstream shoppers. Up until now, the EV market has been heavy on higher priced vehicles aimed at luxury buyers.\"New car shoppers, especially wealthy ones, are less price sensitive,\" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst of iSeeCars. \"They don't care about the depreciation. Used car shoppers are not like that. Every used car buyer, by nature of being a used car buyer, is value oriented.\"There are a few big reasons EVs suffer greater depreciation.Historically they have been more heavily incentivized, which tends to hurt resale values since a used buyer won't pay as much for a car that did — or even could have — received discounts. Incentives hurt resale values for all kinds of cars, but EVs have received some additional ones, including the now expired federal government rebates.EVs received about twice the incentives as gas-burning cars — including those from dealers and automakers in August, for example, according to Cox Automotive. Even that was a drop from the record set in July.There is also the rapidly changing pace of technology. The maximum available EV range for example has more than doubled in the last decade, and the median range has tripled, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Some evidence has suggested longer-range EVs tend to depreciate more slowly.Despite all the advances, EVs remain a relatively niche product with a small, albeit growing, share of the market. U.S. sales of EVs, excluding hybrids, hit a market share of 10.5% for the first nine months of the year, according to data provided to CNBC from Motor Intelligence.But that smaller share limits their marketability.There are big changes ahead. An explosion of used EVs is inevitably on its way, and the mix of models is likely to be different.\"We have, you know, $30,000 to $35,000 EVs coming from the domestic market — from Ford, from Chevy,\" said Alex Yurchenko, managing director of valuation services for J.D. Power. \"So you have now a much better mix of vehicles, in terms of affordability.\"Watch the video to learn more.",

    "body": "Jim Cramer can't guarantee that following certain financial strategies will see you to a secure retirement, but he's pretty sure of a few that won't.In the preface of his book, \"How to Make Money in Any Market,\" Cramer issues a few warnings about building long-term wealth. One is that your confidence \"might be misplaced\" if you plan on relying on Social Security to fund your retirement. Another is that betting on the outcome of basketball games is not a solid investing strategy.\"Third, and maybe worst of all, trolling the internet for 'meme' stocks like GameStop and hunting for short-term victories in the hope of long-term financial stability is an easy road to disaster,\" he writes.A \"meme\" stock is a stock that gains sudden popularity on the internet, leading to skyrocketing prices. Cramer cautioned investors about such investments during GameStop's original Reddit-fueled trading frenzy in 2021, during which GameStop stock went from less than a dollar per share to an intraday high of $120.75, adjusted for splits.Cramer says the backlash from some investors was fierce enough that he hired private security. But many investors who didn't heed his warning got burned: By 2024, GameStop stock traded in the neighborhood of $10 a share. It's currently trading around $20.Cramer's warnings about GameStop and other meme stocks comes down to what investing pros call the \"greater fool\" theory. Investors buy overpriced assets they know aren't long-term winners in the hopes of selling at a higher price to someone else.Cramer has another analogy about investing in meme stocks. \"When you buy the kind of stock like GameStop, that is just literally a musical chairs game,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"And I'm against musical chairs and I'm pro-investing.\"In other words, if you get into risky short-term trades, you could end up without a seat and lose a lot of money when the music stops.Avoid trading in favor of investingNone of that is to say that Cramer doesn't want you to speculate — he does. Cramer advocates for dedicating a small percentage of your portfolio to stocks you think have the chance to deliver huge returns, even at a substantial risk of loss. But he wants even your long-shot stock picks to be fundamentally strong companies that you plan to hold for the long term.Meme stocks, which investors tend to hold solely in the hope that the price will go up, and not based on underlying fundamentals, are unlikely to fit the bill, Cramer says.\"I like you to get in, and, if it's a really good company, you stay in,\" he says. \"But GameStop was not a good company. That was simply people who were just chasing.\"When thinking about a prospective investment, Cramer suggests asking yourself whether you're envisioning a transaction with a beginning and an end.\"If it has a beginning and an end, I say don't own it, because I want owning. I don't want trading,\" Cramer says. \"Trading is for people who professionally traded like I did for 20 years.\"To build wealth, he says, you're better off choosing investments that you expect to deliver consistent growth over the course of decades. Such firms should have bright long-term prospects, underpinned by growing earnings, innovative products or services, and durable competitive advantages over peers.\"My version of investing may not give you the instant high of a short-term 'victory' that will eventually come crashing down,\" Cramer writes in his book. \"But buying and holding shares in best-of-breed companies can compound your money in spectacular fashion over time.\"Upgrade to an annual CNBC Investing Club membership today and claim your free, signed copy of Jim Cramer's new book, \"How to Make Money in Any Market.\" (See terms and conditions for complete offer details.

Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are also supporting the mission.SpaceX won a contract in 2021 to provide a lunar landing system for astronauts on the Artemis III mission.In December, NASA pushed back the next Artemis missions, with the next launch to send astronauts around the moon and back delayed until April 2026 and the trip to land two astronauts on the south polar region of the Moon moved to 2027.Read more CNBC tech news$500 purple cables put this little-known company in the middle of the AI boomNearly half of Kalshi's users saw glitches, delays during Saturday college football gamesSalesforce CEO apologizes for saying Trump should send National Guard to San FranciscoProxy advisor ISS recommends Tesla shareholders oppose Musk's $1 trillion pay planDuffy said Monday that he thinks the April launch can happen in early February and the agency is looking to get \"back to the moon in 2028\" with two potential companies.

Cleveland Works steel mill in Cleveland, Ohio, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCleveland-Cliffs is looking into building a rare earths mining business, CEO Lourenco Goncalves told investors Monday.The steelmaker has two sites in Michigan and Minnesota where geological surveys have found indications of rare earths, Goncalves said in a statement on Cleveland-Cliffs' third-quarter earnings.\"We are working with the geologists to assess whether these deposits could become commercially viable — that's where we are at,\" Goncalves told analysts on the company's earnings call later Monday morning. \"We are a mining company, this isn't new territory for us.\"Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs closed more than 20% higher at $16.18. The Cleveland headquartered steelmaker is experienced in mining iron ore.Rare earths are used to manufacture magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, semiconductor fabrication, robotics and other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on Beijing for imports. China announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, provoking President Donald Trump to threaten 100% tariffs in retaliation.The U.S. has only one commercial rare earths mine. The Defense Department struck a deal in July with the mine's owner, MP Materials, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors have been speculating that the Trump administration will strike similar deals with other U.S. companies that are trying to stand up domestic rare earths mines and processing facilities.Cleveland-Cliffs' sites in Michigan and Minnesota, if successful, would align the company with the administration's \"broader national strategy for critical mineral independence,\" Goncalves said.\"American manufacturing shouldn't rely on China or any foreign nation for essential minerals, and Cliffs intends to be part of the solution,\" the CEO said.",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

    "body": "Trading cards of the game \"Magic\" are located in a shop where a \"Magic\" tournament is taking place.Frank Rumpenhorst | picture alliance | Getty ImagesAs screentime soars and technology races ahead, a low-tech pastime is back in a big way: collecting trading cards.The cardstock depicting everything from NFL standouts to Pokémon and even Taylor Swift is one of the hottest toy categories in stores this year. Big-box retailers are stocking up ahead of the holidays, anticipating that demand will extend beyond traditional toy buyers like children and collectors.\"We see trading cards being a hot gifting category for all ages that we will fuel with newness and with exclusive drops,\" Rick Gomez, Target's executive vice president and chief commercial officer, told CNBC. \"We're going to have new releases nearly every week during the holidays that's going to drive demand. And these make for great gifts and great stocking stuffers.\"Strategic trading card sales — which exclude sports — are up 103% year-to-date through August, while non-strategic card sales, which tend to be collectible pop culture or sports cards, are up 48%, according to market research firm Circana.Target's trading card sales are up nearly 70% year-to-date, with annual revenue from the category expected to top $1 billion.Sales on some online platforms are rising even faster. Walmart Marketplace reported a 200% jump in trading card sales from February 2024 to June 2025, with Pokémon sales up more than tenfold year-over-year during the same period, the company first told Axios. The retailer has even launched a new weekly influencer livestream series focused on sports collectibles.Since 2021, strategic card sales have grown by $891 million, or 139%, to total $1.5 billion, according to Circana. Sales of non-strategic cards and collectible stickers climbed by $565 million, or 156%, to $925 million in the same period, Circana said.Millennials and Gen Z customers have been crucial for growth, said Juli Lennett, vice president and industry advisor for Circana's U.S. toys practice.\"Lots of adults are buying these because it brings them back to a time when they had no cares in the world,\" Lennett said. \"It's an affordable luxury with the economy right now. Some couldn't afford cards as kids and now they have their own money and no one's there to say 'no'.\"Some buyers also treat cards like alternative investments. Through August, the value of Pokémon cards has delivered a cumulative return of 3,821% since 2004, according to an index by analytics firm Card Ladder, the Wall Street Journal reported. To combat online resellers, many stores now limit purchases to two packs per customer.While the trading card category has boomed this year, not everyone is convinced the segment will boost sales during the peak holiday shopping season. Within the past six months, 19% of adults said they purchased Pokémon cards for themselves, signaling they may not be buying them for others in the weeks ahead, according to Circana.\"There has been steady growth in the category, but a large chunk of buyers are purchasing for themselves. There isn't as much gifting here as you see in other toys,\" Lennett said.Pokemon cards released in 1999Yvonne Hemsey | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesA year-round rushWhat trading cards may lack in holiday flair, they make up for in consistency.Cards stand apart from most toy categories in two key ways: they are frequently self-purchased and not \"super seasonal,\" Lennett said.\"Cards sell just as well in March or July as they do in December,\" she said. \"That makes them very attractive to retailers trying to offset seasonal risk.\"Target, which often gets a bump from merchandise tied to holidays, has tried to capitalize on the year-round fervor for cards.\"We expanded our assortment. We increased the number of drops that we have. We put trading cards in a more prominent place in store, did bolder displays and the business has responded,\" Gomez said. \"We don't see the business slowing and we see it continuing to grow in popularity.\"Pokémon remains the category's top performer, with card sales topping $1 billion last year — it's the first toy brand to hit that milestone in the U.S., according to Circana. Sports cards are also becoming more popular, particularly among teen boys, with NFL packs leading the charge.\"A lot of different people are coming in to buy. You have your adult collector who's buying for themselves, but we also see a lot of families coming in with kids requesting them and asking their parents for trading cards,\" Gomez said. \"It's a great gift for parents, for kids, especially if they know that they're into sports or Pokémon.\"While contemporary releases are booming across people aged eight to 28, vintage cards — typically pre-1970s — haven't connected as strongly with Gen Z and Gen Alpha collectors.\"The majority of my customers aren't looking for vintage,\" Matthew Winkelried, CEO of New York-based Bleecker Trading, told CNBC. \"Younger people don't want to dig through 1960s cards unless they see a Mickey Mantle or Hank Aaron. Plus, the scarcity and price of vintage cards make it a tough entry point.\"Topps trading cards are arranged for a photograph in Richmond, Virginia.Jay Paul | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChanging customersAfter a near-collapse in the 1990s due to overproduction, the trading card industry has rebounded. Growth has been particularly strong since the pandemic, propelled by a blend of nostalgia, community and, for some, investment potential.For many, cards offer a sense of belonging — whether it's exchanging cards or playing a game like Pokémon or Magic: The Gathering.\"You still have the game players, and that's a really tight-knit community,\" said Jason Howarth, senior vice president of marketing and athlete relations at Panini America, which supplies sports cards to retailers like Target and Walmart. \"Among sports fans, there's a huge sense of camaraderie around trading. And with Pokémon too, I've heard game nights still play a major role in keeping that ecosystem alive.\"For those looking to cards as a store of value, Pokémon cards often prove to be a stronger investment than their sports counterparts, said Winkelried of Bleecker Trading.\"Maybe a highly touted rookie joins the league, and you buy their card early hoping it'll rise in value,\" he said. \"The value can change week to week. It's volatile like a stock.\"He added: \"Pokémon is like a commodity. Pikachu can't tear an ACL or get a DUI. Supply is limited, so the market is more stable.\"Looking past the holidays, major retailers are focusing on building the category's long-term future. Target is betting on exclusive sets, limited specialty drops and drawing a more diverse consumer base.\"We are looking at reaching not only breadth of age with trading cards, but also gender,\" Gomez said.That process is already underway. The WNBA is now one of the fastest-growing segments in sports cards, particularly among young girls.And with the 2026 FIFA World Cup spanning the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, soccer is poised to surge next.\"Caitlin Clark, Paige Bueckers and Angel Reese have done wonders for the WNBA trading card business,\" Howarth said. \"Once it hits June, the U.S. marketplace is going to be taken over by soccer. Fans already know the global stars like Messi, but with the World Cup being held here, at least four or five players will skyrocket in popularity and get recognized.\"",

    "body": "China Shipping containers are seen at the port of Oakland as trade tensions continue over U.S. tariffs with China, in Oakland, California, on May 12, 2025.Carlos Barria | ReutersBEIJING — China's economy grew 4.8% in the third quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in a year but in line with analyst expectations despite the ongoing real estate slump.Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year as spending on infrastructure and manufacturing slowed. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.1% growth.Property investment extended its decline, sliding 13.9% in the year through September, compared with a 12.9% drop during the first eight months of the year.The drop in fixed-asset investment is \"rare and alarming,\" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said in a note. He warned that fourth-quarter GDP growth faces downward pressure.The last time China recorded a contraction in fixed-asset investment was in 2020 during the pandemic, according to data going back to 1992 from Wind Information.\"Weakness in real estate investment may persist for a longer period than previously anticipated,\" Bruce Pang, adjunct associate professor at CUHK Business School, said in Chinese, translated by CNBC.\"This could represent a structural restructuring, and it's possible that investment will never return to its prior levels,\" he said. \"In this context, China needs to consider how to leverage investment from other sectors to fill the investment gap.\"Industrial production climbed 6.5% in September, topping expectations for a 5% increase and up from 5.2% growth in the previous month.Excluding property, fixed-asset investment for the first three quarters of the year rose by 3%, down from 4.2% as of August, according to official data. Private sector investment outside real estate rose 2.1% for the year through September, also slower than the 3% recorded as of August.\"The weakness in investment spending, especially by the private sector, reflects a lack of confidence in the economy's growth prospects as well as in government policies that could support growth,\" Eswar Prasad, a professor of economics at Cornell University, said in an email.Modest consumer spendingRetail sales rose 3% in September from a year ago, matching analyst forecasts. In a sign of waning support from China's consumer goods subsidy program, sales of home appliances rose by a modest 3.3% in September, compared with a surge of 25.3% for the first three quarters of the year.\"I don't think we could stimulate domestic demand without stabilizing the housing market first,\" Dan Wang, Eurasia Group, said Monday ahead of the data release on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia.\"China's Statistics Bureau said disposable income for city residents rose 4.5% in the first three quarters of the year after adjusting for price changes, while rural residents saw a 6% increase.The urban unemployment rate ticked down to 5.2% in September from 5.3% the previous month.However, retail sales slowed from 3.4% year-on-year growth in August, while third-quarter GDP slowed from 5.2% growth in the previous quarter.Official data for September also showed continued resilience in China's exports despite tensions with the U.S.The core consumer price index, which strips out food and energy, rose at its fastest pace since February 2024. But headline inflation fell 0.3%, missing expectations as deflationary pressures persisted.Earlier Monday, China kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged for a sixth-straight month, in line with expectations, with the one-year loan prime rate at 3% and the five-year rate at 3.5%.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tChina's top leaders are meeting from Monday to Thursday to discuss policy and development goals for the next five years.Beijing has sought to shift the economy toward domestic consumption for growth, while developing homegrown technology in the face of rising U.S. restrictions.\"China should step up its efforts in tech, but we also firmly believe the so-called old economy will remain the backbone of the economy for the foreseeable future,\" Nomura Chief China Economist Ting Lu said in a note last week. \"Beijing will have to clean up the property sector mess in 2026-30 for several reasons.\"He noted that real estate remains second only to exports in contributing to China's GDP, while about half of household wealth is in property, and that the sector still accounts for about 18% of local government revenue. Overinvestment in new industries such as electric vehicles \"has already become counterproductive,\" Lu said.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesA judge ordered that X and xAI's lawsuit accusing Apple and OpenAI of trying to maintain monopolies in artificial intelligence markets must remain in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, despite \"at best minimal connections\" to that geographic area by any of the companies.Judge Mark Pittman, in a sharply ironic four-page order on Thursday, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, given their preference for the antitrust lawsuit to be heard there.In a footnote, he even flagged the companies to the website of the Business Services unit of the City of Fort Worth \"to get the process started\" of relocating there.Pittman's order implicitly aims at the tendency of some plaintiffs of a conservative bent to file lawsuits in the Fort Worth division of the U.S. Northern District of Texas courts to increase their chances of winning favorable rulings from the two active judges there, both of whom were appointed by Republicans.Those plaintiffs have included X and Tesla, both controlled by mega-billionaire Elon Musk, who, until earlier this year, was a top advisor to President Donald Trump.Pittman was appointed by Trump, but has been critical of the practice of targeting lawsuits to specific judicial districts, known as forum-shopping.In his order on Thursday, Pittman said that the Fort Worth division's docket is two to three times busier than the docket of the Dallas division, which has more judges.Pittman's order noted that neither Apple nor OpenAI has a strong connection to Fort Worth, other than several Apple stores.\"And, of course, under that logic, there is not a district and division in the entire United States that would not be an appropriate venue for this lawsuit,\" Pittman wrote.X Corp. is headquartered in Bastrop, Texas — roughly 200 miles south of Fort Worth — while both Apple and OpenAI are headquartered in California. Musk's xAI acquired his social media company X in March in an all-stock transaction.\"Given the present desire to have venue in Fort Worth, the numerous high-stakes lawsuits previously adjudicated in the Fort Worth Division, and the vitality of Fort Worth, the Court highly encourages the Parties to consider moving their headquarters to Fort Worth,\" the judge wrote.\"Fort Worth has much more going for it than just the unique artwork on the fourth floor of its historic federal courthouse,\" Pittman said.The judge had asked the three companies to explain why the case belonged in the Fort Worth court.But neither Apple nor OpenAI requested that the case be moved before the judge's Oct. 9 deadline, Pittman noted in the order.Read more CNBC politics coverageX lawsuit vs. Apple and OpenAI stays in Fort Worth, Texas; judge suggests they move there'No Kings' protests against Trump bring a street party vibe to cities nationwideTrump commutes prison sentence of ex-GOP Rep.

This case contains at best minimal connections to the Fort Worth Division of the Northern District of Texas,\" Pittman wrote. \"Possibly one of the strongest points made by Plaintiffs is the mere fact that 'Apple sell[s] iPhones [in this Division] (and many other products) and OpenAI offer[s] ChatGPT nationwide.'\"\"After more than a decade of service presiding over thousands of cases in three different courts, the undersigned continues to feel strongly that '[v]enue is not a continental breakfast; you cannot pick and choose on a Plaintiffs' whim where and how a lawsuit is filed,'\" the judge sniped.But Pittman noted that he had little, if any, choice in the decision to keep the suit in his courthouse.The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, whose jurisdiction includes federal courts in Texas, has raised \"the standard for transferring venue to new heights,\" Pittman wrote.Last year, the 5th Circuit twice slapped down orders by Pittman to transfer to Washington, D.C., a lawsuit by trade groups representing large banks challenging a rule issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which capped credit card late fees at $8 per month.The 5th Circuit said Pittman's court \"clearly abused its discretion\" in trying to move the case.OpenAI declined to comment to CNBC, referring a reporter to its public filings in the lawsuit. X and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Musk's X and xAI sued Apple and OpenAI in August, alleging the companies of an \"anticompetitive scheme\" to maintain monopolies in artificial intelligence markets.The lawsuit accused Apple of favoring OpenAI's ChatGPT on its App Store rankings and deprioritizing other competitors, such as xAI's Grok.Earlier this month, a judge in Washington, D.C., blocked Musk's request to move the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit over his alleged improper disclosure of his stake in Twitter to Texas. Musk renamed Twitter to X after purchasing the company.",

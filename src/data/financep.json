    "body": "For parents, it's tempting to pour a lot of thought into our kids' holiday gifts. If we can just find the perfect educational toy or cultural experience, maybe our kids will become geniuses or earn soccer scholarships.It doesn't help when stores push \"genius\" toys and unforgettable experiences. But here's what parents are forgetting: The more we try to optimize our kids' holiday gifts, the more we miss out on the joy that's available right now. As a healthcare ethicist and mom of two kids, I have good news: Your child's development does not depend on finding the perfect gifts. You can resist the urge to over-engineer and still do right by your family. If you need a reset from the pressure to optimize this holiday season, here are four reframes to help lower the stakes, protect play for its own sake, and put presence ahead of performance. 1. There is no magic keyEndless reviews, algorithms, and AI tools make finding the perfect gift seem attainable. If we skip the hunt, it can feel like we didn't try hard enough. But when we zoom out, we see that this is just one of hundreds of parenting decisions we'll make this year. The effects of a single small choice, like what to get for the holidays, will be outweighed by all the other things that influence our kids' development and well-being. One gift won't set a life trajectory. So we can stop searching Amazon for the mythical gift that will magically unlock our children's potential and give them a direct path to success. Unfortunately, there isn't one. 2. More is not always betterChasing the best can backfire if we think that \"best\" means fancy or high-tech. Research shows that when it comes to play, simple, classic toys often result in more quality play than more elaborate, scripted ones. Open-ended toys leave more room for imagination.  The extra we hope to squeeze from \"perfect\" usually isn't in the product itself. It's in how we show up. As Nicola Yelland, professor of early childhood studies at the University of Melbourne, notes: \"Any toy can be educational when you play with your children and talk to them about what they are doing and learning.\" Instead of worrying about the perfect gift, we can focus our efforts on finding a good fit and then be present for it.3. Support, don't engineerWanting kids to learn and grow is good, but it's easy to take this desire too far. When our gifts or enriching plans aim to upgrade skills and talents, play starts to feel like work, which can undermine the intrinsic value. Experience gifts aren't immune to concerted cultivation efforts either. Writer Faith Hill notes that even family travel now comes with growth goals. The hope is that a trip abroad will help our kids become more adaptive, resilient, and cultured. Productivity culture can sneak in anywhere.  When we stop treating every leisure moment as productive training, however, we can create more space for joy, curiosity, creativity, and connection — values that are worth pursuing for their own sake, not just as means to future achievement. Instead of asking, \"What might this help my child become?\" we can ask, \"What might this invite my child to notice, enjoy, or share right now?\" 4. Love can be enough  Nothing we get our kids for the holidays will get them into Harvard. And that's okay.  As developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik reminds us in her book \"The Gardener and the Carpenter,\" our job as parents is not to manufacture a particular kind of child or to shape their destiny, but to create a space of love, safety, and stability where they can flourish. We don't need to calculate which gifts will give our kids the greatest developmental payoff. The holidays are a chance to help our kids feel that they matter now. And if we can do that, it's more than enough.  Jen Zamzow, PhD, is an adjunct professor of healthcare ethics at Concordia University Irvine, a writer, and a mom to two young boys.

Student loan borrowers who remain enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education plan forbearance will need to select a new repayment option, the U.S. Department of Education said in a press release Tuesday. The entire SAVE plan has been blocked since February, when the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Republican-led states that argued former President Joe Biden lacked the authority to establish the student loan relief plan.As of July, the Education Department had identified more than 7.6 million borrowers in the SAVE forbearance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverage53% of investors with a required withdrawal for 2025 still haven't taken it: FidelityWhy jewelry owners may want to check their homeowners insurance coverageWhat another Fed cut could mean for your personal borrowing costsMany student loan borrowers say it's harder to cover basic needs: surveyAlmost all companies with 401(k)s allow Roth savings — who benefits401(k) changes for 2026 —one is 'impactful' for high earners, CFP saysKeeping your 401(k) when you retire is easier.

What to know about taxes CNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe proposed settlement would dismiss the SAVE litigation in exchange for the Education Department agreeing not to enroll any new borrowers in SAVE and to move all borrowers currently in the plan \"into legal repayment plans,\" according to the department.Based on the details, borrowers will likely need to leave the SAVE forbearance early next year, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. That's sooner than many advocates and borrowers may have expected: President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" set the SAVE program's expiration date at July 1, 2028.In their lawsuits, the GOP states had argued that Biden, with SAVE, was trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked his sweeping debt cancellation plan in June 2023. SAVE came with two key provisions that the lawsuits targeted: it had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances.The proposed settlement comes four months after the Education Department resumed charging interest on the loans of borrowers who remained in the SAVE forbearance.Consumer advocates slammed the agreement. Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, said it would \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan.\"More than 42 million Americans hold student loans and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. How will the end of the SAVE forbearance impact you?

    "body": "Stellantis plans to offer the Fiat Topolino, an all-electric quadricycle vehicle, in the U.S.StellantisDETROIT – Chrysler parent Stellantis on Monday announced it will offer an all-electric small \"car\" called the Fiat Topolino in the U.S.The automaker did not announce timing for the vehicle, but Fiat CEO Olivier François confirmed plans to bring the vehicle to the market, with \"more details to come next year.\"Fiat's announcement comes less than a week after President Donald Trump praised small \"Kei\" cars from Japan during a meeting at the White House with Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa and other U.S. lawmakers and automotive executives.\"They're very small. They're really cute,\" Trump said during the Wednesday meeting. \"And I said, 'How would that do in this country?' And everyone seems to think 'good,' but you're not allowed to build them.\"Trump said he ordered U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to allow small vehicles like the Kei \"micro\" cars to be built and driven in the U.S. It's not necessarily illegal to produce such cars in America, but they have to meet American safety standards, speed requirements and other regulations.watch nowA Stellantis spokeswoman said Fiat's announcement was unrelated to Trump's comments last week and that the automaker has been gauging customer interest for the Topolino at U.S. events such as auto shows.The Topolino, which translates to \"little mouse\" in Italian, is actually categorized as \"an all-electric quadricycle\" rather than a car, according to Stellantis. It has a top speed of roughly 28 miles per hour and driving range of up to 75 kilometers (less than 50 miles) on a single charge. The vehicle is produced in Morocco.Small cars have historically not sold well in the U.S.The most recent meaningful push to sell small cars in the U.S. occurred after the Great Recession in 2009 under the Obama administration. Back then, Italian automaker Fiat was allowed to purchase bankrupt automaker Chrysler, in part, to help bring such vehicles to the U.S.Fiat and its small 500 city car reentered the U.S. market in 2011 amid Fiat's takeover of Chrysler (both now owned by Stellantis). In its first full year in 2012, Fiat sold 43,772 vehicles in the U.S. Those sales have since dwindled to roughly 1,500 Fiat vehicles sold last year in the U.S.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | Reuterswatch nowLook at what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said this year, and what Chinese tech giants and Beijing have done, and you'll see potential hints as to how this lifting of the ban will play out.Why China might push back against the H200The H200 is one of Nvidia's most advanced chips for training and running AI on the market, but China has been on a drive to wean itself off American technology and boost local semiconductor development for AI. \"While this move reopens the door for U.S. revenue, the strategic train has already left the station,\" Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC on Tuesday.Huang said in a Bloomberg interview in May that Chinese tech giant Huawei's semiconductor products for AI are \"probably comparable\" to Nvidia's H200. Alibaba and Baidu, as well as other Chinese startups, are also racing to bring competitive products to Nvidia to the market. Huawei has been ramping up its Ascend line of AI products and using massive clusters of chips to try to get performance that is on par with Nvidia.Huang told CNBC in June that Huawei would have the country's chip needs covered if Nvidia were never allowed to sell there.Meanwhile, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have been using stockpiled Nvidia chips from before the ban, combined with local semiconductors, to develop models that have become advanced.Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., departs following a meeting with members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. Huang said he's unsure whether China would accept the company's H200 artificial intelligence chips should the US relax restrictions on sales of the processors, following a meeting Wednesday with President Donald Trump. Photographer: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith China's drive to self-sufficiency resulting in advanced products, will Beijing want to allow its local companies to buy American products from Nvidia?\"Capability wise, the Chinese ecosystem is catching up fast from semi to stack with models optimized on the silicon and software for significant local consumption,\" Shah said. He added that China getting \"locked in\" to Nvidia chips is a \"liability with a hanging sword of political uncertainty.\" \"This makes domestic self-sufficiency the only viable long-term strategy for Beijing,\" Shah said. Reasons for China to buy the H200Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping \"responded positively\" to the approval of H200 exports to China.And while China held off on H20 purchases, there are reasons the country's companies could want to purchase the H200 product.The H200 is far more advanced than the H20, which could be tempting for China. Meanwhile, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said there were supply shortages across the entire semiconductor supply chain. \"I think there will be demand for H200 as it is a better chip than H20 and there is a shortage of chips in China,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"The big Chinese tech companies will want to use Nvidia and AMD if possible.\"China's semiconductor industry remains behind that of the U.S. and elsewhere. In particular, China struggles to manufacture the most advanced chips, putting it behind the world's largest chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. China is also restricted from buying chipmaking tools that could advance its capabilities.Meanwhile, domestic alternatives to Nvidia remain behind in performance. This makes Nvidia's H200 an attractive proposition.\"What is not in China's favor right now is the supply — ramping up advanced AI chips in terms of performance or yields still remains elusive, making it a less economically efficient push,\" Shah said.\"The gap between Nvidia, AMD and Huawei and others is still quite wide when it comes to performance and power efficiency.\"Even if Chinese firms begin buying Nvidia's product, Beijing's longer-term trajectory of self-sufficiency will continue.\"In the long run, for the next five to ten years, China's 'self-reliance' strategy for its own tech and innovation won't change. Jensen Huang of Nvidia has a good time window to sell H200 but it won't be ... forever,\" George Chen, partner and co-chair, digital practice, The Asia Group, told CNBC on Tuesday.\"Xi will not be foolish that today Trump can sell H200, and then China just totally relies on U.S. chips. Huawei, Alibaba and other Chinese tech developers remain strategically important for China's marathon to win the AI race and this will be a long race,\" he added.",

    "body": "San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie speaks during a press conference at San Francisco City Hall on Oct. 23, 2025 in San Francisco, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSan Francisco's Downtown Development Corporation, launched in April by Mayor Daniel Lurie, said on Tuesday that it's received over $60 million in early commitments from donors including Google and OpenAI to help revive the city's center.\"I think people view this as a generational moment,\" Shola Olatoye, CEO of the SFDDC, told CNBC in an interview. \"San Francisco has captured the world's, and the country's, imagination as a global hub of innovation and industry. The folks who want to build businesses, raise their families here, and visit, recognize the important work that is underway and want to see it continue.\"In October, Lurie said the group, a nonprofit public benefit corporation, had raised $50 million for its efforts, up from $40 million at the time of its debut. When campaigning for mayor last year, Lurie touted his ability to fundraise, drawing on his past experience at the anti-poverty nonprofit Tipping Point Community, laying the groundwork for public-private partnerships to help revitalize San Francisco. In addition to Google and OpenAI, SFDDC has raised money from backers including Visa, Thoma Bravo, Ripple, Salesforce, Amazon, Emerson Collective, Sixth Street and Gap. The funds will help support Lurie's Heart of the City initiative, which prioritizes street safety and cleanliness, small business support and more.watch nowOlatoye said some of the funding will also be deployed to fill vacant spaces in key retail spots such as along Powell and Stockton streets.\"We're going to provide direct grants to these businesses to provide business support, marketing support and legal support,\" Olatoye said. \"And then actual below market capital from some of our lending partners to go in and actually fix up these spaces and get those businesses in there, get people spending money and generating economic activity for the city of San Francisco.\"Money will also be dedicated to a new Embarcadero Park, inspired by New York City's Bryant Park. Lurie has often cited Michael Bloomberg's efforts as mayor of New York as inspiration for his work, and the DDC is drawing on models used in New York as well as Detroit.While a number of metrics show that San Francisco has bounced back dramatically from its pandemic lull, the city has a lot of work to do to prepare for an active 2026. Super Bowl LX is coming to the area in February, along with the Pro Bowl Games. In the summer, people will pack into the Bay Area for some of the FIFA World Cup. \"When downtown thrives, our residents, families and small business owners all benefit,\" Lurie said in a statement. \"By strengthening public safety, cutting red tape and leaning into our arts and culture, we are bringing people back to our streets.\" The first-term mayor notched a significant political win in October as President Donald Trump reversed his decision to deploy the National Guard in downtown San Francisco, saying Lurie was making \"substantial progress\" on crime in the city. Trump also said he was swayed by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. The city has been boosted over the last year by a surge in investment and activity related to artificial intelligence. CBRE data on venture funding show 2025 is expected to surpass the record reached in 2021, thanks in large part to AI investments in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.In addition, crime rates are down 30% from 2024, with event bookings and tourism on the rise, and residential and commercial real estate heating up.\"There's no doubt that there is a lot of attention on us and we are super focused on outcomes and using data to ensure we can hold ourselves accountable,\" Olatoye said.

    "body": "Nvidia H100 chips inside a server room at the Yotta Data Services Pvt. data center, in Navi Mumbai, India, on Thursday, March 14, 2024. Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesU.S. authorities announced Tuesday that they have shut down yet another China-linked smuggling network that trafficked or attempted to traffic more than $160 million in export-controlled Nvidia AI chips.According to a press release from a U.S. attorney's office, two businessmen were taken into custody, while a Houston-based company and its owner have already pleaded guilty to chip smuggling as part of the wider investigation.The case comes as Washington steps up its enforcement of export controls aimed at curbing China's access to advanced artificial intelligence technologies, including Nvidia's graphics processing units. The action, dubbed \"Operation Gatekeeper,\" exposed efforts to funnel cutting-edge AI chips — with military and civilian applications — to entities that could undermine U.S. national security, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei of the Southern District of Texas.Newly unsealed documents show that Alan Hao Hsu, 43, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company, Hao Global, pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities on Oct. 10. Officials said Hsu and associates had exported or attempted to export at least $160 million worth of Nvidia H100 and H200 GPUs between October 2024 and May 2025.The H200 and H100 models, while not Nvidia's most advanced chips, still require a special license to be shipped to China under current controls.Hsu's operation allegedly falsified shipping documents to misclassify the GPUs and hide their true destinations, including China, Hong Kong and other prohibited locations. Investigators traced more than $50 million in funds originating from China to help finance the scheme by Hsu and Hao Global.Hsu, who remains free on bond, faces up to 10 years in prison at his Feb. 18 sentencing, while Hao Global could be hit with fines up to twice its illicit gains plus probation. In a statement shared with CNBC, an Nvidia spokesperson said that export controls remain rigorous and that \"even sales of older generation products on the secondary market are subject to strict scrutiny and review.\"\"While millions of controlled GPUs are in service at businesses, homes, and schools, we will continue to work with the government and our customers to ensure that second-hand smuggling does not occur,\" the spokesperson said.Relabeled Nvidia GPUsU.S. officials also charged Fanyue Gong, 43, a Chinese citizen residing in New York, and Benlin Yuan, 58, a Canadian citizen living in Ontario, as part of their investigation.Yuan serves as CEO of a U.S. subsidiary of a Beijing-headquartered Chinese IT company, while Gong owns a New York technology firm. Both allegedly conspired independently with a Hong Kong logistics company and a China-based AI firm to evade chip controls.Prosecutors alleged Gong used straw purchasers and intermediaries to acquire GPUs by misrepresenting the end customers as being in the U.S. or in unrestricted third countries.Workers at U.S. warehouses would then rebrand shipments under fictitious names and mislabel them as generic parts for export to China and Hong Kong, according to the case. Meanwhile, Yuan is accused of recruiting inspectors for the Hong Kong firm, instructing them to conceal Chinese destinations, devising cover stories to release detained shipments and providing false information to authorities. He also allegedly handled storage for additional GPU exports.If convicted, Yuan could face up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act, while Gong could receive as much as 10 years for conspiracy to smuggle.The investigation involved the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security, which oversees and enforces U.S. export controls, including those on Nvidia. The case comes amid a flurry of similar busts regarding unauthorized Nvidia exports in recent months. Lawmakers have been attempting to tighten oversight of U.S. chip controls following reports of loopholes in existing rules.However, the U.S. President Donald Trump signaled this week that he would allow Nvidia to ship its H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere, on the condition that Washington gets a 25% cut of the sales.Although the H200 isn't state of the art in Nvidia's lineup, it would become the most advanced model available to China and could help satiate demand for AI compute power in the country.Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Washington would get a 25% cut of the sales from a possible deal to allow Nvidia to ship its H200 chips. The percentage was mischaracterized in an earlier version of this article.",

    "body": "The new Bitcoin token is photographed on U.S. $100 bills.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesA new exchange-traded fund from Bitwise that began trading Tuesday will give retail investors and financial advisors access to a broad range of cryptocurrencies in one shot, as opposed to the ETFs so far that have mostly just tracked just one or two cryptocurrencies.The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) holds the following 10 digital assets: Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. The conversion makes BITW the first ETF by a major crypto asset manager to include Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot, Bitwise CEO and co-founder Hunter Horsley told CNBC.\"This really meaningfully expands the audience that can access exposure to these different assets, [and] of course, for assets that don't have spot ETF, all the more,\" Horsley said Monday. The fund offers exposure to crypto-assets for financial advisors as well as other smaller investors who are using funds from an IRA or retirement account \"where their only choice is to use ETFs,\" said the CEO.The ETF was converted from an index fund which held the same coins and it starts trading with more than $1 billion in assets. Along with broader permissions to trade and hold, ETFs offer other advantages over funds that may make them more attractive to some investors, including increased trading flexibility and tax efficiency, as well as lower fees. This move follows the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of a rash of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. Since then, asset managers have jockeyed for approvals to launch ETFs tracking a wider range of digital assets, from altcoins like sui and aptos to memecoins such as official Trump and dogecoin. The ETF launches amid a series of recent pullbacks in the crypto market that saw bitcoin trade as low as $85,000 earlier this month,  more than 30% off its record high of just north of $126,000 hit in October. Smaller coins with fewer institutional vehicles were hurt even more during the recent sell-off, exposing a risk this ETF will lead to bigger losses for smaller investors.On the flipside, as the cryptocurrency market matures and the coins began trading more on their own merits, an ETF like this offers the potential for diversification, like a broad index fund such as the S&P 500 does with equities.\"It's the perfect time for a lot of investors who've now been paying attention since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, but want a more comprehensive solution to allocating to digital assets than having to pick specific assets and size a bunch of different exposures,\" said Horsley.To be sure, the exposure to the smaller coins in the fund is limited. BITW allocates 90% of its holdings to assets that are held by existing single-coin exchange-traded products— Bitcoin, ether, solana and XRP. It caps the combined weight of all other tokens in the fund at 10%. The fund will be rebalanced every month — more frequently than most ETFs, which rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Bitwise manages more than $15 billion in client assets and has a suite of more than 40 digital asset investment products. BITW, which is technically an exchange-traded product, was 1.5% higher Tuesday on its new home at the NYSE Arca exchange.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, right, speaks alongside President Donald Trump about investing in America, at the White House in Washington, on April 30, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's decision to let U.S. tech giant Nvidia sell more advanced semiconductors to China is getting pushback from some Republicans wary of giving Beijing an edge in the global race to AI dominance.The agreement, which Trump announced in a Truth Social post Monday evening, would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China on the condition that the U.S. government gets 25% of the sales.The H200 chips aren't Nvidia's most advanced, but are more powerful than the company's H20s, which were previously developed specifically for the China market.The White House, over the summer, gave approval for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell their less-powerful chips to China in exchange for 15% of sales revenue. Beijing reportedly told companies not to buy those chips.Chinese President Xi Jinping \"responded positively\" to the latest proposal, Trump wrote in the social media post.CNBC has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., for comment.Experts warn that giving China access to the better chips will shrink America's hardware advantage and help Chinese developers vastly improve their AI models and other tech.Some of Trump's Republican allies appear to agree.\"Alarm bells go off in my head here,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNBC on Tuesday when asked about the chip sales agreement.\"I don't mind doing normal business with China. But if you can prove to me this will accelerate their military capability, I'll oppose it,\" Graham said.\"My general view on this is that China's progress on AI is almost entirely parasitic on our technology, in particular on our hardware,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said on Capitol Hill earlier Tuesday.\"So I don't want China to win the AI race. I want to win the AI race,\" Hawley said. \"But if we want to beat China, I think we need to constrain their ability to leverage our own technology, and I think we would want to reduce their access to our hardware, not increase it.\"Hawley did not directly criticize Trump, and noted that the president is privy to more information about the situation than he is. \"So I think he deserves some deference here,\" Hawley said.\"But I think in the general matter I would want to constrain American hardware going to China,\" he added.The U.S. House Select Committee on China, a Republican-led panel formed to focus on the \"threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party,\" echoed Hawley's concerns.\"Right now, China is far behind the United States in chips that power the AI race. Because the H200s are far better than what China can produce domestically, both in capability and scale, @nvidia selling these chips to China could help it catch up to America in total compute,\" the committee said in a statement on X.Beijing will use the H200s, which boast significantly more processing power and memory bandwidth than China's top chips, \"to strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,\" the panel's statement said.\"Finally, Nvidia should be under no illusions – China will rip off its technology, mass produce it themselves, and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor,\" the panel said. \"That is China's playbook and it is using it in every critical industry.\"Not all Republicans are piling on.\"I don't have a real problem with providing them some [chips],\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC. \"But we've got to know where it is, how they're using it, those sorts of things.\"But there is vocal support among both parties for slowing China's ability to obtain the world's best chips.Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., last week introduced bipartisan legislation that would direct the Trump administration to deny export licenses for advanced chips to China and other foreign adversaries for at least 30 months.\"The best AI chips are made by American companies. Denying Beijing access to these AI chips is essential to our national security,\" Ricketts said in a press release unveiling the bill.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., one of the bill's co-sponsors, said, \"It's crucial that we protect American AI innovation from Communist China to win the AI race.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Trump issued a memorandum on Jan. 20 halting permits and leases for offshore and onshore wind farms, pending federal review. Saris said that federal agencies had failed to provide a reasoned explanation for such a drastic change in U.S. policy. Seventeen states led by New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump in May to overturn the president's ban. They argued it created \"an existential threat to the wind industry.\"watch now\"This is a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis and protect one of our best sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,\" James said in a post Monday on social media platform X. States in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic in particular have been pursuing offshore wind projects to meet future energy demand as they seek to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that \"offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.\"  watch now",

    "body": "Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell attend the Batman Forever/R. McDonald Event in New York City on June 13, 1995.Patrick McMullan | Getty ImagesA New York federal judge on Tuesday ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials and other documents related to the prosecution of Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite convicted in 2021 of procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein.Judge Paul Engelmayer's order came at the request of the Department of Justice, which cited the Epstein Files Transparency Act that Congress passed last month.The ruling comes several days after another federal judge, in Florida, ordered that grand jury investigative material from probes of Epstein in 2005 and 2007 be unsealed because of the act.The act mandates that the DOJ disclose investigative material about Epstein, a former friend of President Donald Trump who killed himself in jail in August 2019, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term for her conviction.Grand jury materials are normally permanently sealed by law.Because of that, Engelmayer denied the DOJ's initial request over the summer to unseal grand jury materials in Maxwell's case.In his order on Tuesday, the judge noted that the Epstein files \"Act does not explicitly refer to grand jury materials.\"But, Englemayer added, \"The Court nonetheless holds — again in agreement with DOJ — that the Act textually covers the grand jury materials in this case.\"Englemayer's order authorizes the DOJ to publicly disclose grand jury transcripts and exhibits, as well as extensive material that federal prosecutors disclosed to Maxwell's defense attorneys for her 2021 criminal trial.But he also modified a protective order in the case to put in place a mechanism \"to protect victims from the inadvertent release of materials ... that would identify them or otherwise invade their privacy.\"It is not clear when the DOJ will release the material covered by Engelmayer's order. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ and from Maxwell's defense lawyer.

They do not reveal any heretofore unknown means or methods of Epstein's or Maxwell's crimes,\" the judge had written. \"They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein's death. They do not reveal the path of the Government's investigation.\"Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, in a statement said that the DOJ most now release the Maxwell record.\"The unsealing of Ghislaine Maxwell's case records is a victory for transparency in the Epstein investigation,\" Garcia said. \"These files are now part of the Epstein files held by the Department of Justice, and must be turned over to the Oversight Committee in response to our subpoena, and to the public under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\"watch nowAlthough he granted the DOJ's request to unseal the materials, the judge slapped prosecutors for again not giving notice to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims before asking that the materials be made public. \"In its two rounds of applications to this Court to disclose records, DOJ, although paying lip service to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims, has not treated them with the solicitude they deserve,\" Engelmayer wrote. \"In applying on November 24, 2025 for leave to release records pursuant to the Act, DOJ again acted without notice to Maxwell's and Epstein's victims,\" the judge wrote.\"The Court ... were compelled again to direct DOJ forthwith to notify these victims of its latest motion, and to set a deadline for victims' submissions.",

    "body": "Target has turned its store in New York City's SoHo neighborhood into a unique concept store. Inside of an area that resembles the company's Bullseye logo, the company has \"The Drop,\" a rotating display of seasonal styles and curated items.Courtesy of TargetIn one of New York City's most fashion-forward neighborhoods, Target is unveiling its latest effort to keep up with trends and lead the way on style. The Minneapolis-based retailer, which is in the middle of a turnaround effort and on the cusp of a CEO change, gave a makeover to its big-box store in SoHo at 600 Broadway.The one-of-a-kind concept store, which opens Tuesday, will have rotating merchandise, curated displays chosen by celebrities and influencers, and other kinds of special programming, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.The SoHo store is part of a broader push by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to win back Target's reputation for style and sharp merchandise. When he was named Target's next leader in August, he said that would be one of his top three priorities, along with improving the customer experience and rolling out technology to make Target faster and more efficient. He will start the role in February, succeeding longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Target is trying to get back to growth after roughly four years of stagnant annual sales due to self-inflicted challenges and a more difficult economic backdrop. Store foot traffic and sales have fallen as shoppers have responded to sloppier stores, out-of-stock and locked-up items, and the company's decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Consumers across the country have also become more selective about buying discretionary merchandise, which has long been Target's sweet spot, as they pay more for necessities like groceries, electricity and housing.At an event previewing the store on Monday night, Fiddelke described the SoHo location as \"a punctuation point\" for Target's sense of style and its plans for the future. In an interview with CNBC, Sylvester said the store's merchandise has completely changed. The location, which opened about seven years ago, drew many shoppers and had strong sales, but sold mostly items found in drug and convenience stores, she said. It didn't carry any of Target's clothing or home decor, which felt both out of step with the neighborhood and like a missed opportunity for Target, she said.\"We said, 'This is the style and fashion capital. We have to be able to showcase the best,'\" she said, recalling the inspiration for the project.Read moreFrom start to finish, the store's redesign took four months as the company raced to get the project done ahead of the holidays, Sylvester said. It has redone the store's first floor and plans to redesign the basement floor in the coming year, she added.The SoHo store is reopening at a time when holiday shoppers and tourists flock to the major shopping district for holiday gifts and party outfits — and as Target chases sales across the country during the critical shopping season. It is one of 42 stores that the retailer has in New York City and nearly 2,000 that is has in the U.S.\"The world looks at New York to see what's new and what's next,\" Sylvester said in remarks at the launch event. \"And we want them to look at Target when they see what's new and what's next.\"A look inside Target's SoHo storeInside of a merchandise area that resembles Target's Bullseye logo, the store will have rotating merchandise that's organized around a theme.Melissa Repko, CNBCWhen customers step inside of Target's SoHo store, they will enter a long, red hallway that resembles the inside of Target's Bullseye logo. The area of the store is called \"The Drop,\" and Target will display merchandise there chosen around themes that feel relevant for the time of year, Sylvester said. Like most of the store, the rotating area will swap out about every four to six weeks, she added.As the store opens, The Drop is themed around the holidays — including outfits and items that a shopper may need for going out, lounging at home or giving a gift to a party host. The store displays range across categories, mixing in clothing, home decor, beauty items and more. For example, The Drop currently includes a table of products that a shopper might want if they're hosting a night at home with friends, such as card games, an espresso martini mix and eye-catching glassware for the cocktails.Sylvester said the company's merchants are already working on the next two themes for The Drop, which will be focused on wellness in January, the season of New Year's resolutions, and Valentine's Day in February.Target's SoHo store has an eye-catching \"Beauty Bar\" that shows off fragrances, makeup items and more.Courtesy of TargetCustomers can step inside of Target's \"Broadway Beauty Bar,\" which is designed for selfies and social media posts. It will have a rotating assortment of Target's beauty merchandise, including fragrance brands like Fine'ry that are exclusive to Target, and trendy mini versions of face washes, lip glosses and more from national brands.At launch, Target is featuring items chosen by celebrity makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. Along with the \"Beauty Bar,\" the store sells items typically found at the big-box retailer, including large shampoos, body washes and cotton balls.Near the beauty area, shoppers can also press a button and snap a black-and-white selfie.Though the store's layout is new, it shares a similarity with some of Target's other New York City locations — some items are locked behind glasses cases that an employee needs to open.Target will tap celebrities and influencers to pick their favorite Target items for its \"Curated By\" display.Courtesy of TargetIn the back of the store's first floor, Target will have a rotating \"Curated By\" display of items from across the retailer's beauty, fashion and home categories, picked by celebrities and other creators known for their sense of style. Shoppers can browse and buy that person's favorites or scan a QR code to see a list of them.Target's first Curated By features favorites from Megan Stalter, an actress and comedian who is in HBO's \"Hacks.\" Some of her picks include a throw pillow, a pair of hot pink slippers, metallic water bottles and Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" movie-themed clothing items.Inside of the \"Gifting Gondola,\" Target will show off exclusive merchandise like plushes from its toy brand, Gigglescape, and items themed around its dog mascot, Bullseye, such as special edition Haribo candies.Courtesy of TargetAlso at the store, shoppers can find Target's \"Gifting Gondola,\" which features merchandise exclusive to Target. Currently, the display includes holiday-themed plush penguins, bears and other products from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape. It also includes some giftable items themed around the retailer's bull terrier, Bullseye, including special edition Haribo gummy candies and a Bullseye Pez dispenser.Over time, Sylvester said Target may introduce some items that are unique to the SoHo store and can only be bought there.

    "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Sept. 25, 202",
    "body": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a keynote speech at the Meta Connect annual event at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Sept. 25, 2024.Manuel Orbegozo | ReutersMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg was so optimistic last year about his company's Llama family of artificial intelligence models that he predicted they would become the \"most advanced in the industry\" and \"bring the benefits of AI to everyone.\"But after including a whole section on Llama in his opening remarks during Meta's earnings call in January of this year, he mentioned the brand name only once on the latest call in October. The company's obsession with its open-source large language model has given way to a very different approach to AI, one focused around a multibillion-dollar hiring spree to bring in top industry talent that could help Meta take on the likes of OpenAI, Google and Anthropic. As 2025 comes to a close, Meta's strategy remains scattershot, according to insiders and industry experts, feeding the perception that the company has fallen further behind its top AI rivals, whose models are rapidly gaining adoption in the consumer and enterprise markets. Meta is pursuing a new Llama successor and frontier AI model, codenamed Avocado, CNBC has learned. People with knowledge of the matter said many within the company were expecting the model to be released before the end of this year, but that the plan now is for that to happen in the first quarter of 2026. The model is wrestling with various training-related performance testing intended to ensure the system is well received when it eventually debuts, said the people, who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter.\"Our model training efforts are going according to plan and have had no meaningful timing changes,\" a Meta spokesperson said in a statement.With its stock underperforming the broader tech sector this year and badly trailing Google parent Alphabet, Wall Street is looking for a sense of direction and a path to a return on investment after Meta spent $14.3 billion in June to hire Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and a handful of his top engineers and researchers. Four months after that announcement, which included Meta purchasing a big stake in Scale, the social media company raised its 2025 guidance for capital expenditures to between $70 billion and $72 billion from a prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion. \"In many ways, Meta has been the opposite of Alphabet, where it entered the year as an AI winner and now faces more questions around investment levels and ROI,\" analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets wrote in a November note to clients. The firm recommends buying both stocks. watch nowAt the heart of Meta's challenge is the sustained dominance of its core business: digital advertising. Even with annual sales in excess of $160 billion, Meta's ad targeting business, driven by massive improvements in AI and the popularity of Instagram, is growing revenue north of 20% a year. Investors have lauded the company for using AI to bolster the strength of its cash cow and to make the organization more efficient and less bloated. But Zuckerberg has much grander ambitions, and the new guard he's brought in to push the future vision of AI has no background in online ads. The 41-year-old founder, with a net worth of more than $230 billion, has suggested that if Meta doesn't take big swings, it risks becoming an afterthought in a world that's poised to be defined by AI.Until recently, Meta's unique position in AI was the open-source nature of its Llama models. Unlike other AI models, Meta's technology was made freely available so third-party researchers and others could access the tools and ultimately improve them.\"Today, several tech companies are developing leading closed models,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post in July 2024. \"But open source is quickly closing the gap.\"He's since started changing his tune. Zuckerberg hinted over the summer that Meta was considering shaking up its approach to open source after the April release of Llama 4, which failed to captivate developers. Zuckerberg said in July that, \"We'll need to be rigorous about mitigating these risks and careful about what we choose to open source.\"Avocado, when it's eventually made available, could be a proprietary model, according to people familiar with the matter. That means outside developers wouldn't be able to freely download its so-called weights and related software components. Some at Meta were upset that the R1 model released by Chinese AI lab DeepSeek earlier this year incorporated pieces of Llama's architecture, the people said, further underscoring the risks of open source and hammering home the idea that the company should overhaul its strategy. The company's high-priced AI hires and leaders of the recently launched Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, have also questioned the open-source AI strategy and favored creating a more powerful proprietary AI model, CNBC reported in July. A Meta spokesperson said at the time that the company's \"position on open source AI is unchanged.\"The Llama 4 flub was a significant catalyst in Zuckerberg's pivot, the people said, and also led to a major internal shake-up. Chris Cox, Meta's chief product officer and a 20-year company veteran who was hired as its 13th software engineer, no longer oversees the AI division, formally known as the GenAI unit, after the botched release, the people said. Zuckerberg went on a spending spree to retool Meta's AI leadership. He landed on Wang, then Scale AI's 28-year-old CEO, who was named Meta's new chief AI officer and, in August, became the head of an elite unit called TBD Lab. Avocado is being developed inside TBD, people familiar with the matter said. Alexandr Wang, CEO of ScaleAI speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBCOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in June that Meta was trying to lure talent from his company with gigantic pay packages, including sky-high $100 million signing bonuses, which Meta said at the time was a misrepresentation.Along with Wang came other tech bigwigs, including former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads the product and applied research arm of MSL, and Shengjia Zhao, who was a ChatGPT co-creator. They've brought with them modern methods that have become the standard for frontier AI development in Silicon Valley, and have upended the traditional software development process inside Meta, the people said. Meta's AI culture shiftWang is now under pressure to deliver a top-tier AI model that helps the company regain momentum against rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google, the people said. That pressure has only increased as competitors stepped up their game. Google's Gemini 3, unveiled last month, has drawn solid reviews from users and analysts. OpenAI recently announced new updates to its GPT-5 AI model, while Anthropic debuted its Claude Opus 4.5 model in November shortly after releasing two other major models.Analysts previously told CNBC that there's no clear leading AI model, because some perform better on certain tasks like conversations or coding. But the one constant is that all of the major model creators have to spend a lot of money on AI to maintain any competitive edge, they said. A hefty dose of that spending lines the pockets of Nvidia, the leading developer of AI graphics processing units. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang laid out the state of play during his company's earnings call in November, after the chipmaker reported 62% year-over-year revenue growth. He highlighted a number of model developers as big customers, including Elon Musk's xAI.\"We run OpenAI. We run Anthropic. We run xAI because of our deep partnership with Elon and xAI,\" Huang said. \"We run Gemini. We run Thinking Machines. Let's see, what else do we run? We run them all.\"At no point did Huang reference Llama, although elsewhere on the call he said Meta's Gem, \"a foundation model for ad recommendations trained on large-scale GPU clusters,\" drove an improvement in ad conversions at Meta in the second quarter.  Wang isn't the only Meta exec feeling the heat. Friedman has also been tasked with producing a breakout AI product, the people said. He was responsible for Meta's September launch of Vibes, a feed of AI-generated short videos, which is widely viewed as inferior to OpenAI's Sora 2, they said. Former employees and creators told CNBC that the product was rushed to market and lacked key features, like the ability to generate realistic lip-synched audio.Although Vibes has attracted more interest to the company's stand-alone Meta AI app, it trails the Sora app as measured by downloads, according to data provided to CNBC by Appfigures.Pressure is being felt across Meta's AI organizations, where 70-hour workweeks have become the norm, the people said, while teams have also been hit with layoffs and restructurings throughout the year. In October, Meta cut 600 jobs in MSL to reduce layers and operate more quickly. Those layoffs impacted employees in areas like the Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit, or FAIR, and played a key role in chief AI scientist Yann LeCun's decision to leave the company to launch a startup, according to people with knowledge of the matter.LeCun declined to comment. Yann LeCun, Meta's former chief AI scientist, says people move on.Getty ImagesZuckerberg's high-stakes decision to turn to outsiders like Wang and Friedman to lead the company's AI efforts represented a major change for a company that's historically promoted long-tenured workers to top posts, the people said.In Wang and Friedman, Zuckerberg has handed the controls to experts in infrastructure and related systems, rather than consumer apps. The new leaders also brought a different management style and one that's unfamiliar inside Meta. In particular, insiders told CNBC that Wang and Friedman are more cloistered in their communications, a contrast to a historically open approach of sharing work and chatting on the company's Workplace internal social network Members of Wang's TBD Lab, who work near Zuckerberg's office, don't use Workplace, people familiar said, adding that they're not even on the network and that the group operates like a separate startup. However, Zuckerberg isn't giving the new AI leadership team complete autonomy. Aparna Ramani, engineering vice president, who has been with Meta for nearly a decade, has been put in charge of overseeing the distribution of computing resources for MSL, the people said.And in October, Vishal Shah was moved from leading the company's metaverse initiatives within Reality Labs, where he'd been for four years, to a new role as vice president of AI Products, working with Friedman. Shah is considered a loyal lieutenant who has helped act as a bridge between the company's traditional social apps like Instagram and newer projects like Reality Labs, the people said. Meta confirmed last week that it plans to cut resources for its virtual reality and related metaverse initiatives, shifting its attention to its popular AI-infused glasses developed with EssilorLuxottica.'Demo, don't memo'One of the biggest points of tension between the old and the new is in the realm of software development, people familiar with the matter said. In creating products, Meta has traditionally sought input from numerous groups responsible for areas like front-end user interface, design, algorithmic feeds and privacy, the people said. The multistep process was intended to ensure some level of uniformity among the company's apps that attract billions of users each day. But the many internal tools built over the years to help coders create software and features weren't developed to accommodate foundation models. Meta's new AI leaders, notably Friedman, view them as bottlenecks slowing down what should be a rapid-fire development process, the people said.Friedman has called for MSL to use newer tools that have been calibrated to incorporate multiple AI models and various kinds of coding automation software often called AI agents, the people said. \"They have this mantra now saying 'Demo, don't memo,'\" Lovable CEO Anton Osika said in October at the Masters of Scale Summit in San Francisco, about Meta's new development process.Osika said Meta employees have been using Lovable's tools to more quickly build internal apps, specifically referencing the company's finance teams, which have turned to Lovable to create software for tracking head count and planning.  An illustration photo shows the event of Meta launching the Vibes platform, Suqian City, Jiangsu Province, China on September 26, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesWhile Meta continues retooling its app development methods and pushes toward releasing Avocado, the company has been experimenting with other AI models on its products. Vibes, for instance, relied on AI models from Black Forest Labs and Midjourney, a startup that counts Friedman as an advisor. Meta is also altering its approach to infrastructure, and is increasingly turning to third-party cloud computing services like CoreWeave and Oracle for developing and testing AI features as it builds out its own massive data centers, the people said. The social media giant announced in October that it signed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital as part of a $27 billion deal to help fund and develop the gargantuan Hyperion data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The company said at the time that the partnership provides the \"the speed and flexibility\" Meta needs to build the data center and support its \"long-term AI ambitions.\"Despite the company's challenges in 2025, Zuckerberg's message to employees and investors is that he's more committed than ever to winning. At the top of the company's earnings call in October, Zuckerberg said MSL is \"off to a strong start.\"\"I think that we've already built the lab with the highest talent density in the industry,\" Zuckerberg said. \"We're heads down developing our next generation of models and products and I'm looking forward to sharing more on that front over the coming months.\"WATCH: Data center demand driving infrastructure creditwatch now",

    "body": "Luis AlvarezAs year-end approaches, many investors still need to take required withdrawals from retirement accounts — or face an IRS penalty of up to 25%. This includes retirees and certain heirs with an inherited individual retirement account.At age 73, most retirees must start required minimum distributions, or RMDs, from pretax accounts. Your first RMD is due by April 1 of the year after turning 73, and the deadline for future withdrawals is Dec. 31. For heirs facing RMDs, the annual deadline is also Dec. 31.With the annual deadline nearing, many investors haven't yet made their required withdrawal, according to data from Fidelity. As of Nov. 30, 53% of Fidelity investors who needed a 2025 RMD hadn't taken one — and 29% of those outstanding RMDs were from inherited IRAs, Fidelity reported. The data does not consider possible RMDs taken from accounts with other firms.At this point, if you're subject to the Dec. 31 deadline, you should \"take it as soon as you can,\" Sham Ganglani, retirement distributions leader at Fidelity, told CNBC. Otherwise, you could have less flexibility with the withdrawal. For example, some investors have to sell assets to make cash available for the RMD, he said. Every year, millions of investors must follow complex RMD rules or face an IRS penalty. Those rules have changed in recent years amid new legislation and agency guidance. What to know about the missed RMD penaltyIf you don't take your full RMD by the due date, the penalty is 25% of the amount you should have withdrawn. That could be reduced to 10% if the RMD is \"timely corrected\" within two years, and you file Form 5329, according to the IRS.In some cases, the IRS could waive the penalty entirely if the shortfall happened due to \"reasonable error\" and you've taken \"reasonable steps\" to fix the mistake, according to the agency. If you miss the Dec. 31 RMD deadline, take the funds \"as fast as you possibly can,\" to demonstrate a \"timely\" withdrawal, said Ganglani. \"[The IRS] seems to be willing to work with you when you are doing the right thing.\"    Inherited IRA rules are 'the biggest landmine'The complicated rules for inherited IRAs could also lead to IRS penalties, experts say.  \"This is the biggest landmine in 2025,\" said certified financial planner Scott Van Den Berg, president of advisory firm Century Management in Austin.Since 2020, certain inherited accounts are subject to the \"10-year rule,\" which means heirs must deplete the balance by the 10th year after the original account owner's death.      Plus, some non-spouse beneficiaries, such as adult children, must start taking RMDs in 2025 over the 10-year period.If the original account owner already started RMDs before death, non-spouse heirs must continue RMDs yearly. Previously, the IRS waived penalties for missed RMDs, but that no longer applies for 2025.\"Many beneficiaries have no idea the rule changed,\" Van Den Berg said.",

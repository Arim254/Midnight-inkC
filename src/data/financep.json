    "body": "With any credit card, there's typically a limit to how much you can spend. And experts say choosing the right limit can play an important role in maintaining good credit health.Set based on factors like your income, credit history and ability to repay, your credit limit is the maximum amount of money you can borrow on a credit card or account. \"Generally speaking, more credit is better, as long as you don't use it as a crutch to overspend and take on too much debt,\" says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. Experts often recommend seeking out a limit that's well above how much you'll spend in a month to maximize your credit score. Your \"ideal\" credit limit will depend on your personal spending habits and preferences, Rossman says.The best limit for your credit scoreToo keep your credit score high, it's best to use only 10% to 30% of your available credit and pay your statements off in full every month, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia.The percentage of your available credit that you're using is a metric known as credit utilization. Keeping utilization low shows lenders you manage credit responsibly, which helps improve your credit score, while hitting that limit every month signals to lenders that you may be over-reliant on credit and a higher lending risk, thus lowering your score, says Rossman.Working backward from the an ideal credit utilization of 10% to 30%, if you typically spend around $5,000 a month on your card, you should have a limit of $50,000, Tsantes says. By the same metric, if you typically spend around $2,500 on your card, $25,000 could be a good limit, he adds. \"The idea is that you'll never be close to hitting that limit,\" Tsantes says. Having a seemingly high limit is there not as money available to use, but as a buffer to keep your balance well below your maximum and your credit utilization low.It may also be smart to consult a trusted financial professional who can help you determine the amount of credit that makes sense for you.It's OK to stick to a more practical limitCredit card debt can be costly and hard to pay off. So, if you know you're likely to view your credit limit as the amount you can spend each month, it may be wiser to stick to a limit that covers just the essentials with a small buffer, Rossman says.\"You definitely don't want to be hitting or approaching that limit or spending more than you can afford to pay back,\" he says. \"Even though it's good for your credit score to have more credit, if you're going to use that as a way to overspend, that could be a danger.\"However, even with a lower limit, it's still possible to maintain a low credit utilization ratio, Rossman says. If your line of credit is just enough to cover your essentials and you're getting close to your limit every month, there are \"workarounds\" to lower your utilization, like making extra payments throughout the month to keep your usage under 30%.How to increase your credit limitTo increase your credit limit, you can either request a credit limit increase for an existing card or open a new card with a new line of credit, Rossman says. Start by checking with your existing credit card issuer to see if requesting a credit limit increase will trigger a hard or soft credit inquiry, he says. Hard inquiries can cause a small, temporary dip in your credit score, while a soft inquiry is a routine or informational check that does not affect your credit score. If your issuer will use a soft inquiry, increasing the limit on an existing card can boost available credit and lower your credit utilization without hurting your score, Rossman says.If your issuer is going to run a hard inquiry, it may be more strategic to open a new credit card with a different set of rewards and benefits, Rossman says. That way, you can have more options to maximize benefits across your cards, he says.Although increasing your credit limit can raise your spending power, avoid treating that extra credit as more money or an emergency fund for \"desperate times,\" Rossman says. Spending more than you can afford on a credit card can lead to high-interest debt that becomes difficult to repay, he says, especially if your financial situation is already strained.\"Having a credit card with a $5,000 limit — yes, that could help you in a pinch — but that's not the same as having $5,000 in the bank,\" Rossman says. \"This is debt. It can be very expensive debt.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "European leaders on Wednesday condemned a move by the U.S. to ban visas for five individuals — including a former EU commissioner — for alleged censorship.The Trump administration imposed visa bans on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner behind the Digital Services Act (DSA), and four anti-disinformation campaigners, accusing them of censoring U.S. social media platforms.\"The State Department is taking decisive action against five individuals who have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.The DSA forces tech giants like Google and Meta to police illegal content more aggressively, or face hefty fines.Rubio added that \"these radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states—in each case targeting American speakers and American companies.\" As such, their entry to the U.S. has \"potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences,\" he said. \"Based on these determinations, the Department has taken steps to impose visa restrictions on agents of the global censorship-industrial complex who, as a result, will be generally barred from entering the United States.\" Breton, who served as EU commissioner between 2019 and 2024, wrote on X: \"Is McCarthy's witch hunt back?\"He added: \"As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA.\" \"To our American friends: \"Censorship isn't where you think it is.\"\" 'Witch hunt'The European Commission \"strongly condemned\" the move on Wednesday. \"Freedom of expression is a fundamental right in Europe and a shared core value with the United States across the democratic world,\" it said in a statement, adding that \"the EU is an open, rules-based single market, with the sovereign right to regulate economic activity in line with our democratic values and international commitments.\"\"Our digital rules ensure a safe, fair, and level playing field for all companies, applied fairly and without discrimination.\" The Commission has asked for clarifications from U.S. authorities, it said. \"Freedom of speech is the foundation of our strong and vibrant European democracy,\" said current EU chief Ursula von der Leyen on X. \"We are proud of it. We will protect it.\"French President Emmanuel Macron said that his country condemns the visa restrictions. \"These measures amount to intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty,\" he said in a statement on X. watch now\"The European Union's digital regulations were adopted following a democratic and sovereign process by the European Parliament and the Council.\"He also said that the DSA does not target any specific third country but is designed \"to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online.\"It comes as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up travel restrictions for foreign visitors and criticizes Europe. Rubio did not identify who his department had taken action against, however Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers later did so on X. Josephine Ballon, the co-leader of HateAid who serves on Germany's Advisory Council of the Digital Services, was among those working on anti-disinformation campaigns to receive sanctions. Her co-leader Anna-Lena von Hodenberg was also affected. CNBC has reached out to Ballon and Von Hodenberg for comment.The bans are part of efforts to enforce what Rogers refers to as a \"red line\" for the U.S. and the \"extraterritorial censorship of Americans.\" In an interview with GB news on Dec. 4, Rogers took aim at the U.K.'s Online Safety Act (OSA), saying the law was being applied extraterritorially, accounting for U.S. citizens' speech about U.S. politics on U.S.-based platforms.Europe's DSA and the U.K.'s OSA are among only a handful of pieces of legislation designed to keep the power of Big Tech in check and improve safety for children online. OSA law requires age verification on adult sites and a number of other platforms.",

    "body": "A Waymo car is halted on the road amid a power outage in San Francisco, California, U.S., December 20, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video.dReutersThree days after a blackout in San Francisco caused Waymo to pause its driverless car service, the Alphabet-owned company said it's updating its fleet so its vehicles are better prepared to respond during future outages. \"We've always focused on developing the Waymo Driver for the world as it is, including when infrastructure fails,\" the company said in a blog post late Tuesday. Power outages began early afternoon on Saturday in San Francisco and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power. PG&E said a fire at a substation resulted in \"significant and   extensive\" damage.With stoplights and traffic signals not functioning, the city was hit with widespread gridlock. Videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in various neighborhoods. \"We directed our fleet to pull over and park appropriately so we could return vehicles to our depots in waves,\" Waymo said in Tuesday's blog post. \"This ensured we did not further add to the congestion or obstruct emergency vehicles during the peak of the recovery effort.\"San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in an update on X Saturday evening that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.Waymo said that it's analyzing the event, and is taking three \"immediate steps.\" The first involves \"fleet-wide updates\" to give vehicles \"more context about regional outages,\" so cars can take more decisive actions at intersections. The company said it's also improving its \"emergency response protocols,\" and is coordinating with Mayor Lurie's team in San Francisco to better collaborate in emergency preparedness. Finally, Waymo said it's updating its first responder training \"as we discover learnings from this and other widespread events.\" In addition to the Bay Area, Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in and around Austin, Texas, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles. The company recently crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and said in December it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.\"Backed by 100M+ miles of fully autonomous driving experience and a record of improving road safety, we are undaunted by the opportunity to challenge the status quo of our roads, and we're proud to continue serving San Franciscan residents and visitors,\" the company said in Tuesday's blog.— CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.

    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms — called FAST channels — like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast’s planned spinoff of Versant.",

Above that, certain tax breaks, such as the earned income tax credit, can also reduce liability below zero.In 2022, more than one-third of tipped workers, 37%, owed no federal income tax due to low income, according to a 2024 report from The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank, showed similar findings. If tips were tax-free or tax-exempt, only about 60% of tipped workers would benefit, the organization reported in early 2025.Some tipped workers won't qualify A Starbucks barista demonstrates how to brew coffee using a siphon at the Reserve Store in Seattle.StarbucksSince the policy was first introduced, there have been questions about which occupations qualify for the \"no tax on tips\" deduction. The Treasury Department and IRS released a preliminary list of jobs in September. But certain workers who receive tips via a so-called \"specified service trade or businesses,\" or SSTBs, from industries including health care, legal, financial services, performing arts and others, are not eligible for the tax break. However, SSTB workers may be able to temporarily claim the deduction for 2025 until the Treasury and IRS finalize regulations, based on \"transition relief\" released by the agencies in November.  With lingering uncertainty about eligibility, \"it's possible to confuse people into thinking they will qualify for this for future years,\" said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation.

The company has been on an acquisition spree in 2025 as it sought to accelerate growth, McDermott  said. ServiceNow announced a deal for AI agent platform Moveworks for $2.85 billion in March, and at the beginning of December, said it would acquire identity security platform Veza.\"ServiceNow will have the only AI control tower that drives workflow, action and business outcomes across all of these environments,\" McDermott added.

In November, the California-based company, which helps businesses protect internet-connected devices from cyber risks, said it had raised $435 million at a $6.1 billion valuation.At the time, co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov told CNBC that Armis was looking to go public in 2026 or 2027, but his main objective was to surpass $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. \"The need for what Armis is doing and what we are building, in this cyber exposure management and security platform, is just increasing,\" he said, adding that there's \"very unique and huge\" demand for its tools. Many companies have opted to stay private for longer or get acquired as a turbulent initial public offering market has begun to rebound. Large companies such as Stripe and Databricks have found an influx of capital in private markets.  In the age of AI, companies are spending more on cybersecurity to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. This year has also been significant for major cybersecurity deals as companies look to enhance their threat protection capabilities. That includes Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion deal for CyberArk. ServiceNow said Armis has topped $340 million in annual recurring revenue with 50% year-over-year growth, up from $300 million disclosed in August. ",

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. By law, borrowers must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageAffordability is a buzzword right now — these charts show whyIt's too late for some last-minute tax moves — but these can be tackled in daysTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

    "body": "Wires and cables in a server room. Thomas Northcut | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesNvidia has been the biggest infrastructure winner in the artificial intelligence boom, soaring in value by almost thirteenfold since the end of 2022 to a market cap of $4.6 trillion.While Nvidia's rally continued in 2025, investors betting on other AI data center plays made a lot more money over the past 12 months. With four of the biggest technology companies projecting collective expenditures of $380 billion on data center and infrastructure build-outs this year, followed by an expected increase in the coming years, Wall Street has poured money into an assortment of vendors that are poised to reap the rewards. Makers of memory, storage, fiber-optic cables, central processors and other types of enterprise hardware have rocketed in valued this year, driven by excitement around the AI craze. Investors will be scrutinizing these five companies closely in 2026 now that lofty expectations have been built into their stock prices. Lumentum watch nowLumentum, based in San Jose, California, makes switches, transceivers and other optical laser-based parts that are needed for fiber-optic cables. Customers have typically been telecommunications carriers and device makers like Apple, which previously used Lumentum parts in its FaceID sensor. But AI servers also need a lot of optical connections. Every graphics processing unit in a rack needs to be connected to every other GPU. Future AI systems will scale out, which requires optical connections from rack to rack. Eventually, entire data centers will need to be connected to each other with fiber-optic connections. Lumentum's stock price has jumped 375% this year, lifting the company's market cap past $27 billion. Sales surged 58% in the most recent quarter from a year earlier to $533 million. \"Our growth is powered by AI demand spanning our laser chips and optical transceivers inside data centers, as well as the interconnected long-haul networks that link them,\" Lumentum CEO Michael Hurlston said on an earnings call in November. He said 60% of the company's sales now come from cloud and AI infrastructure.Revenue is expected to rise 58% for the fiscal year ending in June, but analysts see a slowdown from there to growth of 32% and 15% in the next two years, according to LSEG. Western Digitalwatch nowWestern Digital is one of three major hard drive manufacturers, along with Seagate and Toshiba. Shares of the 55-year-old company are up 300% this year. In addition to computing power, AI companies need increasing amounts of space to store applications and other data. In short, data centers need hard drives. While Western Digital makes solid-state hard drives, which use chips to store data, the company is best known for its hard disk drives, which use spinning discs to store terabytes or more of data.\"Data is the fuel that powers AI, and it is HDDs that provide the most reliable, scalable and cost-effective data storage solution,\" CEO Irving Tan said in October on an earnings call. He cited an example of a hospital that's using an AI that analyzes 7 billion images.In the most recent quarter, revenue rose 27% to $2.82 billion. The company says that selling more storage for data centers will improve profitability because AI companies need larger, more expensive hard drives.Revenue is expected to increase about 23% in fiscal 2026, with growth slowing to 13% in 2027. In February, Western Digital spun out its flash business as Sandisk, which now has a market cap of about $35 billion, more than half the value of Western Digital.Micronwatch nowMicron is one of three major memory producers, alongside Samsung and SK Hynix, but the only one based in the U.S. Artificial intelligence servers need a lot of memory to store and process massive AI models. Chips from Nvidia or Advanced Micro Devices come with scores of gigabytes of the most advanced memory, called high-bandwidth memory. The chipmakers are taking all the memory production capacity, leading to a worldwide shortage and driving prices higher. Micron blew away Wall Street estimates for sales and earnings in its quarterly report last week, and the stock is now up 239% for the year. Sumit Sadana, Micron's business chief, said the company was \"more than sold out\" of its memory chips. In December, it even shuttered its consumer-focused line of memory and solid-state drives to save supply for AI.Analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a December note that Micron's results showed the best revenue and profit upside in the \"history of the U.S. semis industry\" — aside from Nvidia. Revenue is expected to almost double in the year ending in August, before dramatically slowing to 24% in fiscal 2027 and less than 1% in 2028, according to LSEG. Seagate An exterior view of a Seagate office on October 26, 2022 in Fremont, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesSeagate, founded nine years after Western Digital, is also benefiting from booming demand for storage. The stock is up 229% this year. Sales rose 21% to $2.63 billion in the company's fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 3. The company said at the time that 80% of its sales go to the data center market. \"There is no question that AI is reshaping hard drive demand by elevating the economic value of data and data storage,\" CEO Dave Mosley said on a call with analysts. Seagate is unlikely to have extra hard drives in inventory, Bank of America analysts wrote in November, as any additional shipments will get claimed quickly. The analysts also noted that customers are signing build-to-order contracts with firm volume and price commitments. \"The extra units are typically purchased by hyperscale or other mass capacity customers,\" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the stock. Seagate's trajectory looks similar to Western Digital. Analysts expect 21% revenue growth this fiscal year, followed by increases of about 15% and 6% in the next two years, according to LSEG. CelesticaCheng Xin | Getty ImagesCelestica, founded in 1994 as an IBM subsidiary, makes switches that connect networks together and manage the data and traffic flowing through them.The stock is up 236% this year. The company sells many of its switches to the biggest AI buyers. Sales rose 28% in the third quarter to $3.19 billion. Analysts expect revenue growth to climb from 26% this year to 33% in 2026 and 34% in 2027, according to LSEG. Celestica CEO Robert Mionis said on an earnings call in October that a hyperscaler recently approached the company to build parts to connect liquid-cooled rack-scale computers for AI, and said mass production is scheduled to begin next year.  One boon for Celestica is surging demand for custom chips called ASICs, which are less flexible than GPUs but can be cheaper to operate for specific AI applications.\"Our largest and fastest-growing market presence is within AI data centers, supporting high-performance networking and custom ASIC AI/ML compute platforms,\" Mionis said. Analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note Friday that Celestica supplies parts for Google's ASIC. \"The company should benefit in 2026 from being the leading provider of Google TPU rack level solutions,\" the analysts wrote.

    "body": "People shop at a grocery store in Brooklyn on December 12, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAffordability has been a source of household frustration and a key focus of political discourse in recent months, as prices for everyday goods and services continue to rise.\"People are yelling about affordability,\" said Martha Gimbel, executive director and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale University. \"I think it's very obviously become a political flash point,\" she said. The inflation rate has throttled back from its peak in 2022, when it hit a roughly 40-year high of 9.1%, as measured by the annual consumer price index. It was 2.7% in November 2025.But the everyday prices that consumers pay remain much higher than they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. The CPI — which measures how quickly prices are rising for a basket of goods and services — has risen 26% in the past six years. Put another way: The inflation rate since Q4 2019 has risen about twice as fast as the Federal Reserve's optimal rate, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. But prices have risen even faster for many items that are consumer staples or impact overall quality of life, economists said.That's true for categories like housing, groceries, electricity, dining out, car repairs and used cars, for example, according to CPI data. Businesses generally don't cut prices — so prices have risen in absolute terms even as inflation has decelerated, albeit less quickly, according to economists. \"It is the case that wages have been outpacing inflation in recent years, that our living standards are just higher than they used to be,\" Gimbel said. \"On the other hand, it is simply the case that certain categories of spending are more emotional for people,\" she said. A University of Michigan poll published in December shows that high prices remain a pain point for consumers. About 46% blame high prices for poor personal finances — among the highest shares since the series started in the late 1970s.

For example, Politico's poll shows a big gap in perceptions among Democrats and Republicans. About 82% of people who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election said the cost of living has gotten worse over the past year, according to the survey. Meanwhile, 45% of voters for President Donald Trump said the same. Earlier this month, Trump called affordability a \"hoax\" during a speech in Pennsylvania. However, he has also floated the idea of sending a $2,000 tariff \"dividend\" to many households, a move that economists say could stoke inflation and worsen affordability. Trump announced last week in a televised prime-time address to the nation that the government would send a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" check to each U.S. service member before Christmas.  watch nowDemocrats have ridden the affordability issue to victories in recent elections, including the mayoral race in New York and gubernatorial contests in New Jersey and Virginia. Those election wins — coupled with other factors like tariffs levied this year — have brought Americans' focus back to affordability after a period of softening inflation, Zandi said.\"The thing that brought it to the fore was the special elections that showed very clearly people are voting based on this issue,\" he said. \"And I think that's what's pushed this to the top of the political discourse.\"Why affordability will continue to be in the spotlightAffordability may remain a top concern heading into 2026, too. Enhanced premium subsidies for 22 million Americans enrolled in health insurance via the Affordable Care Act marketplace are poised to disappear at the end of 2025, leading insurance premiums to more than double for the average recipient. watch nowHigh prices are not the only affordability driverHigh prices since the Covid-19 pandemic are a byproduct of many factors. At a high level, a mismatch between supply and demand drove prices upwards rapidly, according to economists. The government pumped trillions of stimulus dollars into the U.S. economy to prop up household spending, and consumer demand exploded when the economy reopened broadly in early 2021; meanwhile, the Covid-19 health crisis choked supply chains, limiting supply to meet that demand. Businesses rushed to rehire workers, pushing up wage growth — and prices — especially in service-oriented sectors. Vehicles under repair at an automotive shop in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on Dec. 12, 2025. Nick Oxford/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesRussia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 pushed up prices further for energy and food. Most recently, tariffs have put some upward pressure on prices, \"rekindling\" the affordability narrative, Zandi said. But high prices are just one factor feeding into feelings about affordability, Zandi said.Jobs, wages and the household balance sheet, including assets and debt, also feed into sentiment, he said. The job market has broadly cooled, unemployment has increased and businesses are reticent to hire. Interest rates have fallen but remain quite high for credit cards and auto loans, while mortgage rates remain above 6%, Zandi said. I think it's very obviously become a political flash point.Martha Gimbelexecutive director and co-founder of the Budget Lab at Yale UniversityWhile stock prices have soared, those riches have flowed largely to high-income households, which own a disproportionate share of such assets. Wage growth has also declined more rapidly for lower-wage workers than for those earning higher incomes, according to data compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.\"Not all Americans are feeling the affordability squeeze,\" Zandi wrote in November. \"The finances of the well-to-do are arguably as good as they have ever been.\"Households who feel that squeeze shouldn't necessarily despair, however, Gimbel said.\"We can solve these problems,\" she said. \"But it takes time, and people need to feel like you're listening to them and taking them seriously.\"",

    "body": "Americans are more anxious about the holidays this year, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Healthy Minds Poll.Forty-one percent of U.S. adults say they anticipate more stress related to the holidays this year than last year, compared to 28% in 2024 and 29% in 2023. They list numerous reasons including missing someone in their life, dealing with the cost of holiday gifts, navigating challenging family dynamics and being lonely.If you're stressed out this time of year, there are tactics you can try to make the holidays more pleasant. Here's what Sabrina Romanoff, New York–based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily, recommends.Try 'muting accounts on social media that are really making you feel awful'Americans spend a lot of time on social media. Thirty-seven percent of U.S. adults visit Facebook several times a day, according to the Pew Research Center.  With so much time spent looking at other people's lives, it's easy to compare what your holidays look like to what theirs do.Making this season more pleasant \"can mean muting accounts on social media that are really making you feel awful, making you feel not good enough,\" says Romanoff. You can block them or unfollow them altogether.In December, as in any time of the year, \"it's really important to be intentional about what you are seeing and consuming,\" she says, \"because that's going to change the lens through which you see your own life.\"Choose to participate in whatever way 'makes your life more comfortable'If you're nervous about some of the people you'll be spending time with this season, you can also tailor your experience accordingly.That could mean, \"I'm not going to make myself uncomfortable to make Aunt Karen comfortable when she asks her intrusive questions,\" says Romanoff. \"I'm going to let there be silence.\" It could also mean giving yourself breaks during gatherings that feel overwhelming and going to another room for a few minutes. It could even mean deciding that there are certain celebrations you're going to skip altogether — and replace with get-togethers with your chosen family.Ultimately, making this time of year happier and less stressful \"means really showing up in a way that makes your life more comfortable for you,\" she says.

    "body": "A fire engulfing a residential building complex at Wang Fuk Court in the Tai Po district of Hong Kong, China, on Wednesday, Nov. 26, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhat a year this has been. Understandably for many, it could not be over soon enough. From the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs to natural and man-made disasters across Asia. To new leaders breaking glass ceilings and old leaders whisked off to The International Criminal Court, or even sentenced to death in absentia. Missiles fired across borders. Terrorist attacks in South Asia and the Pacific. Enduring corruption challenges and real estate woes. And people scammed and enslaved. As 2025 comes to a close, we look back and see who had it bad and who had it good. Worst year: Asia's cyber scam victimsThe year saw a growing tsunami of cybercrime sweeping across the globe, emanating from Southeast Asia. Criminal gangs largely operating out of Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia defrauded billions of dollars from victims worldwide.The \"perpetrators\" are also the victims. Hundreds of thousands of individuals enticed with fake employment offers to these nations, many transiting via Thailand, then held against their will, enslaved to work in these scam centers.The year saw a growing tsunami of cybercrime sweeping across the globe, emanating from Southeast Asia. Sarayut Thaneerat | Moment | Getty ImagesThe kidnapping of Chinese actor Wang Xing, who was lured by a fraudulent acting gig, then forced to work in one operation in January 2025, brought heightened attention to this growing crisis. Even the Trump administration took notice. \"The scam centers are creating a generational wealth transfer from Main Street America into the pockets of Chinese organized crime,\" said U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro. Weak governments and corruption allow these multi-billion-dollar criminal enterprises to function, despite high-profile efforts to free captives and close compounds that have operated with near impunity in Southeast Asia. Unless stopped, these operations will only grow more sophisticated as they begin to use AI and deepfakes to perpetrate their crimes. Asia's enslaved cyber scam victims earn the distinction of having the worst year in Asia, with sadly far too little hope for escape and rescue in sight. Bad year: casualties of earth, wind, water and fireThe death count across large swaths of Asia seemed to accelerate by the year's end. Throughout all of 2025, too many people fell victim to natural disasters such as earthquakes, typhoons and floods, seemingly made worse by human corruption or ineptness. A March 28 earthquake in Myanmar killed more than 3,600, displaced some 200,000 and even brought down a skyscraper under construction across the border in distant Bangkok, killing dozens more. From Sri Lanka to Thailand to Indonesia to Vietnam to Malaysia and the Philippines, floods, mudslides and typhoons combined to impact millions and kill more than 1,600. Add fire to the mix. The year closed with the horrific Wang Fuk Court apartment complex fire in Tai Po, Hong Kong. Televised scenes of towering infernos were seen worldwide. Inoperable fire alarms and below-grade construction materials reportedly contributed to the heartbreaking tragedy, with at least 160 people dead —  making it one of the deadliest fires in the city's history. Mixed Year: Gen Z uprisingsArmed with memes, hashtags and reels and some waving the Jolly Roger Flag popularized by the Japanese anime and manga series \"One Piece,\" Gen Zers hungering for change had a mixed year in 2025.  Many in this cohort of young people born between 1997 and 2012 took to the streets, including in Nepal, Indonesia, Philippines, the Maldives and even in the new ASEAN member state Timor-Leste, to protest corruption, nepotism and economic inequality. The results were decidedly mixed though their frustrations seemed all too common in Asia. The Gen-Z group escalates their ongoing demonstrations, confronting police outside the Prime Minister's official residence in Kathmandu, Nepal, on November 26, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThese \"digital natives\" succeeded in bringing down Nepal's government. Last year, this generation had played a key role in toppling the government of Bangladesh. In other countries, small concessions were achieved in 2025. Yet, at year-end, the question remains whether Gen Z — the first generation to fully grow up in the internet era — is able to maintain momentum and turn these uprisings into a viable movement for constructive change. The shared hope remains for a political force that can reform entrenched and corrupt systems, alleviate the youth's deep frustration with the status quo and bring about more economic opportunities. To quote Monkey D. Luffy from \"One Piece,\" \"If you don't take risks, you can't create a future.\" Good Year: Asia's 'Bamboo Economic Tactics' Resilience was in full display across Asia's slowing but still growing economies at year-end. Leaders across the region adopted flexible strategies — akin to bamboo bending in high winds — to navigate Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. Indeed, it proved a good year for \"bamboo economic tactics\" as the region's reputation for pragmatism held and countries were able to manage the new global economic reality. This approach led to reduced U.S. tariffs — down from duties proposed initially — and revamped trade configurations and new economic strategies.Asian countries were able to manage the new global economic reality, entering into deals that cut U.S. tariffs. Ignatiev | E+ | Getty ImagesOne example is the India, Canada and Australia cooperation agreement on technology and innovation, underscoring Asian nations' own \"Art of the Deal.\" Recalibrating economic approach allowed developing Asia to achieve growth hovering around 5% for the year, according to the Asian Development Bank. This also kept Asia on track overall as the world's fastest-growing region in the world. Best Year: Chinese Soft PowerIf tech and creative content are the new soft power, this past year showed that \"Made In China\" could be a contender, with Beijing joining the ranks of the United States and Korea as a soft-power giant.  The year began with the January surprise: the launch of DeepSeek'a low-cost AI model in a world once-enamored by ChatGPT and American tech prowess. By year-end, the \"ugly-cute\" Pop Mart collectible, Labubu, had taken the world by a storm, even appearing in New York City's iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Labubu is part of a larger group of characters called \"The Monsters,\" created by Hong Kong artist and author Kasing Lung.The Friends-giving in POPCITY float is prepared on the eve of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade 2025 on Manhattan's upper west side in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025. Kylie Cooper | ReutersFrom BYD electric vehicles to the biggest animated film in the world ever — Ne Zha 2 that reportedly grossed more than $2 billion — to Li-Ning sneakers appearing on NBA courts and Luckin Coffee shops opening at a rapid pace throughout Asia and the United States, Chinese soft power was clearly on the rise in 2025, and so receives the distinction for having the best year in Asia.

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.\"I think there'll be further stake sales of different parts of BP\" going forward, Dan Boardman-Weston, CEO at BRI Wealth Management, told CNBC on Wednesday. The shift will see the company \"getting back to their bread and butter of focusing on oil and gas exploration and development.\"The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

    "body": "Aire Images | Moment | Getty ImagesAs the calendar winds down, there is still time for certain year-end tax moves — but investors need to act quickly, experts say. With the tax season fast approaching, these tactics could boost your refund or reduce taxes owed, depending on how much you've already paid.     However, most planning moves must be done by Dec. 31 to count for 2025. Some exceptions include pre-tax individual retirement account or health savings account contributions, which can be made by the tax deadline in 2026.  Keep in mind, timing could be tricky with a shortened trading day on Christmas Eve, the major exchanges closed on Christmas Day and holiday hours for some financial firms.  Many taxpayers could see bigger tax refunds in 2026 due to 2025 changes made via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" The IRS did not update withholding tables for employers after the law was enacted, and many workers could see the benefit at tax time, experts say. With limited time left until Dec. 31, here are a few last-minute tax strategies to consider, according to financial experts. Tax loss or gain harvestingOne popular year-end move is tax-loss harvesting, or selling losing brokerage account assets to offset portfolio gains on your tax return. If investing losses exceed profits, you can use the excess to reduce regular income by up to $3,000 per year. However, with the S&P 500 up nearly 17% year-to-date, as of Dec. 22, many investors won't have 2025 brokerage account losses, experts say.Instead, investors in lower tax brackets may consider so-called \"tax-gain harvesting,\" which involves strategically selling profitable assets. If your taxable income falls within the 0% capital gains bracket, you could diversify your portfolio or take profits without triggering a tax bill.Either way, depending on your investments, there's still enough time to harvest losses or gains before year-end.\"New Year's Eve is a full trading day for a reason,\" said certified financial planner Michael DeMassa, founder of Forza Wealth Management in Sarasota, Florida. \"It doesn't matter if it settles, as long as the trade date is [Dec. 31], it's in the calendar year.\"Year-end Roth conversions Another popular year-end strategy is Roth individual retirement account conversions, which transfer pretax or nondeductible IRA funds into a Roth IRA to begin future tax-free growth.However, income projections are important because you'll owe upfront taxes on the converted balance. Many advisors wait until year-end for Roth conversions, when they have more precise estimates for other earnings. Depending on your Roth conversion strategy, the move could be \"pretty quick,\" according to CFP Judy Brown, who works at C&H Group in the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area.\"We pick the highest appreciated funds in there, and we do an in-kind conversion,\" which transfers the assets from one account to the other without selling, she said. \"It's good the next day.\" However, the process could take longer if you don't have an existing Roth IRA set up to receive the funds, said Brown, who is also a certified public accountant: \"Getting accounts set up right now is probably the biggest barrier.\" ",

    "body": "Thos Robinson | Getty ImagesAmazon CEO Andy Jassy could see how dramatically artificial intelligence was altering e-commerce.In June, he told employees that AI agents will start to infiltrate aspects of everyday life, \"from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks.\"Four months later, Jassy said on an earnings call that Amazon expects to partner with third-party agents, and has engaged in conversations with some providers, though he didn't offer names.Now, Amazon is looking to hire a leader in corporate development to help forge strategic partnerships in areas including \"agentic commerce,\" according to a recent job posting.Amazon's rapid evolution in its view of AI-powered commerce underscores how quickly online retail is changing, and the risks the company faces if it doesn't act aggressively to maintain control over its future.The company has watched as OpenAI, Google, Perplexity and Microsoft have released a flurry of e-commerce agents in recent months that aim to change how people shop. Instead of visiting Amazon, Walmart or Nike directly, consumers could rely on AI agents to do the hard work of scanning the web for the best deal or perfect product, then buy the item without exiting a chatbot window. The first shopping agents from AI leaders were released about a year ago. Consulting firm McKinsey projected that agentic commerce could generate $1 trillion in U.S. retail revenue by 2030. It's a trend that poses a threat to Amazon's margins and relationships with customers. When a consumer uses ChatGPT to initiate a purchase, for example, OpenAI collects \"a small fee\" from each transaction. \"With an agent on ChatGPT, retailers risk relinquishing transactions on their site to pay a toll on someone else's highway for the same transaction,\" Sucharita Kodali, a retail analyst at Forrester, said in an interview. Some companies are trying to find a middle ground between working with agent providers and competing against them. Walmart, Shopify and others have adopted a frenemy strategy, announcing partnerships with AI companies while continuing to develop their own tools and setting guardrails around how agents can access their sites.Shopify CEO Tobi Lutke wrote in a post on X on Tuesday that his company is \"building all the layers of infrastructure to power a new cambrian explosion of creativity in shopping.\"\"I'm really really excited about Agentic Commerce,\" Lutke wrote. \"There is so much amazing stuff being built. Everything I test just feels delightful and right.\"watch nowAmazon has so far been playing defense. The company recently updated the code underpinning its website to block external AI agents from crawling it, part of an effort to wall off its valuable training data from rivals. As of Tuesday, Amazon had blocked 47 bots, including those from all the major AI companies, according to its website. Amazon has even taken the matter to court. In November, Amazon sued Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf. The company alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\" Meanwhile, Amazon is investing heavily in its own AI products. The company released a shopping chatbot called Rufus last February, and has been testing an agent called Buy For Me, which can purchase products from other sites directly in Amazon's e-commerce app.Personalized shoppersMorgan Stanley expects that by 2030, nearly half of American shoppers will use AI agents and the technology could add up to $115 billion in U.S. e-commerce spending. \"We believe agentic commerce — in effect the ability to have a personal digital interactive shopper — is set to be the best next substantial GenAI-enabled unlock,\" Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report in November. They noted that a mid-single-digit percentage of consumers currently start their \"purchase journey\" through AI, but that could increase over time as roughly 40% to 50% of Americans currently use AI for product research. Traffic from AI chatbots to U.S. retail sites has surged in recent months, especially during the holiday season, but research suggests Google search still performs better in terms of conversion rate and revenue per session.AI-powered shopping remains a nascent market. OpenAI's Instant Checkout tool, launched in ChatGPT in September, is only available for some products sold by Walmart, Shopify, Target and Etsy. Users can only purchase one item at a time, and they can't connect loyalty memberships like Walmart+. Agents are also prone to glitches. Scot Wingo, founder of e-commerce software startup ReFiBuy, recently tested Perplexity's Instant Buy tool that lets users purchase items directly in its search engine. Wingo tried to purchase a cable-knit sweater from Abercrombie & Fitch, but Perplexity's agent repeatedly spit out error messages, even though both products were in stock on the retailer's website. He eventually gave up.Earlier this month, Wingo was searching for a coffee machine on ChatGPT when it suggested a Breville espresso maker. When he clicked on the product, he was surprised to see an image of a garden rake.  \"These crawlers go out, they pull in this data and you never know exactly what they're going to get,\" Wingo said. 'Leader's dilemma'As Amazon contemplates its next move with shopping agents, it's quietly allowing them to access some of its properties.   Subsidiaries like shoe seller Zappos, fashion site Shopbop and deals site Woot don't appear to have any language blocking agents in their robots.txt files, which dictate how crawlers can access specific webpages.\"A lot of times they'll use the subsidiaries to experiment,\" Wingo said. \"Zappos has its own experience and database, so it's not like they're letting all the horses out of the barn.\" The company could ultimately take a page from its rivals if it decides to let agents access its primary e-commerce platform. Shopify and Walmart have set boundaries around what external shopping agents can and can't do on their sites. watch nowAmazon may be willing to let agents access its catalog, but it likely wants to protect more valuable data from its competitors, Wingo said, such as its vast trove of customer reviews and sales rankings, both of which indicate a product's quality and can help improve an AI chatbot's answers. \"Those are probably the two most proprietary data points that if I'm Amazon, I want to protect,\" Wingo said.Amazon isn't giving up on its homegrown tools. Rufus' capabilities have improved since Amazon first launched it last year, and the company has been surfacing the chatbot across more areas of its site to drive user adoption. Amazon recently added a feature where Rufus can auto-buy items on a Prime shopper's behalf once they hit a certain price. The chatbot now also suggests products from sites across the web, not just on Amazon.Amazon also began testing a feature in recent weeks that allows Rufus to create custom shopping guides, similar to OpenAI's \"shopping research\" tool launched last month.\"Instead of the innovator's dilemma, I would say Amazon is in what I would call the leader's dilemma,\" said Jordan Berke, founder and CEO of retail consulting firm Tomorrow. \"Their market share is so significant that they have the most to lose.\"WATCH: How Amazon came to dominate the U.S. apparel marketwatch now",

Sticking it out made him more successful, he says.\"I worked at Red Lobster for years while building FUBU,\" John posted to LinkedIn on Monday. \"Not because I didn't believe in my dreams. Because it was smart.\"In 1992, the Queens, New York, native co-founded the clothing brand — an acronym for \"For Us, By Us\" — following a humble upbringing with his single mom. John launched the company with just $40, and the money he made as a waiter at the chain restaurant helped keep him afloat and invest in his business.\"That job taught me sales and inventory, paid my bills [and] bought fabric and materials for my business,\" wrote John, 56.DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsFUBU rose to popularity in the early 1990s alongside a flourishing hip-hop and rap scene. John took his apparel to music video shoots and got rappers to take photos in his gear, he's said. In 1996, he put out an ad seeking funding for his business and landed a distribution deal with Samsung, he told Business Insider in February 2018. That investment reportedly helped FUBU bring in $30 million in sales in three months.The urban streetwear brand has since brought in more than $6 billion in total revenue to date, according to John's website. John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" still serves as the company's CEO.'Build slow if you have to'While launching a business or side hustle, you may be inclined to quit your job, especially if you've already brought in a bit of money — or you're just tired of your 9-to-5. Experts typically recommend a couple considerations before taking that risk.Those considerations include a strong business plan — clearly stating what the product or service is, who'll buy it and the money you'll be making — and enough money to sustain yourself as you establish your business, according to Kevin Lao, a certified financial planner and founder of advising firm Imagine Financial Security. Lao saved up a year's worth of living expenses and three months of business expenses before launching his firm, he told CNBC in January 2022. And he was clear on his company's vision, he added.\"It's very hard to be successful if you don't have a very compelling 'why,'\" Lao said.For John, his waiter job — though it wasn't glamorous — set the foundation for his approach to entrepreneurship and taught him an important lesson, he wrote.\"People don't realize it, but sometimes the day job is your first investor,\" John wrote. \"Don't get discouraged if you don't have the means to quit your job right away.

    "body": "If enacted, President Donald Trump's proposal for a temporary 10% cap on credit card interest rates could change many policies for borrowers. Among them: how issuers decide to value credit card points.  If you've accumulated any significant amount of credit card points, you should probably spend them now — but not because of the potential for a 10% interest rate cap, says Nick Ewen, senior editorial director at The Points Guy.\"This is not a reason in and of itself to spend your points,\" Ewen says. \"Even before this was announced, you should be spending your points.\"Credit card points — rewards earned from card spend that can be redeemed for benefits like travel, cash back or merchandise — are funded mainly by fees paid by merchants on each transaction, along with interest and sometimes fees paid by cardholders, Ewen says.That means a 10% interest rate cap could reduce issuer revenue. To offset that lost income, reward programs may lower the amount of points you can earn from spending on the card, increase redemption costs or offer fewer perks, Ewen says.However, putting a timeline on when points could start to lose their value if an interest rate cap is implemented is a \"fool's errand,\" because of all the uncertainty around Trump's proposal, he says. Why you should spend your credit card points nowThere are two main reasons you should be consistently spending your points, Ewen says:Credit issuers can change their policiesPoints tend to lose value over timeHotel, airline and credit card reward programs can change their redemption policies at will, and they don't necessarily need to give you advance notice of any upcoming changes, Ewen says.\"You don't know what the future is going to hold,\" Ewen says. Stockpiling points \"can really come back to bite you if something changes significantly in the program that you are holding them in.\"Changes rarely increase the value you can redeem for your points, Ewen says. Whether it's beneficial redemption rates or options to transfer your points to airlines or hotel loyalty programs, if your credit card comes with a perk you have active plans to use, Ewen says it may be wise to take advantage now.Additionally, unlike money you put in a high-yield savings or investment account, your points don't earn interest. This means their real value erodes over time as prices rise — $100 worth of points with an airline will still be worth $100 next year, even if flight prices increase, Ewen says. \"The idea of using your points now keeps money in your pocket to be used in other situations,\" Ewen says. \"Sure, you can earn more through spending and other activities, but you're not going to see a balance increase just by leaving it there.\"How many points is too many points?The number of points you should keep on hand will vary by person, and it largely depends on how many opportunities you have to redeem them, Ewen says. It can be useful to have some points saved for emergency situations like last-minute flights, he adds.For those going on multiple domestic and international trips in a year, it may make sense to hold onto more points. Those who travel less frequently should start thinking about spending their points once they hit the mid to upper five-figure range, he says.It's very common to see people saving points for a big trip like a honeymoon, Ewen says. Keep in mind that points can often be redeemed months ahead of time, and if price drops happen, especially with flights, you may be able to rebook and receive the difference back in points, though you should check with your provider first, Ewen says.If you have points that can cover a flight right now, go ahead and spend your points on it, he says: \"That is going to be your best option.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

The crackdown on immigration enforcement by federal agents in Minnesota \"has had, and will likely continue to have, profound and even heartbreaking consequences,\" U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez said in the ruling.Menendez did not issue a decision on whether the activity itself was lawful. Rather, she said that the plaintiffs failed to meet the standard required for an emergency order to stop activity immediately, according to the ruling.The decision comes amid widespread protests and backlash against federal immigration enforcement activity in the state, especially after fatal shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis resulting in the deaths of U.S. citizens Renée Good and Alex Pretti.Attorney General Pam Bondi called the ruling \"HUGE.\" \"Neither sanctuary policies nor meritless litigation will stop the Trump Administration from enforcing federal law in Minnesota,\" she said in a post on X.",

    "body": "You need to have the right skills to do the job you're hoping to land. But your ability to communicate that you have them — and can use them to help your prospective employer become more successful — is just as important.\"The things that make us good at communication also make us very, very attractive in an interview,\" Charles Duhigg tells CNBC Make It. Duhigg has studied hundreds of people in authoring three books on productivity, habits and communication. His latest book, \"Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection,\" examines what sets the most effective communicators apart.Duhigg shared three communication tips that candidates should take into their next job interviews to connect with the person on the other side of the table (or screen) and make a stronger impression.1. Give authentic answersInterviewers know candidates are eager to impress. But if your answers to interview questions sound too polished or canned, you could be doing yourself a disservice.\"They know that you're performing; they know that you're there to try and get a job,\" Duhigg says. But the more we can \"genuinely convey who we are,\" the more the employer has \"a chance to see whether we'll actually succeed there.\"Answering questions genuinely, but tactfully, can help you stand out, he adds. \"The interviewer is going to remember that answer,\" he says. \"The best communication is the most genuine communication.\"One of the toughest questions to answer in an interview is \"Tell me about your weaknesses.\"If they ask a question like this, Duhigg says, \"and I answer it as honestly as I can, it doesn't mean that I have to expose my flaws, it doesn't mean that I have to say something out of line.\"Career coach Madeline Mann previously told CNBC Make It that an ideal answer would briefly explain a genuine weakness, but not one that's \"core to the job,\" before laying out steps you're taking to address the problem area.2. Ask questions\"Think about how many people go into an interview and the person asks them, 'Do you have any questions for me?' and the question they ask is completely predictable,\" Duhigg says.The best communicators typically \"ask a lot more questions\" than their peers, Duhigg says. They also ask what he calls deep questions, or those that center on a person's values, beliefs or experience.For job candidates, that might mean asking an interviewer how they got into that line of work, or what their favorite part of working there is.3. Mirror their body languageSome of the most important communication is silent. Body language can be very telling, and mirroring things like your interviewer's posture, gestures and expressions can make you a more attractive candidate for the job.That could be as simple as smiling back when they smile during conversation or noticing when they lean in and doing the same.\"The more we are prepared and comfortable doing that, the better off that interview is going to go,\" Duhigg says.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "American Express announces the new platinum business card.Courtesy: American ExpressAmerican Express is finding that even for a provider of credit cards to the affluent, it pays to focus on the highest of high rollers.The company recently shifted marketing dollars to its refreshed Platinum card, which carries an $895 annual fee, and away from no-fee cash back cards, CEO Stephen Squeri told analysts Friday after the company reported fourth-quarter results.Doing that helps to boost overall spending levels as high-end consumers continue to thrive, a tactic that leads to both rising fee revenue from premium cards and lower loan defaults, executives said.\"We have the ability … to be really flexible with our marketing investments, and we saw a tremendous demand for premium products, particularly the Platinum card,\" Squeri said.\"The overall portfolio is slowly getting more premium [as] the Platinum portfolio is growing at a very fast pace,\" he added.AmEx's strategy shift is the latest example of the so-called \"K-shaped\" U.S. economy playing out, in which wealthy consumers continue to spend freely while others rein in their expenses. Data from the card company shows that demand for high-end products and luxury experiences is accelerating, while purchases in more basic categories rises at a slower pace.Spending at luxury retailers surged 15% in the quarter, business and first-class airfare purchases rose 9%, and luxury hotel spending was up 12%, CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC in an interview.Meanwhile, spending at airlines and lodging more generally was up 3% and 5%, respectively, during the quarter, showing that the richest cardmembers are driving results.Card growth slowingThe commentary helped allay fears from analysts that the relaunch of the pricey Platinum card last fall hadn't gone well.AmEx said Friday that new card accounts hit 2.9 million at year-end, a decline from the third quarter and the lowest figure in the past five quarters, as the company focused on its more profitable card products. \"We are incrementally worried that the Platinum Card refresh isn't generating much traction,\" said BTIG analysts led by Vincent Caintic, citing new competition from other card issuers and consumer weariness over high fees and cumbersome perks.While the company doesn't disclose its total number of cardmembers, including for the Platinum card, Squeri told analysts Friday that \"all of the metrics that we look at speaks to the fact that this was a wildly successful product launch.\"Still, shares of AmEx were down about 3.5% in midday trading after the company's results and guidance disappointed some. Earnings per share of $3.53 were a penny below the consensus estimate, according to LSEG. That was due in part to higher-than-expected expenses, at $14.5 billion, driven by the costs of the Platinum refresh, the company said.\"If there is a rub, perhaps it is that 4Q clearly shows the cost of the Platinum refresh, but doesn't show a corresponding bump on new accounts,\" wrote Truist analyst Brian Foran in a research note.",

    "body": "Elon Musk looks on as President Donald Trump speaks at the US-Saudi Investment Forum at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesA cache of newly released documents from the Epstein files on Friday showed Elon Musk apparently corresponded with the convicted sex offender in 2012 and 2013, as they discussed meeting at Jeffrey Epstein's private island and at Musk's SpaceX facility in Southern California. The emails indicate Musk asked about attending the \"wildest party,\" hosted by Epstein at his island. Musk, who serves as CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has for years downplayed his connection to Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while in federal custody. \"Epstein tried to get me to go to his island and I REFUSED,\" Musk said in a post on his social network X in September. He also complained that Sky News had mentioned him in conjunction with Epstein before naming Britain's Prince Andrew, who had visited the island. The U.S. Virgin Islands issued a subpoena to Musk in 2023 because of suspicion that Epstein \"may have referred or attempted to refer\" Musk as a client to JPMorgan Chase.The Department of Justice on Friday released millions of additional pages of documents related to Epstein, along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said. The release comes after weeks of criticism that the DOJ wasn't complying with the requirement under federal law passed in November that all files related to Epstein be publicly released by Dec. 19.Among the documents released Friday were emails dated from 2012 to 2013, showing Musk's name but with his email address redacted.\"The world needs more romance,\" Musk wrote to Epstein in October 2012, the documents indicate. He told Epstein that he would be traveling with his partner at the time, English actress Talulah Riley, to St. Barts, and was looking to potentially connect at Epstein's Island.In a November 2013 email, Epstein offered to send Musk a private helicopter to transport him to the island and asked, \"how many people will you be for the heli to island?\" Musk responded that it would be just him and Riley and asked, \"What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?\"In a December 2013 email, Musk again wrote to Epstein saying, \"Christmas and New Year's, will be in the BVI /St Bart's area over the holidays. Is there a good time to visit?\"  \"I will send heli for you,\" Epstein responded, with Musk writing back, \"Thanks.\"In a follow-up email on Dec. 25, Musk said, \"Actually, I could fly back early on the 3rd. We will be in St Bart's.\" He asked if he and Riley should head to the island the day before. CNBC hasn't confirmed whether Musk ever visited the Island, though Musk has denied ever traveling there. Musk didn't respond to a request for comment. The emails released on Friday also show that in October 2012, Musk forwarded questions from Epstein to his cousin, Peter Rive, a SolarCity founder. Musk had invested personally in SolarCity and sat on the company's board.In the emails, Epstein asked if the solar installer could electrify his New Mexico ranch, or his private Island. Musk asked Rive, in an Oct. 4, 2012 email, \"Are we in New Mexico?\" Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 in a controversial deal, folding it into what would become the company's energy division. In June of last year, Musk wrote in a post on X, that he thought President Donald Trump and his administration were withholding Epstein-related files from the public view in order to protect the president's reputation.\"Time to drop the really big bomb: @realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files,\" Musk, who was in the midst of a public spat with the president, wrote at the time. \"That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\"Days later he apologized for posts about Trump that he said \"went too far.\"WATCH: House votes to release more Epstein investigation files",

The new year has seen a number of nations and power blocs forging ahead with relationship resets, closer commercial ties and trade partnerships, sidelining a more hostile and volatile U.S. They include China's  \"preliminary agreement\" with Canada and rapprochement with the U.K., as well as the European Union's agreements with India and South American countries.Those deals and negotiations come after a year of U.S. President Donald Trump's \"America First\" trade and foreign policy in his second term in office, which has seen the White House hit friends and foes alike with punitive trade tariffs, and even territorial threats, as it asserts its economic and geopolitical dominance. But that strategy could be backfiring, particularly as the U.S.' friends and partners look to diversify their trade policies, in no small part to protect themselves from Trump's unpredictability.\"Given what's happening with the U.S. and its foreign policy, which was articulated in the recently released National Security Strategy ... the 'middle powers' need to find their own agency and figure out different approaches,\" Damian Ma, director of Carnegie China, an East Asia-based research center, told CNBC on Thursday.watch now\"Countries are going to align based on particular, specific à la carte interests, rather than a comprehensive values-based alignment,\" he said, noting that while this was not a return to a divided Cold War mentality of opposing power blocs, it was more a \"recalibration\" of national interests.\"Where that recalibration and that new equilibrium ends is anyone's guess, but you're seeing countries starting to make moves finally. The U.K. and Canada are not going to be the only ones,\" he said, predicting a \"flood of countries recalibrating their approach\" to superpowers like China and the U.S. Diplomacy, sans TrumpThat recalibration has certainly gathered pace of late with a flurry of diplomacy and trade deals being pursued since the new year, none of which have involved the U.S. or President Trump.China has been particularly busy, with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo and Starmer all visiting Beijing this month.Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney shakes hands with President of China Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China on Friday, Jan. 16, 2026. Sean Kilpatrick | Via ReutersChina and Canada agreed to reduce trade barriers in early January, prompting a furious response from Trump, while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was in Beijing to reset ties with President Xi Jinping, with both sides agreeing to lower barriers to trade and travel.The EU has also been busy, making progress in its trade deal with Mercosur, as well as signing a long-awaited free trade agreement with India last week. Those meetings have taken place after Trump's tirade against allies during his speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which he insulted and criticized various leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Carney.watch nowJimena Blanco, chief analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft, told CNBC that there had been a measurable deterioration in how the U.S. communicated with its allies. \"Our data measuring verbal tensions between countries shows worsening U.S. relations with some key allies over the last year,\" she told CNBC on Thursday. \"The sharpest spikes were recorded with Canada, Denmark, Belgium, Japan, Ireland, New Zealand and France, reflecting the impact of public, tense exchanges between U.S. officials and their counterparts in allied nations.\"Read moreBut Blanco noted that U.S. allies have tended to respond to Washington's policy shifts by diversifying their economic exposure, rather than reversing their integration in the global trade system.\"The EU, Canada, Japan, Australia and the U.K. can't afford to disengage with the U.S. but are instead widening trade with large emerging markets as well as with each other,\" Blanco added, with emerging markets the \"major winners\" of this diversification. Rocky patchLikening this period of difficult relations with the U.S. as a rocky patch rather than grounds for divorce, analysts say the U.S.' allies have little choice but to try to keep the U.S. on side, while exploring other avenues of trade and cooperation.\"Europe is too dependent on the U.S. not only for its security, but also technologically and economically, to prefer the divorced life today,\" Ivan Krastev, chair of the Centre for Liberal Strategies in Sofia, Bulgaria, said in a Goldman Sachs report earlier this week.\"For Europe, while there is much talk about finding new allies, aligning with others won't be a quick or easy process,\" he noted, adding: \"Instead, Europe will be focused on showing the U.S. that Europe matters.\"watch nowJoseph Parkes, senior analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, agreed that the U.S. was too big to be isolated, ultimately: \"It is simply too important from a tech, trade, currency and security perspective,\" he told CNBC on Thursday.Nonetheless, key allies will aim to re-balance their global relationships in strategic areas in the long-term, he said.\"The nature of globalization will change. Trade fragmentation will create new and different groupings of countries seeking to increase economic resilience,\" he told CNBC on Thursday, with \"geopolitical agility\" increasingly important for businesses to navigate a more uncertain landscape. \"The recent volatility has accelerated a shift away from 'just-in-time' towards 'just-in-case' to strengthen supply chains,\" he noted, with companies turning to 'nearshoring' and 'friendshoring' in order to source materials from trusted allies. In the meantime, Parkes said, governments would look to \"expand trade agreements to build strategic flexibility and reduce market and supply-chain dependence on any given country.\"",

Ethereum slid about 9% to $2,445.31, while Solana lost 9.9% at $105.50.The slide in crypto comes in the wake of Trump's selection of Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed, which bolstered the U.S. dollar as it eased concerns about the central bank's independence. Dollar strength may reduce bitcoin's appeal among investors as an alternative currency.If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Warsh would replace sitting Chairman Jerome Powell. Powell's current term as chair ends in May. Trump has criticized Powell — particularly about his unwillingness to reduce interest rates — almost since the Fed chair took the job in 2018.The slide in crypto is the latest blow to retail investors, who were buffeted by a sharp selloff in spot silver on Friday, the worst day for the market since March 1980. Spot silver was down 28% at $83.45 an ounce, trading near its lows of the day. Silver futures plummeted 31.4% to settle at $78.53.",

    "body": "There's no way to walk through New York City's Flatiron district without seeing The Flatiron Building. It first opened in 1902 and has been part of the city's fabric ever since. And for the first time in 124 years, if you have the money, you can call it home.Formerly a commercial building, the Flatiron Building is being converted into 38 luxury condominiums, with a full completion scheduled for later this year. Apartments in the building range from three-bedroom units selling for around $10.95 million to the penthouse on the 21st floor going for over $50 million. Corcoran Sunshine is leading sales and marketing for all of the apartments, which were designed by Studio Sofield. \"Very few buildings in the world elicit an emotional response like The Flatiron Building and reimagining this iconic landmark as residential homes has been an exciting and deeply meaningful experience; one we approach with great care and respect,\" William Sofield, designer and founder of Studio Sofield, tells CNBC Make It via email. There are currently two four-bedroom, four-bathroom units available, priced from $16 million to $18.9 million. Others are set to become available later this year, with three-quarters of the building expected to be done by July. The 11th floor apartment spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe first is an 11th-floor unit that went on the market on Jan. 24 for $16 million. It spans 3,828 square feet and occupies two corners of the building, offering south, east and west exposures. The standout feature is the great room, measuring 58 feet by 21 feet, with 10-foot ceilings. \"You're in a historic building looking at historic facades. It gets tremendous light because it's southwest facing,\" James Lansill, senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, tells CNBC Make It. The second apartment is on the sixth floor and listed for $18.9 million. It spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring more than 63 feet by 26 feet. It also has an additional half bathroom. The unit offers views of Madison Square Park, up to Fifth Avenue and Broadway.One of the facing points of the apartment has views of Madison Square Park.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingLansill says the Flatiron Building apartments are special because each unit has subtle differences from its peers. \"Each one has a personality and that personality can be informed by the historical trim that surrounds the outside of the window,\" he says. \"What was modern about The Flatiron Building in 1902 is still what's modern about it today. The reimagined interiors reflect a love of craftsmanship, texture, and history. We carefully considered what kind of design would best honor the site's integrity and its place within the city,\" Sofield says. The sixth floor apartment spans 4,654 square feet with a great room measuring over 63 feet by 26 feet.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingThe Flatiron Building conversion began in 2023 and is a redevelopment led by the Brodsky Organization and the Sorgente Group.\"It's been a thrilling process because the building has this historical and architectural interest, but it also has this iconic shape,\" Lansill says. Landsill adds that because the building was designed for commercial use, it took the team about eight months to develop a concept that made sense. They eventually landed on two units per floor — a north and south apartment — plus two full-floor units on floors 20 and 21. Some of the amenities include a 60-foot lap pool, fitness center, billiards rooms and a piano lounge.Courtesy of The Flatiron BuildingPart of the conversation meant adding 21st-century amenities, including a wellness center, fitness center, sports simulator, lounge, 60-foot lap pool, billiards rooms and a piano lounge. The building also offers residents private storage and wine cellars for an extra fee. At the time of reporting, four apartments in the building have already sold, according to Lansill.

    "body": "Miami, Florida, Aventura Mall, GameStop store entrance front view, video game retailer shop. Jeff Greenberg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesGameStop wants to acquire a publicly traded consumer company that's far larger than the video game retailer in a deal that could be \"transformational\" for the company, CEO Ryan Cohen told CNBC in an interview Friday.\"It's gonna be really big. Really big. Very, very, very big,\" Cohen said of the size of the acquisition. \"It's transformational. Not just for GameStop, but ultimately, within the capital markets … this is something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets.\"Cohen declined to name the company's targets – saying only he's seeking a publicly traded consumer company that's undervalued, \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects\" and has a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He claimed if the investment pans out, it has the \"potential to make [GameStop] worth several hundreds of billions of dollars.\" \"If it works, it's genius. If it doesn't work, then, you know, it will be totally, totally foolish,\" Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of Chewy, acknowledged. \"But I believe we have the components to make it work, and I'm very confident in the ability to make the asset much, much, much more efficient … we've got the governance structure, we've got the capital, we have the operational expertise.\"While Cohen has transformed GameStop from a dying legacy retailer into a money making business, it's unclear how an acquisition in the consumer space could increase its worth to over $100 billion – a herculean task for a business with a $10.5 billion market cap.One investment banker in the consumer and retail space was skeptical Cohen could pull it off, saying there are very few businesses in the sector that could increase GameStop's value so dramatically.\"I've never seen it,\" the person said. \"Unless you're talking about radically transforming a business model or something, it just doesn't happen in retail.\"Another agreed. \"It's easy to say something,\" the person said. \"It's a lot harder to do it.\"GameStop's ambitions to balloon in size first came to light in early January. The company unveiled a new, all-or-nothing equity incentive for Cohen that will only pay out if it reaches a market cap of $100 billion and sees $10 billion in cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. If GameStop's acquisition plans succeed and its market value hits $100 billion or more, Cohen gets his payday — but he said he hopes \"all shareholders do\" as well.Since taking over as GameStop's CEO in September 2023, Cohen has dramatically cut costs, improved the retailer's profitability and grown its collectibles business, even as overall sales have sagged.Between GameStop's fiscal 2023 third quarter, when Cohen took over, and its fiscal 2025 third quarter, its most recent quarter, GameStop's gross margin has grown by 7 percentage points and net income has climbed to $77.1 million, up from a loss of $3.1 million. In fiscal 2024 and 2025, the retailer posted consecutive annual net incomes following five straight years of losses.The company's success has attracted interest from Michael Burry — the investor who became famous after betting against the U.S. housing market ahead of the financial crisis — who recently disclosed that he's been buying shares. \"Ryan is making lemonade out of lemons,\" Burry said in a Monday Substack post. \"He has a crappy business, and he is milking it best he can while taking advantage of the meme stock phenomenon to raise cash and wait for an opportunity to make a big buy of a real growing cash cow business.\"Over the last two years, GameStop has also amassed a more than $9 billion cash pile between cash on hand and marketable securities – money the company had been using to invest in bitcoin. When asked if GameStop will liquidate its bitcoin holdings to help fund its acquisition plans, Cohen said he was \"not prepared to say,\" but called his new strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin.\"\"It's similar to Berkshire Hathaway, except what Berkshire did in decades we're attempting to do in a much shorter time in terms of creating that much value,\" said Cohen. \"We can go in there and apply the Chewy and [GameStop] mindset of like brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly and so we could capture a lot more value by focusing on this under optimized asset, and then eventually we could move on to the next one, but, you know, we'll see what happens.\"",

    "body": "China's President Xi Jinping (R) and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer shake hands before their meeting at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on January 29, 2026.Carl Court | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Countries that shunned China during its trade dispute with the U.S. are now sending their leaders to Beijing for meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping — and are keen to strike business deals.At least five national leaders, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, have visited Xi in January alone. Uruguay's President Yamandú Orsi is due to make the trip next week — the first by a South American leader since U.S. President Donald Trump captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and his wife in early January. The Canadian and British leaders' trips are the first in at least eight years, while a visit by Ireland's prime minister on Jan. 5 was the first in 14 years. China had closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic and only reopened them in earnest in early 2023.\"These visits reflect managed, selective resets under rising U.S. policy uncertainty, rather than a strategic pivot to China,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.\"Keeping communication channels open with Beijing is increasingly seen as preferable to disengagement,\" she said, \"particularly as the gains from selective resets with China become more visible, and U.S. policy has grown less predictable.\"Since taking office 12 months ago, Trump has wielded tariffs not just on China but a slew of U.S. trading partners. In recent months, he's increased efforts to ramp up U.S. influence over Venezuela, Iran and Greenland. It's an opportunity for Beijing, which has sought to portray itself as not only a partner for developing countries but also as a stabilizing force for the world. watch now\"Maintaining distance from the United States indicates that these countries value ties with China's large economy,\" Cui Shoujun, an international studies professor at Renmin University of China, said in a phone interview Thursday. That's according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks.European and other countries may still need to align with the U.S. on security issues, but they are now increasing economic engagement, Cui said. Facilitating business dealsLarge business delegations often accompany national leaders when making state visits. Nearly 60 British companies and cultural organizations sent representatives to accompany the U.K. prime minister on his China trip. British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca used the state visit to announce plans to invest $15 billion in China through 2030.Similarly, during Carney's visit, Canada agreed to cut tariffs on a limited number of China-made electric cars to 6.1% from 100%, in exchange for lower Chinese tariffs on Canadian canola seeds. Global businesses have also long been keen to sell to China's large consumer market, the second-largest in the world. For their part, Chinese leaders have urged visiting nations to create fair environments for Chinese businesses operating or investing locally. Many Chinese companies, such as electric car makers, have accelerated global expansion plans as domestic growth has slowed.Beijing has increasingly made clear its efforts to build technological self-sufficiency and hold its own on the global stage.Earlier this month, the head of the ruling Chinese Communist Party's international affairs department wrote in the official party newspaper that China's modernization efforts break a \"Western-centric\" model and gives developing countries a new choice.U.S.-China still hold cloutBut the overarching question remains tensions between the world's two largest economies. Some of the visiting nations still count the U.S., not China, as their largest trading partner.The five countries with leaders who visited in January — Ireland, South Korea, Canada and Finland — have a combined gross domestic product of $8.71 trillion, or less than half of China's $18.74 trillion GDP, as of 2024 World Bank figures. The U.S. remained far larger with a GDP of $28.75 trillion.China was the first major economy to retaliate against Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in April 2025. The two countries reached a fragile one-year trade truce in late October, with Trump expected to visit China in April. The American Chamber of Commerce in China hosted an appreciation dinner on Thursday evening in Beijing while Starmer was visiting, which included representatives from the Chinese side. In an opening address, Chair James Zimmerman urged both Trump and Xi to create a vision for greater global stability. The potential for the two leaders to meet as many as four times this year marks \"a moment for sustained leadership and meaningful progress that should not be missed,\" Zimmerman said. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tOne of the opportunities for Trump and Xi to meet — as well as draw other world leaders to China — is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which China is hosting this year. The APEC forum is set to hold a senior officials' meeting in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou early next month, ahead of the main economic leaders' meeting in November. But visiting leaders still must straddle a fine balance when dealing with China.This week, Trump threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa \"makes a deal\" with China and said it was \"very dangerous\" for Britain to do business with China. In a nod toward European industry interests, French President Emmanuel Macron threatened China with tariffs a day after he returned from his state visit in December. \"These trips are a hedging strategy,\" said Jack Lee, a foreign affairs analyst at consultancy China Macro Group. \"They keep the China channel open as a way to preserve strategic optionality,\" he said. But he cautioned that trust, especially between the EU and Beijing, remains limited. ",

    "body": "watch nowEli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks on Friday said upcoming Medicare coverage of obesity drugs could be a major catalyst for the rollout of the company's closely watched experimental weight loss pill, orforglipron.In an exclusive interview with CNBC, Ricks said Lilly expects to have Medicare coverage for the treatment \"immediately following that launch, and that will change the game a bit too.\" He said that's because many patients are currently paying in cash for competitor Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill for obesity. That launched earlier this month and is off to a strong start, even with spotty insurance coverage. Ricks said he noticed that nearly all of the early adopters of Novo's Wegovy pill are new to GLP-1 treatments rather than users of existing injections, so \"it's expansive, it's reaching more patients and that's great.\" He added that Lilly is confident in its pill's ability to compete and is preparing for a \"full launch\" in the second quarter. The rollout is set to coincide with Medicare starting to cover obesity medicines for the first time later this year under drug pricing deals Lilly and Novo struck with President Donald Trump in November. Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersThat government coverage will bring the price point of pills even lower in the second half of the year, Ricks said. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of injectable and oral GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment.\"That opens up things pretty wide, and we'll see where we can go from there,\" Ricks said. Medicare coverage of obesity treatments is a long-awaited move that some health experts say could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Ricks estimates that 20 million to 30 million Medicare beneficiaries who are suffering from obesity and related health conditions could be eligible for GLP-1 treatments, so coverage is a \"big multiplier on the eligible pool.\"Ricks acknowledged that under the drug pricing deal, there will be \"a step down in pricing\" early this year. The agreements involve drugmakers voluntarily offering their medications for less, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest prices abroad, and guaranteeing that so-called most-favored nation pricing for new medicines.But Ricks said volume growth of Lilly's drugs \"will ramp on the back half of the year.' \"We think that's a positive balance for us, but time will tell,\" he said, adding that it will be based on uptake of the treatments among Medicare patients and the company's share of that adoption. Lilly will share more details on the financial impact of the deal when it posts its fourth-quarter earnings and 2026 guidance next week, he said. The price agreements include commitments to launch drugs at discounted cash-pay prices on Trump's direct-to-consumer platform, TrumpRx. That site, which was expected to launch in January, is not yet live.Ricks said Lilly was the first drugmaker to sell obesity treatments directly to patients through the company's platform, LillyDirect, and TrumpRx is \"taking that and expanding it across the industry\" to other medicines.\"We're all for that,\" he said.",

    "body": "Eli Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference in Houston, Sept. 23, 2025.Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly on Friday said it will spend more than $3.5 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley that will help make its next-generation obesity drugs.That includes a closely watched experimental drug called retatrutide, which has shown the highest weight loss seen to date for any treatment in a late-stage trial. It is the fourth facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the pharmaceutical giant. Lilly announced in February 2025 that it would spend at least $27 billion to build new domestic manufacturing facilities, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020. On Thursday, President Donald Trump said Lilly CEO Dave Ricks has told him the drugmaker aims to build six plants in the U.S. But Lilly has not confirmed those plans. The company on Friday said it expects construction of the Pennsylvania plant to start this year and for the site to be operational in 2031. That added production capacity for upcoming weight loss treatments is crucial. Retatrutide is viewed as a key pillar of Lilly's long-term obesity strategy after its popular injection Zepbound and upcoming obesity pill. Some health experts say retatrutide, which works by targeting three gut hormones rather than one or two, can reach patients with severe obesity who would benefit from even more weight loss than what existing injections can offer. Lilly plans to release data from seven other Phase 3 trials on the drug this year. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, have invested heavily in boosting production capacity after previously facing supply shortages for their existing weekly injections in the U.S. Preparing enough supply of upcoming drugs is also central to Lilly's efforts to maintain its dominance in the booming GLP-1 market. The company secured the majority share in the space last year for the first time, overtaking Novo. But the Danish drugmaker is hoping to close the gap with the launch of the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity this month, which has already racked up thousands of U.S. prescriptions. Lilly has its own pill, orforglipron, that could win approval and launch later this year. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following voluntary drug pricing deals with Trump in recent months that exempt companies — including both Lilly and Novo — from the levies for three years. Eli Lilly said the Pennsylvania site will bring 850 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 2,000 construction jobs. ",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBig Food is slimming down. As both consumers and regulators push back against ultra-processed foods, the companies that make them have been splitting up or divesting iconic brands. Last year, Unilever spun off its ice cream business into The Magnum Ice Cream Company. Kraft Heinz is preparing to break up later this year, undoing much of the merger forged more than a decade ago by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and private equity firm 3G Capital. And Keurig Dr Pepper is planning a similar split after it finishes its acquisition of JDE Peet's. In 2024, nearly half of mergers and acquisitions activity in the consumer products industry came from divestitures, according to consulting firm Bain. Over the next three years, 42% of M&A executives in the consumer products industry are preparing an asset for sale, a Bain survey found.Of course, the trend isn't confined to just the consumer packaged goods industry. Industrial companies like GE and Honeywell have pursued their own breakups in recent years. It's happening too in legacy media; Comcast spun off many of its cable assets into CNBC owner Versant, while Warner Bros. Discovery is planning to spin off its cable networks later this year as Netflix acquires its streaming and studios division.\"In many of the spaces that we're seeing this type of activity, there are many very fierce competitive pressures that are making it harder to operate,\" said Emilie Feldman, a professor at The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.The squeeze on packaged food and beverage companies comes from lower demand, which has led to shrinking volume for many of their products. To turn around their businesses and win back investors, they are counting on dumping underperforming brands. February will bring both quarterly earnings reports and presentations at the annual CAGNY Conference, offering investors more opportunities to hear about food executives' plans for their portfolios. Companies to watch include Kraft Heinz, which could share more details on its upcoming split, and Nestle, which is considering selling off multiple brands in its portfolio.Cases of Dr. Pepper are displayed at a Costco Wholesale store on April 27, 2025 in San Diego, California.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesShrinking salesFor more than a decade, consumers have been buying fewer groceries from the inner aisles of the grocery store, instead focusing on the outer aisles with fresh produce and protein. The pandemic served as the exception, as many consumers returned to the brands that they knew. However, price hikes and \"shrinkflation\" as life eased back to normal largely erased that shift in behavior.More recently, regulators, emboldened by the \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda espoused by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have put both more pressure and a bigger spotlight on processed foods. And the rise of GLP-1 drugs to combat diabetes and obesity have meant some of food companies' key consumers have lost their appetite for the sweet and salty snacks that they used to eat.As a percentage of overall spending, the consumer packaged goods industry has held onto its market share. But the biggest companies are losing customers to upstart brands or private-label products, according to Bain partner Peter Horsley.On average, about 35% of large consumer products companies' portfolios are in categories with more than 7% growth, Horsley said. For comparison, over half of private-label brands are in high-growth categories, like yogurt and functional beverages, and for insurgent brands, it's even higher. For Big Food, the result has been slowing — or even declining — sales, followed by stock declines. In some cases, activist investors push for companies to focus more on their core offerings and to offload so-called distractions. \"You're seeing a lot of pressure from a valuation standpoint, especially for these publicly traded companies,\" said Raj Konanahalli, partner and managing director of AlixPartners. \"One way to reset expectations is to really kind of focus more on the core offerings and dispose or divest the slower, capital-intensive or non-core businesses.\"While getting bigger helped food companies develop scale, enter new markets and grow their sales, it also made their businesses much more complex, according to Konanahalli. Become too big, and it becomes too difficult to make decisions quickly or to decide how and where to invest back into the business.To be sure, some of these divestitures and breakups follow deals that seem to have been ill-advised from the start. Look no further than the merger of Keurig Green Mountain and Dr Pepper Snapple Group in 2018, to form Keurig Dr Pepper. \"Frankly the surprise to us was the decision back in 2018 when Keurig Green Mountain acquired the Dr Pepper Snapple Group in an $18.7 billion deal to create Keurig Dr Pepper in the first place,\" Barclays analysts Patrick Folan and Lauren Lieberman wrote in a note to clients in August when the breakup was announced. \"At the time, it was seen as both odd and a very left field deal with the questionable logic of combining coffee and [carbonated soft drinks].\"(When the merger was announced in 2018, Lieberman said on a conference call with executives from both companies that she was still \"scratching my head\" about the logic of the deal for both players).Shares of Keurig Dr Pepper have risen 37% since the merger. The S&P 500 has climbed 150% over the same period.To sell or not to sellLike many industries, the packaged food industry has gone through cycles of expansion and contraction, according to Feldman. For example, Kraft spun off a snacking business that includes Oreos into Mondelez in 2012, just three years before it merged with Heinz.However, in recent years, expanding through acquisitions has required more sophisticated thinking and execution.\"If you go back to those glory years of pre-2015, the rules of the game in consumer products felt fairly simple, at least if you're a global company,\" Bain's Horsley said. \"You bought another company that was relatively similar to you. You integrated it together, you pulled out the cost synergies ... and then that gave you good top-line and bottom-line growth. But the rules of the game have changed.\"Around 2015, upstarts like Chobani or BodyArmor began stealing market share from legacy brands. As a result, food giants needed to become more thoughtful about what they were acquiring and how they were managing their portfolios, according to Horsley. For a cautionary tale, look no further than Kraft Heinz, formed by a mega-merger in 2015. Investors initially cheered the deal, but their enthusiasm waned as the combined company's U.S. sales began lagging. Then came write-downs of many of its iconic brands, like Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House and Velveeta, in addition to a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission related to its accounting policies and internal controls.With the benefit of hindsight, analysts and investors have blamed much of Kraft Heinz's downward spiral on the brutal cost-cutting strategy imposed after the merger. The company's leadership was too focused on slashing costs and not enough on investing back into its brands, particularly at a time when consumer tastes were changing.Since Kraft Heinz began trading as one company, shares have tumbled 73%. But not everyone is sold that getting rid of underperforming brands will benefit shareholders.\"If you don't fix the underlying capability, it doesn't matter how many brands you sell or don't sell,\" RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi said. \"They're not addressing the root problem. It's just something to make investors happy because it seems like they're making a change.\"One breakup that Modi agrees with is that of Kellogg, which split into the snacks-focused Kellanova and cereal-centric WK Kellogg in 2023. Last year, chocolatier Ferrero snapped up WK Kellogg for $3.1 billion, while Mars closed its $36 billion acquisition of Kellanova.From Modi's perspective, the breakup created more value for shareholders than the combined business did. Kellogg's high-growth snack business was much more viable as an acquisition target without the sluggish cereal division attached. Plus, the two strategic buyers are both privately held companies that don't have to worry about sharing quarterly earnings with the public.Some investors are hoping for the same outcome with Kraft Heinz.\"The view that many have had is the best way to create value is split the companies and hope that you can create a Kellanova 2.0 where both entities get acquired at some point down the line, and that's where value creation happens,\" said Peter Galbo, analyst at Bank of America Securities.Kraft Heinz hired Steve Cahillane, the former CEO of Kellogg and then Kellanova, as its chief executive. Once the company separates, Cahillane will serve as chief executive of Global Taste Elevation, the placeholder name for the spinoff with high-growth brands like Heinz and Philadelphia.Steve Cahillane, President and CEO, Kellogg Company accepts Salute To Greatness Corporate Award during 2020 Salute to Greatness Awards Gala at Hyatt Regency Atlanta on January 18, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.Paras Griffin | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesBut acquiring either company resulting from the Kraft Heinz split would be a pretty big acquisition, making it less likely that either is snapped up, according to Galbo. And the resulting uncertainty about the value creation from the breakup is maybe why Berkshire Hathaway, the company's largest shareholder, is preparing to exit its 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz.Food divestitures pick upA month into the new year, it's unlikely that the divestiture trend will slow down. On Tuesday, General Mills announced that it is selling its Muir Glen brand of organic tomatoes to focus on its core brands. And last week, Bloomberg reported that Nestle is preparing the sale of its water unit; the Swiss giant is also reportedly considering offloading upscale coffee brand Blue Bottle and its underperforming vitamin brands.And if Big Food is making any acquisitions, the deals are more likely to involve \"insurgent brands,\" according to Bain. Over the last five years, acquisitions with a value of less than $2 billion represented 38% of total consumer products deals, up from 16% in the period from 2014 to 2019, the firm said. For example, last year, PepsiCo bought prebiotic soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion and Hershey snapped up LesserEvil popcorn for $750 million. Bigger deals are harder to come by because of the current regulatory environment, Konanahalli said. Buyers might not be strategic players, but instead private equity firms with plenty of cash on hand. For example, in January, L Catterton bought a majority stake in cottage cheese upstart Good Culture.But a flashy divestiture or acquisition might not be the solution to a food conglomerate's woes — or a surefire way to lift the stock price. Sometimes, good old-fashioned elbow grease can work even better.\"Just because it seems like the wind is blowing your way, it doesn't mean that you can't put in some hard work and turn things around,\" AlixPartners' Konanahalli said.",

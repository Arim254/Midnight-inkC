Kennedy Jr. attend a Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) Commission event, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., May 22, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Tuesday said it was freezing $10 billion in federal grant funds for certain child care and family assistance programs in five states because of \"serious concerns about widespread fraud\" in state-administered programs.All five states targeted by the freeze — California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York — are led by Democrats.The action applies to three programs overseen by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department's Administration for Children and Families: Child Care and Development Fund, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Social Services Block Grant.The move comes a day after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz dropped his bid for a third term amid political fallout from widespread fraud in social service programs in the state, including child-care services, which a federal prosecutor has estimated cost more than $9 billion.\"Families who rely on child care and family assistance programs deserve confidence that these resources are used lawfully and for their intended purpose,\" said Deputy HHS Secretary Jim O'Neill in a statement.\"This action reflects our commitment to program integrity, fiscal responsibility, and compliance with federal requirements,\" O'Neill said.More than $7.3 billion in TANF funds have been frozen, and nearly $2.4 billion in CCDF funds have been frozen. Nearly $840 million in Social Services Block Grant funding was frozen.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker blasted President Donald Trump for the freeze.\"Rather than making it more affordable for families, Trump is stripping away child care from those just trying to go to work,\" Pritzker wrote in a post on X. \"Thousands depend on these programs, and now their livelihoods are at risk,\" Pritzker wrote. \"It's wrong and cruel — we'll take every step possible to defend Illinoisians.\"New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, in a tweet, wrote, \"Trump is threatening to freeze $10 billion in child care funding in blue states to make life harder and more expensive for kids and families. It's vindictive. It's cruel. And we'll fight it with every fiber of our being.\"HHS on Monday announced that it was rescinding a series of child-care rules implemented under the Biden administration \"that required states to pay providers before verifying any attendance and before care was delivered.\"\"The change will roll back provisions in the 2024 Child Care and Development Fund rule that weakened oversight and increased the risk of waste, fraud and abuse in federally-funded state child care — including programs now under investigation in Minnesota,\" HHS said in a statement on Monday.The department last week froze all federal child care funding for Minnesota, which totals about $185 million annually.",

    "body": "An oil refinery, operated by Bharat Petroleum Corp., in Mumbai, India.Dhiraj Singh | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesState-owned refiners in India are still buying Russian oil, even as New Delhi seeks relief from U.S. tariffs imposed for those purchases, according to energy analysts.The U.S. imposed a \"secondary\" 25% tariff on Indian goods in August, citing New Delhi's continued imports of Russian crude. Washington also sanctioned Russian oil companies Lukoil and Rosneft in late November. On Sunday, U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham claimed that India's U.S. ambassador, Vinay Mohan Kwatra, had asked him to urge President Donald Trump to lift these tariffs, arguing that New Delhi has reduced its purchase of Russian oil.While India's overall demand for Russian crude fell in December, analysts said the decline was largely driven by reduced buying from Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries, which had been a major importer before the U.S. sanctions on Lukoil and Rosneft took effect in late November.State-owned refiners, known as public sector undertakings (PSUs), have offset part of that drop for Russian oil, analysts added. State-owned Indian firms like the IOC (Indian Oil Corporation) and BPCL (Bharat Petroleum Corporation) \"have continued to buy Russian crude for future delivery, through non-sanctioned suppliers,\" said Muyu Xu, senior crude oil analyst at tanker tracker firm Kpler.BPCL declined to comment, while IOC and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation, as well as the Indian Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC.India has faced sustained pressure from the U.S. to cut back on Russian oil imports, an economic lifeline that enables Moscow to withstand Western economic sanctions over its war against Ukraine.\"Despite declining aggregate imports, PSU refinery intake of Russian crude has remained resilient, highlighting a redistribution rather than a collapse in demand,\" said Rystad Energy's Pankaj Srivastava.Rystad estimates India's Russian crude imports fell by about 300,000 barrels a day since November to 1.7 million barrels on a sequential basis.However, a \"modest recovery\" to 1.8 million barrels a day is expected in January, it said.\"Public sector refiners continue to process Russian crude with a slight upward trend, driven by domestic fuel demand and pricing economics,\" said Srivastava, the senior vice president of commodity markets at Rystad Energy.Kpler's data also showed a decline in India's import of Russian oil.\"India's imports of Russian crude fell by 595 kbpd month-on-month in December, dropping to 1.24 mbpd—the lowest level since December 2022,\" according to Kpler.On Sunday, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said the United States could raise tariffs on India if New Delhi fails to curb purchases of Russian oil.",

    "body": "Signage for Bitcoin cryptocurrency in Hong Kong, Nov. 26, 2025.Lam Yik | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFollowing President Nicolás Maduro's deposition last weekend, all eyes are on Venezuela and its vast oil reserves. But there's another resource Maduro's regime is believed to have had in abundance — an asset that, if liquidated or seized, would have implications for global financial markets: bitcoin.Venezuela is likely sitting on sizable amounts of the cryptocurrency — a stash that could be worth billions of U.S. dollars, experts told CNBC. \"It's very fair to assume Venezuela had meaningful exposure to bitcoin,\" said Gui Gomes, founder and CEO of Latin America-based bitcoin firm OranjeBTC. \"Given that they were excluded from the global financial system, probably they had gold, bitcoin and some dollars under their mattress.\"Sanctions levied against Venezuela restricted the nation's access to financial markets. To work around this, the country likely experimented with cryptocurrencies, experts said. They noted that it's virtually impossible to ascertain the exact amount of bitcoin Venezuela may be sitting on, or where those holdings could be stored, due to the privacy features of the decentralized asset and its underlying technology. However, one thing is clear: If Maduro and his allies have tokens in their coffers, the assets might soon be on the move, they said. And whether those bitcoins are sold, confiscated or exchanged, cryptocurrency holders could feel the impact. Billions in bitcoin? Digital publication Project Brazen reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold roughly $60 billion, citing unnamed sources that were not confirmed through blockchain analysis. Such a stash would put the regime among the biggest holders of the crypto in the world, alongside bitcoin treasury firm Strategy. Data provider Bitcointreasuries.net puts Venezuela's holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth roughly $22 million. To reach this estimate they used data from a blockchain analytics firm that was cited by a media outlet.  Based on their rankings, it would the ninth largest pile of bitcoin held by a government entity.  All these estimates must be taken with a grain of salt. Many of the largest firms offering crypto custodial solutions, including digital asset bank Anchorage Digital and Fireblocks, are registered in the U.S. or allied nations, so Venezuela would have had to turn to more covert techniques to amass its shadow reserve, Haun Ventures general partner Diogo Mónica told CNBC. \"There are so many [solutions] for bitcoin off the shelf, it is actually very easy for you to meet the threshold of high security\" through those means, Mónica said. As a result, any bitcoin held by Venezuela is likely distributed across thousands of crypto wallets under the control of various generals and other members of Maduro's party, making it difficult to identify and track, according to OranjeBTC's Gomes.On-chain analysis can reveal transaction histories and balances of public addresses linked to hardware wallets, according to blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. But those methods cannot offer conclusive insights into wallet owners' identities, making it difficult for cybercrime experts to identify which wallets belong to Venezuelan officials.That said, it's still probable that Venezuela could have amassed large amounts of bitcoin in recent years to navigate the consequences of its exclusion from global financial markets, Andrew Fierman, head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis, told CNBC. He noted that the country has a history of using unorthodox methods to convert and transfer its wealth, including by flying allies of Maduro to foreign locales to exchange tangible assets for more liquid funds.\"If they're willing to send a guy on a private jet with a ton of gold on board, it would make a lot of sense that they would also seek to utilize crypto assets for both store of wealth and also for cross-border trade,\" Fierman said. He declined to estimate the value of Venezuela's holdings.  The South American nation also has a long history of experimenting with cryptocurrencies, Fierman said. He cited the issuance in 2018 of a token called petro, which later failed and was sunsetted in 2024, as an example. Given its history with digital assets, it's also possible the Venezuelan government holds other cryptocurrencies besides bitcoin, including stablecoins, according to Fierman.However, bitcoin would likely be the favored asset as it is issued by an agnostic network and has no direct ties to the U.S. dollar, unlike most stablecoins, said Jorge Jraissati, president of the nonprofit Economic Inclusion Group. He added that some of the regime's bitcoins could have been acquired through local authorities' seizures of crypto miners' token rewards. In 2017, CNBC reported on Venezuelan authorities' efforts to curb crypto mining by arresting bitcoin miners and seizing their assets. That was before the nation completely outlawed the practice in 2024, citing energy concerns. Data from Hashrate index shows that Venezuela still accounted for about 0.6% of all hash rates, a measure of power used to mine tokens on the bitcoin blockchain as of 2025. What happens next?Assuming Venezuela holds bitcoin, speculation abounds on what happens next. One possibility is that the Maduro regime's holdings will go up for sale, according to Sebastian Pedro Bea, president and chief investment officer at ReserveOne.\"Anytime you have a chaotic regime change, the assets of that country become unstable, like people can just steal stuff,\" Bea said. \"I'm not suggesting that's likely, but it is more likely today than last week that, if they have bitcoin, some of that bitcoin could end up on exchange, or could end up being sold.\"That sell-off could dent bitcoin's price in the near term. Alternatively, the U.S. could seize Venezuela's bitcoin as part of its enforcement actions, according to Bea. \"Nothing is stopping the U.S. from doing more enforcement actions that go after bad actors [in Venezuela] who could happen to have a lot of bitcoin,\" Bea said. \"And when they do that, that bitcoin can go right to Treasury.\"Some cryptocurrency holders have speculated the Trump administration could confiscate some of Maduro and his allies' bitcoin, with the aim of creating a U.S. bitcoin reserve at no cost to taxpayers.U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a strategic bitcoin reserve at no cost to taxpayers — a central tenet of his pro-crypto policy plans. However, critics and proponents alike have questioned the logistics of the proposal, including how bitcoin could be accumulated in a tax-neutral way.Chris Perkins, managing partner and president of investment firm CoinFund, said it's unclear whether the U.S. could legally use Venezuela's bitcoin to create its planned strategic reserve. However, such a scenario would ultimately be bullish for the asset, according to the executive. \"... To the extent that the Trump administration comes into possession of a significant amount of bitcoin, don't expect them to dump it into the market,\" said Perkins, who served as a U.S. marine. Whatever happens next, the U.S.' recent actions in Venezuela underscore the Trump administration's ability and willingness to wield its power to advance its policy objectives, which include promoting and advancing the digital assets industry, according to Bea. \"Crypto seems to be an unintended beneficiary, long term, of the [U.S. military intervention in Venezuela],\" Bea said.

    "body": "Gia Huynh is the founder of crystal candy company Silky Gem.Courtesy of Gia HuynhWhen Gia Huynh immigrated to the United States from Vietnam in 2016, like many other immigrants, life for her wasn't easy. For years, she worked 14-hour days at nail salons to stay afloat.At the time, she was in her 20s with just $50 in her pockets, Huynh told CNBC Make It. \"I was working at a nail salon pretty much seven days a week, from morning to night, 14 hours a day,\" she said. At one point, Huynh found herself homeless, living out of her car as a single mother with a 5-week old son. \"I was facing homelessness, and with a baby in my arm. I had nothing,\" she said.Today, she is the founder of Silky Gem, an online candy company known for their handmade crystal-like confections, also known as 'kohakutou' in Japan or 'mứt rau câu' in Vietnam. Her business brought in over $9 million in 2024, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Scars from childhood Huynh was born in Dong Nai, Vietnam, and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City. She says she was the youngest of four siblings and grew up in a poor family.\"My dad used to just go in the jungle to chop bamboo and wood and things like that to sell. He's never home, really. He's always working. And my mom just, you know, worked [however] she [could] to put food on the table,\" she said.As a kid, Huynh's parents always had to work so they would often leave her in the care of their neighbor, who she called \"uncle\" at the time. \"It was a rough childhood,\" said Huynh. \"I [became a] domestic and sexual harassment victim [at age] four ... That was my first childhood memories, basically. It was under the man I call uncle.\"Gia Huynh (left) was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the U.S. in 2016.Courtesy of Gia HuynhIn school, she was often made fun of for her skin color and she didn't finish fifth grade. \"I was always got bullied, [people] called me names, just because I had darker skin, basically,\" said Huynh. \"Because I didn't graduate fifth grade, family and friends [would] always belittle me.\" This environment created mental scars for Huynh. She says she felt very underestimated and this manifested in her being very quiet and never speaking her mind. It wasn't until recent years that she's learned her own worth, she said.Homeless as a single motherIn 2016, Huynh immigrated to the U.S. with her husband and lived in Florida. She says that the first few years in the U.S. were extremely difficult and in some ways, life was easier back in Vietnam.\"In Vietnam ... even if I make a little money, it's still plenty for us to take care of our lives there. But [when] we moved [to Florida], it was a lot of struggle, because I was the main [source of] income for the family, and we were living out of my mother in law's house,\" she said.After about a year in the U.S. together, in 2017, Huynh and her ex-husband separated, largely due to financial struggles and conflict, she said. After that, she met her ex-boyfriend and had her first son.\"I had my son in 2019 with my ex-boyfriend and that was a very abusive relationship,\" said Huynh. \"I ended up losing everything on that relationship. I lost my job, I maxed out all [my] credit cards. I took my son out of [my ex-boyfriend's] house when he was only five weeks old and lived out of my car.\" After a few weeks of living out of her car with her newborn baby, Huynh decided to move to Maryland and got a job working at her sister's nail salon. However, since it was Covid, Huynh says she was barely making enough to get by and she had to be separated from her son for ten or more hours a day.She was determined to create a better life for her family and son, so she began to experiment with online business ideas. Starting Silky GemOn top of taking care of her son and working at the nail salon during the day, Huynh would experiment with her business ideas after she got home from work. From selling handmade soaps to bikinis, she says she tried out about six other online business ideas before landing on the idea of Silky Gem.In late 2021, Huynh was scrolling on social media when she saw a few videos showing creators eating crystal candy. Silky Gem brought in over $9 million in 2024.Courtesy of Gia Huynh\"I recognized the candy because we used to make it back home with my great grandma,\" said Huynh, adding that it was something they had during special occasions like Lunar New Year. \"I asked my mom, and she said ... we had the recipe for it. So that's when I started practicing.\"She was inspired to recreate the candy she loved as a child in Vietnam, and ultimately spent $500 on ingredients to start experimenting with the recipe in her own kitchen. \"After I come back from the nail salon, I play with my son, put him to bed and pretty much [make candy] from midnight to three, four in the morning,\" she said, adding that she'd then wake up at 6 a.m. to go to work the next day. By early 2022, she started selling her candy creations on Etsy and quickly began to make money.\"The first three months was hardest ... we were making like I would say, $600 to $1,000 a month, [but] I was so happy. That's enough for my son's diaper and milk,\" she said. In March that year, she landed her first influencer post, which went viral and brought in $3,000 that day. From there, sales grew quickly, said Huynh. In the first nine months in business, Silky Gem brought in over $1.8 million, she added. Founder of Silky Gem, Gia Huynh with her son.Courtesy of Gia HuynhToday, Huynh has been able to hire both of her parents, and they all help to run the business together. \"It has just been amazing ... It really changed what I view about myself,\" she said. \"My whole life, I believed that I'm worthless, useless. I don't have the skills, I don't have the education for any of this.\"One of the biggest lessons she's learned is that: \"You are your own enemy. You are the reason that you would fail in life,\" she said.\"I was blaming all the people about my confidence, my education and everything else. I was playing the victim card for my whole entire life,\" she said. \"But that's not true. You can do it if you put your mind [to it]. I didn't go to language school. I didn't graduate fifth grade, but because I put my mind to this, I make it work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Visitors to the OC Auto Show at the Anaheim Convention Center check out the newly unveiled Ford Expedition in Anaheim on Thursday, October 3, 2024.Leonard Ortiz | Medianews Group | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Ford Motor on Tuesday said its U.S. vehicle sales last year increased 6% to achieve the company's best annual sales since 2019.The Detroit automaker reported sales of 2.2 million vehicles in 2025, including a 2.7% uptick to more than 545,200 units during the fourth quarter. In 2019, the automaker sold 2.42 million vehicles in the U.S.Ford finished the year as the third-largest automaker in the U.S. behind Toyota Motor and domestic sales leader General Motors. Ford's U.S. vehicle sales for the year were largely in line with analyst expectations, such as those from Cox Automotive, which expects industrywide sales to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units in 2025.\"We're really pleased with where we finished the year,\" Andrew Frick, president of Ford's nonfleet vehicle businesses, said during a media call. \"As the year unfolded, we saw really good performance throughout. ... We outperformed the industry for 10 straight months.\"Ford's fourth-quarter performance came as it continues to battle production troubles with its F-Series pickup trucks due to two separate fires at a New York plant of key aluminum supplier Novelis.Frick said the automaker \"seems to be on track\" to offset lost production of tens of thousands of its lucrative pickup trucks this year, including adding another shift to a plant in Michigan.F-Series sales, including the popular F-150, were up 8.3% in 2025, but off 3.1% during the fourth quarter. Like many automakers, Ford's all-electric vehicles business notably declined 14.1% last year, including a roughly 52% plummet during the fourth quarter. A nearly 22% increase in sales of Ford's hybrid vehicles, which the company expects to grow, assisted in offsetting those losses.Traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines continued to dominate Ford's sales, representing about 86% of the company's volume in 2025.",

    "body": "A Samsung Electronics Co. CXL memory module displayed on a monitor during the Semiconductor Exhibition (SEDEX) in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024.SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 16.3% higher this year. Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.\"The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.\"We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models.\"This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMicron and ASML stocks have rallied this year so far. The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.Intel shares are up 7.6%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise 15.2% this year. Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. \"ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027,\" with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit \"from the upcoming DRAM super cycle.\"Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. \"Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure,\" Barringer said.\"That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand.\"",

    "body": "A view of houses in the old town of Nuuk, Greenland, March 27, 2025.Leonhard Foeger | ReutersDonald Trump is interested in annexing Greenland, an Arctic island offering a wealth of untapped mineral resources. But as the U.S. president dialed up the rhetoric about America annexing the self-governing Danish territory, sparking a backlash from international leaders, a report detailed the challenges facing its economy.Published Tuesday, a report by Søren Bjerregaard, head of securities and balance of payments at Danmarks Nationalbank, warned that there were \"major challenges ahead\" for Greenland's economy. The Arctic island's economy — largely driven by the fishing industry — expanded by 0.8% in 2025 and is expected to grow a further 0.8% this year, down from 2% in 2022. According to the Danish central bank, the slowdown is likely to continue.\"The Greenlandic economy is slowing down, with modest growth and serious challenges for public finances,\" Bjerregaard wrote.\"This is partly because the expansion of infrastructure in the form of airports is nearing completion, and planned major projects in energy supply and other areas have not yet begun.\"He added that at the same time, vital shrimp stocks were declining, while public finances \"deteriorated surprisingly sharply in 2025.\" Part of the pressure on public finances was arising from a decrease in dividends from government-owned firms. \"Liquidity in the Greenland Treasury fell to a critically low level in the second half of the year,\" Bjerregaard said, noting that legislation set to be rolled out this year contains urgent fiscal tightening measures. \"More fiscal challenges lie ahead, with a declining and ageing population putting further pressure on the economy,\" he added.Greenland's population, which stood at 56,699 in the final quarter of 2025, is expected to shrink 20% by 2050, as the territory struggles to attract migrants to replace emigrating residents. Trump 'very serious' about acquiring GreenlandIn an interview with NBC News on Monday, Trump said he was \"very serious\" about acquiring the Arctic island. A day earlier, he told reporters that the U.S. needs Greenland to bolster its national security.He was speaking after Washington launched a military operation in Venezuela that led to the capture of the country's president, Nicolas Maduro.Trump later told The Atlantic that America \"absolutely\" needs Greenland, with the president telling the magazine that countries aside from Venezuela could be subject to U.S. intervention.Trump has long floated the idea of taking Greenland. In early 2025, he said the U.S. would assume control \"one way or the other.\"Officials in Greenland, Denmark and across the European continent have rejected the notion that the U.S. can make any claim on Greenland.Read moreOn Monday, Greenland's prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, rebuked parallels between the territory and Venezuela. \"The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland,\" Nielsen told a news conference. \"Our country is not really the right one to compare with Venezuela. We are a country that is democratic and has been democratic for many, many years.\"",

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesCalifornia Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa died Tuesday, his office announced. He was 65. \"Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord. He leaves a lasting legacy of servant leadership kindness to the North State,\" LaMalfa's chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, said in a statement. \"Congressman LaMalfa cared deeply for the people he served and worked tirelessly to hold the government to its word to fix our failing forests, build water storage, and leave people to be free to choose what is best for themselves.\"LaMalfa's death tightens the razor-thin House majority and could imperil Speaker Mike Johnson's grip on the chamber. The House stood at 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., resigned on Monday. LaMalfa's death brings the House to 218 Republicans. Democrats are favored to pick up additional seats from special elections in the coming months. Two Democrats are in a runoff in Texas at the end of the month, and the election to replace now-New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will take place later this year. LaMalfa represented California's 1st Congressional District since 2013. He chaired the Congressional Western Caucus. LaMalfa died in the hospital while undergoing emergency surgery, the Butte County Sherriff's Office said in a statement. He was brought to the hospital by ambulance after suffering a medical emergency at home. \"In accordance with standard protocols, the Coroner's Unit of the Butte County Sheriff's Office is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of death. A forensic pathologist is scheduled to conduct an autopsy as part of this investigation,\" the statement read.

He also served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His electoral prospects, however, were increasingly at risk in 2026 after California adopted new congressional maps that favor Democrats. \"Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa,\" said House Speaker Johnson, R-La. \"He was as fierce of a fighter for his state's vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known.\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also expressed condolences for LaMalfa. \"A fourth-generation rice farmer, Rep. LaMalfa treasured his community, worked powerfully to protect California's farmers and served those he represented with principled purpose, from the state legislature to the United States House of Representatives,\" Jeffries said. President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned LaMalfa in remarks before the House GOP conference.\"He was a fantastic person,\" Trump said. \"He voted with me 100% of the time.\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a post to X that he's \"devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.\"\"Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,\" Emmer said. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom now has 14 days to announce a special election to replace LaMalfa, per California election laws. The election then must take place no more than 140 days after Newsom's proclamation -- potentially pushing an election to replace LaMalfa to June.Jeffries held a moment of silence for LaMalfa before a Democratic hearing on the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. \"A great member of Congress, from the great state of California,\" Jeffries said.

    "body": "A startup in the clean-water space is making a curious bet on beer. Curious, because the beer is made from recycled shower and laundry water. San Francisco-based Epic Cleantec launched in 2015 as a wastewater recycling company using its proprietary technology to clean and reuse water in office and apartment buildings. At the time, CEO Aaron Tartakovsky said, \"We need to overhaul our flush and forget society.\" Now, he's taking it to the next level. \"A lot of it was psychology,\" he said. \"It is getting people comfortable with the concept of recycled water. And we found that if you tell people that the water is clean, maybe they trust you, maybe they don't. But you take those exact same molecules of recycled water, put them into a beautiful beer can, all of a sudden, people love it.\"For the beer, Epic's systems collect water just from showers and laundries and then run it through several treatment steps, including filters, biological treatment, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis and disinfection, according to the company. The resulting clean water is then taken to Devil's Canyon Brewing Co., where it's made into beer. The beer is available for online orders in California, Virginia, Oregon, Ohio, Kentucky, Vermont, New Hampshire, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Alaska and Washington, D.C., and in retail locations in California.It takes about 10 gallons of water to make a gallon of beer, so using recycled water has a huge impact on the water supply. Epic's IPA is also made with drought-resistant and energy-efficient hops, grain and yeast — emphasizing environmental impact from grain to glass. But, again, it's not about the beer. \"Buildings use about 15% of all the fresh water on this planet,\" Tartakovsky said. \"We need to do things differently, and that means we need to tell the story differently. We need to engage people differently.\"Jordan Langer, CEO of events company Non Plus Ultra, was an original investor in Epic when it was just about buildings. Now, he serves the beer at his events.\"I was a little bit skeptical. I'm not a believer in gimmicks,\" Langer said. \"But I was wrong. It blew up like crazy. It has given a lot of spotlight onto Epic Cleantec, which has made it really, quite, quite interesting.\"In addition to three family offices, Epic Cleantec is backed by J-Ventures, J-Impact and Echo River Capital. Total funding to date is $25 million. Epic currently has two beer offerings, Shower Hour IPA and Laundry Club Kölsch. Tartakovsky said the company is also considering making a nonalcoholic beer.— CNBC producer Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this piece.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 6, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday said that the company is seeing \"very high\" customer demand in China for its H200 AI chips, which the U.S. government recently signaled that it would approve for export. Huang added that Nvidia has started producing the chips again and is working out the final details about export licenses with the U.S. government. Nvidia's chips are critical for companies developing artificial intelligence models. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas. Investors see the Chinese market as a massive opportunity for Nvidia as the country's tech companies develop their own AI models. Huang has previously said that the market could be worth $50 billion per year, and none of those sales are currently included in Nvidia's forecasts.In December, President Donald Trump said that Nvidia could export its H200 chip to China as long as the company paid 25% of those sales to the U.S. government. The H200 is a generation or two behind the latest Nvidia models, but unlike previous chips that Nvidia was approved to export to China, this model has not been slowed down on purpose to comply with export restrictions.China must also approve the import of Nvidia's chips. Huang on Tuesday said that he is not expecting China to make an announcement that imports have been approved and that Nvidia would know the regulatory status as purchase orders come in. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Huang added that any H200 sales would be in addition to the $500 billion two-year forecast the company provided last year. \"It appears that we're going to be going back to China,\" Huang said.WATCH: Nvidia is clearly the chips leader in AI trade, says Silvant Capital's Sansoterrawatch now",

    "body": "Elon Musk attends the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 19, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersElon Musk's xAI said it raised $20 billion in a funding round, exceeding its prior target of $15 billion. CNBC reported in November that a financing would value the artificial intelligence startup at about $230 billion. After an initial report that xAI was raising $15 billion, Musk called the story \"False\" in a post on X.Investors included Nvidia and Cisco Investments as well as long-time Musk company backers Valor Equity Partners, Stepstone Group, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi's MGX and Baron Capital Group. Both Nvidia and Cisco work with xAI as vendors and strategic partners.AI startups reached sky-high valuations in 2025, raising massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for their foundational models. In October, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation, and a month later Anthropic was valued at around $350 billion, with capital coming from Microsoft and Nvidia. Musk's AI venture now owns and operates his social network X after merging with the company, formerly known as Twitter, in March. The company faces a new flurry of regulatory probes by authorities in Europe, India and Malaysia after its Grok chatbot generated sexualized images of children and non-consensual intimate images of adults, mostly women. Users shared the images widely on X.Musk is centering xAI's infrastructure buildout in Memphis, Tennessee. The data centers, which use natural gas-burning turbines as a power source, have drawn consternation from many nearby residents, as emissions have contributed to air quality problems in the area, according to local researchers.Despite its controversies, xAI landed a deal with the Department of Defense, which recently added Grok to its AI agents platform. Grok is also the main chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi.WATCH: xAI raises $20 billion watch now",

    "body": "Hampton Inn, Lakeville, MN.Google EarthHilton Hotels said Tuesday that it will sever ties with a franchise hotel in the Minneapolis area after a new video showed a desk clerk there refusing to book rooms for a person claiming to be a Department of Homeland Security agent.Hilton's statement came a day after the company that owns the location, Everpeak Hospitality, apologized for canceling a prior reservation for real DHS agents because of their work on immigration enforcement, and said that such a ban was not consistent with its policy of \"being a welcoming place for all.\"\"The independent hotel owner had assured us that they had fixed this problem and published a message confirming this,\" Hilton said in a statement Tuesday on the social media site X, which was also sent by a spokesperson to CNBC.\"A recent video clearly raises concerns that they are not meeting our standards and values,\" Hilton said. \"As such, we are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems.\"\"Hilton is — and has always been — a welcoming place for all,\" the statement said. \"We are also engaging with our all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again.\"Hilton Hotel logo is seen on one of their hotels. John Lamparski | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe statement was posted hours after a tweet by the conservative independent journalist Nick Sortor, which contained a video of him visiting the Hampton Inn by Hilton Lakeview Minneapolis on Monday night — hours after Everpeak issued its apology — and trying to book 10 rooms for what Sortor said were DHS employees.\"So, we're not accepting people from Immigration, ICE agents, DHS into our property,\" the clerk said. \"That's just our management, ownership.\"When Sortor said he thought the policy had changed \"today\" — Monday — the clerk replied, \"I just talked to the owner of the building, and he didn't say there had been any changes.\"\"Yeah, it's just policy,\" the clerk said. The clerk, who also said \"I'm new here,\" then repeated that he had not been informed of any policy changes, and he offered to speak to the owner. When the clerk returned, he said he had been unable to reach anyone in authority because of the late hour.Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement officers question a man's status on Lake Street near a Somali mall called the Karmel Mall in Minnesota, United States on December 10, 2025.

Why is Hilton Hotels siding with murderers and rapists to deliberately undermine and impede DHS law enforcement  from their mission to enforce our nation's immigration laws?\"DHS's tweet included screengrabs of emails from the hotel.\"We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration  agents to stay at our property,\" the message said. \"If you are with DHS  or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation.\"Hilton Hotels, in its response on Monday to DHS's tweet, had said, \"This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values.\"\"We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter and are contacting impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated.

We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,\" Everpeak said. \"We are committed to welcoming  all guests and operating in accordance with brand standards, applicable  laws, and our role as a professional hospitality provider.\"",

Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition.In October, NinjaOne rolled out its Patch Intelligence AI feature, which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow.\"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"watch now",

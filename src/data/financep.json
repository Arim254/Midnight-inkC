    "body": "Cans of the Sapporo Black Label branded beer sit stacked at the Sapporo Breweries Ltd. factory in Eniwa, Hokkaido, Japan.Tomohiro Ohsumi | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's Sapporo Holdings will sell its real estate business to global private equity firm KKR and Asia-based alternative investment firm PAG, the companies said in joint statement on Wednesday.Sapporo said the enterprise value of the deal, which includes debt, was 477 billion yen (about $3 billion).The company's real estate holdings include the Yebisu Garden Place in Tokyo, a popular tourist destination that consists of the Yebisu Brewery as well as fine dining and shopping options. Known for its beer brewing business, Sapporo is looking to concentrate management resources on its core operations, and plans to use the funds generated from the sale to invest in its beer business and other areas. \"Sapporo Holdings will focus on and further strengthen its alcoholic beverages business, where it has competitive advantages,\" the statement said. Proceeds from the sale will also be reinvested into initiatives to strengthen customer touchpoints and expand offerings such as healthier beverage choicesThe company's shares closed 3.7% higher following the announcement, while KKR stock was slightly lower in after-hours trading.\"We are pleased to collaborate with PAG to support the Company's next stage of growth, and look forward to sharing our global network, investment experience and deep operational expertise in development, operations, and hospitality across KKR's global platform,\" said Hiro Hirano, CEO of KKR Japan.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBack in October, Nikkei reported that the company had granted preferential negotiating rights to KKR and PAG, only to end exclusive talks the next month. The report said the two sides were unable to agree on the sale price of the real estate business, as the properties in the portfolio \"required significant and costly repairs due to aging facilities and the necessary implementation of safety measures.\"At that time, Sapporo had opened the sale to other buyers and was reportedly approaching a consortium made up of private equity funds Lone Star Funds and real estate fund manager Kenedix.",

    "body": "Britain's BP has agreed to sell a 65% shareholding in lubricants business Castrol to Stonepeak for $6 billion, months on from the oil giant seeking a buyer for the unit.The deal comes as the company looks to launch a strategic reset, including a green strategy U-turn and the divestment of $20 billion of assets by the end of 2027. The sale values Castrol at $10.1 billion.Energy companies, including India's Reliance Industries and Saudi Arabia's oil behemoth Aramco, as well as private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Lone Star Funds, had all been touted as suitors for BP's Castrol unit in May, according to Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter.\"With this, we have now completed or announced over half of our targeted $20bn divestment programme, with proceeds to significantly strengthen bp's balance sheet,\" interim CEO Carol Howle said in a statement.\"The sale marks an important milestone in the ongoing delivery of our reset strategy. We are reducing complexity, focusing the downstream on our leading integrated businesses, and accelerating delivery of our plan.\"BP has the option to sell its remaining 35% stake in Castrol after a two-year lock-up period.Strategy resetThe Castrol majority stake sale comes days on from the oil giant announcing it was appointing a new CEO — it's fourth in six years.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill will take up the role on April 1, replacing Murray Auchincloss, who lasted less than two years in the role.Stephen Isaacs, strategic advisor at Alvine Capital, which holds a position in BP, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" last week that while BP has been \"a very poor performer for a long, long time,\" the CEO change could be \"the last piece of the jigsaw\" in getting its house in order.The London-listed company has underperformed compared with its peers in recent times, having reported declining annual profits in both 2023 and 2024.BP's shares opened at 1.3% on Wednesday before paring gains slightly to last trade 0.9% higher. Its share price is up around 9% so far this year, following a 15.7% drop in 2024. Pressure on the stock eased in 2025 following a leadership shakeup, a cost-cutting program, and a string of oil discoveries.",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein are seen in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 19, 2025 as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Date and context is unclear.U.s. Justice Department | Via ReutersThe Department of Justice on Tuesday released another batch of files related to deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.The latest documents appear to contain court records, emails and some heavily or completely redacted files.In a Tuesday morning post on X, the DOJ announced the latest drop and claimed to have released \"nearly 30,000 more pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein.\" The post also refers to claims made against President Donald Trump in the latest release. \"Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election,\" the post states. \"To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false, and if they had a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already.\"Trump, who was largely unmentioned in the initial batch of files released by the DOJ on Friday, is a former friend of Epstein's and has long denied any wrongdoing related to the disgraced New York financier. Epstein died by suicide while in detention in 2019.Included in the latest batch from the DOJ is a handwritten letter Epstein, while detained in the Manhattan Correctional Center, wrote to convicted sex offender Larry Nassar that appears to reference Trump. In the letter, which appears similar to one described in a 2023 Associated Press report, Epstein says, \"Our president shares our love of young, nubile girls.\" Trump was president when the letter was written. A letter apparently sent from Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 23, 2025 as part of a new release of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Date and context is unclear.Courtesy of The U.S. Justice Department\"When a young beauty walked by he loved to 'grab snatch,' whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair,\" Epstein wrote. CNBC has not independently confirmed the authenticity of the letter or the claims made in it. The envelope is stamped three days after Epstein's jailhouse suicide. In the letter, Epstein tells Nassar, \"As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home.\"Hours after the initial document release on Tuesday, the DOJ said in a statement that the Federal Bureau of Investigation deemed the letter from Epstein to Nassar to be a fake. \"This fake letter serves as a reminder that just because a document is released by the Department of Justice does not make the allegations or claims within the document factual,\" the statement read. Another reference to Trump appears in the latest release, in a 2020 email from an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York whose name is redacted.The prosecutor wrote that Trump \"traveled on Epstein's private jet many more times than previously has been reported (or that we were aware).\" Trump is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, according to the email.An email discussing Jeffrey Epstein's private jet flight records mentioned Donald Trump in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 23, 2025 as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.U.S. Justice Department | ReutersTrump and Epstein were the only two listed passengers on a 1993 flight, according to the email, and Trump, Epstein and a then-20-year-old (whose name is redacted) were the lone passengers on a second flight.\"On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case,\" the prosecutor wrote. Ghislaine Maxwell, a British socialite, was convicted in 2021 of procuring underage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein. Last week, Maxwell filed a long-shot petition to vacate her conviction.When asked about Trump's appearance in the files, a White House spokesperson referred CNBC to the DOJ's statement.In another email thread released with redactions in the latest batch, a person from the human trafficking division of the DOJ and an unnamed recipient appear to discuss possible Epstein co-conspirators.The email exchange, dated July 9, 2019, states that three of 10 \"co-conspirators\" had been located in Boston, New York City and Connecticut, and were served grand jury subpoenas. Email from the Epstein files released by the U.S. Department of Justice dated July 2019 from the DOJ’s Crimes Against Children Human Trafficking Unit referencing Epstein’s “10 co-conspirators.”U.S. Department of Justice\"4 of the 10 are outstanding with attempts having been made. 1 is a wealthy business man in Ohio... the remaining 3 are currently out of pocket,\" the email states. In a statement on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., demanded more transparency around the alleged co-conspirators.\"The Department of Justice needs to shed more light on who was on the list, how they were involved and why they chose not to prosecute,\" Schumer said. \"Protecting possible co-conspirators is not the transparency the American people and Congress are demanding.\"This is the second major release of files since Friday, when all documents were required under the Epstein Files Transparency Act to be made public with minimal redactions.In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers that \"due to the volume of materials,\" the DOJ would release the documents on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement to release the files in their entirety by Dec. 19.Schumer said Monday that he would force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files, are among congressional lawmakers considering holding federal officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, in contempt for the handling of the files. Khanna also threatened to begin impeachment proceedings against Bondi and Blanche if the DOJ continues to flout the law.A group of Epstein survivors on Monday joined the call for congressional oversight in a statement. Nineteen survivors signed the letter, which urged \"hearings, formal demands for compliance, and legal action, to ensure the Department of Justice fulfills its legal obligations.\"The survivors also noted that many of the released documents were heavily redacted. \"At the same time, numerous victim identities were left unredacted, causing real and immediate harm,\" the group wrote.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationThe DOJ also raised eyebrows over the weekend when several photos — including one that contained images of Trump's face — were quietly removed from the online database for the Epstein files. The photo was later restored.The Justice Department has maintained that it is working to review and redact material required by the law to protect the privacy of Epstein's victims. \"This is an arduous process, as each document and photograph must be individually reviewed by the DOJ and the Southern District of New York for potential redactions to protect victims or potential victims,\" the DOJ said in a fact sheet.Former President Bill Clinton, who featured prominently in the photos released on Friday, has notably called for the complete release of the files.Clinton's spokesman, Angel Urena, on Monday issued a statement urging the DOJ to \"immediately release any remaining materials referring to, mentioning, or containing a photograph of Bill Clinton.\"\"What the Department of Justice has released so far, and the manner in which it did so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we know this: We need no such protection,\" Urena wrote.Clinton has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.",

The measure for future expectations held steady at 70.7 — well below the 80 level considered a signal for a recession ahead.Still, other data shows that shoppers continued to hit the stores in the last weeks of the year, pointing to a growing disconnect between consumer spending and consumer sentiment. Consumer spending expanded by 3.5% in the third quarter after rising 2.5% in the second quarter, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. The National Retail Federation forecast that holiday spending will surpass $1 trillion for the first time, increasing 3.7% to 4.2% over 2024.watch nowCredit card balances top $6,500Meanwhile, Americans' credit card tab continues to creep higher. The average credit card balance per consumer now stands at $6,523, up 2.2% year over year, according to TransUnion's latest credit industry insights report, from 2025′s third quarter.Average credit balances also grew in November compared to the previous year, a separate report by VantageScore found.

The company has been on an acquisition spree in 2025 as it sought to accelerate growth, McDermott  said. ServiceNow announced a deal for AI agent platform Moveworks for $2.85 billion in March, and at the beginning of December, said it would acquire identity security platform Veza.\"ServiceNow will have the only AI control tower that drives workflow, action and business outcomes across all of these environments,\" McDermott added.

In November, the California-based company, which helps businesses protect internet-connected devices from cyber risks, said it had raised $435 million at a $6.1 billion valuation.At the time, co-founder Yevgeny Dibrov told CNBC that Armis was looking to go public in 2026 or 2027, but his main objective was to surpass $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. \"The need for what Armis is doing and what we are building, in this cyber exposure management and security platform, is just increasing,\" he said, adding that there's \"very unique and huge\" demand for its tools. Many companies have opted to stay private for longer or get acquired as a turbulent initial public offering market has begun to rebound. Large companies such as Stripe and Databricks have found an influx of capital in private markets.  In the age of AI, companies are spending more on cybersecurity to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. This year has also been significant for major cybersecurity deals as companies look to enhance their threat protection capabilities. That includes Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion deal for CyberArk. ServiceNow said Armis has topped $340 million in annual recurring revenue with 50% year-over-year growth, up from $300 million disclosed in August. ",

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. By law, borrowers must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

But some experts question which workers will benefit from the policy. Enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 of \"qualified tips\" per year on federal returns from 2025 to 2028.

Republicans enacted the capped deduction via their multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending package in early July.Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates released in November. But not all tipped workers qualify.Lowest earners can't claim 'no tax on tips'Both parties promoted the \"no tax on tips\" deduction as tax relief for working families. But the country's lowest earners may not be able to claim it, experts say.\"Low-income households do not benefit from no tax on tips because they already don't pay federal income tax,\" Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told CNBC. For 2025, workers won't owe federal income taxes until earnings exceed the standard deduction, which is $15,750 for single filers or $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. Above that, certain tax breaks, such as the earned income tax credit, can also reduce liability below zero.In 2022, more than one-third of tipped workers, 37%, owed no federal income tax due to low income, according to a 2024 report from The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank, showed similar findings. If tips were tax-free or tax-exempt, only about 60% of tipped workers would benefit, the organization reported in early 2025.watch nowSome tipped workers won't qualify Since the policy was first introduced, there have been questions about which occupations qualify for the \"no tax on tips\" deduction. The Treasury Department and IRS released a preliminary list of jobs in September. But certain workers who receive tips via a so-called \"specified service trade or businesses,\" or SSTBs, from industries including health care, legal, financial services, performing arts and others, are not eligible for the tax break. However, SSTB workers may be able to temporarily claim the deduction for 2025 until the Treasury and IRS finalize regulations, based on \"transition relief\" released by the agencies in November.  With lingering uncertainty about eligibility, \"it's possible to confuse people into thinking they will qualify for this for future years,\" said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation.

    "body": "Dr. Thomas Kelly is the co-founder and CEO of Heidi.Courtesy of Thomas KellyIn 2017, Thomas Kelly graduated from medical school and finally became a doctor — a career he had dreamt about as a kid and spent years working towards. But once he started practicing, Kelly realized that the job was different from what he'd imagined. \"My time as a doctor [was] very constrained. I only get 10 minutes for the patient,\" he told CNBC Make It. \"I was finding I had, you know, 100 patients to see in a day, and [was] always in a rush and always coordinating 700 tests and a million tasks.\"\"In a perfect world ... I would spend as much time with [patients] as they need ...  I would understand their family, I would remember them deeply, and then I would check in on them regularly,\" he said. However, the reality is that, like many other clinicians, he faced \"incredible burnout\" working in the field. Inspired to tackle this problem, Kelly created an AI tool that helps transcribe medical visits, generates clinical notes and more, with the goal of lessening the load on doctors and clinicians. Now, the 33-year-old is the co-founder and CEO of Heidi, an AI medical scribe. The company announced its $65 million Series B round in October, valuing the company at $465 million.Early explorationGrowing up in Melbourne, Australia, Kelly was inspired by his primary care doctor to pursue medicine. \"I just loved my primary care doctor ... He was like, the pinnacle of using your intelligence and knowledge for good,\" said Kelly. \"He always had an amazing plan. He was very warm, great bedside manner, but also, just incredibly sharp and intelligent always.\"That experience stayed with him. During university, he explored other interests such as math and computer science before ultimately deciding to go into medicine. In 2013, he enrolled into the University of Melbourne where he began medical school.While studying medicine, Kelly also started a side hustle where he posted educational videos on YouTube and tutored students interested in getting into medicine. To his surprise, the videos began to attract many students, more than he could handle at the time, and what started as a hobby steadily grew into a small business. To better manage his time during his tutoring business, Kelly began experimenting with building out artificial intelligence tools. \"The first AI product I ever tried to build was an interview tutor that people could practice with,\" said Kelly. This tool, called \"Oscar\" allowed students to practice conversations with a medical interviewer, and by 2020, about 20,000 students were using it, he added.\"That was the seed that grew into Heidi,\" he said.As Oscar improved, Kelly began to notice its broader potential. \"There was no [single] lightbulb moment,\" Kelly said, however, he realized that if an AI tool could understand a conversation between a student and a medical examiner, it could do the same for a patient and a doctor. \"You could then create clinical notes. You could do differential diagnosis, potentially. You could complete tasks,\" he said. \"That is the root [of] medicine. It's a very advanced, very technical, deep, complicated conversation, but it's still a conversation.\" Taking the leapBy 2021, Kelly was faced with a big decision: go all-in on his medical career and begin vascular surgery training or take a career break and try to build out his AI tool to help serve not just medical students but also clinicians and doctors. \"I took the leap,\" said Kelly. \"[I thought] I'll regret it forever if I don't take this chance. How many surgical trainees are good enough in math and have had business experience and can build this product? I think not many.\" \"Maybe it was hubris, but I thought if anyone can start this company, it would be me, and let's try and see what happens,\" he said. So in 2021, Kelly officially left his medical career behind and went all-in on building Heidi. Today, the tool assists in helping doctors offload some administrative tasks such as creating documentation, clinical notes and more.Heidi has grown into a strong business and has attracted nearly $100 million in funding. \"At some point I just [did the] introspection ... if you're sitting in an aged care home and your family's around you, what are the things you're going to regret? And for me, it was, I definitely would have regretted not having tried,\" said Kelly.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "watch nowCitadel plans to return about $5 billion in profits earned in 2025 back to investors at the beginning of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The firm's flagship multistrategy fund, known as Wellington, gained 9.3% in the year through last week, the person said, who asked not to be named discussing performance details. The profit being returned is not all that was generated in 2025, the person said, but rather, a way of constraining capital to better match what the firm sees as the opportunity set going into the new year. As such, Citadel will start 2026 with $67 billion in assets, down from the $72 billion it currently manages, the person said. A spokesperson for Citadel declined to comment. The firm does not opt for profit distributions every year, but since 2017 (and including what's expected to be given back this year), Citadel has returned $32 billion in profit to its investors. Citadel has been ranked the most profitable hedge fund based on net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Through 2024, Citadel has generated $83 billion in net gains since it was founded in 1990. It is anticipated that number will jump to more than $88 billion when the new rankings come out in January.",

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates quickly enough, even though the U.S. economy grew at a much faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter.Hassett, a leading contender to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, said the artificial intelligence boom is boosting economic growth while simultaneously putting downward pressure on inflation. \"If you look at central banks around the world, the U.S. is way behind the curve in terms of lowering rates,\" the top White House economic advisor told CNBC in a \"Money Movers\" interview.U.S. economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, faster than the Dow Jones consensus of 3.2%. Hassett said 1.5% of that growth was due to President Donald Trump's tariffs reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, the third cut this year, but the central bank indicated that the pace of future reductions could be slower. Three Fed governors voted against the quarter-point move, the most dissents since 2019. After this month's meeting, Powell said the decision to cut a quarter point was a \"close call.\" Trump has repeatedly bashed the Fed for not lowering rates as quickly as he would like. Hassett's candidacy has raised concerns among some Fed watchers that he is too close to the president.Hassett told CNBC last week that the Fed's independence is \"really important.\" Trump said in an address to the nation last week that he will announce his nominee for Fed chair soon, emphasizing that he will pick \"someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot.\"The president's prime-time speech focused on affordability. His approval rating on the economy stood at 37% in a CBS News/YouGov published Sunday. When asked about Trump's sagging approval rating, Hassett said public sentiment often does not reflect the economic numbers. \"In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing,  their glimpse of the outside world,\" Hassett said.

    "body": "Customers at the GasWay Xpress Mart at 1120 Erie Blvd. pump gas on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025, in Schenectady, N.Y. Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesHoliday road-trippers are feeling some relief at the pump this year.The average price of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. has been below $3 a gallon for most of the month — the lowest level since 2021, according to AAA. The association said it's shaping up to be the cheapest December for drivers filling up their tanks going back to the pandemic year of 2020.Fuel prices are down about 7% from a month ago, AAA data shows, and have tumbled roughly 43% from mid-2022 highs near $5 a gallon that followed runaway inflation in the wake of the pandemic.The latest slide in prices comes as AAA forecasts a record of more than 122 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home in the 13 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 1. AAA found nearly nine of 10 people on the move during the period — or close to 110 million — are expected to travel by car.The drop in pump prices may help mitigate the impact of lingering inflation elsewhere during the holiday season.Just over 40% of those polled said they planned to spend less at the holidays this year, a 6-point increase from a year ago, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey. Of those who are pinching pennies, 46% blamed the high cost of goods.The national average masks wide, regional variances, as Hawaii and California both recorded average gas prices above $4 on Monday. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, a gallon came in just below $2.30.",

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

Its 300 wealthiest residents are worth a combined 850 billion Swiss Francs, or just over $1 trillion, according to business magazine Bilanz. But on Sunday, voters will go to the polls to vote on an inheritance tax that has riled them up.

A recent poll put support at just 30%.watch nowBut close followers of the debate told CNBC the initiative has shaken wealthy individuals and family-owned companies since it was proposed in 2024.

The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft.watch nowAir India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled.Scoot, another carrier under the Singapore Airlines group, said 21 of its 29 A320s required the fix and that it aimed to complete the work by Saturday.In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. \"As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November,\" a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC.The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an \"uncommanded and limited pitch down event.\"  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also issued an emergency directive later that day, ordering operators of the affected model to address the glitch.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: \"The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations.\"",

    "body": "Silver, often nicknamed the 'Devil's metal' because of its volatility, has reached record highs this year and still has further to run despite a supply crunch, according to experts.The metal's growth value has been running alongside gold's, which has seen its own rally with the price surging past $4,000 an ounce this year.Silver prices reached a historic peak of $54.47 per troy ounce in mid October, marking a 71% rise year-on-year. They've since pared back gains somewhat, but are now growing again, despite low supply levels.\"Some people were having to transport silver by plane rather than on cargo ships to meet delivery demand,\" Paul Syms, head of EMEA ETF Fixed Income and commodity product management at Invesco, told CNBC.\"While we've seen the spike up, we've seen the price come down a little bit. Longer term, there's a different dynamic this time that could keep silver at reasonably high prices and maybe continuing to go up for some time to come,\" he added.October was only the third time in the past 50 years where silver prices peaked. Other silver price highs include January 1980, when the Hunt brothers amassed a third of the world's supply as they attempted to corner the market, as well as 2011, following the U.S. debt ceiling crisis when silver and gold were embraced as safe haven assets. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices year-to-date\"Silver is only about a tenth the size of the gold market, and that short squeeze, obviously, sort of caught a few investors by surprise,\" said Syms.Unlike the previous investment waves, silver's boom in 2025 relied on a mix of low supply and high demand from India as well as industrial needs and tariffs.\"After Liberation Day, the gold price spiked, but silver actually went down a little bit. And the gold-silver ratio spiked to above 100,\" said Syms, referring to the gold-silver ratio which reflects how many ounces of silver are needed to buy one ounce of gold.A low ratio means gold is relatively cheap, while a high ratio indicates silver is undervalued and likely to rise. In April, the ratio reached a historic high.\"The risk managers in financial and industrial entities did not want to let any metal go out of the States for fear that it might come back in at 35% higher for example,\" said Rhona O'Connell, head of market analysis EMEA and Asia at Stone X.watch nowFast forward to the Autumn and silver entered its peak demand, especially as India's monsoon and harvest seasons came to an end.\"Farmers don't really like the banks very much, so gold and latterly, silver, tend to be the first port of call when they've got the harvest in,\" said O'Connell.India is also the world's largest consumer of silver, with about 4,000 metric tons used every year, mostly for jewelry, utensils and ornaments. The silver appeal this Autumn also coincided with Diwali, a five-day 'Festival of Lights' celebrating prosperity and good fortune and also India's biggest public holiday.Supply crunchWhile gold is traditionally a favorite, this year silver — an affordable investment option in a country where about 55% of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood — outshined other metals.On Oct. 17, the price of silver in India rose sharply, reaching a record high of 170,415 rupees a kilogram — an 85% rise since the start of the year.However, 80% of India's silver supply is imported. The UAE and China are increasingly supporting that demand, but the U.K. is traditionally India's largest silver supplier.Yet, London's vaults have been emptying rapidly for the past few years. In June 2022, the London Bullion Market Association held 31,023 metric tons of silver. By March  2025, volumes had fallen by around a third to 22,126 metric tons — its lowest point in years.\"What isn't necessarily so visible to people is what's happening in the vaults,\" said O'Connell. \"And that had reached a point where there was basically there was no available metal left in London.\"In October, the squeeze was such that traders had to pay much higher borrowing costs – or lease rates – to close their positions.\"At one stage, to borrow overnight was costing 200% on an annualized basis, so a lot of people were very stressed to put it mildly,\" said O'Connell.Supply is a constant issue for silver, as for other precious and rare metals. The Silver Institute's 2025's World Silver Survey estimates that mine production has been decreasing over the past 10 years, especially in Central and South America.\"Over the course of the past twelve months or so, the underlying surplus has started to turn into a deficit for three reasons: the impact of the electrification of the vehicle fleet, artificial intelligence, and photovoltaics,\" said O'Connell.Read more\"At the moment, a standard electric vehicle has about 25 grams of silver, maybe the larger EVs have 50 grams of silver as part of their components,\" said Syms.\"If we move into these solid-state silver batteries, each electric vehicle might require a kilo or more of silver,\" he added.And with silver having a high thermal conductivity and a higher electrical conductivity than other metals, as well as increasing demand for EVs, AI and renewables, the metal's value is likely to keep shining.\"Silver crosses over that bridge between precious and industrial metals, and the way technology is going on, the batteries, the solar panels, it's got some great use cases as we move into a more electrified world,\" said Syms.",

    "body": "Miniseries | GettyMany people saving in 401(k) accounts get a company match from their employer. But that money may not yet belong to them.A person may have to remain employed with a company for up to six years — nearly twice as long as the typical private-sector worker stays in a job — to take full control of those matching funds, which may pose an additional financial hit for those laid off in a cooling labor market. The 401(k) match is often referred to as \"free\" money: Employees who contribute to their 401(k) plan may get a matching contribution to their account from their employer, up to a certain amount.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageThat 'free' money in your 401(k) may not belong to you just yetAI data center 'frenzy' is pushing up your electric bill — here's why'Buyers may be a little disappointed' by Black Friday car deals: analystIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

Depending on the match terms and a worker's earnings, the match money at stake could be worth thousands of dollars per year — and even more when compounded over decades of investing. The most common employer match formula — used by about 20% of employers — is to match half of the first 6% of a worker's salary, according to the PSCA. So, if a worker has 6% of each paycheck deposited into their 401(k), the employer would contribute an additional 3% to the 401(k).However, while workers may see the matching funds reflected in their 401(k) balance, most don't take ownership of it immediately. Just 44% of employers that pay a 401(k) match offered so-called \"immediate full vesting\" in 2024, according to PSCA data issued in November. In other words, all of the matching funds contributed by an employer belong to the worker immediately. Workers can take that money with them if they leave.For the rest, it may take many years — perhaps up to five or six — to own their full match. \"There might be a service requirement,\" said Hattie Greenan, the PSCA's director of research. \"It's often used as a way to reduce turnover, depending on the industry you're in.\"watch nowIn lieu of immediate full vesting of a 401(k) match, many companies offer \"graduated vesting.\" That means employees take ownership of their match in tranches over a number of years.For example, 15% of companies offer graduated vesting over a five-year period, according to PSCA data; an employee might gain 20% of their match per year for five years. Another 14% of companies offer six-year graduated vesting. Others have \"cliff\" vesting, meaning they give ownership of the full match to workers after the workers reach a specific tenure, but pay none before workers reach that length of service.About 10% of companies offer three-year cliff vesting, and another 7% offer two-year cliff vesting, according to the PSCA.The typical private-sector worker had a tenure of 3.5 years in early 2024, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.Leaving a job too soon or being laid off could be costly for retirement savings. The U.S. labor market has shown signs of weakness lately. Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, reported that job cuts in October were the highest for the month in 22 years. It has been the worst year for announced layoffs since 2009, the firm said. Consumer confidence has plunged to its lowest point since April amid anxiety over the job market.",

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

Europe's Stoxx 600 managed to hold onto gains, making November the fifth positive month in a row. But tech stocks also suffered, as concerns over AI valuations and spending plans played out across global stock markets.So what does this mean for December — can stocks stage a seasonal Santa Rally, or will it be more 'bah humbug' in the final trading month of the year? Macy's Santa Claus is greeted by traders on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Nov. 26, 2025.  Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersThe case for a Santa RallyFidelity International crunched the numbers: The FTSE 100 has delivered a positive return during December in 24 out of the last 30 years. There could be some festive cheer for the U.K. this year, with markets pricing in a 90% chance the Bank of England will cut the interest rate in December after the budget was seen as avoiding any seriously inflationary measures. It's a different picture for the European Central Bank, where markets see zero chance of a cut, but this is also seen as a positive sign as the governing council said policy is in a \"good place\" in their last set of minutes. European and Asian stocks have tracked the U.S. higher each time expectations rise for a cut at the next Federal Reserve meeting in December, with a near-83% chance of a reduction now expected by markets, according to CME Fedwatch. The central banks could help bring the festive spirit this December. The 'bah humbug' caseBut there are market forces that could leave the bulls finding a lump of coal in their stocking. The drivers behind the volatility in November have not magically disappeared, with some investors and market watchers still voicing concern over the pace of AI hyperscaler spending. Even the ECB made the usual move this week of warning that U.S. tech valuations are stretched because investors have FOMO, \"fear of missing out.\" The central bank warned of \"sharp correlated price adjustments\" as a key risk for AI-driven stocks. watch nowCrypto could also be a drag in the final month of the year. As CNBC reported last week, Compass Point predicts bitcoin will continue declining as newer investors sell the token and exchange-traded-funds tied to it. Compass also suggests long-term holders could sell down their holdings due to the \"halving\" schedule, which happens every four years and \"programmatically cuts in half the amount of rewards individuals get for mining new tokens on the bitcoin blockchain.\"Why the pressure on bitcoin may linger into year-endWhether you believe in the Santa Rally or not, December will cap a fascinating year for asset classes across the globe, and make 2026 predictions tough to call.

It makes up about a quarter of the total industrial warehouse space in the U.S. Vacancies are close to cyclical peaks and new construction is contracting, according to industry data. In the first half of this year, new supply still outpaced new demand, but the gap shrank, according to new research from Colliers. Third-party logistics firms, including delivery services such as Ryder and DHL moving goods on behalf of a client, are leading that demand.\"The third-quarter demand has far exceeded the entire first half of the year, which is another really strong indicator that the supply and demand is starting to get more into a balanced state,\" said Stephanie Rodriguez, national director of industrial services at Colliers. Across the 20 largest markets, the overall big-box vacancy rate rose 19 basis points to 11% during the first half of the year, according to Colliers. New supply totaled 48 million square feet in the first half of 2025, much less than the 330 million square feet completed at the height of the cycle in 2023. Rents are expected to stabilize in the near term before starting to grow again. Big-box is a major segment of the overall warehouse real estate market, particularly driven by demand from online retailers and companies seeking efficient supply chain operations. Recent economic and tariff policies have definitely shaken that demand, but as those policies settle, more demand could return. Lower interest rates would be another driver. Supply chainSupply chain, which relies heavily on warehouse real estate, is also seeing something of a transformation that could increase demand. In a report titled \"Bold Predictions for 2026,\" Prologis, the world's largest logistics real estate company, cited specific supply chain trends to watch, including forecasts that:E-commerce companies will make up nearly 25% of new leasing next year as the proportion of goods sold online rises to almost 20% globally by year-end.The need for power-ready logistics facilities capable of supporting automation and manufacturing will be a top-three factor globally in location selection.Defense-related demand in the U.S. and Europe will breathe new life into older industrial corridors and produce a new class of specialized logistics assets.Shrinking trucking capacity will drive double-digit rate hikes in 2026, making transportation an even larger share of total supply chain spend and amplifying the value of well-located logistics real estate.PowerPower is emerging as a leading driver across real estate portfolios. Beyond the usual narrative of e-commerce and the data center sector, power availability and network densification are becoming important pricing catalysts, according to a recent report from Hines, a global real estate investment manager.\"While re/near-shoring demand continues to pick up speed, albeit slowly and with somewhat uneven impact, opportunity also lies in power-advantaged infill assets that support faster and denser networks; where distance once drove advantage, closeness now creates it,\" according to the Hines report. ReshoringFurther research from Hines shows that warehouse net absorption has correlated to manufacturing construction spend. \"This trend highlights another potential source of demand not only for industrial manufacturing facilities, but for the warehouse subsector as well,\" according to its report, which predicts reshoring alone could increase overall warehouse demand over the next five years by roughly 35%.\"Despite the volatility in the macroeconomic landscape, driven by interest rate and trade policy uncertainties, industrial properties near ports remain vital,\" Guarino said. \"Tariffs may lead to higher costs and supply chain challenges, but these locations are key to maintaining supply chain resilience and adapting to trade shifts.\"ProximityOne example of the proximity advantage: Amazon. Its logistics real estate strategy mirrors a broader national trend, prioritizing efficiency, automation and consumer proximity over sheer scale, according to a note from CoStar.\"It's an interesting inflection point for industrial developers and REITs that rode the pandemic-era boom,\" wrote Juan Arias, CoStar Group's national director of industrial analytics. Arias highlighted a leasing slowdown, noting that this year Amazon has occupied just 61 logistics properties, down from 100 in 2024 and as many as 300 in recent years. Its demand for larger footprint facilities hit a seven-year low, but it is still drawn to newer, taller buildings, with an emphasis on modern, efficient distribution centers, Arias said.AIAs with everything else, artificial intelligence and property technology are making an imprint on the warehouse sector as well. They are helping owners and operators to analyze supply chains, traffic patterns and data more efficiently — particularly important in identifying potential warehouse locations. They are also helping to manage inventory and predict maintenance needs, both of which reduce costs. ",

    "body": "A worker walks past molten steel at a steel factory in Huai'an, in China's eastern Jiangsu province on July 22, 2025.    - | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity edged higher in November but remained stuck in contraction for the eighth consecutive month, while services weakened as the boost from earlier holidays faded, according to official data released Sunday.The manufacturing purchasing managers' index rose to 49.2, up 0.2 points from October, the National Bureau of Statistics said. The figures were in line with economists' expectations in a Reuters poll, but remained below the 50-point mark that separates expansion from contraction.The non-manufacturing business activity index fell to 49.5, down 0.6 points from October, while the composite PMI output index eased to 49.7, indicating a slight pullback in both manufacturing and services activities.Supply and demand in manufacturing improved modestly, said Huo Lihui, chief statistician at the bureau's Service Industry Survey Center, with the production index reaching the 50 threshold and new orders rising to 49.2. High-tech manufacturing stayed in expansion for a tenth straight month at 50.1, even as equipment manufacturing and consumer goods producers slipped below 50. Energy-intensive industries posted a mild rebound to 48.4, up 1.1 percentage points from October.Smaller factories recorded the strongest improvement. The PMI for small enterprises jumped to 49.1, its highest in nearly six months, while medium-sized firms edged up to 48.9. Large manufacturers weakened, falling to 49.3.Market confidence showed a slight uptick. The index measuring expectations for production and operations rose to 53.1. Industries including non-ferrous metal smelting and aerospace-related equipment reported particularly strong sentiment, with readings above 57.Holiday boost fadesNon-manufacturing activity, covering construction and services, softened, weighed down by services. Huo attributed the decline partly to the fading impact of earlier holiday-driven spending. China's Golden Week holiday, which typically lifts travel and consumer spending before activity normalizes in the following months, ran from Oct. 1 to 8 this year.Service-sector activity fell to 49.5,  down 0.6 percentage points from October, though pockets of strength remained: railway transportation, telecommunications, broadcasting and satellite transmission, and financial services all posted readings above 55.Real estate and residential services continued to lag below the 50 mark, underscoring persistent weakness in property-related activity. Construction activity improved to 49.6, aided by stronger expectations for near-term growth, with that sector's sentiment index climbing to 57.9.The non-manufacturing new orders index slipped to 45.7, reflecting softer demand. Input prices rose to 50.4, and service-sector sales prices, while still below 50, narrowed their decline.Manufacturing employment ticked up slightly to 48.4, while non-manufacturing employment rose marginally to 45.3. Supplier delivery times for factories improved to 50.1.China surveys roughly 3,200 manufacturers and 4,300 non-manufacturing firms for the monthly PMI readings, which are seasonally adjusted and considered a leading indicator for economic momentum.Trade strainsChina's manufacturing activity has contracted since April, when U.S. President Donald Trump launched new tariffs that squeezed producers.Industrial profits fell 5.5% in October, the sharpest drop since June, reversing the strong gains seen in late summer. Earnings for the first ten months at major industrial firms rose 1.9%, slowing from the January–September pace.The broader Chinese economy has cooled as growth slipped to 4.8% in the third quarter.Trade tensions with the U.S. spiked in October as Washington threatened new 100% tariffs before both sides reached a late-month deal in South Korea. The agreement cut U.S. fentanyl-linked tariffs to 10% from 20%, paused Beijing's rare-earth controls for a year and reopened China's purchases of American soybeans and other farm goods.Despite the truce, demand at home remains soft. A drawn-out property slump and weak labor conditions are weighing on consumer spending. Policymakers have signaled a longer-term push to lift consumption and tech self-reliance but have avoided major new stimulus as the economy remains on track to meet its 5% growth target.",

    "body": "Alistair Berg | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesRecent legislation and policy changes under the Trump administration have upended federal student loans. For some borrowers, the shifts may affect their tax situation — how much they owe the IRS, or whether they actually get an expected tax refund.More than 40 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion. Taxability of student loan forgiveness is changing. A law that shielded student loan forgiveness from taxation at the federal level — a provision in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 — expires at the end of 2025. President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" did not extend or make permanent that policy. It did, however, make student loan forgiveness tax-free in cases of death or disability. As a result, student loan borrowers who get their debt forgiven under the U.S. Department of Education's income-driven repayment plans, or IDRs, after December will again face a federal tax bill. IDR plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.The federal tax bill on student loan forgiveness can be substantial. The average loan balance for borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan is around $57,000, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. For those in the 22% tax bracket, having that amount forgiven would trigger a tax burden of more than $12,000, Kantrowitz estimated. Lower earners, or those in the 12% tax bracket, would still owe around $7,000.Here's what borrowers need to know about how recent policy changes may affect their taxes, and four year-end steps to take:  1. Gather records showing forgiveness eligibilityBorrowers who became eligible for student loan forgiveness in 2025 or expect to before year-end \"should save all payment records with their servicers,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York. \"If necessary, they can use this information to prove they were entitled to forgiveness during a year in which it is not subject to tax,\" Nierman said.2. Plan for a state tax bill on forgivenessEven those who receive student loan forgiveness this year may still owe taxes to their state, said Kantrowitz. Currently, five states tax the relief in certain cases, he said: Arkansas, Indiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and Wisconsin.Borrowers should look into the particular rules of their state so that they can start making a plan to be prepared for any bill.  3. Calculate your student loan interest deductionRecent tax legislation hasn't affected this longstanding break: Borrowers can deduct up to $2,500 in interest payments made on private or federal student loans from their taxable income each year. As 2025 wraps up, you'll want to figure out how much you can claim. Depending on your tax bracket and how much interest you paid, the student loan interest deduction could be worth up to $550 a year, Kantrowitz said. The deduction is \"above the line,\" meaning you don't need to itemize your taxes to claim it.There are income limits, however. For 2025, the deduction starts to phase out, or get smaller, for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $85,000, Kantrowitz said. For married couples filing jointly, the phaseout begins at $170,000. Your lender or student loan servicer reports your interest payments for the tax year to the IRS on a tax form called a 1098-E, and should provide you with a copy in January. If you don't receive the form, you can get it from your servicer.4. Get current to avoid tax refund seizureStudent loan borrowers who are in default should take steps now to get current and avoid the government seizing some or all of their tax refund. The Trump administration announced that it would resume collections on April 21, not long after tax season in 2025. More than 5 million borrowers are currently in default. Your entire federal tax refund, including any refundable credits, can be seized for a past-due student loan, Kantrowitz said. You can contact the government's Default Resolution Group and pursue a number of different avenues to get current on your loans, including enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation. \"If a borrower brings their account current, that can stop the Treasury offset of their tax refunds,\" Kantrowitz said. Borrowers in default can also try to adjust their paycheck withholdings to reduce the likelihood of a large tax refund, but you'll want to be careful that your withholding complies with IRS rules, Kantrowitz added.

    "body": "A sign opposing a zoning change for a Microsoft data center appears in Caledonia, Wisconsin, on Sept. 19, 2025.Jordan Novet | CNBCThe village of Caledonia, Wisconsin, sandwiched between Chicago and Milwaukee along Lake Michigan, is dotted with corn and soybean fields, single-story homes and traffic signs alerting drivers to horseback riders.In September, when Microsoft, the world's third most-valuable company, sought to rezone 244 acres of agricultural land for a data center, 40 of the 49 people who spoke before the village's planning commission opposed the plan.They worried about noise. They said air quality, already in violation of federal standards, could worsen. They feared electric bills might inflate and that few jobs would materialize, while Microsoft would continue to reap the rewards of the artificial intelligence boom.\"Why do we have to subsidize a company making billions of dollars a year?\" resident Mike Kirchner asked at the meeting.Nine days later, before Caledonia's top officials could vote on the proposal, Microsoft walked away. It pledged to find another location in the region, while expanding a separate AI data center 20 miles south, in the village of Mount Pleasant, where public outcry was proving to be less of an impediment.Caledonia and Mount Pleasant both belong to Racine County, which consists of 18 small cities, towns and villages in the southeastern corner of Wisconsin. The two villages have very different dynamics. Half a decade ago, Mount Pleasant was supposed to be home to a giant facility for Taiwanese iPhone supplier Foxconn. It was a project with such ambitions that President Donald Trump, during his first administration, called it \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at a 2018 groundbreaking ceremony.To clear the way for Foxconn, Mount Pleasant bought land, offering $50,000 an acre and 140% of appraised value for residents' homes, plus relocation costs, a village official said. Roads were paved, and water connections and electrical infrastructure installed.But it was ultimately a high-priced failure. Foxconn eventually abandoned most of its plans, leaving a giant hole in the 800-plus acres of land that had been transferred to the manufacturer. In the eyes of many locals, Microsoft is filling that hole, and then some.watch nowThe contrasting scenarios in two Wisconsin villages, separated by mostly farmland and a smattering of churches and gas stations, underscores the obstacles facing the tech industry as it seeks to construct supersized data centers to house what's expected to be trillions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. While large technology companies have maintained data centers in the U.S. for decades, there's a fresh urgency to open facilities packed with hundreds of thousands of Nvidia chips and to cash in on the AI craze, spawned by the 2022 launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.Power requirements measured in the gigawatts, pollution concerns, economic issues and political dynamics are just some of the friction points that can vary dramatically from one municipality to the next, making it virtually impossible to create a playbook for the handful of companies — Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta — leading the way.Meanwhile, data centers don't tend to create a lot of long-lasting jobs. Brad Smith, Microsoft's vice chair and president, wrote in a blog post in September that the Mount Pleasant facility hired 3,000 construction workers at its peak and foresees 500 full-time employees, eventually growing to 800. McKinsey said in an August report that a 250,000-square-foot data center could employ 1,500 people during construction, but more than 50 for \"steady-state operations,\" though additional jobs get created for other labor, like upgrading infrastructure.Local pushback can present a major hurdle.In August, the city council in Tucson, Arizona, voted to shelve an unnamed party's 290-acre data center proposal following objections from residents. In September, Google scrapped plans for a 470-acre site to be located in Indiana after protestors mounted signs that read \"NO GOOGLE DATA CENTER,\" and voiced concerns about strains on the power grid and loss of farmland.A month later, in its quarterly earnings report, Google parent Alphabet raised its capital expenditures forecast, saying it now expects to spend up to $93 billion in 2025 followed by a \"significant increase\" next year. Microsoft said that same day that capex growth would accelerate in fiscal 2026, which started in July, suggesting a minimum of about $94 billion, a number that's substantially higher when including leases.With all of the hyperscalers laying out aggressive spending plans, Wisconsin and other states have lined up to offer incentives, such as extending tax breaks on sales of servers and networking switches. That partly reflects an effort to reestablish domestic industries after decades of economic erosion from the closing of factories and the rise of offshoring.Wisconsin, once a hub for building auto parts and heavy equipment, has 22% fewer people working in manufacturing today than it did at the end of the 20th century, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2010, Chrysler closed its plant in Kenosha, just south of Caledonia.A data center doesn't promise the kind of jobs needed for a vehicle production line, but it represents a connection to an emerging part of the economy and can offer hope to areas that have long been on the decline.\"The jobs Microsoft is paying are notably higher than the average wage in the region,\" said Dale Kooyenga, CEO of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.It's a pitch that was enticing enough for one village in Racine County, but not another.Filling the holeThe story starts in 2017, when Foxconn said it would build a $10 billion plant in Mount Pleasant for making flat-panel displays, with plans to create 13,000 jobs.Mount Pleasant and Racine County told media outlets they were committing $764 million. Kelly Gallaher, Racine County's Democratic party chair, said borrowings approached $1 billion.\"For a town of 26,000 people, that's crazy, right?\" she said in an interview.By mid-2018, Foxconn was already scaling back its plans, first by deciding not to proceed with a \"Generation 10.5\" factory that could churn out screens of up to 75 inches in size, and instead targeting smaller components.The entrance to a Foxconn construction site in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, in May 2019.Katie Tarasov | CNBCThe company quickly downsized its hiring projections. Development was so slow that Bloomberg described the project as \"disastrous\" in 2019.An amended contract signed in 2021 allowed for up to $80 million in state tax credits, down from the original $2.85 billion, in the event that Foxconn reached its new job creation goal of 1,454 by 2026. In 2023, the company said, it employed over 1,000 people in Wisconsin.Mount Pleasant's finances sagged under the pressure of the development. Between 2019 and 2022, the village lost $193 million to pay down debt for the project, as costs far outpaced tax revenue from Foxconn, according to financial reports. And the city of Racine, which supplies water to the village, wasn't getting much economic activity in return, leading to a legal skirmish between the municipalities.Then came the AI blitz.OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022. The chatbot took off immediately and set in motion a torrent of investment in generative AI. Microsoft, OpenAI's lead backer and dealer of computing power, needed more capacity.In addition to enlisting third-party providers like CoreWeave, Microsoft sought out land. The company found Mount Pleasant, and in 2023 revealed plans for a 315-acre campus.In May 2024, President Joe Biden visited Wisconsin to promote the home of the planned $3.3 billion data center. Microsoft's Smith, who spent some of his childhood in Mount Pleasant, said the facility would create manufacturing jobs around the state.And while it wouldn't bring 13,000 jobs, as Foxconn had promised, Smith said, \"We will train over 100,000 people in Wisconsin by the end of the decade so they have the AI skills to fill the jobs of tomorrow.\"Microsoft's arrival was \"kind of a bit of a silver lining in what was basically a shameful story,\" Gallaher said.In 2023, Gallaher had mounted a campaign to try and unseat Dave DeGroot as Mount Pleasant village board president, blaming incumbents for the Foxconn misadventure. But in the election that April, a week after Microsoft's announcement, DeGroot was victorious. He didn't respond to a request for comment.Microsoft President Brad Smith speaks to guests prior to the arrival of President Joe Biden during an event at Gateway Technical College in Sturtevant, Wisconsin, on May 8, 2024.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesWhile Microsoft's plans received a hefty dose of local support from residents fed up with the Foxconn fallout, environmentalists have been vocal.A nonprofit called Midwest Environmental Advocates sued the city of Racine in September for information on water use, a month after conservation group Alliance for the Great Lakes published a report showing that \"a single hyperscale data center can use more than 365 million gallons of water a year, equivalent to what 12,000 Americans use in that time.\"The city responded that Microsoft's facility would use up to 8.4 million gallons per year.In February, residents of neighboring Kenosha County protested plans for a natural gas plant in the town of Paris, six miles from the Microsoft site, saying air quality would worsen and bring health problems.\"Hope this doesn't become some sort of an AI hub,\" Jonathan Barker, one of the protesters, said in an interview. Barker is a former pastor of Kenosha's Grace Lutheran Church, a 20-minute drive from the Paris plant. He said rate increases from We Energies, which provides electricity to over 1 million Wisconsin customers, could be overwhelming to those on fixed incomes.Smith has tried to reassure locals. At a September town hall meeting in Racine, he stressed that Microsoft wasn't about to drain Lake Michigan. He promised citizens that their electric bills won't spike because of the company's presence.If anything, residents should prepare to see the project expand, Smith said in an interview from a balcony at the data center, which will house two stories of AI chips.\"We bought a lot more land than one would need if the only thing we can build is two of these,\" Smith said.The company paid $1.9 million in property taxes to Mount Pleasant in 2025, with a larger sum to follow in 2026, as its first data center comes online. The second is set to open by 2028. 'Does anybody know about this?'Next, Microsoft went north.Caledonia is more rural than Mount Pleasant, with more expansive lots, fewer homes and businesses, and almost 30 miles of horseback riding trails that cross property lines.Microsoft plotted out land just west of We Energies' 610-megawatt Oak Creek coal plant, which opened beside Lake Michigan in the 1950s. We Energies buried coal ash around the plant, and in 2009 it reported elevated levels of the chemical element molybdenum in nearby private wells. The utility bought over 100 acres to form a buffer around the plant.In July, Caledonia sent letters about a potential rezoning to those in close proximity to the property that Microsoft was pursuing, though without mentioning the company's name. Prescott Balch, a retired U.S. Bank technology executive living in Caledonia, estimated that roughly 100 homes sit within a mile of the site. The difference in Mount Pleasant is that the nearby homes had been cleared years earlier to make way for Foxconn.Foxconn's High Performance Computing Data Center Globe stands nearly 100 feet tall in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin.Jordan Novet | CNBCAlong with the letters, Caledonia scheduled a planning commission meeting to discuss rezoning that would allow for \"future development of high-quality, low-traffic light industrial development, i.e., data center.\"Valerie Lancelle never received a letter. She learned about the issue from signs she noticed while driving to the gym one morning in July. The signs were from the village. \"Zoning Change Requested,\" they stated.Lancelle, a 20-year veteran of U.S. Bank and a Caledonia resident, turned to community Facebook groups.\"I'm like, 'Hey, does anybody know about this? What's going on? This is a problem. I'm a little worried,'\" she recalled. She reconnected with Balch, whom she'd worked with until his retirement in 2023.Lancelle attended the planning commission meeting in late July. All 21 people who spoke up were opposed to the development or had questions, according to minutes from the session.The next day, residents launched a Facebook group called \"Caledonia Residents against rezoning on Botting Road.\" It grew to encompass hundreds of members.When CNBC visited Wisconsin in September to see the Mount Pleasant data center, tension was palpable in Caledonia. A lawn sign read \"DATA CENTER\" inside a red circle with a line through it. A man living on the property declined to give his name but said he wouldn't want a data center using water designated for the village.At the time, Microsoft's involvement hadn't been made public. The proposal was just called Project Nova. \"People had been asking me who it was, and I was saying, 'I don't think it's Microsoft,' because I believe that when they went to Mount Pleasant, it was openly Microsoft right from the outset,\" said Fran Martin, a Caledonia trustee. \"I thought it was unlikely that it was Microsoft, because why would they be so open in that situation, and not simply, you know, come to Caledonia with the same openness or transparency? I still don't understand it.\"Microsoft went public with its plans on Sept. 23, at a village board meeting. The Racine County Economic Development Corporation and an engineering firm gave presentations on Project Nova. A director for the economic development group said Microsoft was looking at 50 to 200 permanent Caledonia jobs.Diann Strom, a Microsoft regional manager based in the company's home state of Washington, showed a slide titled \"Microsoft data centers in your community,\" followed by 11 slides detailing how the company professes to foster prosperity and act as a \"good neighbor\" when it arrives in a new location. Strom said Microsoft intended to pay its own way for electricity.\"Our water demands are modest compared to other large industrial water users,\" she told attendees.Despite the assurances, 32 out of 34 people spoke against Microsoft's plans.The next day, Microsoft held an information session at Caledonia Village Hall. Five days later, the planning commission convened at the same place to vote on whether to recommend the rezoning. The crowd spilled out into the lobby, Lancelle said.Prescott Balch at his home in Caledonia, Wisconsin.Prescott BalchSome speakers expressed concerns about the potential environmental impact. Others worried about finances, the risk of relying too heavily on one taxpayer and how the data center buildings could be used if Microsoft were to abandon them.Balch, who said he spent much of his career building software for data centers, had prepared many of the attendees' talking points.\"This is strange bedfellows for me, politically,\" he said. \"I'm the last person that you would expect to be opposed to a data center.\"Caledonia favored Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Balch, who calls himself fiercely independent, said he figured that his best shot at persuading the village board was to advance economic arguments, rather than concentrate on the environment.He did have personal concerns.\"Horses are skittish animals,\" he said. \"They're run-first, ask-questions-later animals. They would have had a miserable experience. I would have even contemplated moving because their lives would have been just unpleasant, given how fearful they are of strange noises and sounds and sights.\"At the hearing, Balch advised planning commissioners to pause.\"The property and AI demand will still be there when the plan is ready,\" he told them. \"And Microsoft isn't anywhere near ready to build anyway.\"Martin took her turn at the mic and slammed officials for a lack of transparency.\"When you're asking us to make a decision as momentous as this and you don't choose to involve us in the process at all, I find that difficult,\" she said. In fact, Microsoft said it reached out directly to Caledonia village staff members in August and subsequently met with them weekly.Despite the pressure, Microsoft managed to win rezoning support from five of the village's seven planning commissioners. The company's employees then checked in with trustees of the village board. The sentiment wasn't all favorable.\"They may have walked out of there going, 'Do we want to take the chance of being voted down?'\" said one trustee, Nancy Pierce.Microsoft pulled out the next week, before the matter came before the village board.In a statement to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Microsoft said, \"Based on the community feedback we heard, we have chosen not to move forward with this site.\"Balch said he, Martin and Pierce shared hugs and high fives at a park.\"We did seem to have awoken a sleeping giant, I guess,\" Martin said.Bowen Wallace, Microsoft's corporate vice president of data centers in the Americas region, said in a statement that the company is \"committed to being a good neighbor in the communities where we operate.\" Microsoft understands \"the importance of hearing and responding to local concerns, and will use the learnings from our experience in Caledonia moving forward,\" Wallace said.Andrew Chien, a computer science professor at the University of Chicago and a former Intel research executive, said \"structural\" challenges are apparent in many places where tech companies try to build.Most of the jobs are temporary, while resource needs and environmental impact will go on for many years, so companies must find ways to be part of the community, protecting residents from rising utility prices and offering job retraining programs, Chien said. That's very different from how the tech industry is used to operating, he added.\"Traditional Silicon Valley culture is, go fast and scale without regard to human communities,\" he said. \"That has to change. Long-term win-wins need to be constructed.\"More work aheadDramas are unfolding across Wisconsin.Last year in Beaver Dam, a small city northwest of Milwaukee, the Common Council signed an agreement backing the annexing and rezoning of an 830-acre site. The project was codenamed Degas LLC.Only later did the council say it was the site of a possible data center. Anger spread on Facebook. Earlier this month, about 100 people showed up at a council meeting, where attendees each had two minutes to lodge complaints.\"You should all be ashamed of yourselves,\" one person called out.Crews have already broken ground, leaving rocks and rubble in the road for vehicles to dodge, said Joey Larson, a midwife in Beaver Dam who joined the meeting virtually.\"Honestly, if we knew that this was going here, we never would have bought here,\" she said.Earlier this month Meta published a blog post outing itself as the company behind Degas LLC, confirming locals' suspicions. The company promised over 100 \"operational jobs.\"Outside Madison, Blackstone-owned developer QTS Realty Trust is aiming to build a data center in the village of DeForest. QTS wants to buy land in the nearby town of Vienna. DeForest received a petition to annex 1,135 acres from Vienna, but Vienna's town board voted 4-0 to reject a cooperation agreement with the developer, after 22 people spoke in opposition to the arrangement.Shawn Haney, a former sheriff's lieutenant in Vienna, said locals are worried about energy and water consumption, and whether it's \"going to be like the dot-com bubble of years ago.\"People work at the Microsoft data center campus, in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, on Sept. 18, 2025.Audrey Richardson | ReutersIn October, the lakeside city of Port Washington, 26 miles north of Milwaukee, was identified as a site for OpenAI and Oracle as part of their Stargate effort. Over 1,000 opponents signed a petition to have the city obtain voter approval before entering into tax deals worth more than $10 million. A joint review board went ahead with a deal anyway.\"This just did not receive any sort of substantial input from the community,\" said Christine Le Jeune, a PhD student at the University of Florida who lives in Port Washington.In flyers distributed to city households, data center firm Vantage promised 330 full-time jobs after construction. The company said electric bills wouldn't go up for the site, which would rely on renewable sources for 70% of its energy needs.On Nov. 10, the city of Janesville, two counties west of Racine, said it would conduct due diligence on a proposal to redevelop the grounds of a former General Motors plant for an $8 billion data center that would consume up to 800 megawatts of power.Unhappy locals are aiming to collect signatures from 4,000 homeowners and renters in the city of about 66,000 to require a referendum for any structure at the old plant that would cost over $450 million. And what's next for Microsoft? Even after the failure at Caledonia, the company said it wanted to keep working with the village and Racine County officials as it selects a new location.At its information session, Microsoft had displayed posters for the public to examine. One listed the steps the company takes before turning on a data center, including construction. Cast in bold at the bottom were the words, \"It's a marathon, not a sprint.\"An election in April 2026 could change the composition of the village board, opening up the possibility of a new Microsoft proposal. Balch said he plans to run for a board seat.\"We never were hellbent on no data center anywhere, and we won't be if they pick another location,\" Balch said. \"But the devil's in the details.\"— CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Amazon's $11B data center goes live: Here's an inside lookwatch now",

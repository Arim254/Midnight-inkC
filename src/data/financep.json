    "body": "Signage at an Anta Sports Products Ltd. pop-up store in Beijing, China, on Saturday, Aug. 24, 2024. Anta is scheduled to release earnings results on Aug. 27. Na Bian | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Puma surged as much as 20% Tuesday, after China's Anta Sports said it would acquire a 29% stake in the German sportswear company from the Pinault family. Anta will pay 1.5 billion euros ($1.78 billion), or 35 euros per share, to take a 29.06% stake in Puma and become the largest shareholder in the company. The deal came as Puma has struggled to revive sales and follow through on a business overhaul after Arthur Hoeld, a former Adidas executive, took the reins last year.  Puma shares pared gains slightly after the open and were last trading up 16%. The 1.5 billion-euro valuation appears \"reasonable\" compared to peer multiples in the sportswear sector, particularly given Puma's current \"loss-making status,\" said Melinda Hu, China consumer analyst at Bernstein. \"Anta is essentially buying a brand with deep heritage and historically strong products at a distressed valuation,\" Hu added.  The deal builds on Anta's efforts to expand its foothold outside of China, where it has faced growing competition from the likes of Nike and Adidas.  By leveraging Puma's heritage, Anta could diversify into a new product category and markets where it has not established a strong foothold, Hu said. Anta has a track record of expanding global footprints by acquiring and revamping Western sports and lifestyle brands. In 2019, it led a consortium to acquire Amer Sports, whose portfolio features Wilson, Arc'teryx, Salomon and Atomic.  \"Puma fills the mass-market athletic footwear and sports lifestyle gap — a segment positioned between Nike, Adidas and budget brands,\" said Julia Zhu, partner and head of consumer retail at consultancy firm CIC.  Puma is strong in Europe and Latin America but weak in China and North America, which creates \"minimal overlap and maximum synergy potential,\" Zhu added.  With the Puma stake acquisition, \"the group is expected to further enhance its presence and brand recognition in the global sorting goods market,\" Anta said in a statement Tuesday.   Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPumaPuma's shares came under heavy pressure last year, falling nearly 50%, according to LSEG data, as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policy rattled investors and retailers grew nervous that tariffs could hit consumer demand. It has fallen over 3% so far this year.  The company said last year that it planned to cut its product range, scale back discounts, improve marketing and slash 900 corporate jobs as part of a broader cost-cutting plan.   \"This is not a takeover [as] Anta does not have full control and Puma remains an independent company with its own management,\" Hu noted. Reuters reported Tuesday that Anta management team said they would speak to counterparts at Puma \"first thing this morning.\"  Global M&A reboundThe Anta-Puma deal also came as global businesses increasingly reassess their risks and returns, in the face of technology disruptions, heightened geopolitical uncertainty, and industry consolidation. \"Companies will make bolder moves to double down on some parts of their global footprint and minimize exposure to less favorable parts,\" according to a survey by Bain & Company released Tuesday. More than half of surveyed companies were preparing assets for sale in the coming years, Bain said, driven by the desire to sharpen business focus, free up cash, and capitalize on higher valuations in today's market.    Global dealmaking activity has roared back into life since last year, with deal value surging 40% to $4.9 trillion, the second-highest deal value on record, according to Bain. The consultancy expects global dealmaking momentum to sustain in 2026, citing easing geopolitical tensions and deeper capital pools as private equity and venture capital firms look to exit the growing backlog of assets. Meanwhile, companies \"urgently need to reinvent themselves to get out ahead of the big forces of technology disruption, a post-globalization economy, and shifting profit pools,\" said Suzanne Kumar, executive vice president of Bain's global M&A and Divestitures practice.

    "body": "Chinese officials are reviewing Meta's $2 billion acquisition of AI startup Manus for possible technology control violations, FT reported on Tuesday.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesMeta Platforms is set to test new subscription models across its apps, including Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp in the coming months, according to a report from TechCrunch on Tuesday. The report, confirmed by a Meta spokesperson, said the subscriptions are expected to \"unlock more productivity and creativity\" by giving paid users access to more features and expanded AI capabilities. Meta's recently acquired suite of general AI agents under Manus will also be scaled as part of the subscription plans. Meta Platforms bought Manus — a Singapore-based developer of AI agents founded in China — in December for a reported $2 billion.With its new subscription plans, Meta could be seeking a return on investment from its massive spending on AI talent and acquisitions last year, even before the Manus purchase. While Meta has been developing large language models under the Llama umbrella, those have been open-sourced. That means general access to Llama has remained free, unlike with paid plans from AI leaders like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic.Other features offered as part of Meta's paid plans could include full access to its AI-powered short-form video experience Vibes, which allows users to create and remix AI-generated videos. While Vibes has been free since its launch in 2025, the new subscription model would grant free access to its basic version, with the option to pay for additional features. The subscriptions will be separate from Meta Verified, a paid product rolled out by the company in 2023 that gave content creators and businesses a verified badge, 24/7 direct support, protection against impersonation, search optimization, and more.Meta told TechCrunch that it plans to listen to its user community and gather feedback as it rolls out subscriptions in the coming months.",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesTikTok users have been deleting the app at a higher rate since the company announced that its U.S. operations would be housed in a new joint venture.The daily average of U.S. users deleting the TikTok app has increased nearly 150% over the past five days compared with the previous three months, market intelligence firm Sensor Tower told CNBC.Last Thursday, TikTok said it had formed a joint venture to keep the video-sharing app operating in the U.S. under new American leadership. The company named Adam Presser, formerly TikTok's head of operations, as CEO of the joint venture. Some users took to social media to voice their skepticism about the new joint venture after being prompted to agree to an updated privacy policy on Thursday.Several social media posts pointed to language in the new policy that describes the types of data TikTok may collect, including sensitive information such as \"your racial or ethnic origin\" as well as \"sexual life or sexual orientation, status as transgender or nonbinary, citizenship or immigration status, or financial information.\"Despite the social media uproar, that language does not appear to be new. An archived version of the policy from August 2024 includes the same provisions.Those concerns appear to have weighed on sentiment around the app after the announcement of the joint venture, contributing to a spike in uninstalls over the past several days.watch now\"If I can delete my biggest platform because their terms of agreement and censorship have gotten out of control, so can you!\" creator Dre Ronayne posted on Threads, the micro-blogging service owned by Meta. Ronayne said she had nearly 400,000 followers on TikTok before deleting her account on Sunday.Other creators have also reported problems posting to the app, with users complaining about outages and video uploads failing to go through.The social media company hasn't communicated to its creators what the joint venture means for them, Nadya Okamoto, a TikTok creator with over 4 million followers, told CNBC. \"That's why there is so much paranoia, because we're all kind of looking at this platform and we just don't know what's happening,\" she said. Okamoto told CNBC she has experienced issues with the app over the past several days and has been unable to upload videos for roughly 24 hours. During the uncertainty, she is continuing to post her content on Instagram and Google's YouTube.\"Online there's a lot of conversation about — is this all coincidence or censorship, and what does this look like?\" Okamoto said. \"For everything to be happening at once, it is very scary.\"An X account associated with the TikTok joint venture said on Monday that the services issue was caused by a power outage at a U.S. data center.\"We're working with our data center partner to stabilize our service. We're sorry for this disruption and hope to resolve it soon,\" the account wrote.However, the increase in uninstalls has not translated into a meaningful drop in U.S. usage. TikTok's active user levels in the U.S. have remained relatively flat compared with the previous week, according to Sensor Tower.Competing apps, however, have seen a bump in interest. Sensor Tower data shows U.S. downloads for UpScrolled increased more than tenfold compared with the prior week, while Skylight Social rose 919% and Chinese-owned Rednote climbed 53% week over week.TikTok did not respond to request for comment.",

    "body": "watch nowUSA Rare Earth shares rallied Monday after the critical minerals startup announced that the Department of Commerce will take an equity stake. Commerce has issued a letter of intent that would provide USA Rare Earth with a $1.3 billion loan and $277 million in federal funding. USA Rare Earth will issue Commerce 16.1 million shares of common stock and 17.6 million in warrants. The U.S. government will have an 8% to 16% stake in the company depending on whether the warrants are exercised, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. USA Rare Earth will also raise $1.5 billion from private investors. The proposed deal with Commerce is subject to the finalization of certain conditions.CEO Barbara Humpton said the deal with the U.S. government will turn USA Rare Earth into an industry leader. Its stock soared 29% at its high Monday before closing with a gain of about 8% at $26.72 per share.\"This is a watershed moment in our work to secure and grow a resilient and independent rare earth value chain based in this country,\" Humpton told analysts on a call Monday. \"We have long said that meeting the urgent call to reassure the rare earth and critical minerals industry will require a multiplayer solution, and this establishes our company as one of the leaders,\" she said. USA Rare Earth is the latest in a series of mining companies that the Trump administration has taken equity stakes in as it builds a Western rare earth and critical minerals supply chain to reduce dependence on China. Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals that are crucial inputs in strategic industries like defense, robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductor manufacturing.Magnet plant and mineThe capital infusion from the Trump administration will help USA Rare Earth advance its plan to build a magnet manufacturing plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma, and a mine at a rare earth deposit in Sierra Blanca, Texas, called Round Top. Commerce will disburse the funding from 2026 through 2028 based on milestones as USA Rare Earth implements its business plan, Chief Financial Officer Rob Steele told analysts on the call.USA Rare Earth is on track to commission its magnet manufacturing plant in the first quarter of 2026, Steele said. It aims to start commercial mining operations at Round Top in late 2028, he said. The company needs about about $4.1 billion to execute its plan, Steele said. It will have about $3.5 billion between its current cash and the government financing as well as private funding announced Monday, he said. This leaves $600 million in additional capital that USA Rare Earth needs to raise. \"We believe we can raise the remaining capital from attractive sources, and you should assume that's equity capital but that can come from strategic investments as well as institutional investors,\" Steele said. Funding conditions But USA Rare Earth has to satisfy several conditions before the agreement with Commerce is finalized. This includes raising at least $500 million from sources other than the federal government, which it will satisfy with the private funding announced Monday. It also has to secure two memorandums of understanding with semiconductor end or midstream users, obtain feedstock supply agreements through 2027, and define a power plan for its magnet facility among other conditions, according to its SEC filing. The planned investment in USA Rare Earth comes after the Defense Department struck a landmark deal last summer with rare earth miner MP Materials that included an equity stake, price floor and offtake agreement. The Trump administration also took stakes in Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals last year.The agreement with USA Rare Earth does not include price floors or offtake agreements. The U.S. has been dependent on rare earth imports from China, which dominates the global supply chain. Beijing tried to cut off rare earth exports last year during trade disputes with the Trump administration.\"USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement. \"This investment ensures our supply chains are resilient and no longer reliant on foreign nations.\"",

    "body": "NINGBO, CHINA - JANUARY 22: Employees work on the production line of snowboards at a workshop to meet the orders on January 22, 2026 in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province of China. He Yuankai/Zhejiang Daily Press Group | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's industrial profits rose 0.6% in 2025 from a year earlier, snapping three consecutive years of declines as officials moved to rein in aggressive price competition and companies sought overseas growth amid weak domestic demand.The pace of growth accelerated from 0.1% in the January-to-November period, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics.The recovery last year was driven by policy intervention, particularly Beijing's campaign against aggressive price undercutting, and companies' efforts to expand overseas, said Tianchen Xu, a senior economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit.  Industrial profits climbed 5.3% in December from a year earlier, the strongest performance since September when earnings surged 21.6%. Profits had faltered in the prior two months, falling 5.5% in October and 13.1% in November.  In December, China's factory activity returned to growth after eight straight months of contraction, in part thanks to pre-holiday stockpiling ahead of the Lunar New Year in February, an official at the statistics bureau said. Profits at the country's major industrial firms have been battered by the bruising price wars sweeping across several industries last year as sluggish consumer demands left companies grappling with excess capacity. Uneven growth across sectorsThere is a \"high level of divergence\" across industries, said Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING, adding that the overall profits growth remains tepid as price competition continues to erode margins. watch nowFor the entire 2025, mining sector profits plunged 26.2% from a year earlier, while profits in manufacturing and utilities, including electricity, heat, fuel and water, rose 5% and 9.4%, respectively, official data showed. Among sectors that posted outsized gains, ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing firms saw profits surge 22.6%, while electronics manufacturing rose 19.5%. Coal mining and washing industry profits fell 41.8% and oil and gas extraction dropped 18.7%.      Profits at state-owned enterprises declined 3.9% while foreign-funded businesses, including those with investment from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, recorded a 4.2% increase. Yu Weining, chief statistician at NBS, attributed the modest rebound last year to the new growth drivers such as equipment and high-tech manufacturing. Railway, shipbuilding, aerospace, and electronics industries posted double-digit profit growth, Yu said.Smart consumer electronics makers saw profits jump 48%, with unmanned aerial devices manufacturing and intelligent in-car appliance makers reporting gains of 102% and 88.8%, respectively. Yu, however, acknowledged that some industrial firms are still facing operational challenges, noting that \"changes in the external environment\" are increasingly important to profitability. \"Progress in Beijing's 'anti-involution' push could gradually improve things, but it will take time,\" ING's Song said, referring to regulatory efforts launched last year to curb aggressive price cuts that have fueled excessive competition and deflationary pressure.Beijing has taken some comfort from the headline economic growth last year that met the official target of 5%, helped by strong export growth as a one-year U.S.-China trade truce kept higher tariffs at bay. Economists, however, called for further policy support to bolster domestic demand and broad economic growth. Retail sales grew 3.7% in 2025 from a year earlier, lagging behind the overall economic growth and a 5.9% expansion in industrial output. At a press briefing on Monday, Yang Mu, an official at the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said Beijing will step up efforts to boost household spending on cars, home appliances, and electronic goods, while targeting consumption in the services sector.

    "body": "USA Rare Earth CEO Barbara Humpton spoke with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick one month after taking the helm at the critical minerals startup, pitching its assets to the federal government. Humpton's November 2025 conversation with Lutnick would ultimately lead to a proposed deal that will provide USA Rare Earth with about $1.6 billion in funding, subject to certain conditions, and a U.S. government equity stake in the company. The CEO, in an exclusive interview with CNBC's Brian Sullivan on Monday, gave rare insight into how the federal government plans equity stakes in mining companies and aims to reduce U.S. dependence on China. \"One of my first objectives was to make sure the U.S. government understood the assets we have under management, so they could begin to see how that fits into the various issues they are so urgently working on,\" Humpton told CNBC in the interview. Seasoned executive Humpton, who took the reins at USA Rare Earth in October, is a seasoned executive who led Siemens USA for seven years. She was also an executive at defense contractors Booz Allen Hamilton and Lockheed Martin earlier in her career. The deal disclosed on Monday briefly sent USA Rare Earth's stock soaring 29% before it settled back to about a 7% gain.  The agreement could turn USA Rare Earth into a second leg of the rare earth supply chain that the Trump administration is building. The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP Materials last summer that included an equity stake, price floor and long-term agreement to buy a specific amount of rare earth minerals and magnets. The proposed deal with USA Rare Earth does not include a price floor or offtake agreement. USA Rare Earth is planning to commission a magnet manufacturing facility in the first quarter of 2026 in Stillwater, Oklahoma and start commercial mining at a rare earth deposit called Round Top, in Sierra Blanca, Texas, in late 2028.  Lutnick asked during the November conversation what would it take for USA Rare Earth to go faster and widen its plans, Humpton said. An interagency meeting was then held with the company, she said.\"We went to work immediately,\" the CEO said. \"Actually, the Department of Commerce led an all-of-government effort. We had a really first-of-its-kind meeting at the Pentagon with both the Department of War, the Department of Energy and Commerce themselves.\" The Commerce Department's Chips and Science Act team then \"switched into high gear to make sure that we moved at warp speed to understand how to scale up this business and to see the transformative opportunity ahead of us,\" Humpton said. The U.S. is \"taking an economic interest in the business, not a governance interest,\" said Humpton, a Wake Forest math major. The Commerce Department has tied the deal to USA Rare Earth achieving key milestones. USA Rare Earth first had to secure at least $500 million in funding from private sources. The company ended up surpassing that goal with $1.5 billion of private investment in public equity (PIPE) funding, Humpton said. The federal government will closely track USA Rare Earth's progress on its business plan as it disburses the money in stages, she said. \"If we don't progress with our business, then we won't receive funding, but as we do progress, we'll be supported by the American people to ensure we quickly build these assets that are needed for our economic security,\" Humpton told CNBC. Manufacturing challengesBut USA Rare Earth will face challenges in ramping up its manufacturing facility and building a mine. Round Top has been a target of investor speculation for decades but has never been developed into a commercial facility.USA Rare Earth cautioned investors on Monday that there is a risk it may not be able to turn Round Top \"into a producing mine.\" The project \"may be delayed, or may not result in the commercial extraction of minerals,\" the company said in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Humpton, however, was confident during the interview in the eventual development of Round Top. She said the mineral extraction method has advanced, and USA Rare Earth's team has progressed from simulation to bench testing to piloting, she said. \"We know that the chemistry works, and now we are building up our demonstration facility,\" the CEO said. \"So through the early part of this year, you'll be able to see the results as we bring samples from the mountain and actually process them,\" she said.

    "body": "Lujiazui Business Districk in Pudong, Shanghai, China.Liqun Liu | Construction Photography | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesAsian equity markets are attracting global investors, with a surge in initial public offerings, rising cross-border flows, and accelerating deal activity underscoring the region's growing importance in global capital markets, according to senior executives at JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.\"It's unbelievable what activity we're seeing [in Asia],\" Sjoerd Leenart, JPMorgan's Asia Pacific CEO, said on CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" Monday, adding that a significant share of IPO volumes last year came from the region. IPO proceeds in Asia Pacific also more than doubled last year, according to EY data, with seven out of the top 10 global deals happening in the region.\"We see this [activity] in the M&A markets … but also in the equity markets, and it's actually quite widespread,\" Leenart said.The strong inflows at the start of the year follow a robust 2025, when several Asian equity benchmarks outperformed the U.S.The MSCI AC Asia Pacific index, which tracks over 1,000 large- and mid-cap stocks across 13 regional markets, has hit multiple records this year, having gained more than 25% in 2025. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have also hit all-time highs in recent days. According to data from Goldman Sachs, foreign inflows into South Korean markets have been healthy, with Korea-focused mutual funds seeing about $1.3 billion in net inflows this year as of mid-January.Similarly, daily turnover across China's Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing stock exchanges hit record this month, prompting regulators to tighten margin financing rules.watch nowIn 2025, Asia-Pacific was the largest region by IPO proceeds, according to a recent study by EY. The region saw a 106% surge in proceeds compared with 2024, with India remaining the world's top active listing destination by deal count.\"China, Hong Kong have been a big part of that. And it's fantastic to see the market confidence coming back,\" said Leenart.\"That positive trend from 2025 I think, is likely to set through in 2026,\" Leenart added. \"The Chinese are doing everything to continue to stimulate the economy, and that's what people are betting on.\"The renewed interest in Asia comes as investors reassess how businesses and markets are functioning amid persistent geopolitical uncertainty. Kevin Sneader, Goldman Sachs' APAC ex-Japan president, told CNBC that markets have become more adept at operating through volatility rather than waiting for it to pass.\"China, India, Japan, Korea. Very much on the attention of international investors,\" he said.\"It is true to say there's a lot of renewed interest in Asia and renewed interest in China. Part of that has come from resilience and indeed, the impressive way in which technology has been developing in this part of the world,\" Sneader said, highlighting South Korean markets and its semiconductor companies as a key beneficiary.Technology firms Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix together account for over 30% of the entire Kospi index, data from Yuanta Securities showed. SK Hynix soared 274% in 2025, and has advanced 20% so far this year, as per LSEG data. Samsung Electronics skyrocketed 125% last year and has gone on to advance 30% year to date.Goldman Sachs expects Chinese equities to rise about 20% this year. It has also lifted its 12-month target for Taiwan's TAIEX to 34,600 from 32,400, implying 8% upside citing stronger-than-expected earnings growth as AI demand boosts the outlook and investment plans of the TSMC — the world's largest chipmaker.Goldman said rising capital spending at TSMC and sustained tightness in advanced chips are lifting profit forecasts across Taiwan's broader semiconductor and hardware supply chain.Late Monday,  President Donald Trump said that he was increasing tariffs on imported autos, pharma, and lumber from South Korea from 15% to 25% because of a delay in that country's legislature approving a trade deal with the United States reached last summer.While some auto stocks fell, South Korea's Kospi was trading 0.6%.\"Tariffs are a part of life. I think business leaders are learning to live with them and understand that,\" Sneader said a day earlier. \"In that context, what really matters is how their businesses perform, and for investors, how you factor that into your decision making.\"— CNBC's Emily Tan contributed to this story.",

    "body": "A shopper carries a Nike bag in the Union Square neighborhood of San Francisco, Jan. 21, 2026.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNike is cutting 775 employees as the company looks to boost its bottom line and accelerate its use of \"automation,\" CNBC has learned. The layoffs, which are in addition to the 1,000 corporate job cuts the company announced last summer, primarily impact distribution center roles in Tennessee and Mississippi, where the sneaker giant operates large warehouses, people familiar with the matter said. In a statement to CNBC, Nike said the layoffs primarily affect its U.S. distribution operations and are designed to \"reduce complexity, improve flexibility, and build a more responsive, resilient, responsible, and efficient operation.\"\"We're taking steps to strengthen and streamline our operations so we can move faster, operate with greater discipline, and better serve athletes and consumers,\" Nike said in the statement. \"We are sharpening our supply chain footprint, accelerating the use of advanced technology and automation, and investing in the skills our teams need for the future.\" It is unclear how many total U.S. distribution jobs Nike has. The company added the cuts are part of Nike's goal to get back to \"long-term, profitable growth\" and improve margins.As the use of AI and automation sweeps across corporate America, distribution center jobs are expected to take a hit. Last year, UPS announced plans to cut 48,000 roles — in part because of more automation at its facilities. It's unclear how exactly Nike plans to expand automation at its distribution centers and how much of a role that's playing in its 775 job cuts.The layoffs come as CEO Elliott Hill works to turn around Nike following years of slowing sales and shrinking margins. The struggles came after former top executive John Donahoe pursued a direct selling strategy that prioritized the retailer's stores and websites over wholesale partners. watch nowAs part of that strategy, Nike's distribution centers — and staff within those facilities — ballooned, but they don't have the volume to support those staffing levels, the people familiar with the matter said. Under Hill, Nike has been working to woo back wholesale partners, clean out stale inventory and reignite innovation. When reporting earnings for the fiscal second quarter in December, Nike said its net income had fallen 32% as it contended with tariffs, costs associated with its turnaround and a slowdown in its key China market. ",

    "body": "BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping walk to a room for a bilateral meeting at Gimhae Air Base on October 30, 2025 in Busan, South Korea. Andrew Harnik | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has widened his tariff playbook, unleashing a string of warnings and policy moves that affect Beijing's interests without directly escalating tariffs on Chinese goods. But analysts are hopeful that the recent geopolitical turmoil is unlikely to unravel the delicate U.S.-China trade truce, as Beijing appears to be betting that Trump's threats will not be enforced in ways that meaningfully harm China. Both sides are seeking to keep plans on track for an upcoming leaders meeting in April.    \"Beijing is watching,\" but is likely to respond cautiously to Trump's latest tariff threats, said Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation. She said Trump is unlikely to follow through on threats, such as imposing 100% tariffs on Canada, or on many of his other warnings to trade partners.\"There is no reason to provoke any other reaction from Washington at this time [as] both the U.S. and China are trying to maintain the fragile truce through Trump's planned visit to China in April,\" Elms added.Gabriel Wildau, managing director at consultancy firm Teneo, said Chinese leaders may doubt Trump will follow through on his latest tariff threats, given that he has largely retreated from earlier measures after backlash from financial markets and the business community.Trump's expanding playbookOver the past month, the Trump administration has seized control of Venezuelan oil flows, a crucial source of crude for China, and threatened a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran, a move that could hit Beijing as Tehran's largest oil customer. Trump had also threatened to take over Greenland, raising concern in Beijing, which has sought to develop Arctic shipping routes and has shown interest in the island's rare-earth resources. The American president later backed away from threats of force and tariffs but said there was \"the framework of a future deal.\"Canada has emerged as the latest flashpoint. Trump warned he would impose a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moved forward with a trade deal with China, in a stark contrast to his previous comments that such a deal could be \"a good thing.\" \"'Never interrupt your adversary when he is making a mistake' appears to be the guiding principle [for China].\" Gabriel WildauManaging Director of TeneoPrime Minister Mark Carney reached a trade deal with China — Canada's second largest trading partner after the U.S. — following his trip to Beijing earlier this month. Under the deal, Ottawa would roll back 100% tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles while Beijing would lift retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola seeds and meal. Trump's tone on the Canada-China deal shifted after Carney's speech at Davos, when he urged middle-power nations to band together against coercive tactics by major powers. Carney later said Canada has no plans to pursue a free trade agreement with Beijing, framing the latest deal as limited in scope. Trump appeared to make it clear that \"if you go too far in the China direction, we're going to be really rough on you,\" said Kurt Tong, managing director of The Asia Group, as officials prepare for an upcoming renegotiation of the U.S.-Canada-Mexico free trade agreement. Beijing said that the trade agreement with Canada was \"not directed at any third party\" and aligned with the two countries' shared interests. Chinese leaders may welcome the opening created by Carney’s engagement and trade deal, but see limits to how far Canada can pivot away from its deep ties with Washington, said David Meale, Head of Eurasia Group's China practice. Beijing's calculationsChinese officials have sought to project stability in ties with Washington against the backdrop of rising tensions in recent weeks. Dong Yan, China's vice minister of commerce, said in a press briefing Monday that the two sides have maintained regular communication since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea in October. China is willing to work with the U.S. to manage differences and deepen cooperation to ensure a stable and healthy bilateral relationship, Yan said, while stressing the relationship must be based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation. Both sides appear to have adapted to a world in which they \"lob hand grenades at each other – or at least threaten to – without disrupting plans for the two leaders to meet,\" said Stephen Olson, a visiting senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. It is in the best interests of both sides to keep the April meeting on track, he added.  watch nowChina's restrained response also reflects efforts to strengthen its position against the U.S. while reassuring global leaders that its ties with Washington remain stable, as Beijing hosts a fresh round of foreign leaders.Several world leaders have visited China this year, including Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin and South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung. Xi met Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Tuesday, while U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to visit China this week, marking the first visit by a British leader in eight years. Separately, Xi said in a phone call with Indian President Droupadi Murmu on Monday that Beijing and New Delhi were \"good neighbors, friends and partners,\" calling for deeper cooperation.There have been few signs that Beijing plans concrete policy responses — such as sanctions, trade restrictions, or military deployments — to counter Trump's recent broadside, Wildau said. \"Beijing's overarching strategy appears to be maximizing global distrust of the U.S. through commentary highlighting perceived U.S. bullying, while presenting China in contrasting terms as supportive of restraint, multilateralism, free trade, and win-win cooperation,\" said Wildau. He added that China is able to do so without directly undermining the ongoing detente with the U.S.  \"'Never interrupt your adversary when he is making a mistake' appears to be the guiding principle [for China,]\" he noted.",

    "body": "Meta's 5-gigawatt \"Hyperion\" data center under construction in Richland Parish, Louisiana, on January 9, 2026.MetaThe popular narrative that artificial intelligence is the engine keeping the U.S. economy alive appears to be overstated, according to recent analyses. The AI boom has reshaped market valuations, driven large investments and record bond issuance to finance data centers, and heavily influenced gross domestic product, or GDP, especially in early 2025. This led many economists and market participants to suggest AI investment was the savior of an otherwise-stagnant domestic economy. However, a January report from MRB Partners U.S. economic strategist Prajakta Bhide reveals that consumption was the most crucial driver of U.S. GDP growth last year, which is usually the case in periods of economic expansion. AI-related capital expenditures were the second-biggest driver, she said. \"AI is an important part of the growth story, but it's not the only part of the growth story. That's a narrative that's out there, that if we didn't have the AI capex, GDP would have slumped last year. And that's simply not true,\" Bhide said in an interview with CNBC. \"Still, it's the U.S. consumer that continues to drive the expansion.\" Given that a lot of high-tech equipment is imported, AI's GDP value is smaller than one might suspect, Bhide said. GDP is comprised of four components: consumption, investment, government spending and net exports. Imports don't count given that GDP measures domestic production.Bhide found that without making any adjustment for imports, AI-related components seem to have added around 90 basis points, or 0.9%, to real GDP growth on average between the first quarter to the third quarter of 2025, or a little under 40% of average real GDP growth over the period. When adjusted for the real imports of computers, peripherals and parts, semiconductors and related devices, and telecom equipment — considered AI-related equipment — then the net average contribution of AI-related investments is smaller, between 40 and 50 basis points, or about 20%-25% of real GDP growth between the first and third quarters, her research shows.Also, even though data centers get a lot of headline attention, Bhide said that it was investments in software and computers that were AI's most important contributions to GDP growth in 2025.\"Although a negative shock to the optimism around A.I. implies a risk to GDP growth, the more realistic (and smaller) estimate of A.I.'s growth impact after adjusting for imports dispels the popular notion that the U.S. economy would falter without it,\" Bhide wrote in the Jan. 8 report. \"Without an A.I. boom, there would have certainly been less GDP growth last year, but there would also be fewer imports, so that overall real growth would still have been decent, above 1.5%, due to solid personal consumption.\" Bespoke Investment Group in December similarly dispelled notions of AI contributions to GDP in a post on X, publishing a chart titled: \"A unique Q1 created vastly over-stated 'AI share of Economy' perceptions.\" The firm found that in the second and third quarters of 2025, categories linked to artificial intelligence spending accounted for just 15% of quarterly GDP growth, with their share of overall GDP coming out less than 5% overall.There is not yet an official final number for 2025 U.S. GDP growth given that annual revisions come out later, and the quarterly results show a mixed picture in a year dominated by strong AI investment, consumer demand and headwinds such as volatile U.S. tariff policies. Real GDP increased at a much higher-than-expected annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter of 2025. GDP rose at a 3.3% annualized pace in the second quarter, also stronger than estimated. Meanwhile, first-quarter GDP shrank at a 0.3% annualized pace, marking the first negative quarterly growth since the start of 2022.Support for a resilient economy aheadBhide's research underscores the importance of consumer spending as a major leg of economic expansion. Looking ahead, she expects resilient consumption to continue in 2026 despite slower income growth and rising wealth concentration among top U.S. earners. \"You do have the support coming from the fiscal side, and that gives you a little bit of an offset for the aggregate income growth being not as maybe as strong as last year. ... The U.S. consumer's still, in our view, in good shape,\" Bhide told CNBC. \"The argument that only the rich are driving consumption and that somehow makes consumption vulnerable ... we don't find a lot of evidence for that. I don't think the hollowing out of consumption is that much of a cyclical risk,\" she added.Bhide expects economic growth this year also will be supported by further AI investments, Federal Reserve rate cuts and a stabilization in the U.S. unemployment rate that has been aided by a collapse in immigration. She remains watchful of quarterly productivity statistics and the pace of job creation. ",

    "body": "A screengrab from a video obtained by Reuters shows a law enforcement officer spraying irritants at a man identified as Alex Pretti, before he was fatally shot when federal agents were trying to detain him in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., January 24, 2026.ReutersOn Saturday, Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse and U.S. citizen, was shot and killed by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis. There's a wide gap between what Americans have seen of the shooting and what federal officials are telling them.Soon after the shooting, Department of Homeland Security officials rushed to defend the officers involved, claiming the victim \"approached U.S. Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun\" and that when federal agents attempted to disarm him, \"the suspect violently resisted.\"DHS Secretary Kristi Noem defended the Border Patrol agent who shot Pretti, saying in a news conference that the agent fired \"defensive\" shots after the victim violently brandished a gun. \"The officers attempted to disarm this individual, but the armed suspect reacted violently,\" Noem said.In a separate news conference, Greg Bovino, Border Patrol commander at large, claimed Pretti may have wanted to do \"maximum damage\" and \"massacre law enforcement.\"But videos taken by bystanders, filmed from several different angles, tell a different story. In the first video verified by CNBC, protesters can be heard honking their horns on an urban Minneapolis street, while the video's author records through a car windshield as the car moves.watch nowAt 15 seconds, the camera pans to the left to show a man on the side of the street wearing a brown jacket and tan pants (believed to be Alex Pretti) holding up what appears to be a phone while being confronted by two federal agents. Pretti steps backward away from the confrontation while appearing to yell at an agent.  At 21 seconds, the person filming the video drives past the confrontation, and the camera swings to the other side of the street as someone in the car yells profanities.  In a second video verified by CNBC, protesters can be heard blowing whistles and honking their horns at federal agents in a video on a cold Minneapolis street. At seven seconds, the video shows a man dressed in tactical gear believed to be a federal agent shove a woman wearing a brown jacket and black leggings in the back near the side of the street. She doesn't fall but moves several feet away because of the shove.  watch nowThe camera briefly shifts to the middle of the street before going back to the confrontation on the side at 11 seconds. The agent is face-to-face with one woman wearing a long cream jacket and charcoal pants. Next to her is a man in a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti, and next to him is the woman in brown jacket and black leggings who was shoved seconds ago.  At 12 seconds in the second video, the agent shoves the woman wearing the cream jacket to the ground. Pretti puts himself between the agent and the woman, who is on her back in a snowbank on the side of the road. At 14 seconds, the agent starts spraying Pretti in the face with a chemical agent. Pretti covers his face and turns away from the officer. Other agents wearing vests approach the confrontation. At 22 seconds, several agents are struggling with Pretti, attempting to bring him to the ground. He appears to fall to the ground, and at 28 seconds you see one agent apparently swinging a punch at his head while Pretti is down.  Read more CNBC politics coverageAlex Pretti killing: Minnesota CEOs, including UnitedHealth, Target, call for 'immediate deescalation'After Minneapolis shooting, government hurtles toward shutdown over DHS fundingTrump threatens to impose 100% tariff if Canada makes deal with ChinaTrump withdraws 'Board of Peace' invitation to Carney in widening riftHouse passes final funding bills 8 days before shutdown, Senate now will considerGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosAt this point, bystanders are recording, and whistles are making noise constantly. By 38 seconds, at least six agents seem to have restrained the man believed to be Pretti on the ground.One agent appears to take a weapon from Pretti and quickly walks away while holding the gun. A gunshot is heard at 40 seconds. It is unclear if the man holding the gun fired the shot. Following the first shot, more gunshots are heard in quick succession.  In a third video verified by CNBC, taken by someone on the street near the incident, protesters are blowing whistles at federal agents. watch nowAt 25 seconds, a man wearing a brown jacket and tan pants believed to be Pretti is holding his hand up in the middle of the street. He waves a car past and then starts walking. The camera then shifts away for a moment to a snowbank. A protester can be heard shouting, \"What is wrong with you?\" At 33 seconds into the third video, Pretti has his arm around a woman in a dark green jacket and black leggings, apparently attempting to help her. He steps in front of a federal agent closing in on a woman who is on her back in the snowbank on the side of the road.  At 40 seconds, Pretti has his hand up to a federal agent who is spraying him with some kind of chemical agent. Two agents drag him onto his back and more agents join in a circle around the man in tan pants. A struggle takes place on the ground, with six agents surrounding the man in tan pants. At 60 seconds, one of the agents can be seen stepping back from the confrontation and he draws his gun and points it at Pretti. At 1:01, a single shot can be heard, followed by several in quick succession. The man on the ground, Pretti, slumps down.Amid screams, at 1:04, another flurry of gunshots can be heard.At no point in any of the three videos shown here does Alex Pretti brandish a weapon or appear to threaten federal immigration agents before the confrontation begins, as was claimed by DHS Secretary Noem and others in the Trump administration. One video also appears to show a federal officer removing a weapon from Pretti while he's being restrained by agents on the ground before any shots are fired. Pretti is a lawful gun owner and owns a permit for his weapon.",

The European Union is exploring a security and defence partnership with India, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said on February 28 before meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi. (Photo by Money SHARMA / AFP) (Photo by MONEY SHARMA/AFP via Getty Images)          Money Sharma | Afp | Getty ImagesIndia and the European Union on Monday closed a \"landmark\" free trade agreement, touted as the 'mother of all deals,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during a speech at the India Energy Week on Tuesday.The FTA with the EU, which represents about 25% of global GDP and about a third of global trade, will also complement India's deals with Britain and the European Free Trade Association, Modi said.The agreement will forge a market of 2 billion people at a time when trade ties are being tested amid rising geopolitical tensions.\"I congratulate our colleagues associated with every sector, such as textiles, gems and Jewelry, leather and shoes. This deal will prove to be very supportive to these sectors,\" Modi said in a speech in Hindi, translated by CNBC. Modi and EU President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to make a joint statement at the India-EU summit in New Delhi, later in the day, revealing the details of the deal that had been in the making for nearly two decades. Trade talks between the two sides were relaunched in 2022 and the deal has been long time in the making due to \"mutually sensitive\" issues such as agriculture and automotive. \"India and European union can both be very protectionist,\" Hosuk Lee Makiyama, director of European Centre for International Political Economy, told CNBC.Neither the EU nor India have secured a large trade deal which could impact their economic growth, especially as U.S. and China are closed off for a deal, so this deal will be \"one of the best they can get,\" he said.For New Delhi, which has been facing the brunt of punitive U.S. tariffs, this deal could be a much-needed shot in the arm. Since Trump imposed 50% tariffs on the Asian economy in August last year, it has been looking at alternative markets for its exports and has entered into trade deals with several countries.This is India's fourth major trade deal since the U.S., India's biggest export market and a major trading partner, imposed steep tariffs in August. It has entered into a trade pact with the U.K., Oman and New Zealand.According to European Commission data, goods traded between India and the EU in 2024 amounted to over 120 billion euros (about $140 billion), making the bloc New Delhi's largest trading partner. Machinery and appliances, chemicals, base metals, mineral products and textiles are New Delhi top exports to the bloc. For the year ended March 2025, India-goods trade stood at $136 billion.India is the ninth largest trading partner of the EU, accounting for 2.4% of the the bloc's total trade in goods in 2024, far behind major partners like the U.S. (17.3%), China (14.6%), or the U.K. (10.1%). The EU's main exports to India include machinery and appliances, transport equipment, and chemicals.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan. 20 that the bloc was set on \"choosing fair trade over tariffs. Partnership over isolation. Sustainability over exploitation.\"India's total exports to six major EU markets — Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, France and Belgium — were $43.8 billion in the 9-month ending December compared to $65.88 billion for the U.S. alone.Experts have said that even though India's deal with the EU is a major milestone, it will not replace the need for an India-U.S. deal.In 2024, India's goods trade surplus with the U.S. was $45.8 billion, while for the EU it was substantially lower at $25.8 billion.",

    "body": "Silas Stein | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesShares of Zoom closed up 11% on Monday after analysts at Baird estimated that the company's investment in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic could be worth between $2 billion to $4 billion, depending on dilution assumptions. In May 2023, Anthropic announced a partnership with Zoom and revealed that Zoom Ventures had invested in the company. The companies did not disclose the value of the investment, but Zoom reported making $51 million in \"strategic investments\" that quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Baird's analysts estimate that all, or at least the \"vast majority,\" of that investment went to Anthropic. The startup is currently valued at $350 billion, suggesting Zoom could see a return of roughly 78 times its investment, the analysts said. \"While we (and the market) have been primarily focused on ZM's ability to gradually reaccelerate revenue growth and capture AI opportunities, the quieter, hidden gem might be its $51 million investment in Anthropic in 2023,\"  the analysts wrote in a Monday note. Zoom exploded in popularity at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic as workers turned to the video-conferencing platform to stay in touch with colleagues, friends and family. But as the pandemic subsided and many workers returned to in-person roles, Zoom's stock has tumbled from its highs.The company's investment in Anthropic could prove to be a bright spot, Baird's analysts said.\"ZM is literally invested in Anthropic's Claude success, and as Anthropic IPO rumors accelerate, the investment could become even more meaningful,\" the analysts wrote.WATCH: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei on AI race: Focused on making our models as smart and capable as possiblewatch now",

Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's ruling Democratic Party said it would pass a special act on the U.S. trade deal by end- February, according to Yonhap, after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened higher tariffs on South Korean exports. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said he was raising tariffs on South Korean exports to 25% from the current 15%, citing a delay in the country's parliament approving the Washington-Seoul trade deal agreed in July last year. Spokesperson of the ruling Democratic Party Kim Hyun-jung said Trump was likely referring to the Special Act on Strategic Investment Management between Korea and the United States, according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean, submitted to the country's parliament last November.The bill aims to establish a state-run investment corporation to manage Seoul's planned $350 billion investment pledge to Washington. Kim said that five related bills have been submitted to the National Assembly, and are scheduled to be reviewed, adding that \"the fact that both the Democratic Party of Korea and the People Power Party have proposed these bills will likely expedite their passage.\"The ruling DP currently holds 162 seats in the 300 seat National Assembly with four vacant seats, while the PPP holds 107.  \"What is needed now is to quickly confirm the intent and facts of the U.S statement and correct any misunderstandings,\" she said. South Korea's presidential office said that it had called a meeting to review and discuss responses to Trump's announcement on Tuesday, and reiterated its commitment to implementing the tariff agreement. Earlier in the day, the office said it had not received any official notice or explanation from the U.S. regarding the announcement, according to local media outlet Yonhap. South Korea's finance ministry said that it will keep the U.S. informed on the legislative process, while Seoul's trade ministry said that industry minister Kim Jung-kwan will visit Washington for talks on the matter, Yonhap reported.\"It is time for the government and the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly to join forces. I look forward to the People Power Party's bipartisan cooperation,\" Kim said.South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia plunged in early trade following Trump's threats, but later pared losses. Hyundai last traded 0.1% down, and Kia was down 1.16%. The broader Kospi was up 1.9%, while the small-cap Kosdaq index climbed 0.89%. Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

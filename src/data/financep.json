    "body": "<div><div><p>The U.S. government <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">shut down Wednesday</a>, putting hundreds of thousands of federal workers at risk of losing pay.</p><p>About 750,000 federal employees are expected to be furloughed each day, <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-09/61773-Government-Shutdown.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">according to the Congressional Budget Office</a>. Hundreds of thousands more are required to keep working without pay until funding resumes, based on federal agency estimates, including essential staff like air traffic controllers and border patrol agents.</p><p>The shutdown was triggered early Wednesday after the Senate failed to pass a short-term funding bill. The measure, which would have kept the government open through Nov. 20, fell short in a 55-45 vote, below the 60 needed.</p><p>All but two Democratic senators opposed the bill. Led by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/09/29/shutdown-democrats-republicans-funding/\" target=\"_blank\">Democrats have been pushing</a> for an extension of expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of about $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts included in President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill.</p><p>In turn, Trump and Vice President J.D Vance have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/government-shutdown-trump-live-updates.html\">threatened permanent job cuts</a>. Last week, the Office of Management and Budget sent a memo directing federal agencies to prepare layoff plans for programs \"not consistent with the president's priorities\" if funding lapses, according to the memo <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/read-the-full-memo-directing-federal-agencies-to-weigh-mass-layoffs-if-the-government-shuts-down\" target=\"_blank\">published by PBS</a>.</p><p>Labor unions have <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/30/labor-unions-sue-omb-opm-00589170\" target=\"_blank\">already sued</a> over the move, arguing it violates federal law.</p></div><h2><a></a>What a shutdown means and who is affected</h2><div><p>Each year, Congress must approve funding for the government's new fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. A shutdown occurs when lawmakers miss that deadline. The last time it happened was a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/01/nx-s1-5559267/government-shutdown-length-history\" target=\"_blank\">34-day shutdown in 2018</a>, during Trump's first term.</p><p>In a shutdown, agencies pause many operations and split workers into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Excepted employees</strong> who must keep working without pay, commonly in roles tied to safety and national security.</li><li><strong>Non-excepted employees</strong> who are placed on unpaid leave and told not to report to work.</li></ul><p>Federal employees are guaranteed back pay once the shutdown ends, but <a href=\"https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2025/government-shutdown-who-gets-paid\" target=\"_blank\">contractors are not</a>.</p><p>The shutdown's effects will be most visible in the government's largest agencies. At the Department of Homeland Security, more than 250,000 employees are required to keep working without pay, including border patrol officers and TSA agents, according to its contingency plan. </p><p>The Department of Health and Human Services expects to furlough about 32,460 workers, or 41% of its staff,<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/us-government-shutdown-furlough-41-health-agency-workers-2025-09-29/\" target=\"_blank\"> Reuters reports</a>. And at the FAA, more than 11,000 employees are being sent home while about 13,000 air traffic controllers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/faa-would-furlough-11000-employees-us-government-shutdown-2025-09-30/\" target=\"_blank\">continue working without pay</a>.</p><p>Most social programs will continue because they're funded outside the annual budget process. Social Security and Medicare benefits will still go out, the Postal Service will keep running and veterans' health care and disability payments will continue. SNAP food assistance is not expected to be affected immediately, though a prolonged shutdown could strain USDA's reserves,<a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/advocacy/government-shutdown-snap-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\"> AARP</a> reports.</p></div><h2><a></a>Guidance for federal workers</h2><div><p>Shutdowns are a considerable disruption, especially for federal employees whose pay status can be unclear. To help them, the Office of Personnel Management maintains the government-wide<a href=\"https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutdown guidance</a> that applies to all federal employees.</p><p>Federal agencies have also posted contingency plans that outline who is furloughed, who must keep working without pay and the procedures employees are expected to follow while operations are scaled back. Below is guidance from some of the agencies with the most employees affected:</p><ul><li>Department of Defense <a href=\"https://media.defense.gov/2025/Sep/27/2003809363/-1/-1/1/CONTINGENCY-PLAN-GUIDANCE-FOR-CONTINUATION-OF-OPERATIONS-IN-THE-ABSENCE-OF-APPROPRIATIONS.PDF\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Department of Veterans Affairs <a href=\"https://department.va.gov/contingency-planning/\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Department of Homeland Security <a href=\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-09/2025_0929_dhs_procedures_related_to_a_lapse_in_appropriations.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown procedures</a></li><li>Department of Justice <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/jmd/media/1377216/dl\" target=\"_blank\">contingency plan</a></li><li>Health and Human Services<a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy-2026-hhs-contingency-staffing-plan/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"> contingency staffing plan</a></li><li>Department of Transportation <a href=\"https://www.transportation.gov/lapse\" target=\"_blank\">shutdown guidance</a></li><li>State Department<a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DOS-Lapse-Guidance-updated-29-September-2025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> guidance</a></li></ul><p>For contract workers wondering if they'll get paid, the National Law Review <a href=\"https://natlawreview.com/article/how-government-contractors-should-prepare-and-deal-shutdown\" target=\"_blank\">offers advice</a> on confirming contract status and possible recourse on compensation.</p><p>Beyond that, out-of-work federal workers and contractors might qualify for <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/unemployment-insurance\" target=\"_blank\">state unemployment insurance</a>. Furloughed federal employees access it through the <a href=\"https://oui.doleta.gov/unemploy/docs/factsheet/UCFE_FactSheet.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees program</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, excepted employees have fewer options and often need to rely on personal savings until the shutdown ends.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

It was our military versus insurgents, guerrillas, asymmetric warfare, relatively low-tech fighters in most cases,\" said Darby.</p><p>But war today is more focused on \"great power competition,\" said Mak.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>The battlefield is changing and new technologies are needed ... warfare no longer being limited to land, sea, air. There's also cyber and space domains that have become contested.</p><div><p>Ernestine Fu Mak</p><p>Co-founder, MilVet Angels</p></div></div></blockquote><div><p>\"The focus is more on deterring and competing with [adversaries] in these very high-tech, multi-domain conflicts,\" Mak added. \"The battlefield is changing and new technologies are needed... warfare no longer being limited to land, sea, air. There's also cyber and space domains that have become contested.\"</p><p>Today, some of these Silicon Valley \"neoprimes\" are developing not just weapons, but also dual-use technologies that can be applied both commercially and by militaries.</p><p>\"So things like artificial intelligence and autonomy have broad, sweeping commercial applications, but they're also clearly a force multiplier in a military context,\" said Darby. \"[The] Department of War is rapidly assessing and adopting these dual-use technologies ... they're sending signals to the investment world, to the defense industrial base, that the U.S. government needs these things.\"</p><p>That direction from the government has, in turn, provided a clear and strategic roadmap for both investors and entrepreneurs, said Mak.</p></div><h2><a></a>The 'new guard'</h2><div><p>On Sept. 17, MVA came out of stealth mode after quietly backing some leading defense tech startups since 2021.</p><p>Today, Mak says the syndicate's roughly 250 members include tech founders, Wall Street financiers, company executives, intelligence officials, former military leaders and Navy SEALs. Together, they've <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-neoprime-innovation\" target=\"_blank\">invested in companies</a> like Anduril Industries, Shield AI, Hermeus, Ursa Major and Aetherflux.</p><p>\"Overall, we believe that 'neoprimes' cannot exist in the abstract. They require people — individuals who bring technical expertise, who carry a deep sense of mission, and who contribute complementary voices and talents. Together, this coalition forms what we are convening and calling the 'new guard,'\" said Mak.</p><p>She added that modern national security requires both the \"warrior's insight on the battlefield\" and the \"builder's drive for innovation\".</p><p>\"Working together with engaged, informed patriots whose participation strengthens our defense ecosystem and reinforces the very fabric of national security,\" Mak said.</p><p>Mak and Darby both agree that as new technologies develop and make their way onto battlefields globally, it's changing the way militaries fight, which can also pose new threats.</p><p>\"You're seeing these technologists, these builders ... building defense tech, and the reason why they're doing so, is not to initiate conflict, but rather to create a credible deterrent that discourages aggression,\" said Mak.</p><p>\"No one in defense tech is looking to wage war, rather, it's looking to deter it and wanting adversaries to think twice before threatening peace and stability,\" Mak added.</p></div></div>"

Clary | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke is upbeat on the asset-based finance segment of the private credit market, but warns of \"cracks\" in corporate direct lending, which makes up the bulk of the sector.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/chery-kang/\">Speaking with CNBC's </a>Chery Kang at the annual Milken Asia Summit in Singapore Wednesday, Stracke highlighted the widening gap between the two lending spheres.</p><p>\"There are problems [in corporate private credit] where borrowers are going to their lenders and saying, 'Can I not pay you cash interest now, but basically borrow the interest from you and pay it later?' It's called Payment-in-Kind [PIK], and it's fairly prevalent right now,\" Stracke said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Balance sheet divergence</h2><div><p>He referred to asset-based financing as a \"much healthier\" credit environment.</p><p>\"In asset-based financing — residential mortgages, consumer loans, student loans and auto loans — the economy is strong, households are strong, the consumer is strong, and we really aren't seeing cracks that way,\" he added.</p><p>The widening gap stems from the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which saw consumer borrowers scale back their borrowing and deleverage their household balance sheets, which has helped boost asset-based financing activity. Corporate borrowers, in contrast, have built up their leverage and have \"less clean\" balance sheets.</p><p>In October last year, PIMCO raised more than $2 billion for asset-based specialty financing strategy as part of its continued push into private credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206130-17592796421759279639-41893235216-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759279641&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"'Real cracks' showing in the direct lending market within private credit: PIMCO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Corporate borrowers also face a trade-off in public versus private debt markets, according to Stracke.</p><p>The smaller number of lenders in private markets means it can be easier for borrowers to renegotiate loan terms in the event of loan pressure — albeit with higher costs.</p></div><h2><a></a>Unfolding opportunities</h2><div><p>More liquid bank debt, on the other hand, comes at a much lower cost, though the refinancing process can be trickier.</p><p>\"It's more difficult with a broadly syndicated bank loan or bond,\" Stracke said. \"We're seeing some real problems in the credit markets. There have been some high-profile defaults in the credit markets — in the public markets — where it's very difficult for the company to negotiate with the lenders to preserve value in the company.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, Stracke said that as the Federal Reserve continues on its path of interest rate cuts, and the overall all-in cost of borrowing comes down, particularly in mortgage rates, there will be more opportunities for PIMCO to take advantage of that demand for credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206122-17592776821759277679-41892888085-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759277682&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"We are going to see more IPOs in the first half of next year: Hostplus CEO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, David Elia, CEO of Australian superannuation fund Hostplus, said institutional investors in search of portfolio diversification are increasingly drawn to the private markets space – but said regulation should be focused on the retail wealth space.</p><p>Elia told CNBC at the Milken Asia summit that any push for tougher regulation of private markets should center around \"mom-and-dad\" investors who are attracted to the diversifying benefits of the asset class, rather than sophisticated institutional investors.</p><p>\"There are probably about 19,000 companies that are listed on global markets. There are 140,000 private companies who generate in excess of $100 million in U.S. revenue,\" Elia said.</p><p>\"As long-term institutional investors, you will not see the level of concentration, if you're genuine about diversification, in listed markets. Therefore, it's going to drive you towards the unlisted sector, largely around private equity-style types of investments.\"</p><p>He also predicted more IPOs in the coming months.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Nicole Teo and Asriel Chua contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>"

Sentiment from Democrats, who had typically had better views of Disney before the past two weeks, soured more strongly than Republicans. Though both groups showed significant declines.</p><p>\"The last two weeks for Disney have been as eventful to say the least, and have been equally controversial,\" analyst James Heaney wrote in a Thursday note to clients.

For Disney+ specifically, the jump was much smaller, which the analyst said bodes well from a business perspective for CEO Bob Iger.</p><p>\"This is clearly a PR hit for Disney,\" Heaney said. \"But the data implies a smaller impact on Disney+ than the brand as a whole, which may limit the amount of streaming churn.\"</p><p>Disney shares have dropped 6% over the last month, pulling the stock into the red for 2025.

Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.</p><p>Heinrich, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Thursday, \"Minutes before the news of these cancelled projects broke, I had just left lunch with [Energy] Secretary [Chris] Wright and he had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state — projects that affect real jobs and real families.\"</p><p>\"That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions,\" Heinrich said in a statement.</p><p>\"The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives,\" he said. This Administration is choosing to punish ordinary families just to settle scores — and that is as dangerous as it is un-American.\"</p><p>The Energy Department, in a statement, said that the cancellations followed \" a thorough, individualized financial review,\" which \"determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.\"</p><p>Energy Secretary Wright said that many of the awards were \"rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.\"</p><p>\"President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,\" Write said, adding that the cancellations \"deliver on that commitment.\"</p><p>The department said that of the 321 financial awards terminated, \"26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day,\" with those awards alone valued at more than $3.1 billion.</p><p>But Wells, the NRDC advocate, said that despite the Energy Department's claims, \"there's been a confusing lack of transparency in this process of cancelling\" funding.</p><p>Wells contrasted that to the Biden administration's vetting of the projects before they were approved. He noted that the department itself had not publicly released a list of the cancelled projects.</p><p>The Energy Department did not respond to CNBC's request for that list.</p><p>Wells pointed out that several Democratic members of Congress, including New Mexico's Heinrich, in early September had raised concerns about the influence of political appointees in the Energy Department to cancel funding of projects in May.</p><p>\"This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent,\" Heinrich and two other Democrats, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, and New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., wrote in a letter to Wright. \"It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards.\"</p><p>\"These programs are not optional,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them.\"</p><p>Ken Lovett, the senior communications advisor on energy and environment for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, said that the funding cuts \"come as no surprise given the Trump administration's full-on assault on clean energy.\"</p><p>\"Whether it's blocking offshore wind, cutting federal incentives for electric vehicles and solar energy, or rolling back clean air and clean water standards, the Trump administration's attempt to rollback the progress we have made puts New Yorkers' well-being and safety at risk,\" Lovett said in a statement.</p><p>\"We will not go back.\"</p><p><em><strong>— CNBC's </strong></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/emily-wilkins/\"><em><strong>Emily Wilkins</strong></em></a><em><strong>, Ashlee Trujillo and </strong></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/mary-catherine-wellons/\"><em><strong>MC Wellons</strong></em></a><em><strong> contributed to this story.</strong></em></p></div></div>"

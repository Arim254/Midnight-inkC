Comparatively, its competitors <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BJ/\">BJ's</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT/\">Sam's Club</a><span><span></span></span></span> grew their apparel businesses by about 28% and 21%, respectively.</p><p>While the apparel segment is still a relatively small portion of Costco's overall sales, it brings in more than some of the world's largest apparel retailers like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ANF/\">Abercrombie & Fitch</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Old Navy, whose fiscal 2024 sales were $4.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.</p><p>Costco has driven its success in clothing by offering popular brands like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/COLM/\">Columbia</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GAP/\">Gap</a><span><span></span></span></span>, along with its private label Kirkland Signature.</p><p>Still, its clothing selection is limited compared to stores like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT/\">Target</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Walmart. Experts say that part of Costco's appeal is never quite knowing what you may find shopping there. </p><p>Its procurement methods vary, but it primarily works directly with manufacturers and secures licensing partnerships with major brands. Additionally, the company will make \"opportunistic\" purchases, which helps to create that treasure hunt-like shopping experience when a special one-off product is for sale, said Telsey Advisory Group senior managing director Joe Feldman.</p><p>\"Everybody gets excited and tries to go in and buy it. And it's only in a handful of stores,\" said Feldman. \"There could have been a special overrun at a particular vendor, and they sold it to Costco. Other times, they might buy it from another retailer or a third party that may have excess of that item.\"</p><p>Costco has even been known to use well known brands to produce its own private-label products. However, it is typically intentionally unclear when this happens. </p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LULU/\">Lululemon</a><span><span></span></span></span> filed a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/01/lululemon-costco-lawsuit.html\">lawsuit against Costco</a> in June, accusing the warehouse club of \"duping\" its athletic wear. The athleisure company claims that the ambiguity around its manufacturing led consumers to believe that Lululemon was producing products for Costco. Lululemon also alleges the wholesale club did not dispel rumors around this speculation.</p><p>\"It's also been one of the most fantastic advertising campaigns that Costco could hope for, because it's drawn enormous attention to the fact that Costco has all these clothing lines. They have things that may be similar to Lululemon, but that are a much lower cost,\" said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders.</p><p>Regardless of the lawsuit's outcome, it's an indication that major clothing retailers are taking Costco more seriously.</p><p>Costco declined to give an interview or comment to CNBC for this story.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/10/10/how-costco-built-a-nearly-10-billion-clothing-empire.html\">Watch the video to learn more</a> about how Costco has become a major player in the apparel space.</p></div>",

A hearing on the unions' request for a temporary restraining order to block the layoffs is scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco.</p><p>\"These mass firings are illegal and will have devastating effects on the services millions of Americans rely on every day,\" AFSCME President Lee Saunders said <a href=\"https://www.afscme.org/press/releases/2025/afscmes-saunders-these-mass-firings-are-illegal-and-will-have-devastating-effects-on-the-services-millions-of-americans-rely-on-every-day\" target=\"_blank\">in a statement</a>.</p><p>\"Whether it's food inspectors, public safety workers, or the countless other public service workers who keep America running, federal employees should not be bargaining chips in this administration's political games,\" Saunders said.</p><p>The layoffs started four days after <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/06/government-shutdown-trump-hassett-vought.html\">National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett</a> warned in a CNBC interview that could \"start taking sharp measures\" if the shutdown continued due to the lack of a stopgap funding deal approved by Congress.</p><p>Hassett said that \"any government worker who loses their job\" will have Democrats to blame for their layoff.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108208092-17597541151759754111-41971846415-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759754114&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"NEC Director Kevin Hassett: Pres.

They're callously choosing to hurt people — the workers who protect our country, inspect our food, respond when disasters strike. This is deliberate chaos.\" </p><p>\"Here's what's worse: Republicans would rather see thousands of Americans lose their jobs than sit down and negotiate with Democrats to reopen the government,\" Schumer said.</p></div><div><p>Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, in a statement said, \"I strongly oppose OMB Director Russ Vought's attempt to permanently lay off federal workers who have been furloughed due to a completely unnecessary government shutdown caused by Senator Schumer.\"</p><p>\"Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,\" Collins said. \"Arbitrary layoffs result in a lack of sufficient personnel needed to conduct the mission of the agency and to deliver essential programs, and cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.\"</p><p>Since the shutdown began last week, Vought has announced in tweets decisions by the Trump administration to freeze and cut billions of dollars in federal funding for projects in states and cities controlled by Democratic elected officials.</p><p>The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have repeatedly sought to blame Democrats for the government shutdown and any negative fallout from it.</p><p>Democratic senators have largely refused to vote for a Republican stopgap funding plan that would reopen the government, saying that any such resolution must include an agreement to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits.</p><p>Those tax credits lower the cost of Obamacare health insurance plans purchased by millions of Americans from government-run ACA marketplaces.</p><p>Dueling Republican and Democratic funding resolutions failed to pass in the Senate for the seventh time on Thursday.</p><p>The shutdown is expected to continue until at least early next week because the Senate is not due to resume business until Tuesday.</p><p>Although Republicans hold majorities in both the Senate and House, they need the votes of at least some Democratic senators to pass a funding bill because of the 60-vote threshold in the Senate required to avoid filibusters blocking legislation.</p></div></div>",

Friday evening, Trump <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/10/trump-trade-tariffs-china-software.html\">announced</a> on social media that he would put an extra 100% tariff on imports.</p><p>Earnings season kicks off on Tuesday, starting with quarterly results from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BLK/\">Blackrock</a><span><span></span></span></span>, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs. Cramer said all three have had solid runs this year, and they \"aren't exactly in the crosshairs of the trade war.\" He suggested Goldman Sachs might have \"the biggest upside surprise.\" JPMorgan and Citigroup will report that day, and Cramer said he's optimistic about the results from both banks.</p><p>Tuesday also brings earnings from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ/\">Johnson & Johnson</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DPZ/\">Domino's Pizza</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Cramer said he expects the pharmaceutical giant to report the best quarter of the sector, but indicated the pizza maker could miss the estimates.</p><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/\">Bank of America</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MS/\">Morgan Stanley</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ABT/\">Abbott Laboratories</a><span><span></span></span></span> are set to report on Wednesday, and Cramer noted that Morgan Stanley has been surprisingly positive for the last several quarters. He also said Abbott Laboratories is usually reliable.</p><p>Wednesday also brings analyst meetings from Salesforce and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DLTR/\">Dollar Tree</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Cramer noted that both companies' stocks have been under pressure as of late — with Salesforce weighed down by worries about its artificial intelligence offerings and Dollar Tree burdened by new tariffs.</p><p>Trucking giant <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JBHT/\">J.B. Hunt</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL/\">United Airlines</a><span><span></span></span></span> are set to report Wednesday, and Cramer said these two could provide a solid read on the economy as investors largely lack economic data due to the government shutdown.</p><p>On Thursday, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSM/\">Taiwan Semiconductor</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CSX/\">CSX</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SCHW/\">Charles Schwab</a><span><span></span></span></span> will report earnings. Cramer said he expects largely positive figures from Taiwan Semiconductor, which manufactures chips for industry leaders <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a><span><span></span></span></span> and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMD/\">AMD</a><span><span></span></span></span>. Cramer said CSX will likely explain its recent leadership shakeup, while Schwab can give insight to retail participation in the market.</p><p>Friday brings quarterly reports from <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AXP/\">American Express</a><span><span></span></span></span> and oil giant <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SLB/\">SLB</a><span><span></span></span></span>.

That fear skewed higher for younger people, to 29% of Gen Z members and 24% of millennials, it found.</p><p>Putting all your money in cash or bonds may feel safe, because it seems like there's little scope for financial loss — but this is misguided, according to financial advisors.</p><p>\"When you're young, worrying more about downside than upside is probably the biggest mistake,\" said Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management. \"You have to get rich before you focus on preserving your wealth.\"</p></div><p>In fact, young people shouldn't be focused at all on cash positions or bonds in their investment accounts, Brown said. Instead, they should be fully invested in the stock market, he said.</p><h2><a></a>Young investors have time on their side</h2><div><p>It may seem counterintuitive that stocks are generally the safer route for young investors when it comes to building long-term financial security.</p><p>While stocks are generally more volatile than cash and bonds, stocks have also historically outperformed them over long periods — an important factor when it comes to growing wealth and beating inflation, which erodes the value of money over time, experts said.</p><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/07/sp-500-where-to-invest-in-case-of-a-pullback.html\">S&P 500</a>, an index of the largest U.S. stocks, had an average annual return of almost 12%, including dividends, from 1928 through 2024, according to <a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> compiled by Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University.</p><p>By comparison, 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds and corporate bonds had an average annual return of about 5% and 7% over the same period, respectively, the data shows.</p><p>Investors in their 20s and 30s have decades ahead of them for interest to compound and recoup any near-term financial losses from stocks.</p><p>\"When you're a young investor, you have something at your disposal that every professional investor dreams that they can have, which is more time,\" Brown said.</p><p>\"When you appreciate how much time you have, you recognize the benefit of long-term compounding,\" he said. \"Even though you think you're taking more risk by buying and holding [stocks], you're actually taking less risk.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>How to buy and hold stocks</h2><div><p>Fajrul Islam | Moment | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Buying and holding stocks is just one part of the equation — how investors hold them matters a lot, too.</p><p>Investors who are just starting out are generally best served by owning an index fund that tracks the broad stock market, instead of trying to pick individual company stocks that they or analysts think will perform well. The latter strategy is risky, since investors peg their financial outcomes to the success of a handful of stocks.</p><p>Index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds hold a basket of hundreds of stocks that track the broad market. Index funds have <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/05/active-funds-struggle-to-beat-index-funds.html\">historically outperformed most stock pickers over long stretches of time</a> and take a lot of the complexity out of investing, experts said.</p><p>\"If you're going to be self-directed and you're going to do it yourself, I would utilize index [mutual] funds and index ETFs,\" Brown said. \"And until you've got six figures of pure stock market exposure at a low cost, there's really nothing else worth talking about.\"</p></div><div><p>Young investors can start out with a total market index fund, said Christine Benz, director of personal finance and retirement planning for Morningstar.</p><p>An all-stock index fund that provides U.S. and non-U.S. stock exposure, such as the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (<span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VT/\">VT</a><span><span></span></span></span>), is a good \"one-and-done fund\" for young investors, she said.</p><p>A balanced fund or target-date fund may also work well, she said.</p><p>Balanced funds maintain a static asset allocation — that is, the relative mix of assets such as stocks and bonds — over time. A target-date fund is similar, but gradually winds down its stock exposure as investors age.</p><p>Investors should be mindful of the type of account in which they hold their assets, advisors said. For example, it may make more sense to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/vanguards-106-million-tdf-settlement-offers-a-key-lesson-about-taxes.html\">hold certain funds such as a target-date fund in a tax-advantaged retirement account</a> such as a 401(k) or IRA instead of a taxable brokerage account, a type of non-retirement account, to prevent an unexpected tax bill at year-end.</p><p><em>This article is part of CNBC's Let's Get Personal (Finance) video series.

A whopping 57% reported they were considering adding a new residence over the next 12 months, up from 55% in last year's survey.

Tax savings ranked eighth overall behind other factors such as improved security and safety (47%) and better education opportunities (52%). Respondents to the survey could select multiple options. The most popular motives at 67% each were to expand their business to new markets or to gain access to new investment opportunities.

According to the report, French entrepreneurs \"are most content to enjoy their own culture\" as only 39% indicated interest in moving.</p><p>Respondents were most likely to cite Singapore (12%) or the UK (10%) as potential destinations, with Japan and Switzerland tied at 9%. Despite the survey being conducted in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcement in early April, the U.S. was cited by 8% of respondents, the same percentage as last year. However, the U.S. came in fifth in terms of most-desired locations for moving after tying for second place last year.</p><p>This year's report noted that Japan has gained traction with Asian entrepreneurs.</p></div><div><p>Switzerland was the only country where attaining a better quality of life was a bigger draw (57%) than accessing investment opportunities (49%) or expanding a business (48%).

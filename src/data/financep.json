    "body": "Ina Garten is an expert on making major career changes: she built a multimillion-dollar culinary empire after she quit her government job to open a food store.Garten's husband Jeffrey gave her sage advice when she decided to leave her previous career, she told Amy Poehler in a Nov. 25 episode of her podcast \"Good Hang with Amy Poehler.\"\"I said to Jeffrey, I really need to find something else to do. And he said, 'Just pick something fun. Pick something that you think you'd love doing, and if you love it, you'll be really good at it,'\" Garten said.She purchased her first store, Barefoot Contessa, in Westhampton Beach, New York in 1978.Managing her own store was difficult at first, Garten said. She had to \"learn very quickly how to be a boss,\" and she struggled to find her leadership style.\"A friend gave me the advice, your employees need two things from you. They need you to be clear, and they need you to be happy,\" Garten said. From then on, Garten practiced being more direct with her instructions – \"I need these candies bagged, and I need them wrapped up like this\" — and she resolved to not let her bad days \"disturb the energy in the room\" at the store. \"That was the best lesson I ever had for business,\" Garten recalled.How she delivers criticism Garten has a \"very clear\" rule about giving feedback to her employees: \"If I'm criticizing you, I'll take you out of the room and discuss what you can do better. If I'm complimenting you, I'll do it with everybody around.\"Though Garten tries to avoid firing people — \"I usually give them a lot of warning, explain what they have to do better,\" she said — sometimes the job just isn't the right fit. Learning how to let employees go was also a leadership skill Garten had to hone.A month into running Barefoot Contessa, Garten realized that one of her young employees was \"just dreadful\" at her job.\"She was just very sweet, but not very good,\" Garten said, so she decided to fire her.\"I took her out in the back and I explained that, you know, I'm sure there are other jobs that you're good at. This isn't the one,\" Garten told Poehler. Her delivery \"was so gentle, because I was so worried about hurting her feelings,\" Garten said, but she failed to get her point across to the employee.\"The next day she showed up for work again. She didn't know she was fired,\" Garten laughed. Garten didn't have the heart to attempt to fire the employee again, so she allowed her to stay on for the rest of the summer.Now, Garten has mastered the art of firing people in a kind, but firm manner: she said she fires people \"in a way that makes them say thank you and kiss me when they leave.\"Garten also prioritizes transparency as a leader. When Garten lets an employee go, she calls together the rest of her team to explain what happened, she said.She always worries that other employees will be upset with her for firing their colleague, she told Poehler, but \"100% of the time they're like, 'Oh, [they were] such a pain in the neck. We hated working with them. I'm so glad you fired them.'\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Being a great leader takes time and practice, and a growing share of workers are trying to get better at it.Search interest in the term \"leadership\" is at an all-time high, according to Google data, along with related terms like training, best practices, advice on how to lead a team and sources for professional development.The buzz likely stems from people wanting to lead during a time of rapid business changes due to remote and hybrid policies in offices, global politics, changing economic circumstances and the adoption of technology like AI, says Brian Glaser, Google's chief learning officer.Glaser has been a manager off and on for the last 20 years and leads the onboarding, training and leadership development for some 150,000 employees worldwide. As a leadership expert, Glaser tells CNBC Make It that people of all experience levels struggle with one main aspect of being a boss: delivering \"really effective feedback so that people are clear about where they stand.\"Instead, many managers shy away from critical or constructive feedback in the pursuit of being well liked.\"As a leader, being nice is great,\" Glaser says. That can lead you to be liked among your reports, but \"the name of the game is really to be respected.\"\"If you're not delivering the feedback, you may not get the kind of respect you need as a manager,\" he says. This can be tough for first-time managers or someone who's been promoted and is now overseeing the work of former peers.But teams can grow stagnant or repeat avoidable mistakes \"if you're only looking to tell people what's working and not necessarily delivering the hard stuff,\" Glaser says.Glaser's team is behind Google's latest People Management Essentials, a paid course available to the public that covers lessons from over a dozen Google bosses about what it takes to be an excellent leader.Some of the lessons about delivering solid feedback are inspired by sports psychology, Glaser says.\"We know the best athletes are the folks who receive constant feedback from their coaches about how they're performing, he says. Win or lose, \"every time they finish a game, they debrief, they talk about what worked and what didn't. We believe those same concepts can be applied to organizational life.\"Talking about areas for improvements helps ensure stronger performance outcomes in the future. Athletes including Super Bowl champ Tom Brady and Team USA Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas have discussed that learning from mistakes and failures fueled their successes.In the workplace, meanwhile, telling a report that \"they need to improve can be challenging,\" Glaser says, \"but we know through good practice, managers can do this, and it really matters.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Bestselling author and wellness leader Deepak Chopra is optimistic about the possibilities of artificial intelligence. \"The thing is, AI is here to stay,\" he says. Chopra believes that while the technology can be harmful, it can also be beneficial when used very specifically for self-discovery. Chopra recommends using AI chatbots to get to know yourself better, suggesting questions like, \"What is my purpose?\" and \"How can I cultivate self-compassion?\"Chopra recently launched an online wellness platform that offers meditations, community discussion boards and live sessions led by Chopra himself. And he's bullish enough on AI to have created his very own Deepak Chopra chatbot. Unlike large language models such as Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini, Chopra's bot is what's called a small language model. Instead of training the bot on all of human knowledge, it's trained on Chopra's work, specifically.\"I've written 95 plus books,\" he says. \"I've done innumerable conferences. I have thousands of videos on YouTube and LinkedIn and Facebook and Instagram and TikTok. So I fed all that into my AI.\" Chopra platform subscribers pay $10 monthly, which includes chatbot access. Non-subscribers can pay from 50 cents per 30-minute session to $6 a month to use the bot.The thing is, AI is here to stay.Deepak ChopraAuthor, wellness guruUsers can choose from a series of existing prompts on subjects including success, relationships, sex and spirituality, or they can simply put in their own question. Answers come back in text format and can also be played out loud in Chopra's voice. But Chopra says the bot does have its limits: \"We will not be doing suicide prevention,\" he says. \"That's for professionals.\" Chopra's chatbot will not offer psychotherapy either, he says.Instead, Chopra says you can give the bot prompts like \"I haven't slept in five days, can you give me a meditation?\" or \"I'm having difficulty in my relationship because we're not communicating.\" \"Then, we give you guidelines,\" he says. Ultimately, Chopra says he wants people to cultivate empathy, compassion, joy and peace of mind, and that he wants to be a resource for users around the clock. \"You have me as your companion in your pocket all the time,\" he says.He adds that he wouldn't mind continuing to be a presence in his family's life. \"My grandchildren's grandchildren will be able to have a conversation with me long after I'm gone,\" he says.Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "With the rising cost of groceries, rent and other essentials, having money to set aside and save can feel impossible. However, saving doesn't always require more money — you might just need to reorganize what you already have, says Kashif Ahmed, a certified financial planner and lecturer at Suffolk University in Boston. Ahmed, who teaches a finance class to undergraduate students, says many of his students tell him they want to save more, but say they lack the funds to start. That tracks with national data: Nearly 75% of Gen Z adults reported having $1,000 or less saved, according to a Self Financial survey of over 2,000 adults in July. But often, \"the money is there, you just have to go look for it,\" Ahmed says. Here's where he recommends starting.How to reorganize your spendingAhmed's advice: Start by writing down every dollar you spend and sincerely looking at it.When looking through your list, ask yourself which expenses were absolutely necessary and which expenses were simply \"wants.\" For example, he says, do you really need two lattes a day or five different streaming services? Sometimes, it may be smart to bring in a third-party auditor — someone like a parent or friend who isn't emotionally invested in your purchases — who can identify places to cut spending and save instead. Even packing a meal instead of buying lunch once a week can be a great way to get started, Ahmed says. \"Financial security is absolutely possible,\" he says. \"It's all about discipline.\"It's OK to make fun purchasesSaving money doesn't necessarily mean you have to cut out all purchases that may bring joy or stick to a tight budget limited to essential items.Sometimes, a restrictive budget may even backfire on you, leading to periods of spending binges, Suze Orman, personal finance expert and host of the podcast \"Women & Money (and Everyone Smart Enough to Listen),\" told the Wall Street Journal in 2024.Instead, Orman said to try focusing on smaller, everyday decisions that can make you feel more in control of your spending. \"Just do one thing that might make you feel more secure,\" Orman said. \"Is that saving $10? Is that not going out to eat?\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesSouth Korea became the latest country to impose sanctions on Prince Group, a multinational network accused of running large-scale fraud operations across Southeast Asia. Seoul's move follows similar actions by the U.S., UK, and Singapore.In a statement Thursday, South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that the measures mark the country's first independent sanctions regarding transnational crime and the \"largest single sanction measure in history,\" according to a Google translation.\"It shows the government's firm determination to actively respond to online organized crime in Southeast Asia that is causing serious damage at home and abroad,\" the statement added. Prince Group is accused of operating large-scale online 'scam centers' in Cambodia and Myanmar that used trafficked workers to defraud victims around the world. South Korean sanctions target 15 people and 132 entities linked to the network.The documents detailed the completion of two particular facilities staffed with 1,250 mobile\nphones that controlled 76,000 accounts on a popular social media platform.Source: US Eastern District of New YorkSouth Korea and Cambodia agreed in October to set up a joint task force to help tackle online crimes, after a university student died of torture in August in a scam compound.Prince Group has denied any wrongdoing. In a Nov. 11 statement issued through U.S. law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, the group called the allegations \"baseless.\"\"The recent allegations are baseless and appear aimed at justifying the unlawful seizure of assets worth billions of dollars,\" the Cambodia-based network said, adding that it had engaged a team of lawyers from the U.S. legal powerhouse.CNBC has reached out to Prince Group and Boies Schiller Flexner for comment and didn't immediately hear back.Crackdown widensThe latest action against Prince Group builds on broader international efforts to curb scam networks in the region. On Oct. 14, the U.S. and UK announced sweeping sanctions on Prince Group, which the U.S. Treasury Department designated as a \"Transnational Criminal Organization.\"The U.S. Department of Justice also seized about $15 billion worth of bitcoin on Oct. 14, held in cryptocurrency wallets owned by Cambodian national Chen Zhi, the chairman of Prince Group. Zhi, a 38-year-old Chinese-born emigre who is also known as \"Vincent,\" was also charged with wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy and remains at large.Chart of The Prince Group Transnational Criminal OrganizationU.S. Treasury DepartmentAnother Cambodian financial network, Huione Group, was also banned from the U.S. financial system on the same day, which the U.S. Treasury Department accused in May of colluding with North Korean cybercriminals.\"Huione Group serves as a critical node for laundering proceeds of cyber heists carried out by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and for [Transnational Criminal Organizations] in Southeast Asia perpetrating virtual currency investment scams, commonly known as \"pig butchering\" scams, among others,\" the U.S. Treasury Department said.Seoul's sanctions announced Thursday also target the Huione Group. The British government said the centers in Southeast Asia used fake job adverts to lure workers, who were then forced to commit online fraud, including love scams and crypto scams, under threat of torture.In October, Singapore had seized over 150 million Singapore dollars of assets linked to the group. The Singapore Police Force said these included bank accounts, securities accounts and cash.",

    "body": "Coffee prices were already rising following poor harvests last year when the U.S. added new tariffs on coffee imports in April. Those tariffs have since been rolled back, but prices at grocery stores and cafés are still high, leaving many shoppers wondering why a simple cup of coffee costs so much.As of September, roasted coffee sold in stores cost about 41% more than it did 12 months prior, rising from an average of $6.47 to $9.14 per pound, according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data.While prices can swing by roughly a dollar within a year during volatile periods, the nearly $3 increase in the most recent BLS data is unusually steep — and consumers are taking notice.\"This is ridiculous,\" 52-year-old Chuck Smith said in a TikTok video in August in which he showed receipts for the 38.2-ounce tub of Maxwell House ground coffee he buys at his local Walmart in Indiana, which had nearly doubled in price to $21.44 in under a year.Smith says he filmed the clip spontaneously in the grocery aisle after noticing the price hike. \"It was just me in the moment,\" he told CNBC Make It, adding that the reaction \"captured what a lot of folks are feeling.\" Walmart and Kraft Heinz, the maker of Maxwell House, did not respond to requests for comment. Other brands, including Nespresso and Folgers, have also increased prices in the last year.Restaurant coffee prices have risen, too: The average cost of a regular cup increased from $3.46 to $3.57 in the year ending October 2025, according to restaurant and café price data tracked by menu software company Toast.What's behind the biggest coffee price spike in decadesThe run-up in average retail coffee prices has been the steepest and most sustained since BLS began tracking those prices in 1980, the data shows.Weather issues came first. Drought and heavy rain disrupted harvests in Brazil and Vietnam in 2024, tightening supply well before tariffs took effect.Coffee futures prices then climbed from roughly $2 a pound in May 2024 to a peak of $4 by April 2025, one of the steepest increases the market has seen in decades, according to Intercontinental Exchange data. Because futures serve as the benchmark for what importers and roasters pay for beans, sharp increases often lead to higher costs, which may eventually show up in retail prices.Tariffs are another factor. In April, the U.S. imposed new tariffs on coffee imports — 10% on key coffee-growing Latin American countries and about 20% for Asian growers, with Brazil hit hardest at 50%. Since then, grocery-store coffee prices have risen about 21%, according to consumer price index data.In mid-November, the White House rolled back most of the new coffee tariffs, eliminating duties for nearly all producing countries except Brazil, which retained a 40% tariff. Last week, the administration removed the remaining 40% duty on Brazilian coffee as well, effectively ending tariffs on coffee imports from almost all major exporters.Because retail prices typically lag wholesale costs, it may take time before any easing shows up on store shelves. Still, removing tariffs should eventually help take some pressure off prices, according to the National Coffee Association, an industry trade group.\"Significant coffee price inflation has occurred during the time tariffs have been in place,\" a spokesperson for NCA tells CNBC Make It. \"Removing tariffs on the world's leading coffee producing countries is expected to significantly decrease costs.\"Black Friday sale: Want to up your AI skills and be more productive? Get 25% off our most popular course of the year, How to Use AI to Be More Successful at Work, with coupon code GETSMART.

    "body": "Greg Hart, President and CEO of CourseraCourseraWith entry-level jobs declining as employers continue to deploy AI, Coursera's CEO has shared his top tips for graduates to stay competitive in the job market and stand out in interviews. Greg Hart, former technical advisor to Jeff Bezos at Amazon, became president and CEO of online learning platform Coursera in February 2025. He told CNBC Make It that in the age of AI, it's important for young people to pursue additional learning alongside a degree. \"The advice that I give to my sons... is one of the best things that you can do is to augment your university degree with micro credentials specifically,\" he said in the interview. Micro credentials are short courses that provide a certification for a specific skill or knowledge and they take less time to complete than a traditional degree or diploma. It's become increasingly important to supplement degrees with additional certifications, as graduate jobs are at risk of being replaced by AI, Hart said. Major firms have been laying off staff this year and have cited AI as part of the reason, from Amazon making 14,000 workers redundant as it bets on AI to Salesforce slashing 4,000 customer support roles saying AI can do 40% of the tasks at the company. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you.\"Greg HartPresident and CEO of CourseraMeanwhile, 62% of U.K. employers anticipate that junior, clerical, managerial and administrative roles will be the most likely be lost to AI, according to a recent survey of 2,019 senior HR professionals and decision makers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD.)Additionally, the U.K.'s Institute for Student Employers found in its annual Student Recruitment Survey that 1.2 million applications were submitted for just 17,000 graduate roles, highlighting the intense competition and the limited positions available to young people. \"They [micro credentials] demonstrate to employers that not only did you get whatever university degree you're studying, but you augmented that with something that is generally much more workforce focused,\" Coursera's Hart added. As AI dominates, many workers are pursuing upskilling opportunities with LinkedIn's Skills on the Rise report, earlier this year finding that AI literacy was the most popular skill that people were adding to their profiles. 'Hiring you for your traits' Hart explained that fresh graduates going into job interviews should highlight their personality and character traits alongside their experience. \"Say you're a young person in university right now, you are generally going to get hired into your first job based primarily on the traits that they see in you,\" Hart said. \"They're going to be assessing your mindset and your traits as a human being more than your experience, because by definition, you really don't have much experience and so they're not really hiring you for your experience, they're hiring you for your... personality traits.\" Hart outlined that \"one of the most important traits\" that employers want to hire for are \"people who are proactive and hard working and take initiative, who prove to be ready, learners.\" The best way to show these traits is having micro credentials alongside your degree, especially ones that are tailored to your field. For example, Hart encouraged his son, who is a finance major, to take an additional course on AI for finance. In fact, experts previously told CNBC Make It that workers who have been laid off as a result of AI should train themselves up on new skills including increasing AI literacy via short courses, rather than pursuing a new degree which would be more costly and time consuming. Having the dedication to pursue additional learning demonstrates that you will also bring those traits to the job, they told CNBC. ",

Alexander Kazakov | Afp | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has broken his silence on a U.S.-backed peace plan to end the war in Ukraine, saying Moscow is ready for \"serious\" discussions about the draft proposals.Putin said Thursday that the outlines of a fledgling peace plan that has been reached by the U.S. and Ukraine could be the basis of a deal that ends the almost four-year long conflict.\"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said in comments made during a trip to Kyrgyzstan and translated by Reuters.The president added that the U.S. appeared to be taking Russia's position on a peace settlement \"into account\" and that Moscow was ready for \"serious discussions\" when U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff travels to Moscow next week for talks.It's the first time Putin has publicly addressed a peace plan since a flurry of diplomacy between the U.S. and Ukraine in the last few days. Those talks came after reports last week of a U.S.-Russia devised 28-point peace plan, which appeared to heavily favor Russia's demands.  Ukraine and its European allies' scrambled to mount a response, amending the plan and inserting counter proposals which were discussed in Geneva last weekend with a U.S. delegation led by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. All eyes on RussiaThe current draft plan, which has reportedly been slimmed down to 19 key proposals, appears to have received Ukraine's tentative backing, putting the ball back in Russia's court as to whether it could accept the framework and build upon it.On Wednesday, Putin's close aide Yuri Ushakov had claimed that Russia had not even seen an official version of the latest U.S.-backed draft deal for Ukraine, but that it had seen an unofficial version.Regarding the plan it had seen, Ushakov said the Kremlin viewed some aspects of the plan positively while \"several of its points require serious analysis.\"Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign minister, said Moscow welcomed U.S. efforts on peace proposals but said \"there are no concessions on key issues on the Ukraine settlement,\" suggesting there could be some distance to travel before a deal is actually reached. Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov warned on Wednesday against jumping to conclusions regarding an end to the war, which Russia launched when it invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022.\"Wait. It's too early to say that,\" Peskov told reporters, state news agency TASS reported, when asked whether this was the closest Russia and Ukraine had ever been to concluding a peace agreement. Putin on Thursday praised Russian advances in Ukraine and told reporters that the fighting in Ukraine would stop only when Ukrainian troops withdraw from their positions in key areas. If they did not do so, then Russian forces would achieve their objectives by force, he added, appearing to suggest that Moscow was not willing to give up one of its key objectives in the war (and contained within the initial peace plan secretly drafted with the U.S.) which was to have full control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region.CNBC has contacted the Kremlin for further comment and is awaiting a response.Ukraine on board, tentativelyMultiple outlets reported Tuesday that a Ukrainian delegation that had held talks with U.S. officials in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday appeared to tentatively support the basis of a U.S.-backed peace plan — though key details remained unresolved.ABC News and CBS News both reported an unnamed U.S. official had said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while adding there were still points that had to be ironed out. It was unclear if both stories quoted the same U.S. official.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.U.S. President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"",

Sergio Yate | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines said Saturday that aircrafts impacted by an Airbus recall have received the software fixes necessary to resume flying.\"As of 12 p.m. CT, no aircraft were left to be updated of the 209 impacted,\" the company said. \"American expects no further operational impact related to the Emergency Airworthiness Directive and looks forward to the remaining days of the Thanksgiving holiday travel period, especially Sunday, our most-traveled day.\"Thousands of travelers worldwide were stranded after Airbus ordered immediate software fixes for 6,000 A320-series aircraft, a move that affected more than half of the narrow-body fleet and forced airlines to ground jets during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.The directive — among the largest in the 55-year history of Airbus — quickly spilled into U.S. holiday travel and stretched to Australia. The disruption, linked to solar flares, hit especially hard in Asia, where the single-aisle A320 family anchors short-haul networks.United Airlines said six aircraft in its fleet were affected, and the carrier expected \"minor disruption to a few flights.\"  Delta Air Lines said less than 50 of its Airbus A320 fleet were affected.Japan's ANA Holdings canceled 95 domestic flights Saturday, affecting around 13,200 passengers. The carrier, along with affiliates such as Peach Aviation, operates the country's largest Airbus narrow-body fleet, while rival Japan Airlines relies mostly on Boeing aircraft.watch nowAir India, which is partially owned by Singapore Airlines, said it had completed software updates on over 40% of its affected aircraft and that there were no flight cancellations, although some flights were delayed or rescheduled.Scoot, another carrier under the Singapore Airlines group, said 21 of its 29 A320s required the fix and that it aimed to complete the work by Saturday.In Australia, Jetstar Airways canceled around 90 flights after identifying 34 aircraft that required the software correction. \"As of 3:30 pm [local time], 20 of the 34 affected aircraft are ready to return to service. We're expecting the remaining to be ready overnight, allowing flights to resume as planned on Sunday 30 November,\" a Jetstar spokesperson told CNBC.The budget airline and its parent company, Qantas, which is Australia's national flag carrier, together hold about 65% of the domestic market. Rival Virgin Australia, which has four A320s in its fleet and a 35% share, said that it was unaffected by the recall.The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said in a directive on Friday that a JetBlue flight on Oct. 30 experienced an \"uncommanded and limited pitch down event.\"  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration also issued an emergency directive later that day, ordering operators of the affected model to address the glitch.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in a LinkedIn post: \"The fix required on some #A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays since yesterday. ... Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible to get planes back in the sky and resume normal operations.\"",

Bonds and metals resumed trading after a pause, according to FactSet data, while individual stocks were still trading the premarket.\"All CME Group markets are open and trading,\" a CME Group spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Earlier, representatives for CME Group had told CNBC markets were halted due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, adding that it may take some time for moves in the impacted contracts to be seen once the outage is resolved. watch nowGlobex futures and options markets, foreign exchange platform EBS markets and BMD markets were all impacted. EBS markets reopened at 7 a.m. ET, around 90 minutes after its subsidiary BrokerTec EU markets resumed trading.The CME — the largest exchange operator in the world by market value — trades futures and options across various asset classes, including agricultural commodities, energy, metals and equities. Cooling issueEarlier, a spokesperson for Dallas, Texas-headquartered CyrusOne told CNBC the company was actively responding to a cooling system issue at its CHI1 data center facility in the Chicago area, which had impacted customers including CME Group. \"On November 27, our CHI1 facility experienced a chiller plant failure affecting multiple cooling units,\" they said in an email. \"Our engineering teams, along with specialized mechanical contractors, are on-site working to restore full cooling capacity. We have successfully restarted several chillers at limited capacity and have deployed temporary cooling equipment to supplement our permanent systems.\"CyrusOne's representative said the firm was in direct contact with all affected customers, and its teams were \"working around the clock to restore normal operations as quickly and safely as possible.\"\"We apologize for any disruption this has caused and appreciate the patience of our customers as we work toward full resolution,\" they added. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told CNBC it was fortunate the outage had come on one of the slowest trading days of the year in the U.S., just after Thanksgiving. \"It appears as though they are gradually starting to restore some operations,\" he said. \"All told this could have been much worse.\"Emir Syazwan, a futures trader at Ninefold Trading Co. based in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, told CNBC on Friday that he had been on the phone to his broker \"throughout the afternoon\" local time as the CME outage dragged on. watch nowGiven the timing of the outage — at the end of the week, just after a major U.S. holiday and in the early hours of the morning for American traders — Syazwan said those trading in the Asian or European session would be more directly impacted. Whether it will create \"lasting distortions\" in markets depends on how fast the issue can be resolved, he added. \"It's inconvenient, but it's not unprecedented, although this kind of event may materially alter market structure or price discovery,\" he said. \"Current price action already reflects markets being affected: the markets have been relatively flat and trading in a very tight range since 26 November, Wednesday, around ~10 PM EST. And until the issue is resolved, I would expect that behaviour and price action to continue.\"It's not the first time the CME has had to shut down electronic trade. Back in 2014, technical issues shut down some trading on the CME's Globex electronic system, impacting agricultural contracts. Last year, trading of equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds was also temporarily halted in Switzerland after stock exchange SIX had problems disseminating data. Syazwan's own trades have not been impacted, he told CNBC.\"I had already anticipated the major markets — especially the U.S. indices — to consolidate until the start of next year, so I went on early holiday at the beginning of the month,\" he said. — CNBC's Lisa Kailai Han and Matt Ward-Perkins contributed to this article.

The group called on the leadership of Nexperia's entities in China to take steps to restore the  established supply flows without delay.In a statement, Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's Chinese parent company, said on Friday that the Dutch unit's open letter contained \"a large number of misleading and untrue allegations.\"It said the \"unlawful deprivation of Wingtech's control and shareholder rights over Nexperia\" was the root cause of the ongoing supply chain chaos.\"Combined with the recent series of actions by the Dutch government and Nexperia B.V., we believe their true intention is to buy time for Nexperia B.V. to construct a 'de-China-ized' supply chain and permanently strip Wingtech of its shareholder rights,\" Wingtech said.In this photo illustration, the logo of semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is displayed on a screen.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesNexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. How did we get here? The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns. Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains.  Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last.\"The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech,\" Luman told CNBC by email.\"It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity,\" Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages.Nissan signage at a dealership in Richmond, California, US, on Friday, June 21, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, \"particularly for the first quarter\" of 2026.\"In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts,\" a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. \"However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. Component availability remains uncertain,\" they added. ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls.\"The Chinese position appears strong again as European manufacturers are dependent on the supplies. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies,\" Luman said. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Jefferies' relationship into bankrupt auto parts maker First Brands Group, The Financial Times reported Thursday. The newspaper, citing people with knowledge of the matter, said the regulator is looking into whether Jefferies gave investors enough information on its Point Bonita fund's exposure to the failed auto business. The inquiry into internal controls and potential conflicts within the bank is at an early stage, the report said. It's not clear whether it will result in any allegations of wrongdoing. Jefferies came under pressure last month after its exposure to First Brands — which collapsed under a series of complex debt agreements — raised fears of other bad loans on Wall Street.

Anna Rose Layden | ReutersThe White House on Friday evening named the Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent as \"media offender of the week,\" blasting their coverage of a video released by Democratic lawmakers telling the U.S. military that they can disobey illegal orders.The Boston Globe, CBS News and The Independent did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC.Last week, six Democrats, all with military or national security experience, released a video reminding service members that they have the right to refuse illegal orders. President Donald Trump accused them of \"seditious behavior\" and said that in \"the old days\" that was \"punishable by death.\" The FBI is now seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly and the other Democrats featured in the video.The White House has denied that Trump has ever issued illegal orders. However, some experts have said the Pentagon's deadly campaign against alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean is unlawful. On Friday, the Washington Post reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth verbally ordered to kill all crew members on a suspected drug boat. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., a Marine Corps veteran, told the newspaper that Americans will eventually be prosecuted for this, \"either as a war crime or outright murder.\"",

    "body": "Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesWhen ChatGPT launched in 2022, Google was caught flatfooted, but the launch of Gemini 3 and the Ironwood AI chip this month has experts raving about Alphabet's AI comeback. Google kicked off November by unveiling Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, or TPUs, that the company says lets customers \"run and scale the largest, most data-intensive models in existence.\" And last week, Google launched Gemini 3, its latest artificial intelligence model, saying it requires \"less prompting\" and provides smarter answers than its predecessors. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff captured the excitement around Gemini 3 with a Sunday post on X, saying that despite using OpenAI's ChatGPT daily for three years, he wasn't going back after two hours of using Gemini 3. \"The leap is insane,\" wrote Benioff, whose company has partnerships with Google, OpenAI and other frontier AI model providers. \"Everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again.\"Most tech stocks were down to start the week, except for one: Alphabet. Shares of the Google parent surged more than 5% on Monday, adding to last week's gain of more than 8%. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway revealed earlier this month that it owns a $4.3 billion stake in Alphabet as of the end of the third quarter. Alphabet shares are up nearly 70% this year and have outperformed Meta's by more than 50 percentage points this year, and last week, Alphabet's market cap surpassed Microsoft's.All of this came despite Nvidia reporting stronger-than-expect revenue and guidance in its third-quarter earnings last week.\"You may be asking why almost all of the AI stocks we cover are selling off after such good news from Nvidia,\" Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes wrote in a note Monday, referring to Nvidia's positive third quarter earnings last week. \"There is one real reason for worry and it is the 'AI comeback' of Alphabet.\" But while Google appears to have regained the edge, its lead over rivals remains razor thin in the gruelingly competitive AI market, experts said. Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPutting the pieces togetherWith Gemini 3 and Ironwood, Google CEO Sundar Pichai appears to have finally put the pieces together for the company's AI offerings, said Michael Nathanson, co-founder of equity research firm Moffett Nathanson. Google is serving a broad range of customers from consumers to enterprise, something the company initially struggled to do after the arrival of ChatGPT. \"Three years ago, they were seen as kind of lost and there were all these hot takes saying they lost their way and Sundar is a failure,\" Nathanson said. \"Now, they have a huge leg up.\"The company had a number of AI product mishaps in its initial attempts to catch up with OpenAI. In 2024 alone, Google had to pull its image generation product Imagen 2 for several months after users discovered a number of historical inaccuracies. The launch of AI Overviews caused a similar reaction when users discovered it gave faulty advice, which the company later remedied with additional guardrails.\"There was a lot of fumbling, and they were scrambling,\" said Gil Luria, managing director at technology research firm DA Davidson. \"But they had the tech in the pantry, and it was just a matter of getting it all together and shipped.\"Of particular note is how quickly Google launched Gemini 3 after the spring release of Gemini 2.5, which was already considered an impressive model. The hyper-realistic image generation features of Nano Banana is another notch in Google's belt. After the company initially launched the image generation tool, Gemini shot to the top of the Apple App Store in September, dethroning ChatGPT. And after the launch of Gemini 3, Google released Nano Banana Pro last week. Google's ownership of YouTube and all the content on the video platform gives the company an edge when it comes to training models for image and video generation. \"The amount of video and current data that Google has, that's really a huge competitive advantage,\" said Mike Gualtieri, vice president and principal analyst for Forrester Research. \"I don't see how OpenAI and Anthropic can overcome that.\"Additionally, Google has successfully incorporated its AI models into its enterprise products, driving sales for the company's cloud unit. In its third quarter earnings results last month, Google reached its first $100 billion quarter, boosted by its cloud growth. The company's cloud unit, which houses its AI services, showed solid growth and a $155 billion backlog from customers. And it's not just the AI models. Google is also garnering attention with its AI chips. Google says Ironwood is nearly 30 times more power efficient than its first TPU from 2018. Google's ASIC chips are emerging as the company's secret weapon in the AI wars and have helped it notch recent deals worth billions with customers such as Anthropic. After a report said that Meta could strike a deal with Google to use its TPUs for the social media company's data centers, Nvidia saw its stock drop 3% on Tuesday, prompting the chipmaker to post a response on social media. With the rise of Google's TPUs, Nvidia may no longer have the AI chips market cornered.\"The advantage of having the whole stack is you can optimize your model to work specifically well on a TPU chip and you're building everything to a more optimally designed,\" said Luria.The company's ability to serve AI enterprise customers with its TPUs and Google Cloud offerings as well as its incorporation of Gemini 3 throughout its consumer products is driving Wall Street's enthusiasm.Experts who spoke with CNBC said the competitive landscape is broader than just one AI winner, but they added that it's become increasingly expensive for multiple companies to prove success.Tight competitionDespite these wins, Google is still in fierce competition with other AI companies, experts said.\"Having the state of the art model for a few days doesn't mean they've won to the extent that the stock market is implying,\" Luria said, pointing to Anthropic's new Opus 4.5 model launched Monday. Earlier this month, OpenAI also announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \"more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. \"The frontier models still seem to be neck and neck in some ways,\" Forrester Research's Gualtieri said.The competitive edge will likely go to the companies willing to spend more money given the expenses of the AI race, experts said. In their earnings reports last month, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures. They collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.\"These companies are spending a lot of money assuming there's gonna be a winner take all when in reality we may end up with frontier models being a commodity and several will be interchangeable,\" Luria said.For Google, maintaining a lead in AI won't be without challenges. Company executives told employees earlier this month that Google has to double its serving capacity every six month to meet demand for AI services and run its frontier models, CNBC reported last week. \"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Google Cloud Vice President Amin Vahdat told employees.Although Google's in-house TPUs have gotten increased attention as viable alternatives to Nvidia's Blackwell chips, Nvidia still holds more than 90% of the AI chip market. In its post on Tuesday, Nvidia pointed out that its chips are more flexible and powerful than ASIC chips, like Google's Ironwood, which are typically designed for a single company or function.And despite getting Salesforce's Benioff to switch to Gemini, Google also has a lot of catching up to do with its consumer chat product, experts said, citing hallucinations and lower user numbers than OpenAI's.The Gemini app has 650 million monthly active users and AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said last month. OpenAI, by comparison, said in August that ChatGPT hit 700 million users per week.  \"Yes, Google has got its act together,\" Luria said. \"But that doesn't mean they've won.\"WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

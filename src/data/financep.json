    "body": "If you believe money causes tension in your relationship, you're not alone.I've spent the past two years interviewing and studying more than 60 couples and the ways they come into these conflicts. I've learned that love has little to do with it. You can love each other deeply and still allow money to erode your relationship if you're talking about the wrong issues, or not talking about them at all.People often focus on the problems right in front of them: missing a bill payment or spending over the monthly budget. But these smaller transgressions can be a symptom of a bigger issue you and your partner haven't identified yet.The happiest couples don't let these money mistakes ruin their relationship:1. They don't stay locked into old financial patterns Long ago, you and your partner may have decided to do something one way, and you've been doing it that way ever since. A good example is splitting your expenses down the middle and having separate bank accounts. At the time, you were earning similar incomes and were just starting your lives together. It made sense. But circumstances have changed, and maybe one of you earns more money, or you're having kids, and the logistics of this setup are more complicated than helpful.My advice is don't approach your partner about making big changes during a heated conflict. Raise the subject when stress is low and attention is high. You don't need to make a dramatic change overnight. Instead, use incremental steps to work toward a positive shared goal.2. They don't get stuck in the shame of their own storiesWe all have things we wish could've gone differently. But the story you tell yourself about a situation might be completely different from someone else's. You might see your student loan debt as a challenge to overcome, while I see mine as my biggest financial regret.The stories we tell ourselves about money matter. Shame, whether from the past or present, can trap someone into a cycle of fear and guilt. It clouds judgment and stalls progress, especially in a partnership. It might even convince someone they don't deserve a good life. As a partner, you can't wipe their shame away. They may need professional support. But you do need to understand the weight they're carrying in order to have honest, vulnerable conversations. Only then can you tailor your support to help them heal. 3. They don't hold setbacks over their partner's headNot every poor financial outcome is the result of a mistake. Sometimes, you take a step in the wrong direction. When that happens, you both need to be able to move on.  For example, holding credit card debt, even for a short time, is a frequent source of regret, even if it was necessary in the moment. Failing to let go of your partner's setbacks can damage their self-worth and confidence. The result can cause them to believe they aren't good with money, or even worse, that they don't deserve to have a say in financial decisions. Letting go of regrets can be as simple as writing them down, or as complex as working through them with a professional. But above all, never be the one to make your partner feel shame over money. Be their support and let them grow from it.4. They don't constantly fixate on what they don't have Having a \"never enough\" mindset goes beyond money or careers. It's fueled by constant comparison, especially on social media. When you fixate on what you don't have, you keep trying to fill a bigger glass without ever feeling full.Those expectations aren't always realistic or aligned with your goals as a couple, which is a slippery slope that can turn your partner into a moving target. They could begin to feel like they aren't enough for you, either.\"Enough\" doesn't mean \"everything.\" Set aside time to talk about your real priorities and set those as your benchmarks of contentment, not the idealized version of success you see on social media. 5. They don't lie about about how they use their money Financial infidelity can break trust in ways that are as harmful as adultery, because the betrayal directly impacts your livelihood as a family.For example, hiding income from your partner, making a massive purchase your partner wouldn't agree with, or even taking on debt in one or both of your names. Healing from patterns of lies requires radical transparency from that partner, along with a willingness to listen, evolve, and improve.And if you really don't feel free to spend money in your relationship, that's a conversation worth having. Rather than setting rigid spending rules (or even worse, \"allowances\") that fail to account for each person's household responsibilities, set a check-in number that you're both comfortable with. Anything below that amount is fair game.Strong couples know that handling money together is about values, trust, and communication. If you commit to facing the real issues together, even tough times can become building blocks for a better relationship.Heather Boneparth is the co-author of the upcoming book, \"Money Together,\" and the director of business and legal affairs for Bone Fide Wealth in New York City.

    "body": "The best bosses have one particular skill that elevates them above the rest, according to University of Chicago economist Virginia Minni.Standout managers can spot their workers' hidden talents and know how to best put them to use, making them more productive and helping them advance their careers, Minni wrote in a study published in September. \"Gaining a good manager results in an improvement in worker performance,\" she wrote, and those workers were more likely to be promoted and earn higher salaries in the long-run — 13% more than other workers, on average — according to the study.Minni, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, studied 10 years of data from a single \"large multinational firm\" with 200,000 workers and 30,000 managers across offices in 100 countries. The study does not identify the name of the company.The study identified the company's most successful managers by looking at those who were promoted faster than their peers and received high marks in internal performance ratings, Minni wrote.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossAmong that group of top managers, she looked for common factors that might explain their success. She found that their employees more likely to show improved performance under their management — and 40% more likely than others to make a lateral move within the company and see their performance continue to improve in the new roles.Those employees' continued improvement in other parts of the company suggests that the top managers aren't just strong motivators. They excel at identifying individual employees' specific skillsets and matching them to new roles within the company where they can potentially have a greater impact, Minni wrote in The Wall Street Journal on Friday.\"If a top manager were just a good coach or motivator, employees would show big gains while serving under the top manager, and the gains would fade once the high-performing leader left the scene,\" wrote Minni. \"But worker mobility and pay rose steadily even after the manager departed.\"How the best managers nurture talent and encourage autonomyIt's no secret that managers who identify and nurture talent can be highly valuable to their employers. Businesses that prioritize employees' development tend to see higher productivity and retention rates, plus 11% higher profitability, according to a 2019 Gallup study. Workers are happier and more productive at work when they are performing roles that make the most of their specific skills, research shows.The top managers in Minni's study had \"strengths in strategy and talent management skills\" that helped them identify underutilized workers and steer them toward roles where they could truly shine, she wrote. Other measurable differences made the managers Minni nicknamed \"high-flyers\" stand out from their peers, she added in the study: \"Workers describe good managers as mentors who guide career development, offer structured feedback, foster autonomy, and create opportunities aligned with employees' individual skills and aspirations.\"Those high-performing managers spent \"19% more time in one-on-one meetings with subordinates, and engage more in communication and multitasking — suggesting a more involved, coordination-intensive management style,\" she wrote in the study, citing the unnamed company's time-use data.Talent development can indeed be aided by managers who dedicate time to individual mentorship, research shows: Bosses can learn more about their employees' specific strengths and skillsets while offering relevant feedback to help advance their careers.The best managers also gave their employees the freedom to discover their own strengths and experiment with new tasks and roles, Minni added. As such, those workers were more likely to participate in \"flexible, short-term projects outside their core teams, which offer a low-risk way to experiment.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "Sign on facade at Kendra Scott retail store on Santana Row in the Silicon Valley, San Jose, California, December 14, 2019.Smith Collection | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesKendra Scott, a jewelry brand best known for its single-pendant necklaces, is becoming the latest company to join the Western wear trend.The company on Wednesday announced its debut boots collection in an expansion outside of the accessories market. The brand will offer three styles, available in men's and women's, as part of the Yellow Rose by Kendra Scott line focused on Western style.\"A lot of folks don't know, but in the other half of my life, I take my heels off in the boardroom, and I throw my boots on and head to my ranch,\" founder Kendra Scott told CNBC.Scott, who lives in Texas, said she grew up incorporating Western wear from denim to cowboy boots into her everyday style, in what she calls a \"beautiful, timeless, classic look.\" Slowly, Scott said she saw the trend take hold across the globe.\"I'm sitting here going, well, this is my life everyday. This is authentically who I am and what I do,\" Scott said. \"I also noticed that there were a lot of Western brands out there that put cowboy first, and then they later think about the girl ... so I was really excited to create a brand that put cowgirl front and center, but make it more modern.\"Kendra Scott's expansion into Western wear rides a larger wave of companies leaning into the style. The fast-growing market for cowboy boots is projected to reach $538.6 million by 2035, according to Future Market Insights.Other companies are taking notice. Retailers like Gap and Levi's are marketing and innovating more denim products amid what's become a \"jeans war.\" Wrangler is an exclusively Western wear brand that has leveraged the trend, and parts of American pop culture like the hit TV show \"Yellowstone\" and celebrities like Beyoncé are embracing the cowgirl aesthetic.Of course, more Western wear options for consumers means tougher competition for Kendra Scott as it enters the space.Branching outScott set out to create Yellow Rose in 2023. The in-house brand eventually became separate brick-and-mortar stores that incorporate Western style into its jewelry designs. Scott said the company quickly saw customer excitement about the unique style, but it felt like the tip of the iceberg of the brand's potential.Over the course of two years, the company tested modern Western apparel that was specifically designed for women, Scott said. The boots, she said, tie in the custom shapes that the jewelry brand is known for and include stitching and embroidery that give them a more \"modern twist.\"Scott said the collection is a \"labor of love\" with a specially shaped toe, a unique combination of leather and suede, multiple color choices and options for both men and women.Yellow Rose by Kendra Scott's debut boots collectionSource: Kendra ScottAnd the debut boot collection is just the first step toward building out a larger wardrobe, Scott said.\"We've been at it for almost 24 years and really put our stake in the ground as this premier jewelry designing brand,\" Scott said. \"We've built trust and connection with our customer over two decades now, and that allows a brand like mine to be able to now think about [more].\"Yellow Rose, named after Scott's ranch and the Texas flower, is opening its fourth location – and the first outside of Texas – in the fourth quarter of 2025 in Nashville, Tennessee.The boots launch comes after the company branched out into eyewear at the beginning of this year, entering into a licensing agreement with Marchon Eyewear.Scott said the step into Western apparel is a significant next chapter for the brand.\"It's exciting because I think we're at a really amazing place at Kendra Scott where this next 20 years is really going to be something that is kind of like literally, 'hold on to your hat,' because we're on this launching pad that we've really been able to build that trust,\" Scott said. \"When we launch a new category, we make sure that we're filling a void in the market and that we're doing it with our own unique fingerprint.\"",

The companies said more markets outside of the U.S. are in the pipeline.\"This partnership marks a new chapter for podcasting,\" Spotify's Head of Podcasts Roman Wasenmüller said in a statement. \"Together with Netflix, we're expanding discovery, helping creators reach new audiences, and giving fans around the world the chance to experience the stories they love and uncover favorites they never expected. This offers more choice to creators and unlocks a completely new distribution opportunity.\"Lauren Smith, Netflix's vice president of content licensing and programming strategy, said the curated selection \"adds fresh voices and new perspectives to Netflix.\"The shows coming to Netflix include \"The Bill Simmons Podcast,\" \"The Rewatchables\" and \"Serial Killers,\" with more expected after the initial launch.Spotify said the move is the next step in evolving the company into a multimedia experience, with more initiatives planned in the future to \"bring similar opportunities to a wider range of creators.\"Tuesday's announcement comes as media companies have turned to video podcasts as the next big thing among their audiences. In particular, video podcasts have soared in popularity on Google's YouTube, which is increasingly nabbing a bigger share of viewership.This has led traditional media and streaming companies to lean into the medium.At this year's Upfront advertising presentations, some companies, including Amazon's Prime Video, noted the recent success of podcast content as creators sign multimillion dollar deals and garner millions of followers and views.On an April earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said the company is \"constantly looking at all different types of content.\" Sarandos added that the line between podcasts and talk shows is becoming increasingly blurred. \"We want to work with kind of great creators across all kinds of media that consumers love,\" Sarandos said. \"Podcasts ... have become a lot more video-forward.\"— CNBC's Lillian Rizzo contributed to this report.

    "body": "Shoppers look at fruit for sale at Frank's Quality Produce Co. at Pike Place Market in Seattle, Washington, US, on Wednesday, May 28, 2025. M. Scott Brauer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmericans have vastly different views of the economy — and the divergence is being driven in part by income bracket, data shows.Higher-income consumers were more likely to report stronger economic confidence readings when asked to consider the next year given changes since the presidential election, according to JPMorgan's Cost of Living Survey.This release adds to a growing body of qualitative and quantitative evidence showing the U.S. economy is in a \"K-shape,\" a term used by economists to describe the deviation in economic experiences by income. In other words, it can explain why well-off Americans are continuing to spend while lower earners buckle under inflationary pressures.\"Survey results indicated a notable bifurcation,\" JPMorgan's Matthew Boss, a widely followed and respected consumer analyst, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients.High-income respondents rated their confidence a 6.2 out of 10 — with 10 being the best — on average. More than half of this cohort chose a rating between 7 and 10, underscoring their rosy financial outlook.On the other hand, low-income consumers reported a 4.4 score on average. Less than a quarter of participants in this category provided a score between 7 and 10, which Boss pointed out creates a 30-point delta between these groups.Across income brackets, the average respondent rated their confidence at a 4.9 out of 10 rating.This income-based division was once again prevalent when consumers were asked about their confidence for covering monthly bills compared with six to 12 months ago.Nearly 6 of 10 high-income consumers said these bills were easier or becoming easier to cover. But just 37% and 30% of middle- and lower-income groups, respectively, said the same.Higher-income respondents were also more likely to say they were planning to increase spending on nonessential items over the next year than other brackets, according to JPMorgan's survey.JPMorgan isn't the only organization seeing a disparity between income classes when it comes to their economic outlook.The top one-third of earners have reported an average consumer sentiment rating that's around 25% higher than the lowest one-third over the last two years, according to the University of Michigan's monthly consumer survey. The Michigan survey's most recent results reflect interviews conducted July 29-Aug. 25 of a statistically representative sample of about 1,000 American households.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump could still slap China with 100% tariffs on Nov. 1 or sooner, depending on Beijing's next move in a dispute over rare earths, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC Tuesday.\"A lot depends on what the Chinese do,\" Greer told CNBC in an interview. \"They are the ones who have chosen to make this major escalation.\"China announced sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports last week that would disrupt U.S. defense, technology, semiconductor and automobile industries if implemented.Trump retaliated with the threat of massive tariffs that would effectively shut down trade between the world's two largest economies. But the president appeared to dial back his rhetoric earlier this week,  saying \"it will all be fine\" with China.\"We can't have a situation where the Chinese keep this regime in place, where they want to have veto power over the world's high tech supply chains,\" the U.S. trade representative said.Trump, Xi scheduled to meetThe restrictions took the White House by surprise ahead of an expected meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit later this month in Seoul, South Korea.Trump and Xi are still scheduled to meet, Greer said, though he suggested those plans are subject to change depending on how the situation develops.\"Whether it will go through or not, I don't want to precommit either ourselves or the Chinese,\" Greer said of the meeting. \"But I think it makes sense for people to talk when they can.\"U.S. and Chinese officials at the senior staff level spoke as recently as Monday in Washington about the rare earth dispute, Greer said.\"We think we'll be able to work through it,\" Greer said of the trade dispute.'We want to work with the Chinese'The U.S. stock market erased about $2 trillion in value on Friday in response to Trump's tariff threat against China. The White House watches the market, Greer said, but the administration is focused on building long-term economic success by bringing supply chains back to the U.S., and reducing dependence on China.\"We want to make sure that the market is also responding to appropriate information,\" Greer said. \"You've seen the market settle out this week as they realize that the president and his team, we want to work with the Chinese.\"Rare earths are critical minerals used to manufacture magnets, which are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, the semiconductor industry and other applications.China controls about 60% of rare earth mining and more than 90% of refining worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency. The U.S. is dependent on China for roughly 70% of its rare earth imports, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",

Revenue increased 10.8% to $28.24 billion.Shares of the bank rose almost 5% in premarket trading. They've climbed roughly 14% this year before Wednesday.Like its peers, Bank of America's Wall Street businesses helped fuel the quarter's results.Banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs reported strong gains in trading and investment banking revenue during the third quarter on heightened activity among both institutional investors and corporations looking to acquire companies or raise capital.Bank of America said investment banking fees surged 43% from a year earlier to $2 billion, about $380 million more than analysts surveyed by StreetAccount had expected.Equities trading also contributed to the quarterly beat; revenue there rose 14% to $2.3 billion, roughly $200 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.Fixed income trading rose 5% to $3.1 billion, matching expectations.Bank of America also benefited from an improved outlook around credit losses in the quarter. The company said its provision for credit losses fell about 13% to $1.3 billion, which is below the $1.58 billion StreetAccount estimate.Net interest income rose 9% to $15.39 billion, about $150 million more than the StreetAccount estimate.\"With continued organic growth, every line of business reported top and bottom-line improvements,\" CEO Brian Moynihan said in the earnings release. \"Strong loan and deposit growth, coupled with effective balance sheet positioning, resulted in record net interest income.\"This story is developing.

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration will set price floors across a range of industries to combat market manipulation by China, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview Wednesday.China has driven foreign competitors in the rare earth industry out of business over the past two decades by using its global dominance in refining and processing to slash prices, Bessent said.\"When you are facing a nonmarket economy like China, then you have to exercise industrial policy,\" Bessent told Sara Eisen at CNBC's Invest in America Forum in Washington, D.C.\"So we're going to set price floors and the forward buying to make sure that this doesn't happen again and we're going to do it across a range of industries,\" the Treasury secretary said, without naming specific industries the administration was looking at beyond rare earths. The U.S. also needs to set up a strategic mineral reserve, Bessent said. JPMorgan Chase is interested in working with the Trump administration to create such a reserve, he said.Rare earths are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons systems like the F-35 warplane and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rare earth magnets are also essential for civilian commercial applications like electric vehicles.The Trump administration has been working to stand up a domestic rare earth supply chain. The Department of Defense struck an unprecedented deal in July with MP Materials, the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and offtake agreement.China last week announced sweeping new restrictions on rare earth exports ahead of an expected meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump in South Korea later this month. Trump has threatened to slap China with additional 100% tariffs in response.The U.S. could take equity stakes in other companies in the wake of Beijing's rare earth restrictions, Bessent told CNBC.\"I wouldn't be surprised,\" the Treasury secretary said when asked about additional equity stakes. \"When we get an announcement like this week with China on the rare earths, you realize we have to be self-sufficient, or we have to be sufficient with our allies.\"The Trump administration will not take stakes in nonstrategic industries, Bessent said. \"We do have to be very careful not to overreach,\" he said.Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors speculate on which companies might be future targets for Trump administration industrial policy.",

The 11-inch iPad Pro starts at $999. The latest Apple Vision Pro, which includes a Dual Knit Band, starts at $3,499.The new devices are available to preorder now in most markets and go on sale Oct. 22. They are Apple's latest additions to its fall catalog of products.The company released the iPhone 17 and Apple Watch Series 11 models in September.Apple's December quarter is its largest by sales, driven by holiday and Christmas shopping. That is why the company usually updates its bestselling products in the fall. This year, it's the first full quarter of iPhone 17 sales as well.The new device lineup is powered by Apple's M5 chip, which the company said has four times the peak compute performance compared with the previous M4.Johny Srouji, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Technologies, said in a release that the \"M5 delivers a huge boost to AI workloads.\"Supercharged by the powerful M5 chip, the new 14-inch MacBook Pro delivers even more performance and takes the next big leap in AI for the Mac.Courtesy: Apple Inc.Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJWednesday's announcement comes as Wall Street analysts are closely watching Apple's new releases to see if the company is raising prices or eating costs related to President Donald Trump's announced and threatened tariffs, especially on semiconductors and China.Starting prices for the latest M5 models are the same as the previous versions.While iPads and MacBooks aren't as critical for Apple as iPhone sales, they are still massive businesses.Apple reported $6.58 billion in iPad sales in the June quarter, an 8% decrease on an annual basis that the company attributed to difficult comparisons to the year-ago quarter when new iPad Pros were released.Mac sales in the June quarter came in at $8.05 billion, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. Apple released a new version of what it calls its bestselling laptop, the MacBook Air, earlier this year.Apple has never broken out figures for the Vision Pro headset but they are included alongside Apple Watch and AirPods sales in the company's wearables, or other products, line item. Analysts believe the company's Vision Pro revenue is negligible.MacBook, iPads and Vision Pro put together are significantly less than Apple's iPhone revenue, which accounted for more than 47% of revenue in the company's June quarter at just under $45 billion.Wall Street analysts tend to focus on iPhone sales and growth over the company's secondary product lines.The new iPad Pro with M5 unlocks the most advanced iPad experience ever, packing an incredible amount of power and AI performance into the ultraportable design.Courtesy: Apple Inc.watch now",

It intends to open its robotaxi service next year, assuming it can get permissions from regulators as well as local and national leaders.London will mark the company's second international city after Tokyo, where testing began in early 2025.Waymo has been aggressively expanding in the U.S., and now offers a commercial service in the Los Angeles area, Phoenix, San Francisco, Atlanta and Austin, Texas. The company has also announced plans to start robotaxi services in Miami and Washington, D.C., and said in August that it obtained permits to begin testing its autonomous vehicles with trained safety drivers on board in New York City.In London, Waymo's fleet will be comprised of Jaguar iPACE electric vehicles equipped with the company's Waymo Driver autonomous systems. Waymo said it already employs engineering teams in Oxford and London, and that it plans to work with Moove to handle operations and maintenance for its fleet.Moove provides vehicle financing to drivers who want to purchase a new vehicle for ride-hailing, and offers services like cleaning, some repairs and charging of electric vehicles to transportation businesses including Waymo and Uber, which is an investor in the startup.In June, the U.K. announced an accelerated framework for commercial pilots by AV ventures, an effort to bring self-driving investments to the region. London also established a \"Vision Zero\" goal earlier this year to eliminate all serious injuries and deaths in its transportation systems by 2041.Waymo says its system \"is involved in five times fewer injury-causing collisions, and twelve times fewer injury-causing collisions with pedestrians compared to humans,\" according to the company's analysis of its own data.The company has also reported that its self-driving vehicles have logged 100 million \"fully autonomous miles\" on public roads, and provided more than 10 million paid rides to passengers to-date.Waymo is part of Alphabet's \"Other Bets\" segment, which brought in revenue of $373 million in the second quarter on a loss of $1.25 billion. Alphabet plans to report third-quarter results on Oct. 29.Wayve, a U.K.-based startup backed by SoftBank and Microsoft, previously announced that it plans to bring a robotaxi commercial pilot to London next year.

Analysts pointed to \"sequential improvements\" in local spending across geographies, and noted the \"turnaround at Tiffany [is] continuing to bear fruit,\" while positive trends for champagne and improvements at Sephora were also adding to bullish sentiment.Meanwhile, analysts at RBC Capital Markets hiked their price target from 550 euros to 575 euros, also giving LVMH shares an Outperform rating.\"LVMH has delivered stronger than expected 3Q25 organic revenue growth ... recovery shape from here is unlikely to be linear,\" they said. \"We remain constructive on soft luxury category recovery into 2026, and in our view LVMH offers the right risk/reward profile to play this theme.\"",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersNextEra Energy is working with Exxon Mobil, the country's largest oil company, to build a large data center site powered by natural gas for a potential tech customer, CEO John Ketchum told investors Monday The 1.2 gigawatt power plant would combine gas generation with Exxon's carbon capture technology to reduce emissions, according to NextEra's presentation to investors. They plan to market the site to a hyperscaler in the first quarter of 2026. Hyperscalers are the big tech companies that are building data centers to train and run artificial intelligence applications. There is no signed agreement with a hyperscaler yet. NextEra and Exxon have secured 2,500 acres of land for the facility. The site will be located in the Southeast in close proximity to Exxon's carbon dioxide pipeline infrastructure, according to NextEra. NextEra shares closed about 3% lower on Monday. Exxon declined to comment on the partnership, but said its \"projects are making progress, and we appreciate our partners who add strategic value.\"A person familiar with the matter told CNBC that the project is a memorandum of understanding that is in its early stages. The oil major announced last year that it was developing natural gas solutions for data centers. CEO Darren Woods said in October that Exxon is in advanced discussions with potential customers and partners on data centers. NextEra is the largest renewable energy developer in the U.S., but it is leaning into natural gas to meet the growing demand from data centers. The power company plans to bring as much as 8 gigawatts of gas generation online by 2032, and is developing a pipeline of 20 gigawatts of gas generation. NextEra plans to build 15 gigawatts of power for data center hubs by 2035, Ketchum said. That includes at least three data center campuses that NextEra is developing with Alphabet's Google. \"A lot of those will get started with what I call bridge power — renewables, storage,\" the CEO said. \"We're also at that same time planning for the gas to come behind it.\"The tech sector has primarily secured renewables and increasingly nuclear power to supply data centers in an effort to meet its climate targets.

    "body": "Signage for Tata Electronics Pvt Ltd. at the company's factory in Hosur, Tamil Nadu, India, on Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTata Electronics has lined up American chip designer Intel as a prospective customer as the division of Mumbai-based conglomerate Tata Group works to expand India's domestic electronics and semiconductor supply chain. Under a Memorandum of Understanding, the companies will explore the manufacturing and packaging of Intel products for local markets at Tata Electronics' upcoming plants.Intel and Tata also plan to assess ways to rapidly scale tailored artificial intelligence PC solutions for consumers and businesses in India. In a press release on Monday, Tata said that the collaboration marks a pivotal step towards developing a resilient, India-based electronics and semiconductor supply chain.\"Together [with Intel], we will drive an expanded technology ecosystem and deliver leading semiconductors and systems solutions, positioning us well to capture the large and growing AI opportunity,\" said N Chandrasekaran, Chairman of Tata Sons, the principal investment holding company of Tata companies. Tata Electronics, established in 2020, has been investing billions to build India's first pure-play foundry. The facility will manufacture semiconductor products for the AI, automotive, computing and data storage industries, according to Tata Electronics. The firm is also building new facilities for assembly and testing. India, despite being one of the world's largest consumers of electronics, lacks chip design or fabrication capabilities. However, the Indian government has been working to change that as part of efforts to reduce dependence on chip imports and capture a bigger share of the global electronics market, which is shifting away from China. Under New Delhi's \"India Semiconductor Mission,\" at least 10 semiconductor projects have been approved with a cumulative investment of over $18 billion.Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan said the partnership with Intel was a \"tremendous opportunity\" to rapidly grow in one of the world's fastest-growing computer markets, fueled by rising PC demand and rapid AI adoption across India.",

    "body": "In Lisbon, Portugal, on January 12, 2025, people sit by a McDonald's storefront. McDonald's rolls out new value deals, like the McValue Menu, to combat economic challenges and attract budget-conscious customers, as global sales face pressure amid shifting consumer trends. Luis Boza | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMcDonald's will soon assess its franchisees on how their prices deliver value as the company updates its franchising standards as part of a larger bid to win over cash-strapped diners.\"Effective January 1, 2026, we are enhancing our global franchising standards across all Segments to reinforce accountability for value leadership,\" Andrew Gregory, McDonald's senior vice president of global franchising, development and delivery, wrote in a memo issued Monday and obtained by CNBC. \"With enhanced standards, we aim to provide greater clarity to the System to ensure every restaurant delivers consistent, reliable value across the full customer experience.\"Franchising standards are the policies that define how McDonald's operators should run their restaurants. Continued noncompliance with those standards could result in penalties, like not being permitted to open another restaurant, or even the termination of the franchise. Franchisees run about 95% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide and set their restaurants' prices, with input from third-party pricing advisors. Under the new standard, the company will \"holistically assess\" pricing decisions for how well they offer value, Gregory wrote in the memo.\"This approach enables franchisees to bring local insight to how value is delivered in their restaurants,\" he said.The change comes after McDonald's U.S. President Joe Erlinger told owners last month that they needed to keep their foot on the gas and stay the course on promoting the chain's value offerings.Across the restaurant industry, eateries have been leaning into value, betting that deals will attract cash-strapped customers. But discounts that are too steep can cut into profits, and operators have to strike a delicate balance to preserve both traffic and long-term profitability.For more than a year, McDonald's has reported that low-income consumers have been spending less money and visiting less frequently. To bring diners back to its restaurants, it has rolled out value menus in the U.S. and other key markets like France and Germany. The efforts have so far paid off, as the company has reversed same-store sales declines and attracted more high-income diners who are trading down to fast food.Still, McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said he expects that the pressure on the consumer isn't going away anytime soon.\"We continue to remain cautious about the health of the consumer in the U.S. and our top international markets and believe the pressures will continue well into 2026,\" Kempczinski said on the company's earnings conference call last month. The company's change in standards is likely to rile some McDonald's U.S. franchisees who already have a contentious relationship with their franchisor. An independent advocacy group of McDonald's operators has pushed for the company to contribute financially to make discounts more sustainable for franchisees in the long run. Several years ago, a new grading system for franchisees drew the ire of some operators, who said at the time that it would alienate workers in a tight labor environment.In addition to updating the franchising standards, McDonald's has also invested in tools to help franchisees determine how to address value in their local markets.\"While Owner/Operators continue to set their own prices and make decisions that reflect local market nuances, we've now strengthened individual accountability for value leadership – equipping you with approved pricing consultants, tools, and other levels that support informed choices and elevate the overall guest experience across all order points,\" McDonald's USA Chief Restaurant Officer Mason Smoot wrote in a separate memo sent to U.S. franchisees Monday and obtained by CNBC.",

    "body": "Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison at Netflix's \"America's Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys\" at The Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles, Aug. 11, 2025.Gilbert Flores | Variety | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance laid out its plan Monday to persuade Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders that it's a better buyer for the company than Netflix. The hostile bid kicks off a tug-of-war that could get complicated. Paramount has officially launched a tender offer for current WBD shares at $30 per share, all cash. That bid is backed by $41 billion in equity financing. The remainder will be money from RedBird Capital and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. Paramount also has $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo Global Management.Paramount's tender offer will be open for 20 business days, Paramount Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon said during a conference call for investors Monday. Warner Bros. Discovery has 10 days to respond, and after the 20 business days are up, Paramount has the option to extend the deadline to keep the offer open for WBD shareholders, Gordon said.During this time, any shareholder of WBD can sell its shares to Paramount for $30. If Paramount buys 51% of outstanding shares, it would control the company. \"We do believe the [Paramount] offer should garner meaningful traction,\" Raymond James equity analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note to clients. \"That said, we believe that Netflix is committed to this deal; if [Paramount] seems to be gaining traction, we would not be surprised to see a reaction.\"That reaction could come in the form of an increased Netflix offer, though Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos didn't mention as much when speaking Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference. A prolonged battle could eventually invite lawsuits or proxy fights that would demand full shareholder votes. The WBD board said in a statement Monday it \"is not modifying its recommendation with respect to the agreement with Netflix.\" It advised shareholders \"not to take any action at this time with respect to Paramount Skydance's proposal.\"Still, the board will \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery's agreement with Netflix, Inc.,\" the board said in its statement. Making a caseIf WBD shareholders seem to be convinced that Paramount's is the superior bid, Warner Bros. Discovery management could restart friendly discussions with Paramount to make sure it's getting the best deal possible. Paramount CEO David Ellison told CNBC's David Faber on Monday that the company's $30-per-share offer was not its \"best and final,\" suggesting Paramount is open to paying more for WBD if discussions begin again.Ellison hopes to convince WBD shareholders that a $30-per-share, all-cash offer is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share, cash-and-stock offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets. Ellison told CNBC on Monday that he values the linear cable networks, which aren't part of Netflix's bid, at just $1 per share. WBD internally has valued that business at about $3 per share, CNBC previously reported.If WBD reaches a deal with Paramount, WBD would owe Netflix $2.8 billion as a breakup fee — meaning Paramount may have to increase its bid, or agree to pay the fee, to adjust for the added cost. Regulatory jittersEllison said Monday that Paramount's odds for regulatory approval, combined with what he views as a higher bid, should sway shareholders that the WBD board made a mistake in choosing Netflix's offer. A Netflix-HBO max combination would create a streamer \"at such a scale that it would be bad for Hollywood and bad for the consumer,\" said Ellison, noting it would be \"anticompetitive in every way you fundamentally look at it.\"Sarandos disagreed.\"We're super confident we're going to get it across the line and finish,\" Sarandos said Monday at the UBS conference. Sarandos also jabbed Paramount's estimate of $6 billion in synergies, noting those potential cost cuts would likely mean job losses.\"We're not cutting jobs, we're making jobs,\" Sarandos said.",

    "body": "Alina Habba attends her swearing-in ceremony as interim U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 28, 2025.Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersAlina Habba, who had previously served as President Donald Trump's defense lawyer, said Monday that she was stepping down as U.S. attorney for New Jersey after judges disqualified her from that position.Habba's resignation came a week after the 3rd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals upheld a district court judge's ruling that found her ineligible for the top prosecutor's job because of the circumstances of her appointment as the interim holder of that post.Habba and Attorney General Pam Bondi said Habba would remain at the Department of Justice as senior advisor to the attorney general for U.S. attorneys.Bondi also said the DOJ would appeal the 3rd Circuit's ruling and that the department is confident it would be reversed.\"As a result of the Third Circuit's ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down in my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,\" Habba said in a statement on X.\"But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,\" Habba said.\"Make no mistake, you can take the girl out of New Jersey, but you cannot take the New Jersey out of the girl.\"Bondi said on X, \"I am saddened to accept Alina's resignation.\"\"The court's ruling has made it untenable for her to effectively run her office, with politicized judges pausing trials designed to bring violent criminals to justice,\" Bondi said. \"These judges should not be able to countermand the President's choice of attorneys entrusted with carrying out the executive branch's core responsibility of prosecuting crime.\"Trump called the reasons for Habba's resignation \"a shame.\"\"She's not disqualified,\" Trump said.\"You got a blue slip thing that's horrible,\" Trump said, referring to the practice of the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow effective vetoes of nominations  of U.S. attorneys unless the senators from the state housing that office agree on the person nominated.\"It's a shame ... Republicans should be ashamed of themselves\" for allowing it to go on, Trump said.Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche appointed three people to supervise the criminal, civil and appellate, and administrative functions of the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office in light of Habba's departure.Lindsey Halligan, another former lawyer for Trump, was recently disqualified by a judge from serving as the top federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia because of the circumstances of her appointment.Because of Halligan's disqualification, the grand jury indictments she obtained against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed last month.Bondi appointed Habba as interim U.S. attorney in March after her predecessor resigned.Trump later nominated her to hold the post permanently, but her nomination was never considered by the Senate, as is required. The DOJ engaged in a byzantine series of maneuvers that it argued enabled Habba to automatically become the acting U.S. attorney, but a federal judge and then the 3rd Circuit rejected that effort, saying they failed to comply with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.— Additional reporting by Justin Papp and Garrett Downs",

    "body": "watch nowLate fall tends to be the time when the most homes come off the market, as so-far unsuccessful sellers would rather not sit through the slowest winter months. In October, however, delistings, which are reported with a one-month lag, were up 45.5% year to date and rose nearly 38% from October 2024, according to a new report from Realtor.com. The report calls it an \"unusually high rate,\" as this is now the highest delisting year since Realtor.com began tracking in 2022. Delistings started to rise in June and have remained elevated for five straight months. About 6% of active listings are coming off the market each month, which is typically only seen in the dead of winter. In addition, more potential buyers are heading to what Realtor.com calls \"refuge markets.\" These are areas where home prices are much more affordable and didn't see the run-up in prices during the first years of the pandemic. \"Rising delistings and the growth of refuge markets capture the push and pull defining today's housing market,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"These dynamics reflect how higher rates and years of rapid price growth have rewritten the rules of engagement for both buyers and sellers.\"  Hale does forecast a gradual improvement next year, with potentially lower mortgage rates and more consistent supply creating an increasingly balanced market between buyer and seller.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Some of the cities that saw the most price growth over the past five years are now seeing the largest share of frustrated sellers. Miami, Denver and Houston saw the highest ratio of homes delisted compared with newly listed.The median list price in November nationally was 0.4% lower than November 2024, according to Realtor.com. It was still, however, 36% higher than November 2019, pre-pandemic. New listings were up just 1.7% from a year ago.Price gains are much stronger in refuge markets, like Grand Rapids, Michigan, where they're up 5.5% year over year and St. Louis where they're up 5%. Cleveland, Milwaukee and Pittsburgh round out the top-performing refuge markets, according to the report. Prices in these markets are still 20%-30% lower than the national median. Another troubling trend this fall -- canceled contracts. Roughly 15% of home purchase agreements were canceled in October, up from 14% the year before, according to Redfin. Cancellations are now well above pre-pandemic levels. Regionally, San Antonio saw the most canceled deals, with more than 1 in 5 (21%) pending home sales falling through in October. It was followed by Fort Lauderdale, Florida (20%), Fort Worth, Texas (19.7%), Las Vegas (19.2%) and Jacksonville, Florida (19.2%). The report cited high housing costs as well as economic uncertainty.

Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Friday, July 12, 2019.Patrick T. Fallon / Bloomberg / Getty ImagesWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway announced a number of structural changes before the legendary CEO steps aside at the end of this year, among them the departure of Todd Combs, investment manager and Geico CEO.Combs, 54, will be joining JPMorgan Chase as head of the bank's new Security and Resiliency Initiative, to find direct equity investments in the defense, aerospace, health care and energy industries.Combs \"has resigned to accept an interesting and important job at JPMorgan,\" said Buffett, 95, in a press release from Berkshire. \"Todd made many great hires at Geico and broadened its horizons. JPMorgan, as usually is the case, has made a good decision.\"Combs joined Berkshire in 2010 from his hedge fund Castle Point and was brought in, along with Ted Weschler, to help manage Berkshire's portfolio of investments. Buffett is handing over the CEO reins to Greg Abel in 2026 and Combs' departure leaves some questions as to how the sizable equity holdings of Berkshire, which include Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola, will continue to be managed when he steps down. Berkshire shares traded lower on Monday following the management changes with perhaps some concern that other executives could depart when Buffett is no longer at the helm. Berkshire's B shares were last off by about 2.5%.Among some of the other notable changes at Berkshire are the retirement effective in June 2027 of Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg, who served under Buffett for 40 years. Charles Chang, current CFO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy will succeed him. Nancy Pierce, chief operating officer of Geico, will replace Combs as CEO of Geico. The conglomerate also said the CEO of its NetJets unit, Adam Johnson, will serve in a new role as president of Berkshire's consumer products, service and retailing businesses. Abel will directly oversee the remaining noninsurance businesses, Berkshire said.$1.5 trillion JPMorgan initiativeCombs, who was a member of JPMorgan's board of directors, will also become a special advisor to CEO Jamie Dimon. Combs is giving up his board seat as he moves into the new role.\"Todd Combs is one of the greatest investors and leaders I've known, having successfully managed investments alongside the most respected and successful long-term investor of our time, Warren Buffett,\" said Dimon in a release. \"Having served nine years on our Board, he truly understands all aspects of our company, and he supports the role we play helping make the world better and safer for all its citizens.\"Combs will have $10 billion to deploy to start with for JPMorgan's new initiative, which the bank said will ultimately commit $1.5 trillion to spur economic growth and \"to make the world more secure.\"The Security and Resiliency Initiative will have an outside council to guide its strategy which includes, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Chairman Michael Dell, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire B shares, YTDDespite his advanced age, Buffett surprised shareholders at the conglomerate's annual meeting in May when he said he would be stepping aside for Abel, who is 63 and current vice chairman of noninsurance operations. The stock has underperformed this year in part because of angst over what Berkshire will look like after Buffett, who took over the textiles manufacturer in 1965 and turned it into an investment holding company that went on to post an unprecedented long-term track record. Berkshire shares are up 9% this year, below the 16.6% return of the S&P 500. Buffett, who will remain chairman, noted in a Thanksgiving message that he still feels good, however he is moving slowly and reading with \"increasing difficulty.\"",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, the ICEBlock app is displayed on an Apple iPhone on October 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesThe developer of ICEBlock, an app used to track local sightings of ICE agents and other law enforcement authorities, sued the U.S. government on Monday for allegedly infringing his free speech rights.After Apple removed the app from its store in October, creator Joshua Aaron criticized the Trump administration for pressuring the iPhone maker to ban ICEBlock over fears it could be used to harm U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Attorneys for Aaron wrote in the complaint that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi made clear that the government \"used its regulatory power to coerce a private platform to suppress First Amendment-protected expression,\" when she said the Department of Justice demanded that Apple remove the app, which was only available on iOS.The suit claimed Apple cited one of its review guidelines that says apps can't allow objectionable content that can be used to harm a targeted group. Apple said ICEBlock targets law enforcement officers, according to the suit. Aaron told CNBC on Monday that his complaint was inspired by the U.S. founding fathers, who held the view that, \"The survival of our democratic republic isn't guaranteed.\"  \"It requires constant vigilance, active and informed participation of its citizens,\" Aaron said. \"When we see or think our government is doing something wrong, it's our duty to hold them accountable. And that is the heart of this lawsuit.\"Aaron said attorneys with law firm Sher Tremonte in New York are representing him on a pro bono basis.It's not the first time Apple has made such a move. In 2019, the company removed an app that Hong Kong protesters used to track police movements during a public dispute over the city's relationship with China. Apple said at the time that the app was removed because criminals used it to target and ambush police.Aaron had developed an Android version of his app, but said he couldn't release it. After Apple's move to remove ICE Block, Google parent Alphabet also agreed to ban apps that help people track the whereabouts of law enforcement from its app store, he said.Representatives for Apple and Google didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The DOJ didn't also didn't immediately provide a comment. Aaron launched ICEBlock in April in response to the aggressive crackdown on immigrants by the Trump administration. According to new data obtained by the University of California at Berkeley via the school's Deportation Data Project, \"more than a third of the roughly 220,000 people arrested by ICE officers in the first nine months of the Trump administration had no criminal histories.\" Gallup's polling data released on Nov. 28 found only 37% of US voters approved of the way Trump is handling immigration.Read the full complaint here: watch now",

Scott Olson | Getty ImagesA federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping ban on new wind power projects in the U.S., a major victory for an industry that has been singled out by the White House since the administration's first day.Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts ruled that Trump's ban is \"arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,\" tossing out the president's action in its entirey.  Trump issued a memorandum on Jan. 20 halting permits and leases for offshore and onshore wind farms, pending federal review. Saris said that federal agencies had failed to provide a reasoned explanation for such a drastic change in U.S. policy. Seventeen states led by New York Attorney General Letitia James sued Trump in May to overturn the president's ban. They argued that it created \"an existential threat to the wind industry.\"watch now\"This is a big victory in our fight to keep tackling the climate crisis and protect one of our best sources of clean, reliable, and affordable energy,\" James said in a post on social media platform X. States in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in particular have been pursuing offshore wind projects to meet future energy demand as they seek to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions. White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement that \"offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.\"  watch now",

    "body": "Mike Cavanagh, President of Comcast Corporation attends the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 10, 2024 in Sun Valley, Idaho. TKevork Djansezian | Getty ImagesComcast's top brass on Monday pulled the curtain back on the company's unsuccessful bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, detailing an offer far different from its rival bidders. Mike Cavanagh, Comcast president and soon-to-be co-CEO, walked through the specifics of the proposal —and the company's thinking — during the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference on Monday, just days after Comcast was knocked out of the bidding war for Warner Bros. Discovery assets. \"When we looked at the circumstances of how it all came to be ... we didn't expect that we had a high likelihood of prevailing with a deal that made sense to us. We debated whether to bother or not. Do we want the disruption? Do we want the distraction?\" said Cavanagh. \"But it's our job, so we thought better to take a look and do the work and see where it leads. You never know. And so that's what we did.\" Comcast, like Netflix, bid solely on the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO Max streaming business. Paramount Skydance's offer was for the entirety of the business, including the cable TV portfolio comprised of networks like CNN and TNT. \"We are not interested in stressing the Comcast balance sheet,\" Cavanagh said Monday. \"As a result, that meant our proposal was light, relative to other proposals from what I gather, on cash.\" Last week Netflix was named the winning bidder. On Monday Paramount launched a hostile offer. Comcast offered \"a significant chunk of equity in a combined entertainment company,\" which would have put NBCUniversal — including its Universal theme parks and film studio as well as its broadcast network and streaming platform Peacock — together with Warner Bros.' studio and HBO Max, Cavanagh said. The resulting combination would have been a publicly traded, controlled subsidiary of Comcast. That vehicle would provide shareholders with returns, but would not constitute a full spinout, which would have involved a complete separation of the companies. Comcast's NBCUniversal is in the midst of a spinout of its portfolio of cable TV networks, which includes CNBC. In contrast, Netflix's proposed transaction is comprised of cash and stock, valued at $27.75 per WBD share. The equity value of the transaction is $72 billion, with a total enterprise value of about $82.7 billion.Paramount went straight to WBD shareholders on Monday with an all-cash, $30 per share tender offer, which equates to an enterprise value of $108.4 billion. \"We respect and understand the decision of the Warner Brothers board to obviously prefer the certainty of high levels of cash or collared stock,\" said Cavanagh.Comcast leadership has long said the company's bar for doing mergers and acquisitions is high. \"Good news is that we like what we are doing ... and we roll on with a lot of focus, but I think we're better for having taken a look,\" Cavanagh said. Peacock aspirations Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, 2023: Birds Of A Feather Stream Together - Peacock FloatNBC | NBCUniversal | Getty ImagesComcast's NBCUniversal has been shape-shifting in recent years — from the spinout of its cable TV networks, to a heavy focus on bulking up on sports rights like the NBA, to building out its theme parks presence. The company has also been building out Peacock. NBCUniversal launched its streaming play in 2020 and it has slowly built up since then. As of Sept. 30 Peacock had 41 million subscribers, paling in comparison to HBO Max's 128 million customers as of Sept. 30 and Netflix's more than 300 million customers as of late 2024.Cavanagh said Monday that had Comcast's offer for Warner Bros. Discovery been successful, \"it would have been an interesting play.\"\"It probably would have changed our streaming aspirations to be global streaming aspirations by necessity,\" he added.Sports have been key to the playbook in fueling Peacock's subscriber growth. NBCUniversal has nabbed exclusive NFL games to Peacock in addition to simulcasting its \"Sunday Night Football\" package from NBC's broadcast network. It paid heavily to bring back the NBA to NBC, with exclusive games for Peacock, too. The Olympics have also be integral in its growth. Live events such as the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade have helped boost viewership across TV and streaming, too. Peacock has also been increasing its subscription price, similar to its peers. In July Peacock raised prices again, just months ahead of the beginning of the NBA season. Unlike most of its competitors, Peacock has yet to report a profit, however. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Peacock reported losses of $217 million, an improvement from $436 million in losses during the same period last year. Cavanagh noted Monday that Peacock improved in the trailing 12 months by $900 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Peacock's losses are expected to \"meaningfully improve\" next year compared with 2025, with \"a trajectory to a positive future.\" Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through 2036. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "Corn and soybean farmer Don Swanson prepares to harvest his corn crop as he and other Iowa farmers struggle with the effects of weather and ongoing tariffs resulting from the trade war between the U.S. and China that continue to affect agricultural business, in Eldon, Iowa, on Oct. 4, 2019.Kia Johnson | ReutersPresident Donald Trump announced Monday that his administration is doling out a $12 billion aid package to farmers who have been squeezed by a trade war between the U.S. and its top economic partners.The funds will come from U.S. tariff revenues, Trump said during a roundtable event at the White House.Most of that money — up to $11 billion — will go to the U.S. Agriculture Department's new Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which will provide one-time payments to row crop farmers, a White House official told CNBC earlier Monday.The remaining $1 billion will be reserved as the USDA evaluates changing market conditions, according to the official.The president was joined at the event by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, as well as members of Congress and farmers who raise cattle and grow corn, cotton, sorghum, soybean, rice, wheat and potatoes.Democratic lawmakers slammed the administration ahead of the announcement.\"Trump wants credit for trying to fix a mess of his making,\" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in an X post.\"Trump's tariffs are hammering our farmers, making it more expensive to grow food and pushing farmers into bankruptcy,\" he wrote. \"Farmers need markets to sell to—not a consolation prize for the ones he wrecked.\"\"Trump's plan to bail out farmers won't even get agriculture communities back to even,\" Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the Senate Finance Committee's top-ranking Democrat, said in a statement. \"They're still paying more for fertilizer, equipment and seeds, while grown-in-the-USA farm goods are facing more obstacles than ever in foreign markets.\"The administration is framing the money as \"bridge payments\" that will help farmers weather the period between the U.S. abandoning former President Joe Biden's economic policies and Trump's current agenda kicking in.But some in America's agriculture industry say they are suffering as a result of the wide-ranging trade war — especially due to conflicts with China, a major U.S. customer.China stopped buying U.S. soybeans for several months, most notably during the key harvest season beginning in the fall.Beijing resumed purchasing some soybeans in late October as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping neared a tentative trade truce. But China's imports of the crop do not appear to be rebounding to their current levels, and Beijing's stockpiles have swelled to recent highs.Bessent has maintained that China is on track to meet its projected purchase of 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of February.

    "body": "Pakin Songmor | Moment | Getty ImagesIf you own jewelry made of gold or another precious metal, you should probably check your homeowners insurance to see if your coverage is sufficient.The market price of gold has shot up over the last year, as have the prices paid for other precious metals like platinum and silver, both of which are also commonly used in jewelry. This means the value of your pieces could be higher than what your insurance would pay if they were stolen or destroyed in, say, a fire — especially if you have owned the jewelry for quite some time.\"A piece you bought or last appraised years ago could now cost significantly more to replace,\" said Loretta Worters, spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute.Gold prices surgeThe price paid for a troy ounce (31.1 grams) of gold is up about 58% over the last year to about $4,200 in Monday morning trading. Platinum and silver prices (per troy ounce) have also seen outsized jumps of 76% to about $1,651 and 84% to about $58, respectively, in the same period. Since 2000, the price of gold has increased roughly 1,400%. That compares to the Standard & Poor's 500 index's gain of about 382% over the same time.Gold pieces accounted for the largest share — 54.9% — of the $366.8 billion global jewelry market last year, according to Grand View Research. Retail prices are generally higher than the intrinsic value of the metal in jewelry, although how high depends on the quality of the piece, as well as its actual gold content.The commonly referred-to spot price is for pure gold (24 karat), which is soft and malleable. Jewelry makers combine gold with other metals — often silver, zinc or copper — to make the piece sturdier or give it a particular hue. For example, 14 karat gold jewelry is 58.3% gold, while 10 karat is 41.7% gold. The higher the karat, the greater the gold content — and in turn, the higher the intrinsic value.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWhy jewelry owners may want to check their homeowners insurance coverageWhat another Fed cut could mean for your personal borrowing costsMany student loan borrowers say it's harder to cover basic needs: surveyAlmost all companies with 401(k)s allow Roth savings — who benefits401(k) changes for 2026 —one is 'impactful' for high earners, CFP saysKeeping your 401(k) when you retire is easier.

Standard homeowners or rental insurance policies generally have low coverage for jewelry.\"Most homeowners and renters policies cover jewelry as personal property for common risks like theft or fire, but they typically apply special limits, often around $1,000 to $2,500 total, and don't cover accidental loss or wear and tear,\" said Sarah Cast, specialty lines vice president at Allstate.\"If someone owns higher-value pieces, especially with gold values climbing, it's smart to check those limits and consider options to fill the gap,\" Cast said.Higher-value pieces should be 'scheduled'You may be able to add a rider to your existing policy that provides more coverage, or you could get a standalone policy. Either way, because some options impose per-piece limits, be sure you know the value of each piece of jewelry.\"Many insurers and advisors recommend reappraising jewelry every few years, especially when market conditions (like gold price surges) shift to ensure coverage stays adequate,\" Worters of the Insurance Information Institute said.If you have high-value items, you may want to \"schedule\" them — that is, create a detailed list that identifies each piece, including photos and an appraisal or sales receipt for each, along with the cost to replace them.Coverage can range from a few thousand dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars, depending on the items and the insurer, Worters said.The deductible for these policies typically is no more than $500, she said. The premium is usually 1% to 3% of the insured value each year.You also may notice broader coverage for perils: including mysterious disappearance, accidental loss and sometimes damage, according to Worters.Some insurers offer riders or \"valuable-articles\" policies that automatically adjust for rising value under certain conditions, she said.In the meantime, \"take inventory with photos and appraisals and keep everything in a safe place,\" Allstate's Cast said. \"Then review your policy details with your insurer and connect with an agent ... to decide whether adding valuable item protection or buying a separate jewelry policy makes the most sense.\"",

Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesGoogle on Monday said it plans to launch the first of its AI-powered glasses in 2026, as the tech company ramps up its efforts to compete against Meta in a heating consumer market for AI devices. The Alphabet-owned company is collaborating on hardware design with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker, with whom Google agreed to a $150 million commitment in May.Google plans to release audio-only glasses that will allow users to speak with the Gemini artificial-intelligence assistant, the company said in a blog. Google also said there will be glasses with an in-lens display that show users information such as navigation directions and language translations. The company said the first of these glasses will arrive next year, but it did not specify which styles that will include. In a Monday filing, Warby Parker said that the first of its glasses in partnership with Google are expected to launch in 2026.The glasses will be built on top of Android XR, Google's operating system for its headsets.Google's Monday updates come after the company in May announced that it would be getting back into the smart glasses game. At the time, co-founder Sergey Brin said he learned from Google's past mistakes of failed smart glasses, citing less advanced AI and a lack of supply chain knowledge, which led to expensive price points.\"Now, in the AI world, the things these glasses can do to help you out without constantly distracting you — that capability is much higher,\" Brin said in May.The AI wearables space has been gaining traction with Meta leading the pack. the social media company's Ray-Ban Meta glasses were met with surprising success. The glasses, which were designed in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica, are infused with the Meta AI digital assistantMeta also released its own display glasses in September, which allows users to see features like messages, photo previews and live captions through a small display that's built into one of the device's lenses. Other companies like Snap and Alibaba have also been churning out their own AI glasses offerings as the small but competitive market continues to grow.Google on Monday also revealed more software updates to the Galaxy XR headset, including the ability to link it to Windows PCs and a travel mode that will allows the device to be used in planes and cars.WATCH: Google's vibe-coding playwatch now",

Kamil Krzaczynski | Afp | Getty ImagesUnited Airlines is joining Delta Air Lines in holding steady its requirements to earn elite frequent flyer status next year after it raised the bar in 2025.Airlines have spent years making it more expensive to get high-tier status, which comes with perks like early boarding, free first-class upgrades (when they're available), waived baggage fees or even airport lounge access.But hordes of elite travelers in the wake of the pandemic — when airlines let many customers hold onto their status — have meant more crowded early boarding groups. And a rise in premium credit card-toting customers has led to longer waits at some airport lounges than at TSA checkpoints.Airline executives have also said that more customers are willing to pay cash to sit in first class, making fewer seats available for complimentary upgrades that are a draw for many consumers to chase status.watch nowFor United, its program is more in balance now, said Luc Bondar, president of United's MileagePlus loyalty program. \"When you have benefits like upgrades, if everyone has status, then … fewer and fewer customers are going to get access to upgrades,\" he said in an interview. \"We feel good that they're at the right level.\"Read more CNBC airline newsDelta says government shutdown cost it $200 million, but forecasts strong travel demand into 2026The government shutdown is over.

Can it catch up?United is making some changes next year, when the status flyers earn will apply to travel in 2027. The airline is changing how its so-called Plus Points — a currency beyond regular miles that can be earned by top-tier Platinum and 1K loyalty program elites — can be used. The carrier currently has a mileage chart, where customers need to earn set amounts for certain cabins, like its top Polaris long-haul business class. In 2027, it will move instead to dynamic pricing based on demand. United next year will also allow elites with high-level 1K status to earn Plus Points through co-branded credit card spending.The carrier also said status holders and United Chase credit card holders will also have \"increased access\" to Polaris Saver Award fares, which the airline said will make it easier to book in the top cabin.Airlines' lucrative loyalty programs bring in billions in profits, in part when the carriers sell miles to banks when customers earn them through credit card spending. Last year, United raised the amount customers had to spend to reach frequent flyer status in 2026. The thresholds to reach elite status in the airline's MileagePlus program went up about 25% and include either spending on a co-branded card or a combination of spending and flying.Last week, Delta said it would keep its earning requirements the same next year for 2027 status.American Airlines hasn't announced a change to its frequent flyer program elite thresholds this year. The carrier trails Delta and United in profits and is trying to win over more big spenders with refreshed cabins and lounges, though its rivals' decision to hold elite-earning requirements steady could pressure American to do the same.",

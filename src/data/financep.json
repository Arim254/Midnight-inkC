Foley Federal Courthouse in Albany, N.Y. Will Waldron | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesA judge disqualified a federal prosecutor from overseeing investigations into New York Attorney General Letitia James, ruling Thursday that he had been serving in his post unlawfully when he requested subpoenas.U.S. District Judge Lorna G. Schofield blocked subpoenas requested by John Sarcone, the acting U.S. attorney for the Northern District of New York.The judge said the Department of Justice did not follow statutory procedure after judges declined to extend Sarcone's tenure. \"When the Executive branch of government skirts restraints put in place by Congress and then uses that power to subject political adversaries to criminal investigations, it acts without lawful authority. Subpoenas issued under that authority are invalid. The subpoenas are quashed, and Mr. Sarcone is disqualified from further participation in the underlying investigations.\"James, a Democrat, had challenged Sarcone's authority after he issued subpoenas seeking information about lawsuits she filed against President Donald Trump, claiming he had committed fraud in his business dealings, and separately against the National Rifle Association and some of its former leaders.Justice Department lawyers say Sarcone was appointed properly and that the subpoenas were valid. James claims the inquiry into her lawsuits is part of a campaign of baseless investigations and prosecutions of Trump's perceived enemies.The judge said the Justice Department did not follow statutory procedure after judges declined to extend Sarcone's tenure. \"Instead, on the same day that the judges declined to extend Mr. Sarcone's appointment, the Department took coordinated steps — through personnel moves and shifting titles — to install Mr. Sarcone as Acting U.S. Attorney. Federal law does not permit such a workaround.\"James' office issued a statement calling Thursday's ruling \"an important win for the rule of law.\"\"We will continue to defend our office's successful litigation from this administration's political attacks,\" the statement said.Attorney General Letitia James listens as New York Gov.

Santiago | Getty ImagesA call and an email to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of New York were made seeking comment.The ruling is the latest to address the legality of unusual maneuvers the Trump administration has performed to try and keep its favored candidates for U.S. attorney in those jobs indefinitely, without going through the usual process of getting them confirmed in the U.S. Senate.On Dec. 1, a federal appeals court ruled that Alina Habba, Trump's former personal lawyer, had unlawfully stayed on as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey for longer than a 120-day limit set by federal law. Habba resigned the next week.In November, a federal judge in Virginia dismissed indictments brought there against James and former FBI Director James Comey. That judge said the interim U.S. attorney who brought the charges, Lindsey Halligan, was unlawfully appointed.Lindsey Halligan, outside of the White House, Aug. 20, 2025, in Washington.Jacquelyn Martin | APAlso, a federal judge in Nevada in September disqualified from several cases the Trump administration's pick to be U.S. attorney there. And a federal judge in Los Angeles disqualified the acting U.S. attorney in Southern California from several cases after concluding he had stayed in the job longer than allowed by law.In New York, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed Sarcone to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in March. But when his 120-day term elapsed, judges in the district declined to keep him in the post.Bondi then appointed Sarcone as a special attorney and designated him first assistant U.S. attorney for the district, moves that federal officials say allows him to serve as an acting U.S. attorney.James' lawyers called the maneuvers an end-run around federal law. They claimed that because Sarcone lacks legitimate authority to act as U.S. attorney, the subpoenas should be blocked. The lawyers argued that Sarcone should be disqualified.Federal lawyers argued in court that the U.S. attorney general has broad authority to appoint attorneys within her department and to delegate her functions to those attorneys.Sarcone was part of Trump's legal team during the 2016 presidential campaign and worked for the U.S. General Services Administration as the regional administrator for the Northeast and Caribbean during Trump's first term.",

    "body": "Pedestrians walk past a Saks Fifth Avenue store in Chicago, Dec. 30, 2025.Scott Olson | Getty ImagesBeleaguered retail chain Saks Global is struggling to line up as much as $1 billion in financing to keep its business afloat during a potential Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, CNBC has learned. The luxury chain has been working to secure a \"debtor-in-possession\" loan, which would allow it to fund operations in the event of a potential bankruptcy filing, people familiar with the matter said. But investors have so far shown little interest in lending Saks the money because they're skeptical the company can successfully reorganize and pay them back, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions are private.While DIP lenders get repaid before other creditors during bankruptcy proceedings, they don't always recoup their full investment, and some investors are concerned that could happen if they finance Saks, the people said.The storied 159-year-old department store, which now owns Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, is both a destination and a symbol for luxury fashion, known for offering top brands like Chanel and Dior alongside up and comers like Good American. Across the entire enterprise, Saks Global has more than 70 full-line luxury stores and about 100 off-price locations. Since Saks missed an interest payment to bondholders late last month, only a \"limited number\" of investors have shown interest in financing the DIP loan, while a number of others have declined to get involved, the people said. Saks declined to comment on investor interest in its fundraising efforts. A wide array of firms invest in companies that could be headed for bankruptcy, including top banks and private equity. However, the only firms likely to be interested in investing in Saks at this point are either liquidators that also have investment vehicles or alternative asset managers that have experience in distressed retail, one source said. Still, even some of those investors have declined to get involved with Saks' DIP loan, the people said. Liquidation is one of several potential outcomes Saks faces. However, if it can't line up a DIP loan, which would be used to pay for essential expenses like payroll, rent and inventory, that scenario would be more likely. The retailer is already struggling to pay those costs.Failure to line up financing would prevent Saks from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would give the company a chance to reorganize and potentially find a buyer willing to take on its business as a going concern. It could then be faced with Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which is reserved for liquidation. That could mean the end for one of the most fabled department stores in history, whose flagship store on Fifth Avenue, considered by some to be its most valuable asset, has become a global destination. In the meantime, Saks has also been in talks with liquidators for a number of stores that are in the process of closing, but not yet the entire chain, the people said.Saks' troubles have been mounting since it acquired its longtime rival Neiman Marcus in a $2.7 billion deal in 2024, which was heavily financed with debt.The tie-up between the two rivals was expected to create a luxury retail powerhouse that could better streamline costs and negotiate with vendors.Instead, Saks has struggled to pay its vendors on time, leading to inventory gaps and declining sales. A slowdown in the overall luxury market, which has seen growth stagnate in recent years, has compounded the issues.",

    "body": "The U.S. government is considering investing in a company's critical minerals mining projects in Greenland, its CEO has told CNBC, ahead of high-stakes talks between Washington and Danish officials over the island's future.The projects are run by mining company Amaroq, which operates in South Greenland and is involved in extracting or exploring gold, copper, germanium and gallium, among other critical mineral deposits.Discussions with U.S. government bodies about the potential investment opportunities are ongoing and haven't been finalized, Amaroq CEO Eldur Ólafsson told CNBC in an interview.Deals could involve \"offtake agreements, infrastructure support and credit lines,\" Ólafsson added, though he declined to comment on what specific projects the U.S. government was interested in.When asked to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson, mentioning Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, told CNBC: \"The United States is eager to build lasting commercial relationships that benefit Americans and the people of Greenland.\"President Trump reiterated the importance of Greenland to U.S. defense and underscored his commitment to the relationship by designating Governor Landry as Special Envoy to Greenland.\"CNBC approached the Export-Import Bank of the United States, or EXIM, for comment but had not received a response as this article went live.Ólafsson's comments come as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up talk of acquiring Greenland, which he sees as integral to national security, following a dramatic military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Saturday.European nations have been scrambling to respond to escalating rhetoric about Greenland from the U.S., which has refused to rule out military action.U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to meet with officials from Denmark next week to discuss Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory.watch nowGreenland's critical mineralsThe White House sees Greenland's deposits as a potential way to break China's dominance in the critical minerals.Rare-earth companies with projects in the Arctic island surged earlier this week on U.S. comments about acquiring the territory.Trump has mainly emphasized national security when discussing Greenland in recent days, but former national security advisor Mike Waltz told Fox News in January 2025 that U.S. interest in the island was about \"critical minerals.\"Some experts have cautioned that extracting critical minerals from Greenland isn't economically viable due to the harsh conditions and lack of infrastructure, but Ólafsson told CNBC that it was realistic with proper planning and logistics.He compared the process to significant critical minerals mines in Russia and Alaska, which, he said, were built in similar conditions.He said that \"one of the biggest challenges in any mining project is usually some [transporting minerals] long distances on land,\" but added that many of Greenland's mineral deposits were near \"deep fjords,\" meaning they could be easier to ship. Climate change has transformed some parts of Greenland, with ice melting to reveal wetlands, areas of shrub and barren rock. This has made some of the island's strategic minerals more accessible for mining firms.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Jan. 6, 2026.Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.Wall Street goes shopping in the Sun BeltThose concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. \"While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation,\" analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. \"Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase,\" BTIG said in a note. Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attends a briefing at the White House in Washington, Jan. 7, 2026.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersNew federal dietary recommendations have sparked mixed reactions from the embattled restaurant industry, as changing guidelines could encourage Americans to dine out less often or choose from a smaller pool of restaurants when they do leave home.The departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture unveiled the nutrition guidelines on Wednesday. The recommendations, which are updated every five years, pushed for higher consumption of protein and full-fat dairy and reduced intake of processed foods and sugary drinks. The guidelines are primarily a public health tool for federal agencies, health-care providers and nutrition experts, so it's unclear how much they will influence individual consumer choices. Although the recommendations largely focus on eating at home, they lightly touched on the restaurant industry as well.\"When dining out, choose nutrient-dense options,\" the guidelines advise.While the recommendations could discourage Americans from spending at restaurants — especially at a time when high inflation has curbed trips to dine out — some pockets of the industry had a positive reaction to the changes. The changes could give a particular boost to struggling fast-casual chains like Sweetgreen and Chipotle, which have long touted the type of natural ingredients championed by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s \"Make American Healthy Again\" movement.One lobbying executive who represents restaurant companies, whose organization was involved in meetings with the White House on the new guidelines, said the outcome could have been \"far worse\" for the sector. The person, who declined to be named because their organization was involved in private discussions, said the end result was better for the industry than proposed guidance from earlier in 2025 was. However, the executive said they are still concerned the guidelines could encourage Americans to eat at home when diners have affordable options to incorporate those foods at restaurants. That implication could also ruffle feathers among restaurant chains and their franchisees.Despite those potential concerns from some, industry lobbying group the National Restaurant Association backed the new guidelines.\"Now, more than ever, restaurant operators are offering a wider variety of options, allowing consumers to choose what best fits their dietary needs, preferences, and lifestyles. We congratulate Secretary Kennedy and the Trump Administration on the release of the new guidelines and look forward to continued collaboration with policymakers to ensure that nutrition guidance remains practical, flexible, and supportive of access and innovation,\" National Restaurant Association spokesman Sean Kennedy said in a statement to CNBC. Restaurant franchise lobbyist the International Franchise Association, called the approach \"nuanced\" and said it may limit the number of price increases restaurants have to make. \"Fortunately, the more nuanced approach of these guidelines helps ensure our members will not have to raise prices and that consumers can continue to make their own choices,\" the group said. \"Any future regulations or guidance must keep potential cost increases top of mind, as restaurant owners already face numerous regulatory burdens and supply chain challenges, which most often disproportionately affect small business owners, like franchisees, and ultimately, American consumers.\"How fast casual could benefitSome of the most supportive reactions came from chains that had been beaten down in 2025, including Chipotle and Sweetgreen. Both fast-casual names saw pullbacks from younger consumers who continue to struggle in a K-shaped economy, where spending has concentrated more among the highest earners.Sweetgreen, which was the biggest restaurant sector laggard last year with a nearly 80% stock decline, cheered the new guidelines. A spokesperson told CNBC in a statement: \"We keep ultra-processed ingredients and added sugars out of our restaurants, source transparently from partners we know and trust, and cook our food from scratch. That is why we are excited to see the new Food Pyramid so clearly emphasizing whole, real, and unprocessed foods.\"Sweetgreen founder and CEO Jonathan Neman wrote on X, \"The U.S. government is for the 1st time urging Americans to avoid highly processed food, added sugar, and refined carbohydrates. Today, the government finally told the American people the truth. Avoid highly processed food (which is 70% of a child's diet).

At times, his beliefs, like his advocacy for beef tallow and encouragement of more red meat in diets, have run afoul of both public health experts and industry players, like McDonald's. Kennedy's criticism of processed foods has put fast-food chains on the defensive, although President Donald Trump is a vocal and loyal fan, particularly of McDonald's.",

Graeme Sloan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTwo members of the House of Representatives asked a federal judge in New York on Thursday to appoint  a so-called special master to ensure that all materials related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein are released by the Department of Justice as required by the law they promoted.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., in their request for that independent monitor, blasted the DOJ for failing to meet a Dec. 19 deadline to release all of the Epstein files.\"The conduct by the DOJ is not only a flagrant violation of the mandatory disclosure obligations under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but as this Court has recognized in its previous rulings, the behavior by the DOJ has caused serious trauma to survivors,\" Massie and Khanna wrote to Manhattan Federal Court Judge Paul Engelmayer in a letter obtained by CNBC. The letter was first reported by MS Now.\"As leads of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, we have urgent and grave concerns about DOJ's failure to comply with the Act, as well as the Department's violations of this Court's order,\" the letter said.The DOJ, in a court filing earlier this week, said that it still needs to review more than 2 million documents related to Epstein.To date, the DOJ has publicly released just a tiny fraction of that: fewer than 13,000 documents, that filing said.\"The Department of Justice is openly defying the law by refusing to release the full Epstein files. Millions of files are being kept from the public,\" Khanna said in a statement to CNBC.\"The DOJ has failed to make the necessary redactions to protect survivors while removing records after publication without any explanation,\" Khanna said.\"That is why we are requesting the appointment of a Special Master to oversee the release of the files and ensure that the DOJ is following the law,\" he said.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

    "body": "A \"Now Hiring\" sign at a Cookout fast-food restaurant in Durham, North Carolina, Nov. 25, 2025.Al Drago | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market likely showed modest improvement in December, providing some encouragement for the year ahead but nothing to get too excited about.Nonfarm payrolls likely rose by 73,000 last month while the unemployment rate edged lower to 4.5%, according to the Dow Jones consensus. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the report Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.If those numbers are near accurate, it would represent a slight step up from the 55,000 average monthly gain during the prior 11 months of 2025 and would be a bit better than the initially reported 64,000 for November. The jobless rate is half a percentage point above where it was at the start of last year.Heading into 2026, most economists see a labor market far from stellar, but at least stable.\"The year is ending stronger than it started,\" said Amy Glaser, senior vice president of business operations at Adecco Staffing. \"We've seen some positivity, both in terms of hiring as well as [a] slow down of layoffs. So [the market is] looking pretty positive going into 2026. I think it'll be the year of stability.\"The labor market moved in a tight range through most of 2025, from a peak gain of 158,000 in April to a loss of 105,000 in October. Three of the last six months saw net losses.watch now\"We're just seeing that it's not too cold, not too hot, it's kind of right in the middle,\" Glaser said. \"I think that's where we'll continue to see 2026 as folks are cautiously optimistic. We'll probably see some ups and downs and add a little bit of bumpiness along the way. It may not be linear, but at the end of the day I think the market has proved resilient.\"Though the outward signs of the labor market show unemployment at a very low rate historically speaking, some Federal Reserve policymakers worry that cracks are showing that could grow more pronounced this year.Policymakers who backed the recent run of three straight interest rate cuts have cited a need to strengthen the jobs outlook as outweighing concerns over inflation reigniting. Fed officials also have cited a \"systematic overcount\" of payroll growth as a reason for their caution.Markets have been pinning their hopes that the Fed will intervene again if needed, said Jose Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers.\"Confidence has been stronger this year on the expectation that the Fed's going to ease further,\" he said. \"That's really going to bolster the hiring in more cyclically oriented areas.\"Job growth has so far largely been concentrated in areas that benefit from expansionary fiscal policy, particularly health care and government. Glaser expects that trend to continue.Outside of that pattern, Glaser said the other trend to continue watching in 2026 is retention, or the efforts of companies to keep the staff they have, rather than lay off or aggressively hire.\"Employers are really valuing those that have stayed with them and offering increases in salaries, additional bonuses and perks,\" she said. \"The one thing that employers that are getting it right are doing ... is just this investment in upskilling and reskilling.\"Friday's release will be the first on-time report since the end of the government shutdown in mid-November. Questions have arisen over the data gaps from the shutdown, with some economists expecting the first \"clean\" report to come in February.",

The move came less than a week after Trump authorized a strike that captured the country's leader, Nicolás Maduro.The measure, known as a War Powers Resolution, only needed a simple majority to pass in the Republican-controlled Senate and would require Trump to seek the approval of Congress before using the U.S. military again in Venezuela. The measure was brought by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. The vote in the Senate was procedural, but it indicates that the measure has the votes to pass when it comes to a final vote in the Senate. It would then go to the House, where Republicans have a razor-thin majority.Later Thursday, Trump railed against the five Republicans who helped Democrats pass the measure.\"Republicans should be ashamed of the Senators that just voted with Democrats in attempting to take away our Powers to fight and defend the United States of America,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.The five GOP senators — Paul, Susan Collins of Maine, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Indiana's Todd Young — \"should never be elected to office again,\" Trump wrote.Collins, responding to Trump's post, told reporters on Capitol Hill, \"I guess that means he would prefer to have [Maine's Democratic Gov.

    "body": "GM Hummer EV production in Detroit.Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General MotorsDETROIT – General Motors said Thursday it will record $7.1 billion in special charges for the fourth quarter of last year related to its pullback in electric vehicles and restructuring efforts in China.The Detroit automaker said in a public filing that the charges include roughly $6 billion related to changes to its EV plans amid weakening demand and $1.1 billion, including $500 million in cash, largely related to its previously announced overhaul of a Chinese joint venture.The charges will impact GM's net income but not adjusted results. The announcement was broadly anticipated after the Detroit automaker in October said it was reevaluating its EV plans and would initially take a $1.6 billion charge during the third quarter as a result. GM's new writedowns come after crosstown rival Ford Motor said in December it expected to record about $19.5 billion in special charges related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in all-electric vehicle investments.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" GM CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC in October.watch nowAutomakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.GM said the fourth-quarter EV impairments include non-cash charges of approximately $1.8 billion. The remaining $4.2 billion is related to supplier commercial settlements, contract cancellation fees and other charges, which will have a cash impact when paid.Additional EV charges are expected to hit this year but at a lower amount than 2025's impairments, GM said in the filing Thursday: \"We expect to recognize additional material cash and non-cash charges in 2026 related to continued commercial negotiations with our supply base, which we believe will be significantly less than the EV-related charges incurred in 2025.\"The automaker also said it may incur additional charges related to its emissions credits due to proposed regulatory changes to the greenhouse gas emission standards by the Trump administration.GM was among the first automakers to invest billions of dollars in an EV market that ultimately didn't materialize. At one point, the company was planning to invest $30 billion in EVs, including dozens of new models and capacity for battery production.The U.S. EV segment overall has experienced a sales slump after the Trump administration in September put an early end to a $7,500 federal tax credit previously available for EV buyers.Shares of GM closed Thursday at $85.13, up almost 4% on the day. The stock had a banner year in 2025, gaining more than 50% to lead all major publicly traded automakers.GM is set to report its fourth-quarter results on Jan. 27.",

The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, did not immediately respond to CNBC's requests for clarity.watch nowFHFA Director Bill Pulte posted on X later Thursday, \"We are on it. Thanks to President Trump, Fannie and Freddie will be executing.\" Hours before Trump's post, Pulte said in a CNBC interview that he expects Trump will make a decision in the next month or two on a possible initial public offering of Fannie and Freddie.Trump claimed that his latest directive would help restore \"affordability,\" a word that has become key to Democrats' political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.Trump heaped criticism on the administration of his predecessor, Joe Biden, claiming that Biden had \"ignored the Housing Market\" amid a slew of other policy failures.\"Everything was broken, but I, as President of the United States, have already fixed it!\" Trump declared. \"Now, I am giving special attention to the Housing Market.\"\"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount — AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE — and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH,\" he wrote.\"Because of this, I am instructing my Representatives to BUY $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN MORTGAGE BONDS.\"It was not clear from Trump's post whether it would be Fannie and Freddie, the Treasury Department or another entity doing the buying.The Federal Reserve in the past has purchased mortgage bonds in an effort to lower rates, as part of the monetary policy known as \"quantitative easing.\" But the executive branch cannot order the independent central bank to initiate those transactions.The Treasury has purchased mortgage bonds in the past during times of extreme turmoil, such as the housing crisis of 2008 and 2009.It was also not clear whether this buying would have any impact on mortgage rates. The Fed's quantitative easing typically involves buying multiple types of securities, with larger amounts done in Treasuries in order to lower long-term Treasury rates.Mortgage rates typically follow the lead of long-term Treasury rates, rather than mortgage bond yields.The 10-year Treasury yield ticked slightly lower after hours amid Trump's comments.",

    "body": "In a photo illustration, prescription drugs are seen next to a pill bottle on July 23, 2024 in New York.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA coalition of patient advocacy groups is urging a federal court to halt the practices of third-party companies that buy drugs from countries outside the FDA-regulated U.S. supply chain, which the groups argue put U.S. patients' health at risk.The court filing comes in the wake of a CNBC investigation that documented how these third-parties — commonly referred to as alternative funding programs, or AFPs — have spread across employer-sponsored health plans nationwide. Under the growing business model, AFPs source high-cost specialty drugs from abroad at lower prices and charge employers a fee or a percentage of the savings. The AFPs then provide the medication to patients at little or no cost. AFPs are especially appealing to small employers like local school districts, county governments and others who pay their staff's health-care costs out of pocket. But there's a trade off: Federal officials at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Food and Drug Administration told CNBC that these medications are illegally imported and put patients' lives at risk. A Homeland Security Investigations official last year told CNBC that criminal investigations into AFPs were ongoing.The filing in a U.S. Court of Appeals in Maryland, dated Dec. 26, was led by the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, a nonprofit that advocates for safe and affordable treatment for people living with HIV and viral hepatitis. \"Forcing a person who has employer-sponsored health insurance to sign up with an unknown third-party vendor to receive their life-saving drug supplied by a foreign country not only is illegal but jeopardizes the health and safety of patients,\" wrote Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute, in a press release. \"While federal regulators should be shutting them down, in the meantime, the courts must step in to protect patients.\" watch nowIn the court filing, the patient groups said the arrangements can delay treatment, confuse patients and expose them to drugs that differ from those distributed through the tightly regulated U.S. system. They warned that patients with chronic and life-threatening illnesses should not be forced to trade the safety and certainty of approved U.S. supply chains for lower costs to employers.The amicus brief filing was submitted in a case brought by Gilead Sciences after the company learned that an HIV patient received Gilead medication with labeling written in Turkish. Gilead alleges the drug traveled through an unsecured supply chain that does not comply with U.S. law. Turkey is a known hotbed for counterfeit drugs, according to U.S. officials.Gilead sued several companies involved in administering employer health plans, including the alternative funding program Rx Valet.Greg Santulli, the CEO of the Georgia-based AFP, told CNBC last year that he's confident in the safety of the medications his company sources, adding that Turkey is a \"modern, sophisticated country\" capable of tracking medications through its supply chain.The lawsuit also named Meritain Health, which managed the patient's employee health plan and is owned by CVS Health.A spokesperson for CVS Health told CNBC last year that it \"has long maintained a policy that it does not support programs for non-FDA-approved medications sourced from outside the United States and does not contract with companies to facilitate the importation of non-FDA-approved medications\" from overseas.A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking all parties in the case from importing Gilead medications from overseas. The defendants are appealing the ruling, with Meritain arguing the injunction is not necessary and would adversely affect its business. Rx Valet in a court filing said the injunction undermines access to safe medications, adding that Gilead's HIV drug shipped from Turkey was the same as what is sold in the U.S. at a much higher cost.",

The crew launched from NASA Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft and Falcon 9 rocket on August 1, 2025. The agency said that it would not disclose the crew member's name or specific condition due to medical privacy. NASA Chief Medical Officer, James D. Polk, said at a press conference on Thursday the astronaut's condition is considered stable however, and the medical situation did not arise from any \"injury in pursuit of operations.\"Polk also said, there is \"a very robust suite of medical hardware on board the International Space Station,\" but it doesn't include all the tools physicians would have in a hospital emergency department to complete a full patient workup. The astronaut's \"medical incident was was sufficient enough,\" he said, that NASA decided to bring Crew-11 back early due to \"lingering risk.\"The Crew-11 astronauts' return was planned for around March 2026. The decision to bring the astronauts back early due to a medical situation represents a first for NASA.The last early contingency return by the agency involved its STS-83 Space Shuttle mission in 1997, when one of Columbia's fuel cells failed in orbit.

    "body": "A 3D-printed miniature model of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and the Greenland flag are seen in this illustration taken January 15, 2025. Dado Ruvic | ReutersGreenland's icy landscape may not match its name, but its potential value certainly does.President Donald Trump is, once again, openly pining for the U.S. to take over Greenland. His administration says it's weighing a range of options to acquire the Danish island territory, including using the U.S. military or buying it outright.Denmark and its European allies in NATO – the military alliance co-founded by the U.S. – have repeatedly stated that Greenland is not for sale. But Trump's rhetoric about Greenland has flared back up in the days since the U.S. military entered Venezuela and captured that country's leader.The prospect of the U.S. buying Greenland is \"currently being actively discussed by the president and his national security team,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters Wednesday. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he plans to discuss Greenland with Danish officials next week. Trump has not made an official offer, nor has he said what he believes would be a fair price for the territory. If Denmark reversed its opposition to selling Greenland, that land likely wouldn't come cheap. Even some conservative estimates suggest that the island could have a price tag in the hundreds of billions of dollars or higher.Prior Greenland bidsThe lowest guesses come from a direct comparison with history. The U.S. has previously considered buying Greenland, and in 1946 made a formal offer of $100 million —nearly $1.7 billion today. That offer, which Denmark rejected, at the time amounted to 0.04% of U.S. GDP; that proportion today would equal around $1.2 billion.But multiple analysts believe an accurate valuation would be much, much higher.\"Something in the trillions looks about right,\" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Forum, a center-right think tank, in an interview.His group sought to calculate a ballpark price for Greenland by looking both at its natural resource reserves and its potential real estate value.The value of its known critical mineral and energy resources alone totaled more than $4.4 trillion, according to the study, which was published in January 2025 and cited data from geological surveys in the U.S., Denmark and Greenland.That figure falls to $2.7 trillion when excluding oil and natural gas, which Greenland stopped issuing exploration licenses for in 2021, citing environmental concerns.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep. Doug LaMalfa dies at 65, GOP saysClassified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro captureRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's ousterNot all of that value is ripe for the taking, however: Greenland's frigid conditions and small population of about 57,000 people mean the territory has a low \"resource-to-reserve conversion rate,\" the study said.For example, while Greenland boasts more than 36 million metric tons of known rare earths, its reserves total just 1.5 million tons — a conversion rate of just 4.2%. If that rate is applied across the board, AAF's study shrinks Greenland's value to $186 billion, though it calls that figure its \"lower bound\" estimate.But Trump has recently stated that he primarily wants Greenland for its perceived national security benefits, not solely its economic potential.\"Right now, Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,\" Trump said Sunday. \"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security.\"The U.S. military already maintains a base in Greenland, but securing the island could give the U.S. a much stronger foothold in the Arctic. It could also give the U.S. more access to the shipping lanes that are emerging in the planet's northernmost latitudes as a result of climate change, experts have said.To determine Greenland's potential value based on its strategic location, the AAF study compared it with a similarly situated country: Iceland.It would cost the U.S. $1.28 million per square kilometer to buy all the real estate on Iceland, for a total of $131 billion, the according to the study.Applying that same price per square kilometer to Greenland — the world's largest island — results in an estimated total value of nearly $2.8 trillion, AAF found.Other pricey estimatesThat number is higher than some previous analyses. The Financial Times' Alphaville valued Greenland at a \"very conservative\" $1.1 trillion in 2019, when Trump's interest in acquiring the territory first came to light.Iwan Morgan, emeritus professor at University College of London's Institute of the Americas, told CNN that year that Greenland's cost could hit the trillions, while stressing the immense political and legal complexity of any such deal.Former New York Federal Reserve economist David Barker, however, last January valued Greenland between $12.5 billion and $77 billion. To find those numbers, Barker looked at America's prior acquisitions of Alaska and the U.S. Virgin Islands and adjusted those prices based on GDP growth.But Holtz-Eakin told CNBC that he believes AAF's estimate is conservative.\"They're pricing the economics of it. But let's face it, this is not about economics,\" he said. \"What price do you put on our standing in NATO or the global order? I put a big price on that.\"— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowThe House on Thursday advanced a three-year extension of Obamacare subsidies, sending the bill to the Senate where it faces an uphill climb.Seventeen Republicans joined all Democrats voting in favor of the legislation, which passed 230-196.The enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits were a key factor in the longest-ever government shutdown last fall. Their expiration at the end of 2025 led to premiums rising for millions of Americans who get their health insurance on ACA marketplaces. The Senate in December voted down a similar three-year extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits and lawmakers predict a similar fate if the proposal comes back to the floor. Instead, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is negotiating a compromise deal on ACA tax credits.Sen.

Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, part of the Senate group, told reporters on Wednesday. \"It probably wouldn't be put on the floor, because why waste floor time on something we've already considered?\"In a gaggle on the Hill, Moreno said the House bill is useful in the sense that it can serve as a vehicle for the Senate working group to amend. Members of that group, including Moreno and Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, have said they are closing in on a deal that would extend the tax credits for two years, though several key sticking points remain.Among them is the Hyde Amendment, a decades old policy that prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions, which many Republicans want to strengthen. President Donald Trump earlier this week told Republicans to be \"flexible\" on Hyde, prompting some pushback from within the GOP ranks.\"We don't do federal funding for abortions,\" Moreno said. \"That's a long-standing tradition, nobody's looking to change that.\"CNN reported on Thursday that some GOP Senators were privately open to leaving the Hyde Amendment as is.The Thursday vote on the House floor came after four moderate Republicans broke ranks at the end of last year and signed on to a Democrat-led discharge petition to force a vote on the ACA subsidies.A discharge petition is a procedural tool that allows members of the House to circumvent leadership and force a vote on the floor if a majority of lawmakers sign on.The discharge petition, introduced by Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., cleared a procedural hurdle Wednesday, with nine Republicans joining all Democrats voting in favor of the measure, despite opposition from Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Eleven Republican voted with Democrats on a second procedural vote earlier Thursday.\"What we do here today will not be the end of the effort that is necessary, but we can begin the effort that is necessary and extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said on the House floor ahead of the final vote.",

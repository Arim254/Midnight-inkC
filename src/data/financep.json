Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on November 19, 2025. Brendan Smialowski | Afp | Getty ImagesNvidia on Tuesday said its tech remains a generation ahead of the industry, in response to Wall Street's concerns that the company's dominance of AI infrastructure could be threatened by Google's AI chips.\"We're delighted by Google's success — they've made great advances in AI and we continue to supply to Google,\" Nvidia said in a post on X. \"NVIDIA is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done.\"The post came after Nvidia saw its shares fall 3% on Tuesday after a report that Meta, one of its key customers, could strike a deal with Google to use its tensor processing units for its data centers. In its post, Nvidia said its chips are more flexible and powerful compared with so-called ASIC chips — such as Google's TPUs — which are designed for a single company or function. Nvidia's latest generation of chips are known as Blackwell. \"NVIDIA offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs,\" Nvidia said in its post. Nvidia has more than 90% of the market for artificial intelligence chips with its graphics processors, analysts say, but Google's in-house chips have gotten increased attention in recent weeks as a viable alternative to the Blackwell chips, which are expensive but powerful. Unlike Nvidia, Google doesn't sell its TPU chips to other companies, but it uses them for internal tasks and allows companies to rent them through Google Cloud. Earlier this month, Google released Gemini 3, a well-reviewed state-of-the-art AI model that was trained on the company's TPUs, not Nvidia GPUs. \"We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.\"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed rising TPU competition on an earnings call earlier this month, noting that Google was a customer for his company's GPU chips and that Gemini can run on Nvidia's technology. He also mentioned that he was in touch with Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google DeepMind. Huang said that Hassabis texted him to say that the tech industry theory that using more chips and data will create more powerful AI models — often called \"scaling laws\" by AI developers — is \"intact.\" Nvidia says that scaling laws will lead to even more demand for the company's chips and systems.

    "body": "Enrique Lores, President and Chief Executive Officer of HP Inc. speaks at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. Ann Wang | ReutersPC and printer maker HP Inc. said Tuesday it'll lower its headcount by 4,000 to 6,000 people, representing a cut of up to 10%. HP also issued a lower-than-expected earnings projection for the new fiscal year. Shares of the company fell 6% in extended trading.Here's how HP did versus LSEG consensus estimates:EPS: 93 cents adjusted vs. 92 cents expectedRevenue: $14.64 billion vs. $14.48 billion expectedHP's revenue increased 4% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income of $795 million, or 84 cents per share, was up from $763 million, or 80 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.For the first quarter of HP's fiscal 2026, the company called for 73 cents to 81 cents in adjusted net earnings per share, while the LSEG consensus was 79 cents. For all of fiscal 2026, HP sees $2.90 to $3.20 in adjusted per share, below the LSEG consensus of $3.33.\"HP's outlook reflects the added cost driven by the current U.S. trade-related regulations in place, and associated mitigations,\" the company said in the statement.The company's personal systems unit that includes desktop and laptop computers contributed $10.35 billion in revenue, up 8% and above StreetAccount's $10.15 billion consensus.HP said it expects to complete the headcount reduction by the end of fiscal 2028. The company said the restructuring will result in savings of at least $1 billion in annualized gross run rate by the end of fiscal 2028. HP said it expects to incur about $650 million in charges, of which $250 million will happen in fiscal 2026.\"As we look ahead, we see a significant opportunity to embed AI into HP to accelerate product innovation, improve customer satisfaction and boost productivity,\" HP CEO Enrique Lores said on a conference call with analysts. Corporate executives across industries are hoping to draw on generative artificial intelligence products to speed up software developers and automate customer service. Cloud providers are buying large supplies of memory to meet computing demand from companies that build AI models, such as Anthropic and OpenAI, leading to a rise in the cost per gigabyte of RAM this year. HP, whose headcount stood at 58,000 as of December, announced a similarly sized round of layoffs in 2022. Several other technology companies have announced layoffs in recent months as U.S. consumers face higher prices and interest rates.\"Memory costs are currently 15 to 18% of the cost of a typical PC, and while an increase was expected, its rate has accelerated in the last few weeks,\" Lores said.The company does expect to benefit after Microsoft stopped supporting its Windows 10 operating system in October, which will lead people to buy new machines, Lores said. Around 60% of HP's installed base has moved to Windows 11, he said.HP's printing business did $4.3 billion in revenue, down 4%. The pricing environment is competitive, and customers are putting off purchases of new models, said Karen Parkhill, the company's finance chief.As of Tuesday's close, HP shares were down 25% for the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 15% in the same period.WATCH: HP CEO: Tariffs are mostly nonmaterialwatch now",

    "body": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy attends a meeting of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group at the Ramstein Air Base in Germany, September 6, 2024. Heiko Becker | ReutersUkrainian officials are willing to move forward with a U.S.-backed framework for a peace deal that would end Kyiv's war with Russia, multiple outlets reported Tuesday — though key details remain unresolved.Reports from ABC News and CBS News both cited an unnamed U.S. official who said that the Ukrainians \"have agreed\" to the deal, while noting that some points still need to be ironed out.It was not clear if the same U.S. official was quoted in both stories.Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said later Tuesday that Kyiv was ready to advance the peace framework, Reuters reported, citing a copy of a speech the president gave to a coalition of allied countries.President Donald Trump said at the White House on Tuesday, \"I think we're getting very close to a deal. We'll find out ... I think we're making progress.\"In a Truth Social post later Tuesday afternoon, Trump said, \"there are only a few remaining points of disagreement.\"He directed U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow and said U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll \"will be meeting with the Ukrainians.\"\"I look forward to hopefully meeting with President Zelenskyy and President Putin soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages,\" Trump wrote.The post followed U.S. officials meeting with a Ukrainian delegation in Geneva over the weekend for talks that resulted in significant revisions to Washington's initially proffered 28-point peace plan.That plan — which was widely seen as being highly favorable to Russia, the invading force — \"has been fine-tuned, with additional input from both sides,\" Trump acknowledged in Tuesday's post.\"Our delegations reached a common understanding on the core terms of the agreement discussed in Geneva,\" Ukraine National Security Secretary Rustem Umerov said in an X post.But it was far from certain if Russia would assent to the revised peace plan, which has reportedly been narrowed to 19 points.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said any agreement must reflect the understandings reached by Trump and Putin during their August summit in Alaska.On Tuesday, officials from Kyiv and Moscow reportedly met with Driscoll in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates.The Kremlin was tight-lipped about the discussions taking place there, with Putin's press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, telling reporters overnight that \"we still have nothing to say\" and that the Kremlin was \"monitoring media reports.\"\"We understand that negotiations between the Americans and the Ukrainians are ongoing. We understand that some adjustments are being made to the text that was published; we understand that the text that we unofficially received earlier has already undergone changes, but at some point, the time will probably come when we will also establish contacts with the Americans and we will officially receive some information,\" Peskov said. \"For now, we have no new information.\"The initial, 28-point plan, which Ukraine had not participated in, included controversial terms, such as Ukraine making territorial concessions by handing over the eastern Donbas region that is partially occupied by Russian forces.The original deal also demanded that Ukraine reduce its army by 50%, along with other proposals that crossed Ukraine's \"red lines.\"Trump had pushed Ukraine to accept that deal by the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Nov. 27, prompting Zelenskyy to declare on Friday that Ukraine faced the difficult choice between \"losing its dignity or losing a key partner,\" referring to the U.S.That deadline appears to have been scrapped. It was unclear how many of the original deal's points remained in the latest version of a potential peace agreement.",

    "body": "TAIPEI, TAIWAN - OCTOBER 10: Taiwan President Lai Ching-te (William Lai) delivers a national day address, during the National Day Ceremony, outside the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan, on October 10, 2025. Daniel Ceng | Anadolu | Getty ImagesTaiwan will introduce a supplementary defense budget of 1.25 trillion Taiwanese dollars ($40 billion) as Beijing accelerates military preparations near the island, President Lai Ching-te said at a press briefing Wednesday.China has continued to increase military drills and so-called \"gray-zone harassment\" around Taiwan, with the goal of seizing the island by force by 2027, Lai said, according to a CNBC translation of his remarks in Mandarin. The speech comes in the aftermath of a diplomatic dispute between China and Japan over Taiwan. Lai added that Beijing had intensified its \"infiltration and influence campaign,\" using a range of tools to interfere in Taiwan's politics and society as it seeks to sway public opinion and undermine the island's democracy.He also cautioned \"unprecedented military buildup\" by Beijing and \"intensifying provocations in the Taiwan Strait, in the East and South China Seas, and across the Indo-Pacific.\" Beijing considers democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and Chinese President Xi Jinping regards its reunification with the mainland \"a historical inevitability.\" Taiwan rejects those claims. China has been piling pressure on Taipei and has conducted several military drills off the coast of the island over the past few years, issuing stern warnings over Taiwan's \"provocations for independence.\"Beijing raised its defense budget by 7.2% this year to about $245 billion, with its military assets heavily deployed near the Taiwan Strait, according to analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lai on Wednesday vowed to build up Taiwan's self-defense capabilities in the face of growing threats from Beijing, aiming to achieve a high level of combat readiness by 2027.  \"President Lai's announcement is a signal to Washington of Taipei's commitment to its self-defense and intent to increase imports to balance trade between the two,\" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. Since his election campaign, U.S. President Donald Trump has been pushing allies to increase defense spending. Trump even suggested Taiwan should pay to be protected.     Shortly after Lai's speech, Raymond Greene, director of American Institute in Taiwan — the de facto U.S. embassy — said in a social media post that the United States \"welcomes\" the special defense budget and supports Taiwan's \"rapid acquisition of critical asymmetric capabilities needed to strengthen deterrence. When asked to comment on Taiwan's defense budget and Greene's comments, a spokesperson for Chinese foreign ministry said at a daily press briefing Wednesday that \"the Democratic Progressive Party's plan of resisting reunification and seeking independence using armed forces is doomed to fail.\" That's according to a CNBC's translation of the remarks in Mandarin. China has been locked in a diplomatic spat with Japan over Taiwan, with Beijing accusing Tokyo of intervening in its internal affairs after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said earlier this month that the use of military force in any Taiwan conflict could be deemed a \"survival-threatening situation\" for Tokyo. Beijing called the remarks \"egregious\" and has demanded a retraction.Trump spoke with Xi and Takaichi in separate phone calls on Monday. Experts say that Xi likely used the call to solicit Trump's help in influencing Takaichi to tone down her rhetoric on cross-Strait issues. ",

    "body": "Actors Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan arrive to the premiere of \"Rush Hour 3\" at Mann's Chinese Theater on July 30, 2007 in Hollywood, California. Jeff Vespa | WireImage | Getty ImagesA push from President Donald Trump led Paramount Skydance to revive its \"Rush Hour\" buddy cop movie series, two decades after the last installment, according to multiple reports Tuesday.Paramount has secured funding for \"Rush Hour 4\" and struck a distribution arrangement with Warner Bros. Discovery, which previously owned the franchise under its New Line banner, Puck's Matthew Belloni reported. The project had been in limbo for years.Studios were repeatedly approached about a new installment, but had balked at working with director Brett Ratner.Ratner's career collapsed in 2017 after several female actors accused him of sexual misconduct. He has denied the allegations and was never charged.Belloni reported that Paramount's decision to release \"Rush Hour 4\" came \"after prodding from Trump on behalf of Brett Ratner,\" who will direct the film.Ratner, in late 2024, was tapped to direct a documentary about first lady Melania Trump for Amazon Prime, which reportedly paid $40 million for the rights to make it.In the \"Rush Hour 4\" deal, Paramount will collect a flat distribution fee to release the film in theaters, Variety first reported. Warner Bros. will take an undisclosed share of box-office receipts before financiers recoup costs.Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment. The White House also did not respond to a request for comment.The first three \"Rush Hour\" films were global hits, particularly in China, earning more than $850 million worldwide, according to box office estimates. They also turned Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker into major stars.But the new sequel faces a changed theatrical landscape where comedies have struggled at the box office.And at 71 years old, Chan has scaled back U.S. studio work, while Tucker has not headlined a major film since 2007.Both Chan and Tucker are expected to be in the new film.Trump's intervention in Hollywood has drawn criticism. He has informally tapped allies including Sylvester Stallone, Jon Voight, and Mel Gibson as cultural emissaries, and has repeatedly said he wants to restore what he calls \"classical masculinity\" to studio filmmaking.For Paramount, the \"Rush Hour\" revival comes as the newly combined studio aims to nearly double its output, targeting 15 films in 2026 and up to 18 by 2028.The timing also overlaps with a major industry shake-up: Paramount Skydance, Comcast, and Netflix have all submitted first-round bids to acquire Warner Bros. The company's portfolio includes some of entertainment's most valuable franchises, from DC to Harry Potter.Paramount is bidding for all of Warner Bros. Its proposal, previously valued at about $23.50 per share, would bring the entire company — the studio, HBO Max, and the cable networks — under one owner.Comcast is reportedly interested in the studio and streaming assets, including Warner Bros. and HBO Max. The deal would fold those pieces into NBCUniversal and let Warner Bros. Discovery spin off CNN and TNT Sports before the deal closes. Netflix is also interested in the film and streaming assets, people familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Warner Bros. Discovery aims to have its sale process wrapped by mid- to late-December, CNBC previously reported.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

    "body": "watch nowCore wholesale prices rose less than expected in September, indicating a potential cooling in pipeline inflation pressures, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.The producer price index, a measure of what producers get for final demand goods and services, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.3% on the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate.However, excluding food and energy, the index rose just 0.1%, below the 0.2% estimate. Both core and headline PPI had decreased 0.1% in August. Headline PPI was up 2.7% from a year ago, while core rose 2.6%.In an era of tariff-driven cost pressures for imports, goods prices drove the PPI increase, rising 0.9% on the month, while services prices were flat. The jump in goods prices was the biggest since February 2024, according to BLS data.Final demand energy prices jumped 3.5% for the month, while food rose 1.1%. Of the energy increase, much of that was tied to an 11.8% surge in gasoline.On the services side, transportation and warehousing prices rose 0.8%, while airline passenger fees surged 4%.The September PPI release, like most other major official data points, was delayed due to the government shutdown. The BLS may not release October PPI data, as it already has canceled the October consumer price index report. November's CPI is due out Dec. 18. The PPI release is usually timed around the CPI.In other economic news Tuesday, the Census Bureau said retail sales increased 0.2% in September, a bit softer than the 0.3% forecast. However, sales excluding autos rose 0.3%, in line with the estimate.Miscellaneous retailers saw a 2.9% increase on the month, while gas stations, owing to the higher prices, increased 2%. Sporting goods, hobby and music stores saw a 2.5% decline while online sales were off 0.7%.Sales at eating and drinking establishments, an indicator of discretionary spending, increased a solid 0.7% on the month and were up 6.7% from a year ago.Retail sales, which are adjusted for seasonality but not inflation, increased 4.3% from a year ago, ahead of the 3% CPI rate for the month.Correction: September headline PPI was up 2.7% from a year ago. An earlier version misstated the percentage.",

    "body": "watch nowWeak buyer demand, weakening home prices and overall uncertainty in the economy are combining to make home sellers change their minds and step out of the market. Close to 85,000 U.S. sellers took their homes off the market in September, up 28% from September 2024 and the highest level for that month in eight years, according to Redfin. Sellers are delisting because so many listings are going stale, sitting on the market longer and longer. Redfin reported that 70% of listings in September were on the market for 60 days or longer. Homeowners are seeing prices weaken significantly and would rather wait than accept a low offer. Prices in September were 1.3% higher year over year, down from a 1.4% rise in August, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"The frequency of delistings is keeping inventory tighter than it looks on paper,\" said Asad Khan, a senior economist at Redfin. \"When tens of thousands of homeowners pull their homes off the market rather than accept a low offer, it effectively reduces the supply of homes that are actually available for buyers. That keeps sale prices elevated.\" Some sellers are lowering prices — even multiple times. The typical price cut is roughly $10,000, but multiple reductions are becoming more common as homes take longer to sell, according to Zillow. The typical listing saw $25,000 in cumulative price cuts in October, matching the largest discounts Zillow has ever recorded.The housing market is now heading into its slowest season. While 1 in 5 homes that are delisted are relisted, that may not happen for several months, as sellers will likely wait for the much busier spring season to try again. Home prices are still 50% higher than they were just five years ago, but some sellers who bought in the last few years are facing potential losses. Roughly 15% of the homes that were delisted in September were at risk of selling at a loss, the highest share in five years, according to Redfin.The supply of homes for sale is about 15% higher now than it was a year ago, according to Realtor.com, but that is likely to shrink in the coming weeks, both because of the season and because of weakening consumer sentiment among buyers and sellers alike. Pending sales in October, which are based on signed contracts, were up 1.9% month to month and basically flat from a year ago, according to the Realtors. The monthly bump may have been due to a small drop in mortgage rates, which then turned higher again in November. ",

We're grateful for his contributions and wish him continued success. With hardware and software engineering unified under Global Product, we're integrating product management with engineering to accelerate the delivery of exceptional in-vehicle experiences,\" GM said in an emailed statement to CNBC.Cetinok, who joined GM in September 2023 after stints with companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Amazon, could not immediately be reached for comment. The announcement of his departure comes a month after he described his position as \"a product person's dream\" in an interview with CNBC.GM's senior vice president of software and services engineering, Dave Richardson, and its head of GM artificial intelligence, Barak Turovsky, have also left the company since October. Richardson was with GM for more than two years, while Turovsky was hired in March.GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.Michael Wayland / CNBCAnderson left the self-driving company he cofounded, Aurora Innovation, to join GM. He told CNBC last month that in order for the automaker to succeed, software and product must be thought of as one and the same.\"That's the point of the role, I think, is it brings together all of these pieces into a unified approach to how we do product going forward,\" Anderson said during an Oct. 22 interview at a GM technology event in New York.Anderson, a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who later led Tesla's AutoPilot program, said his goal is to accelerate the pace of GM's innovations.When Anderson's appointment with GM was announced in May, Cetinok said in a LinkedIn post he was \"delighted to welcome\" the executive to the company. GM CEO Mary Barra and GM President Mark Reuss also hailed Anderson as being equipped to \"evolve\" and \"reinvent\" the automaker's operations.The global automotive industry has battled for years to better integrate technology into vehicles – from their production to consumer-facing software and remote, or \"over-the-air,\" updates like Tesla pioneered.GM has taken an aggressive approach to combat such challenges by hiring leaders from Tesla and technology companies such as Apple and Google. However, many times, such executives have had short tenures with the company.",

Picture taken November 18, 2025.Annabelle Gordon | ReutersThe FBI is seeking to interview Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and five other congressional Democrats in connection with their appearance in a video encouraging members of the U.S. military to refuse to follow illegal orders, those lawmakers confirmed Tuesday.President Donald Trump last week blasted the video, accusing Kelly and the other lawmakers of \"seditious behavior,\" calling them \"traitors,\" and saying that, \"In the old days, if you said a thing like that, that was punishable by death.\"The other lawmakers on the video were Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, as well as House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin on Tuesday said the FBI's Counterterrorism Division \"appeared to open an inquiry into me in response to a video President Trump did not like.\"\"The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,\" Slotkin said in a tweet. \"He believes in weaponizing the federal government against his perceived enemies and does not believe laws apply to him or his Cabinet. He uses legal harassment as an intimidation tactic to scare people out of speaking up.\"Goodlander, Crow, Deluzio, and Houlahan, in a joint statement, said, \"President Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass members of Congress.\" \"Yesterday, the FBI contacted the House and Senate  Sergeants at Arms requesting interviews,\" the statement said. \"No amount of intimidation or  harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution,\" the lawmakers said. \"We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of  the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep  it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.\"Kelly's office told NBC News, \"Senator Kelly won't be silenced by President Trump and Secretary Hegseth's attempt to intimidate him and keep him from doing his job as a U.S. Senator.\"Fox News first reported on the FBI's efforts.Earlier Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lashed out online over Kelly's display of his U.S. Navy medals after the Pentagon began investigating him for encouraging service members to refuse to obey unlawful orders.\"So 'Captain' Kelly, not only did your sedition video intentionally undercut good order & discipline … but you can't even display your uniform correctly,\" Hegseth snapped in a post on X, which replied to a tweet by Kelly showing his medals.\"Your medals are out of order & rows reversed. When/if you are recalled to active duty, it'll start with a uniform inspection,\" said Hegseth, a former Fox News host and a former major in the Army National Guard.The Pentagon on Monday said it was investigating \"serious allegations of misconduct\" against Kelly, who is a retired Navy captain, for his role in the video. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) military uniform.Source: @SenMarkKelly | XThe Pentagon said Kelly could be recalled to active military duty and face a possible court-martial for potential violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.The UCMJ requires service members to obey \"any lawful general order or regulation.\"Kelly, in response Monday, posted on X a statement saying that the Pentagon's probe \"won't work\" if \"this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable.\"His post also included a close-up photo of Kelly in his Naval uniform, showing the medals on the shirt's breast pocket.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, blasted the Pentagon's investigation of Kelly and the FBI's probe of him and other lawmakers.\"Senator Kelly valiantly served our country as an aviator in the U.S. Navy before later completing four space shuttle missions as a NASA astronaut,\" Murkowski wrote in a post on X. \"To accuse him and other lawmakers of treason and sedition for rightfully pointing out that servicemembers can refuse illegal orders is reckless and flat-out wrong,\" she wrote. \"The Department of Defense and FBI surely have more important priorities than this frivolous investigation.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

The American people need you to stand up for our laws and our Constitution. Don't give up the ship.\"The video was made as the U.S. military, under Trump, has carried out more than 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people on those vessels.The legality of those strikes, which were made without congressional authorization, has been questioned.On Monday, a group of Democratic senators, including Kelly and Slotkin, wrote Hegseth and Attorney General Pam Bondi to request that they declassify a Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel's written opinion from September on the domestic and international legal basis for the strikes.FBI Director Kash Patel, speaks during a press conference related to arrests of NBA players and coaches for illegal gambling schemes, at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, New York, October 23, 2025.

    "body": "watch nowMichael Burry — the investor known for predicting the housing meltdown ahead of 2008 — has turned his attention to one of the market's most beloved themes: artificial intelligence.Burry recently deregistered his hedge-fund firm, Scion Asset Management, removing it from routine regulatory disclosures. But he remains actively investing, and he is doubling down on what he sees as the next major mispricing in markets.Central to that view is Phil Clifton, Scion's former associate portfolio manager, whose research underpins the skepticism. Clifton argues that while generative AI adoption is accelerating, the economics behind the industry's massive infrastructure buildout have yet to justify the cost.In his farewell letter to Scion investors in late October, Burry called Clifton \"the most prodigious thinker\" he's ever encountered. CNBC obtained several of Clifton's research notes from earlier this year, written before he launched his own firm, Pomerium Capital, that help outline Scion's bearish thesis on AI.The investment world is \"expecting far more economic importance out of this technology than is likely to be provided,\" Clifton wrote. \"Just because a technology is good for society or revolutionizes the world doesn't mean that it's a good business proposition.\"Low marginsOn the surface, AI usage appears ubiquitous. More than 60% of U.S. adults say they interact with AI at least several times a week, according to Pew Research Center. Yet Clifton said the economics on the demand side are \"surprisingly small.\" OpenAI — market leader and cultural phenomenon — is set to surpass $20 billion in annualized revenue this year, but that figure is tiny compared with the size of the AI build-out. Hyperscalers have quadrupled their capex spend in recent years to almost $400 billion annually, with expectations of $3 trillion over the next five years, according to Man Group.\"We assume other generative AI services in aggregate are insufficient to justify the sums being spent on infrastructure,\" Clifton wrote.History's warningsScion sees a clear historical parallel with the early-2000s telecom boom, when heavy investment in fiber-optic networks far outpaced actual usage. U.S. capacity utilization fell to about 5%, and wholesale telecom pricing collapsed roughly 70% in a single year, Scion noted.Clifton argues the cloud giants are now in a comparable race, expanding AI infrastructure on the assumption that future demand will catch up eventually. But if mass AI adoption takes longer than expected, the economics on these massive data center deals could become untenable.Some Big Tech companies are starting to wobble on commitments already, he noted. Microsoft has canceled data center projects set to use 2 gigawatts of electricity in the U.S. and Europe, citing an oversupply. Alibaba's chairman has warned a bubble is forming in AI infrastructure. The Nvidia ExposureNo company has benefited more from AI spending than Nvidia. The stock has surged alongside unprecedented GPU orders from cloud providers. But Scion questions whether those customers will ever generate economic returns on that investment.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNvidia one yearA key element here is depreciation policy. Tech giants have lengthened server lifespans on the books to six years. Yet Nvidia's product cycles run every year now, making older chips functionally obsolete and less energy-efficient, long before they've been written down, Scion claims.Nvidia has pushed back at this claim, saying its hardware remains productive far longer than critics say, thanks to efficiencies driven by the company's CUDA software system.Still, Burry and other critics are seizing on a contradiction. Nvidia says the newest chips are superior in performance, efficiency and capability, at the same time as it promises that older chips remain economically viable. One of those defenses, they say, has to give.Burry has launched a new Substack newsletter to lay out his bearish thesis on AI. Whether generative AI ultimately proves to be a bubble remains to be seen, but for now, Burry is again positioning himself on the cautious side of a fast-moving story.",

Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, on July 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWorkday shares slid more than 5% in extended trading Tuesday after the finance and human resources software maker issued quarterly margin guidance that came in below Wall Street projections.Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.32 adjusted vs. $2.18 expectedRevenue: $2.43 billion vs. $2.42 billion expectedThe company forecast a fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin of at least 28.5% and $2.355 billion in subscription revenue, according to a statement. The StreetAccount consensus was a 28.7% margin and $2.35 billion in subscription revenue.Workday's revenue grew about 13% year over year in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31. Net income of $252 million, or 94 cents per share, was up from $193 million, or 72 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.Subscription revenue in the third quarter totaled $2.24 billion, with an adjusted operating margin of 28.5%. Analysts polled by StreetAccount had anticipated $2.24 billion in subscription revenue and a 28.1% margin.During the fiscal third quarter, Workday announced artificial intelligence agents for analyzing employee performance testing financial health, and the company revealed plans to buy AI and learning software startup Sana for $1.1 billion. Also, activist investor Elliott Management said it had built a Workday stake worth over $2 billion.Workday encountered some turbulence with higher education institutions that rely on U.S. funding, CEO Carl Eschenbach said on a conference call with analysts. Workday has seen its stock decline this year as pundits discuss the risk of generative AI tools threatening the growth prospects for cloud software incumbents. Company shares have fallen 9% so far in 2025, while the Nasdaq Composite index has gained 19%.\"The narrative we've been hearing in the last couple of quarters is changing, and it's coming back to those who are highly penetrated in the enterprise already providing value and are deeply trusted by our customers,\" Eschenbach said. Despite rounds of layoffs that companies have been carrying out in recent months, the headcount in Workday's customer base is up year over year, he said.WATCH: Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach: There's a narrative that AI is eating into software, that is falsewatch now",

    "body": "Ugur Karakoc | E+ | Getty ImagesAs tax season approaches, the IRS has released guidance for workers who can claim the federal deduction for tips and overtime pay enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\"The guidance released last week covers how to report these deductions on tax returns. But workers could still face questions at tax time, experts say. The tip provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 in \"qualified tips\" from 2025 through 2028. The tax break phases out once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000, or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly.      Meanwhile, Trump's tax break for eligible overtime pay offers a deduction of up to $12,500 for single filers or $25,000 for joint filers, with the same income phaseouts. This provision is also temporary, in effect from 2025 through 2028.    Read more CNBC personal finance coverageIRS releases guidance for Trump's tips, overtime deductions.

Here’s what to knowCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms for 2025 rankedWorkers can deduct tips or overtime pay if those earnings are reported via so-called information returns, such as Forms W-2 or 1099, according to the legislation. While the IRS is \"strongly encouraging\" employers to provide this reporting, it's not required for tax year 2025, said Thomas Gorczynski, a Tempe, Arizona-based enrolled agent, which is a tax license to practice before the IRS. Gorczynski, who also educates tax professionals on legislation changes, said: \"We're going to have this hodgepodge, weird year of rules that's going to make reporting very difficult for employees.\"Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates. And nationally, about 6% of workers reported overtime pay in 2024, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an economic organization. These taxpayers will soon have to navigate Trump's tip and overtime deductions for 2025, which apply to their returns filed in 2026.  \"Taxpayer confusion will be off the charts at tax time on these provisions,\" Terry Lemons, former communications and liaison chief for the IRS, said in a LinkedIn post last week. 'Transition relief' for some tipped workersThe new IRS guidance also includes \"transition relief\" for certain workers who receive tips via a so-called \"specified service trade or businesses,\" or SSTBs.Trump's 2017 tax law outlined the list of SSTBs to limit eligibility for a 20% deduction for certain businesses, and includes sectors like health care, legal, financial services, performing arts and more.SSTB workers are excluded from claiming the new tip deduction under Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" But these workers may briefly be eligible for the tip deduction until the Treasury Department and IRS finalize regulations.\"I don't want people to think that this new waiver is the permanent provision or a permanent guidance,\" Gorczynski said.It's a \"temporary waiver\" for some SSTB workers to claim the tip deduction for 2025, he said. But there could be an \"unhappy surprise\" in 2026 and future years if eligibility goes away.watch now",

    "body": "Colder weather and, for many, some time off for the holidays makes winter a perfect time of year to \"catch up on reading,\" according to billionaire and avid reader Bill Gates.\"There's something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,\" Gates wrote in a blog post published on Tuesday that includes his latest annual list of holiday season book recommendations.Gates' list of \"recent favorites\" includes a wide variety of authors and genres, from a book by a Harvard psychologist that dissects the concept of \"common knowledge\" to a fictional work about an aging night janitor in an aquarium. The list also features a media mogul's recent memoir, a book that Gates calls a \"hopeful, fact-driven overview\" of the current climate crisis, and a nonfiction political bestseller about government regulations and American innovation.DON'T MISS: Exclusive Black Friday discounts on courses to help you earn more money and get ahead at work\"Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate, and how America lost its capacity to build big things — and how to get it back,\" wrote Gates.Here are the five books Gates recommends reading during this holiday season:'Remarkably Bright Creatures' by Shelby Van PeltTold partially from the perspective of an octopus, Van Pelt's 2022 novel meets Gates' top condition for any work of fiction, he wrote: \"I want to read about interesting characters who help me see the world in a new way.\"Gates, who turned 70 in October, also wrote that he related to the book's human protagonist: a 70-year-old widow named Tova, a janitor working the night shift at the aquarium housing Marcellus the octopus. The book follows a developing friendship between Tova and Marcellus, and Gates referred to it as a thought-provoking exploration of \"relationships and getting older,\" particularly struggles with loneliness and the search for meaning as one enters the final chapter of their life.\"Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working — and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,\" wrote Gates, who has previously said that retirement \"sounds awful.\"'Clearing the Air' by Hannah RitchieHannah Ritchie is a University of Oxford data scientist who Gates has previously touted for her \"surprisingly optimistic\" analyses of the ongoing fight against climate change. Her latest book — which published in the U.K. on Sept. 18, and is set to publish in the U.S. in March 2026 — \"is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I've read,\" Gates wrote.In \"Clearing the Air,\" Ritchie focuses on 50 questions about the climate crisis — like, whether renewable energy alternatives are too expensive to be effective, or if it's too late to limit global warming and avoid further climate disasters — offering answers that are \"realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,\" Gates wrote.Like Ritchie, Gates has touted the environmental movement's progress — from increased use of solar and wind power to the popularity of electric vehicles — and rejected a \"doomsday outlook\" of climate change that the billionaire worries could distract us from other areas of concern, he wrote in a separate blog post in October.Gates has spent decades, and billions of dollars, on combatting climate change. He recently drew some criticism from scientists for arguing that some of the resources earmarked for climate initiatives would be better used on issues like welfare and poverty.\"If you want a hopeful, fact-driven overview of where climate solutions stand, this is a great pick,\" Gates wrote of Ritchie's book on Tuesday.'Who Knew' by Barry DillerBarry Diller, the billionaire IAC and Expedia chairman who also co-founded Fox Broadcasting, published his memoir in May 2025. Even though Gates considers Diller a longtime friend, he wrote, the media mogul's book \"still managed to surprise and teach me a lot about him, his career, and the many industries he's transformed.\"Diller is credited with inventing concepts like the made-for-television movie and TV miniseries during his years as an entertainment executive. Later, Diller \"was early to see the internet's potential and willing to bet on it when others weren't,\" including buying Expedia from Microsoft in 2001 and building IAC into one of the earliest media and internet conglomerates, Gates noted.Gates considered Diller's book to be insightful about the mogul's rise to corporate power, he wrote — and \"raw and honest\" about Diller's personal life, including a decision to come out as gay earlier this year at age 83.'When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows' by Steven Pinker\"Few people explain the mysteries of human behavior better than Steven Pinker,\" Gates wrote about the professor of psychology at Harvard University who studies how humans interact. Pinker's latest book, which published on Sept. 23, \"is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn more about how people communicate,\" Gates wrote.In \"When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows,\" Pinker explores how \"common knowledge\" shapes so many aspects of our lives, including how we communicate and work with others. And as Gates wrote: \"Most people would benefit from understanding how common knowledge props up every conversation we have,\" and how to used that shared understanding to more effectively collaborate with others.\"Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,\" Gates wrote.'Abundance' by Ezra Klein and Derek ThompsonWritten by two journalists — Thompson is a contributing writer at The Atlantic and Klein is a columnist at The New York Times and co-founder of Vox — \"Abundance\" offers \"a sharp look at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that,\" wrote Gates.Klein and Thompson argue that regulations, particularly some championed by progressive politicians, have stymied U.S. development in areas ranging from infrastructure and affordable housing to scientific breakthroughs. To fix the bottleneck, the writers propose an \"abundance agenda\" that would promote spending on development while cutting back on red tape to help accelerate the pace of new projects.The book has critics on both sides of the political aisle, and Gates wrote that it \"doesn't have all the answers.\" However, the writers \"are asking the right questions\" based on Gates' own experiences working with government agencies on large-scale global health and climate technology projects, he wrote.\"I've seen how the bottlenecks discussed in 'Abundance' impede progress in global health — whether we're trying to improve seeds, design better toilets, or eradicate polio,\" Gates wrote. \"Sometimes the science itself is hard. But often, the logistics and execution are even harder.\"Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "watch nowFrom July 2024 to July 2025, 1 in 3 condos sold in Manhattan sold at a loss, according to luxury real estate firm Brown Harris Stevens. Experts say this dynamic is somewhat typical in a city with high selling fees and high tax rates.What is unusual is the borough's wavering property values over the past decade. In November 2015, 1 square foot of space in Manhattan cost $1,562; by fall 2025, prices had fallen to $1,108 per square foot, according to Redfin data. Manhattan condo and co-op values took a large swing down amid the Fed's tightening of the U.S. economy from 2022 to 2024. A dearth of foreign buyers further dampened demand. Experts point to shifts in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and currencies such as the euro. \"I think there's probably more upside over the next 10 years than the last 10 years,\" said Jonathan Miller, CEO and founder of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraisal and consulting firm. Experts say many first-time buyers are shut out of this high-end market. \"I'm seeing more people in their early 30s, and they're getting a little bit of help from their parents,\" said Bess Freedman, CEO of Brown Harris Stevens. \"They're New Yorkers who are going from uptown to downtown, empty nesters, ... younger families, ... not so much international,\" she said in an interview with CNBC's Robert Frank.\"That's actually why rents went up so much, because people couldn't afford to buy,\" said Pierre Debbas, a real estate lawyer in the New York metro region. The median rent in Manhattan today is $4,973, according to rental website Zumper, a 10% increase from the year prior. A buyer purchasing the median condo in Manhattan — which sells for $1,650,000, according to data from Miller Samuel — with a 20% down payment and a 6.25% mortgage could face monthly principal and interest payments north of $8,000.As a result, even wealthy New Yorkers are choosing to rent.New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani campaigned on affordability issues, gaining national attention.His platform called for higher taxes on the rich and a rent freeze for approximately 1 million rent-stabilized units throughout the city. Experts say this could raise the rents on an estimated 1.2 million market-rate units in the coming years. \"What that's going to cause landlords to do is to push expenses on the buildings they control that have more open-market units,\" said Miller.Watch the video above to see how Manhattan's real estate market is shifting.

    "body": "Co-founder and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang spoke to journalists during a trip to Beijing in July.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesNvidia will help train and mentor emerging deep tech startups in India as a founding member of a $2 billion investment alliance, deepening its presence in the world's third-largest startup ecosystem.The U.S. chipmaker has joined the India Deep Tech Alliance (IDTA) — a group of private equity and venture capital investors pledging $2 billion for deep tech investments — as a founding member. Deep tech startups are an umbrella term for emerging companies in semiconductors, space, AI, biotech, robotics, and energy.The world's most valuable company will offer technical talks and training through its Nvidia Deep Learning Institute to emerging startups in India.Nvidia wants to \"provide guidance on AI systems, developer enablement, and responsible deployment, and to collaborate with policymakers, investors, and entrepreneurs,\" Vishal Dhupar, Nvidia's managing director of South Asia, said.Nvidia did not disclose any financial investment, timeline, or training targets, and did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.\"Nvidia's depth of expertise in AI systems, software, and ecosystem-building will benefit our network of investors and entrepreneurs,\" said Sriram Viswanathan, founding executive council member of the IDTA.He told CNBC that the pace of innovation is accelerating in India and there could be a \"significant number of Indian deep tech companies of global repute\" in the next five years.The Indian government is also actively encouraging research and innovation in the deep tech space through major initiatives, including over 100 billion rupees ($1.1 billion USD) under its AI Mission and a separate 1 trillion rupees ($11.2 billion) Research, Development and Innovation Scheme Fund targeting deep tech companies.On Monday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the country will host the AI Impact Summit in February next year.The event is likely to see the participation of heads of state and top policymakers, along with business leaders such as Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of NVIDIA, and Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind.Nvidia's commitment in India coincides with rising global interest in India's AI market, where OpenAI counts the country as its second-largest user base. U.S. rivals are also deepening ties: Google recently pledged $15 billion to build an AI hub in the southern city of Visakhapatnam.",

    "body": "A jobseeker holds a brochure during a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025. Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEmployment opportunities hit their lowest level in more than 4½ years as October came to a close and the government shutdown dragged on, according to data from jobs site Indeed.The firm's Job Postings Index fell to 101.9 as of Oct. 24, the most recent point for which data is available. That's the lowest since early February 2021 for a measure that uses February 2020 as a baseline value of 100.The level represents a 0.5% decline from the beginning of the month and a roughly 3.5% tumble from mid-August, the latest point from which Bureau of Labor Statistics data is available.Under normal conditions, the BLS on Tuesday would have reported its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, a measure that Federal Reserve officials watch closely for indications of slack in the jobs market. With the shutdown on the precipice of being the longest in history, economists and policymakers are left to look at alternative data for big-picture indicators.The most recent JOLTS report, for August, also indicated an ongoing decline in openings. The BLS reported that job openings totaled 7.23 million, about level with July but down 7% from January.Indeed's dashboard of indicators also has shown a pullback in salary offerings as job advertisements have declined. Year-over-year wages as judged by salary offerings in Indeed postings rose 2.5% in August, down from 3.4% in January.A softening labor market has generated concern from Fed officials. The central bank's Federal Open Market Committee last week voted 10-2 to lower its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%.Officials have cited rising risks to the labor market taking precedence over ongoing concerns about inflation holding nearly a full percentage point above the Fed's 2% target.\"Hiring is slowing. We see this from Indeed, from job postings,\" Fed Governor Lisa Cook said Monday. \"We're looking at a panoply of data, and those are real time. We're not waiting on the unemployment report. There's reason to be concerned, because there's a slight uptick in the unemployment rate over the summer.\"The nonfarm payrolls report normally would be released Friday, but that also is not happening. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the BLS count would have shown a decline of 60,000 jobs in October and an increase in the unemployment rate to 4.5%.",

    "body": "A woman uses her mobile phone as she walks past the logo of Japan's telecommunications giant SoftBank in Tokyo on December 25, 2013. Toru Yamanaka | Afp | Getty ImagesShares in Japan's SoftBank Group plunged more than 14% Wednesday amid a broader drop in Asian AI-linked companies, tracking declines in U.S. peers, as investors turned wary of stretched valuations in the market's most crowded trade.SoftBank, which has built a broad portfolio of AI-related investments spanning infrastructure, chips, and application firms, lost about $32 billion in market cap. If losses hold, the group's shares will clock their worst day since last August when they tanked over 18%, data from LSEG showed.SoftBank has a controlling stake in U.K-based Arm Holdings, whose chip designs power mobile and AI processors, and acquired Ampere Computing this year to strengthen its AI data-center capabilities. Nasdaq-listed Arm Holdings saw shares drop 4.71% overnight.The group has backed leading AI model developers such as OpenAI, as well as application-level startups like OpusClip, a generative-AI video-editing platform, and Tempus AI, which applies machine learning to precision medicine.SoftBank has now erased nearly $50 billion in market cap over two days. Shares had dropped over 7% on Tuesday as well.Other Japanese tech stocks also fell: semiconductor testing equipment maker Advantest declined over 8%, chipmaker Renesas Electronics lost 5.48%, Tokyo Electron, a chip production equipment maker, fell more than 5%.South Korean memory chip giants Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix lost nearly 6%. The surge in chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics this year has helped push South Korea's Kospi Index to record highs.Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, fell 2%. Alibaba declined over 3% while Tencent was more than 2% lower.The declines come after U.S. software company Palantir dropped about 8% overnight, even after topping expectations for the third quarter, as sky-high valuations across AI sector hit investor sentiment. The AI-led rally has pushed the S&P 500's forward P/E above 23 — its highest since 2000, according to FactSet.The frenzy around AI has sparked concerns that markets could be in the midst of a tech bubble.\"There is fear of an AI correction, and if it comes, it will sweep the rest of the market with it due to the heavy weight of the leading names,\" market veteran Louis Navellier wrote in a note.Some analysts say valuations of AI companies increasingly resemble the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, with share prices soaring far ahead of credible profit expectations.watch nowJared Bernstein, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers during the Joe Biden administration, noted that the share of the economy devoted to AI investment is almost a third higher than during the internet bubble, adding that the gap between earnings potential and spending \"certainly looks bubbly.\"Michael Burry, famed for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, has also stirred controversy with his bet against AI darlings Palantir and Nvidia. In a recent filing, Burry's Scion Asset Management revealed significant short positions on these firms, which are at the forefront of AI and chip technology.Besides Palantir, other U.S. tech majors also fell overnight: Oracle lost 4%, Chipmaker AMD dropped nearly 4%, while Nvidia and Amazon also declined.\"In my view, [the selloff] is short lived. I don't believe this is a start of a more structural sell off,\" said Dan Ives, managing director and senior equity research analyst at Wedbush. \"I think it's just a lot of nervous, sort of white knuckles and the selloff that we saw ... along with the selloff that we've seen crypto and others, it was just a massive risk off.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPalantir CEO Alex Karp ranted against short sellers, calling out specifically Michael Burry after a filing revealed the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame had bets against the artificial intelligence software company, as well as Nvidia, at the end of the last quarter.\"The two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird,\" Karp told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"The idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is bats--- crazy.\"\"He's actually putting a short on AI. ... It was us and Nvidia,\" Karp added.When reached via email by CNBC seeking comment on Karp's remarks, Burry declined to comment.Palantir shares slid 8% on Tuesday even after the software company beat Wall Street estimates for the third quarter and offered upbeat guidance. Investors have grown increasingly wary of lofty valuations in AI-linked names. Palantir's stock, which was up 173% for the year heading into Tuesday's trading, has a forward price-earnings ratio of 228. Nvidia fell 4% after gaining over 50% this year.\"I do think this behavior is egregious and I'm going to be dancing around when it's proven wrong,\" said Karp of short sellers.Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options with a notional value of about $187 million against Nvidia and $912 million against Palantir as of Sept. 30. in a filing. The filing didn't specify the strike prices or expiration dates of the contracts.It's unclear whether Burry is profiting from Tuesday's declines. The filing reflects his positions at the end of September, and he may have since adjusted his portfolio by now. Burry declined to comment on his positions.\"It's not even clear he's shorting us. It's probably just, 'How do I get my position out and not look like a fool?'\" Karp said.The disclosure comes after Burry hinted at renewed caution in markets in a cryptic post on X last week.\"Sometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play,\" he wrote to his 1.3 million followers on the platform.Burry gained fame for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, a trade chronicled in Michael Lewis' book \"The Big Short\" and the Oscar-winning film of the same name.\"With the shorts it's very complex ... honestly I think what's going on here is market manipulation,\" Karp said. \"We delivered the best results anyone's ever seen. It's not even clear he's not doing this to get out of his position. I mean these people, they claim to be ethical, but they are actually shorting one of the great businesses of the world.\"",

Mel Musto | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested that the United States would not pay any SNAP benefits during the government shutdown, contradicting a court filing a day earlier by his administration.Trump said that the benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, will resume only after Democrats in Congress agree to pass a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the government.The administration on Monday told a federal judge in Rhode Island that it would pay half of the costs of the SNAP benefits for November.Trump on Tuesday said in a Truth Social post, \"SNAP BENEFITS, which increased by Billions and Billions of Dollars (MANY FOLD!) during Crooked Joe Biden's disastrous term in office (Due to the fact that they were haphazardly 'handed' to anyone for the asking, as opposed to just those in need, which is the purpose of SNAP!), will be given only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"The White House, when asked by CNBC for clarification on Trump's statement given the court filing Monday, said, \"Refer you to the President's truth.\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, at a briefing later, told reporters that \"the administration is fully complying with the court order.\"Leavitt said she had spoken to Trump about his post, and added, \"The recipients of these SNAP benefits need to understand it's going to take some time to receive this money, because the Democrats have forced the administration into a very untenable position.\"\"We are digging into a contingency fund that is supposed to be for emergencies, catastrophes, for war, and the president does not want to have to tap into this fund in the future, and that's what he was referring to in his Truth Social post,\" Leavitt said.She also said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had issued guidance on Tuesday to individual states about the amount of money being disbursed to SNAP recipients.The social media post came shortly after lawyers for plaintiffs in a court case challenging the administration's cessation of SNAP benefits told a federal judge in Rhode Island that the decision to pay partial benefits out of a contingency fund did not meet his prior order that any decision to make partial payments \"cannot be arbitrary and capricious.\"The judge, Jack McConnell, had told the administration on Friday that it needed to pay SNAP benefits as soon as possible out of a contingency fund, and that is also needed to investigate whether other federal funds could be used to keep the program fully funded in the absence of a new appropriation by Congress.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverage Government shutdown could cost U.S. economy up to $14 billion, CBO saysJudge extends ban on Trump firing federal workers during government shutdownStates sue Trump admin to keep SNAP benefits during government shutdownLargest federal worker union urges end to government shutdownTrump's $130 million mystery military donor is Timothy Mellon: NYTGovernment shutdown becomes second-longest in U.S. historyStates sue Trump administration to keep SNAP benefits Government shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteThe Trump administration on Monday told McConnell that it would use all of the $4.65 billion remaining in the contingency fund, but said it had declined to use at least $4 billion from the Child Nutrition Program to keep SNAP fully funded for November, at least.Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case told McConnell on Tuesday, \"The Court should grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary stay on the ground that Defendants' decision not to provide full SNAP benefits — even though they have funds available to do so and even though switching to partial payments at this late date will cause devastating delay — is arbitrary and capricious.\"McConnell later told the Trump administration to respond to the request by Wednesday.The dispute over the continuation of the SNAP benefits in the past week has become a major issue in the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which began Oct. 1.Past presidential administrations have continued disbursing funds for SNAP during prior government shutdowns.But the Trump administration recently said SNAP benefits would end this week because Congress had not approved funding needed to continue the program during the shutdown. The administration, in what is seen as an effort to pressure Democrats in Congress to vote to end the shutdown, also refused to use more than $4 billion in contingency funds that Congress had set aside explicitly for SNAP.Separate groups of plaintiffs then sued the Department of Agriculture in different federal courts to compel the department to continue paying the benefits.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPinterest shares tanked nearly 20% on Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter financial results that missed on earnings per share and provided weak guidance.Here's how the company did, compared to analysts' consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: 38 cents adjusted vs. 42 cents expectedRevenue: $1.05 billion vs. $1.05 billion expectedPinterest's third-quarter sales grew 17% year over year while net income was $92.11 million, up 201% from $30.56 million a year ago during the same period.The company said fourth-quarter revenue will come in between $1.31 billion and $1.34 billion. The midpoint of the revenue outlook, $1.325 billion, trailed Wall Street's projections of $1.34 billion.After the stock move in extended-trading on Tuesday, Pinterest erased its gains for the year.Pinterest said it recorded 600 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, ahead of the 590 million that StreetAccount was projecting. In August, Pinterest reported 578 million monthly active users for the second quarter.The company logged $306 million in third-quarter adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBIDTA. That was higher than StreetAccount's estimates of $295 million.Third-quarter sales in the U.S. and Canada came in at $786 million, lower than StreetAccount's estimates of $799 million.Pinterest's third-quarter global average revenue per user was $1.78 and less than the $1.79 that StreetAccount was projecting.\"Our investments in AI and product innovation are paying off,\" Pinterest CEO Bill Ready said in a statement. \"We've become a leader in visual search and have effectively turned our platform into an AI-powered shopping assistant for 600 million consumers.\"Pinterest finance chief Julia Donnelly said during an earnings call that the company experienced some \"pockets of moderating ad spend\" in the U.S. and Canada regions during the third quarter. Donnelly attributed the sales moderation to unspecified \"larger U.S. retailers\" that are dealing with tariff-related issues putting pressure on their margins.Regarding the company's fourth-quarter guidance, Donnelly said that \"we see these broader trends and market uncertainty continuing with the addition of a new tariff in Q4 impacting the home furnishing category.\" President Donald Trump said in September that the White House would impose 10% tariffs on imported timber and lumber and 25% duties on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and related furniture.Tech giants Meta, Alphabet and Amazon reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Those reports showed strong digital advertising sales amid their big spending for artificial intelligence infrastructure.Meta said that its third-quarter revenue, of which 98% is derived from online ads, soared 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, representing the company's strongest year-over-year sales growth since the first quarter of 2024.Sales in Amazon's online ad unit rose 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, which was a faster growth rate than the tech giant's AWS cloud computing unit.Alphabet reported $74.18 billion in total advertising sales for the third quarter, which was a nearly 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. The company's YouTube unit saw third-quarter online revenue jump 15% increase to $10.26 billion.Reddit reported third-quarter earnings last Thursday and said sales ballooned 68% year-over-year to $585 million while global daily active uniques were up 19% year-over-year to 116 million, topping estimates of 114 million. Snap reports its quarterly results on Wednesday.WATCH: Final Trades: Meta, S&P Global and Idexx Lab.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowSaudi Arabia will capitalize on its abundant supply of cheap natural gas and renewables to transform the kingdom into a global leader in artificial intelligence, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser told CNBC in an interview.Aramco, the world's largest oil company, disclosed in late October that it plans acquire a significant minority stake in the new artificial intelligence company Humain. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, PIF, is the majority owner of Humain, which launched in May.Humain will become Saudi's national AI champion and will grow into a leader in the space, Nasser told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an interview that aired Tuesday. Humain CEO Tareq Amin has said Saudi is aiming to become the third biggest player in AI worldwide behind only the U.S. and China.\"Here, if you want renewable, you will find the lowest cost renewable,\" Nasser said. \"If you want gas, you will find the lowest cost gas. Energy is available and land is also available to build all these things.\"Data centers that train and run AI applications are requiring tremendous amounts of electricity, which is typically generated either by renewables and natural gas. The facilities will consume almost four times the electricity of the global electric vehicle fleet by 2030, Nasser said. They will primarily be powered by gas but also renewables, the CEO said.A significant portion of Armaco's capital spending is going toward boosting natural gas production more than 60% by 2030 to meet demand and toward the investment in Humain, Nasser said. Aramco is targeting capital expenditures of $52 billion to $58 billion this year, he said.Armaco sees oil and gas demand growing for decades to come on consumption in developing markets particularly in Asia, Nasser said. Demand will grow by 1.1 million barrels per day to 1.3 million bpd this year and almost the same in 2026, he said.\"There is huge potential for growth in emerging economies,\" he said.",

Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe ongoing U.S. government shutdown is about to become the nation's longest federal funding lapse ever.The shutdown is poised to hit that milestone on Wednesday, marking its 36th day and surpassing the previous record, which was set in early 2019.The latest attempt to break the logjam, by getting a Republican-backed stopgap measure passed by Congress, failed in the Senate for the 14th time on Tuesday.There are no further votes scheduled Tuesday on the GOP's short-term continuing resolution, or on an alternative proposal put forward by Democrats, which includes additional spending on health care and other priorities.Both of the longest government shutdowns in U.S. history occurred while President Donald Trump was in office.The funding dispute centers on enhanced tax credits for insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire by year's end, threatening to significantly hike health care costs for millions of Americans. Democrats have refused to vote for any \"clean\" stopgap resolution that does not address those subsidies. Republicans have rejected the prospect of negotiating while the government remains shut down. While Republicans hold a narrow majority in the Senate, they need Democratic votes to overcome the chamber's 60-vote threshold.Some Republicans on Tuesday said they have grown \"optimistic\" that the shutdown could end this week.Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., told reporters that he believes Democrats will be more open to cutting a deal after breaking the shutdown length record and after Tuesday's elections are complete.They will be able to tell their constituents \"we're fighting the President, and I think that's a major part of what this is about,\" Rounds said. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he was \"pretty confident\" the shutdown would end in the coming days.But some Democrats have poured cold water on the prospect of a coming compromise.\"There seems to be some indication of a thaw, but I see no immediate solution on the horizon,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.\"Talks are a good thing, but so far, I sense no willingness on the part of Republicans to really assure the American people that health care insurance will be guaranteed,\" he said.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., asked about Republicans' optimism, said, \"That would be nice. I hope that means Republicans are coming to the table to negotiate with Democrats, because so far, they have come to the table to negotiate exactly zero times.\" This is developing news.

    "body": "Joe Bae, co-chief executive officer of KKR & Co., during the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, Nov. 4, 2025. Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPrivate equity fund managers are bracing for a wave of consolidation as investors demand higher returns and stronger governance, forcing a shakeout in an overcrowded industry, several industry veterans said at a high-level finance summit in Hong Kong on Tuesday.\"How is it that there are more private equity funds in North America than there are McDonald's franchises,\" said KKR & Co's co-CEO Joe Bae on Tuesday, noting that the U.S. has about 14,000 of the fast-food outlets and 19,000 private equity funds.The bifurcation of funds' performance has become more \"extreme\" than at any time in the past decade, Bae said at the Global Financial Leaders' Investment Summit. \"You have to be very disciplined in a market like this and focus on ... fundamental, operational value creation in companies, bring better governance to the table,\" he said.The widening gap followed a private equity spending spree in 2021, as firms rushed to deploy unspent funds, with activity also boosted by ultra-low interest rates. As PE firms typically hold portfolio companies for more than five years before exiting, many of those investments are now harder to sell or revalue in a higher-rate environment.In an interview with CNBC's The China Connection, Howard Marks, co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management, cautioned that \"the era of ultra-low rates is over.\"He estimated that the current easing cycle will see U.S. interest rates fall to just 3%-3.5%, which would be \"neither stimulative nor restrictive.\" The Federal Reserve lowered its interest rates to a range of 3.75%-4% last week.Firms that had stayed disciplined during the post-pandemic liquidity rush — holding back from inflated valuations and cheap leverage — are the ones outperforming, according to Bae.Private equity groups have struggled in recent years to raise new funds, with a significant backlog of unsold assets and a slowdown in cash returns to investors. Limited partners — the fund investors — are also scrutinizing managers more closely than ever, demanding stronger performance and tighter governance.Only about 5,000 of the private equity firms that exist today had successfully raised funds in the past seven years, Per Franzen, CEO of Sweden's EQT said in an interview with Financial Times earlier this week. He added that 80% of these companies were likely to turn into zombie firms within the next decade, managing only the existing investments because they cannot raise fresh capital.Less than 100 globally diversified firms could capture around 90% of capital flowing into private markets in the next fundraising cycle, according to Franzen.While that may sound dire, private equity industry veterans say that consolidation will ultimately strengthen the asset class, weeding out weaker players and restoring discipline to the industry.watch now\"There are going to be winners and losers ... it'll all come down to performance,\" Rob Lucas, CEO of CVC Capital Partners, said at the Hong Kong summit panel, noting that consolidation is inevitable and is a \"sign of strength\" rather than \"in any way a negative aspect.\"Renewed optimismPE giants are optimistic about the rising demand for capital and signs of returning liquidity, supported by the growing popularity of secondary funds, or secondaries, that buy stakes or assets from primary private equity fund investors.\"The demand for capital of all forms for the next 5, 10, 15 years in the business that we're in is only growing,\" said Harvey Schwartz, CEO of Carlyle, citing global economic growth and an inflection point for technology that's creating fresh investment opportunities.Secondaries, one of Carlyle's fastest growing businesses, is \"just in the beginning of creating a more dynamic flow of capital for the entire industry,\" Schwartz noted.The secondaries market has exploded in popularity, with transaction volumes on track to top $200 billion this year, up from $160 billion last year, and could reach $381 billion in 2029, according to an industry report by iCapital.While experts forecast ultra-low interest rates are no longer on the horizon, prospects of relatively lower borrowing costs, as the Fed announced the end of quantitative tightening last week, delivered two rate cuts since September, would further improve the financing environment for dealmaking.watch nowIn another sign of renewed optimism, private equity activity rebounded in the third quarter, achieving a record $310 billion in deal value as companies capitalized on narrowing valuation gaps and renewed market confidence, according to EY.Private capital groups are increasingly widening their reach to the U.S. pensions and endowments after the Trump administration earlier this year issued an executive order that enabled 401(k) retirement plans to invest in a range of alternative assets.According to a survey conducted by AlphaSights and EY, 90% of private equity firms surveyed said they are at least \"somewhat interested\" in developing products for the 401(k) market.",

Ken Cedeno | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has renominated Jared Isaacman to run NASA after pulling his prior nomination months ago due to what the president called a \"thorough review of prior associations.\"\"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday. Isaacman, who is friends with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, was originally picked to lead NASA in December, before Trump had even taken office. Isaacman is a billionaire who founded payments company Shift4 and has led two private spaceflights.But Trump pulled the nomination in late May after a spat between the president and Musk, who had been leading a White House effort to slash the size of the federal government. Trump said at the time that he was withdrawing the pick because of Isaacman's past associations, though he didn't specify what those were. Some reports have suggested that it was a reference to Isaacman's prior donations to Democrats.Days after the withdrawal, Isaacman told Shift4 investors in a letter that his \"brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience.\" He also said that he was resigning as CEO of Shift4, which he founded in 1999 at age 16, and would assume the role of executive chairman. He had been planning to leave the company if his nomination was confirmed by the Senate. But it never got that far.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been running NASA as interim head since July. Isaacman still must go through the Senate confirmation process. The federal government has been shut down since the beginning of October, but the Senate is still able to confirm presidential nominees. WATCH: Trump renominates Jared Isaacman to run NASAwatch now",

The report comes about two weeks after Super Micro issued preliminary earnings and said it expected revenue of $5 billion for the quarter, down from prior guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion.Net income fell by more than half to $168.3 million, or 26 cents a share, from $424.3 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier.In its partial report last month, Super Micro said \"design win upgrades\" pushed some expected first-quarter revenue to the second quarter. The company said it now expects sales of $10 billion to $11 billion in the current quarter, above the $7.83 billion average estimate, according to LSEG.Super Micro has been a big beneficiary of the artificial intelligence boom, as its servers come packed with graphics processing units from Nvidia. But after growth soared from late 2023 through last year, the business has flatlined, with some analysts saying that Dell has taken market share.Prior to Tuesday's report, the stock was up 55% for the year.WATCH: Going short on AI is a bad ideawatch now",

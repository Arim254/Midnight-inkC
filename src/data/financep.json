    "body": "I spent seven years studying high-achieving students, interviewing hundreds of them and their families.Many young people I met described monitoring grades, rankings, and résumés as if they were constantly evaluating their worth. In some families, achievement took on an outsized role, leading some children to wonder whether their parents' love was tied to how well they performed.Achievement culture promises to open doors, suggesting that better grades and better college degrees guarantee better futures. But a growing body of research shows that this relentless chase can breed perfectionism, a trait linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression.So what can a parent do to protect against this narrow view of success and self-worth? We can help young people turn their self-focused attention outward. When children shift from \"How am I doing?\" to \"Where can I be useful?\" they develop a stronger identity, rooted in contribution rather than performance. Small, everyday ways of being needed — helping a neighbor, being counted on at home, showing up for a team — can buffer against that harmful inner-scorekeeping and build a sturdier sense of self-worth.When kids anchor their efforts in something beyond themselves, everyday stressors become more manageable. They stop believing they are only a grade or a score, and start feeling like a person who matters in the world. Here's how:1. Help kids notice genuine needs around them Recently, a woman told me she was on her way to the park with her two young kids when she saw their elderly neighbor raking her lawn. The neighbor waved off the woman's offer to help, but still, she unloaded her kids from the car, and they grabbed rakes, piling leaves into bags.The kids talked about it all afternoon — how happy their neighbor was, how much fun they had, and how good it felt to be useful. They were experiencing what psychologists call a \"helper's high\" and a growing sense of agency.To help children look beyond themselves, try prompts like \"What do you think she might need today?\" or \"Who could use a hand right now?\" Regular acts, such as checking on a neighbor, delivering a meal, and volunteering, strengthen kids' sense of belonging within their community.2. Build contribution into daily routinesOne mother I interviewed taped a sheet of paper to the front door with a short list of family tasks. When her kids came home from school, she'd ask them to sign the ones they could take on that day. Over time, these small commitments helped her children see themselves not just as children who sometimes help, but as contributors to their family.That shift toward a helper identity matters. In a study of 149 children ages 3 to 6, researchers found that thanking children for \"being a helper\" rather than \"helping\" significantly increased their willingness to pitch in. They were motivated by the idea of becoming someone who helps. Across studies, people who feel useful and connected show lower stress and greater resilience, suggesting that contribution is protective.3. Make the invisible work of care visibleKids learn generosity by watching us. But modeling alone isn't enough. We have to make our thinking visible. When you check on a neighbor, bring soup to a sick friend, or help someone who looks overwhelmed, narrate the \"why\" behind your actions. You might say, \"I brought her soup so she knows she's not alone.\" Or, you might explain, \"He looked like he needed a hand with those bags,\" or, \"I texted her because I had a feeling today might be hard.\" These small explanations give kids a mental model of why we help and an internal script they can use themselves.In a culture that too often reduces young people to what they achieve, helping them look outward is one of the most potent antidotes we have to excessive pressure. When young people discover ways to contribute that aren't tied to external metrics, they gain a more grounded sense of who they are and the larger role they can play in the world.Jennifer Breheny Wallace is an award-winning journalist and author of the New York Times bestseller \"Never Enough: When Achievement Culture Becomes Toxic — and What We Can Do About It.\" She lives in New York City with her husband and three teens. You can follow her on Instagram @jenniferbrehenywallace. Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, California, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHeading into 2026, investor focus could shift from fixed-income instruments to attractive dividend stocks, given a lower interest rate backdrop. Picking the right names from a vast universe of dividend-paying companies is a challenging task. Tracking the stock picks of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choices, as these experts assign their ratings after conducting a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.ChevronOil and gas giant Chevron (CVX) is this week's first dividend pick. The company returned $6 billion of cash to shareholders in the third quarter via $3.4 billion in dividends and $2.6 billion in share repurchases. With a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share (annualized dividend of $6.84 per share), Chevron offers a yield of about 4.5%.Following meetings with Chevron's management, Piper Sandler analyst Ryan Todd reiterated a buy rating on CVX stock with a price target of $178. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst is also bullish on the energy company, with an \"outperform\" rating and a price target of $164.Todd noted that while the ongoing scenario of an unfavorable crude backdrop and positive refining business has affected Chevron's performance, his meetings with the management reflected the company's solid position.The analyst contends that Chevron's capital efficiency is underappreciated. Notably, the company's upstream capital expenditure/boe (barrel of oil equivalent) produced is 29% below the peer average. He added that given the declining capex and operating expenses, the benefits from artificial intelligence (AI) that have yet to materialize, and a resource base that is better than feared, Chevron's free cash flow (FCF) annual growth outlook of 10% per year seems conservative.Additionally, Todd argued that \"while investors may continue to worry about TCO [Tengizchevroil joint venture] contract extensions, lingering post-2030 resource depth questions are misguided.\" In this matter, the analyst noted that aside from the projects included in Chevron's official plan, management is upbeat about additional opportunities presented by improved global access (especially in the Middle East), a rise in exploration activities, and expansion and technology-driven prospects.Todd ranks No. 868 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.5%. See Chevron Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Darden RestaurantsRestaurant company Darden Restaurants (DRI) owns a portfolio of brands, including Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Yard House. It recently announced a quarterly dividend of $1.50 per share, payable on Feb. 2, 2026. At an annualized dividend of $6 per share, DRI offers a yield of 3.2%.Following the company's mixed results for the second quarter of fiscal 2026, BTIG analyst Peter Saleh reiterated a buy rating on Darden stock with a price target of $225. In comparison, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a price target of $218 with an \"outperform\" rating.Saleh noted that Darden posted a mixed, but \"mostly positive,\" quarter, with better-than-anticipated comparable sales fueled by improved traffic at the company's major brands.\"Its strategy of under-pricing inflation, leaning on delivery, and offering a desirable menu resonated with guests, driving another quarter of sizable industry outperformance,\" said Saleh.The five-star analyst highlighted that high beef prices continued to be a headwind and weighed on the quarter's restaurant margins and earnings per share (EPS). That said, Saleh is optimistic about Darden achieving its guidance, as beef costs appear to have peaked, labor cost pressures are easing, and management is relying slightly on price increases to offset commodity costs.Overall, Saleh continues to be impressed by the momentum in Darden's sales, and although earnings haven't kept pace yet, they are expected to improve going forward.Saleh ranks No. 641 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.5%. See Darden Restaurants Statistics on TipRanks. Ares CapitalThis week's third dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. The company announced a dividend of 48 cents per share, payable on Dec. 30, 2025. At an annualized dividend per share of $1.92, ARCC stock offers a yield of 9.5%.In his latest research note on business development companies (BDCs), RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee called Ares Capital one of his favorite BDC names for 2026 and reaffirmed a buy rating with a price target of $23. TipRanks' AI Analyst has assigned an \"outperform\" rating to ARCC stock with a price target of $24.While Lee is less constructive on the BDC space heading into 2026 due to a potential decline in net interest income (NII) and return on equity (ROE) from lower base rates, he remains bullish on Ares Capital. In particular, he cited management's confidence in sustaining dividends at current levels despite expectations of lower base rates.Among the key strengths, Lee noted ARCC's dominant position in the BDC market, its extensive scale, and strong originations in the Ares direct lending platform. He also highlighted Ares Capital's more than 20 years of experience.\"In our view, ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share generation plus potential net realized gains,\" said Lee to support his bullish stance.Lee ranks No. 341 among more than 10,200 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 66% of the time, delivering an average return of 11.5%. See Ares Capital Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks. ",

    "body": "Europe stands at a crossroads: compete meaningfully in the AI race or stick to its world-leading climate goals. \"It's like a fork in the road moment for Europe,\" Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives told CNBC. The bloc can either \"play in the future\" or risk \"missing a big part of this technology wave.\"The dilemma is compounded by the region's mandates for green energy. Globally, energy is the biggest bottleneck for building out AI-related data center projects. While the U.S. fires up fossil-fuel plants to power its build-out, Europe requires developers to disclose energy and water efficiency measures, adding red tape that can slow project launches. The European Union is often celebrated for its suite of agenda-setting environmental policies and how it has made strides with new mechanisms, such as the forthcoming carbon border tax. However, some critics argue it gets in the way of business. The continent is seen as \"anti-entrepreneur,\" Ives said, which pushes European technology names and startups to move to the U.S., Middle East, or Asia in pursuit of more favorable policies. As Europe attempts to catch up in the AI race, the need for power-hungry infrastructure increases, demand for electricity surges — and that friction has become harder to ignore. Additional renewable energy capacity was intended to replace more polluting sources, but there are now concerns that this will play out differently.\"You can see in the U.K. that we're already rowing back on some of our commitments,\" Paul Jackson, regional Global Market Strategist at Invesco, told CNBC – and Europe will likely follow suit. watch now\"This is a fairly regular process that when times are good, it's easy to persuade individuals, businesses, governments, to move in the right direction on things like climate change, and to take some of the cost associated with doing that,\" Jackson said. However, pushing the climate agenda down the priority list is one of the easiest things legislators can do when faced with tougher times and competing interests, he added. The U.K.'s energy grid is free of coal, which is significantly dirtier than gas — Europe's, however, is not. \"I'm worried that, at a certain stage, coal power plant closures might get actually postponed,\" Jags Walia, head of global listed infrastructure at Van Lanschot Kempen, told CNBC. Taking fossil fuels offline as renewables come online works when energy demand is flat, but that's no longer the case, he said. Data centers also require constant connection, so the intermittency of wind and solar could prove tricky. \"Electricity wise, we might not be able to afford to close down coal power plants, which is going to be a real headache for the energy transition and energy security as well,\" Walia said.Over the course of the year, Europe has rolled back a number of environmental commitments. On Dec. 16, the EU watered down its effective ban on new combustion-engine cars from 2035. On Dec. 9. it approved a one-year delay to the implementation of a fresh EU emissions trading system for buildings, road transport and small industries – though simultaneously committed to slashing emissions by 90% by 2040. Earlier this year, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence (CSDDD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting (CSRD) directives were also narrowed and pushed back.A 'pragmatic' approachSome have welcomed the moves as much-needed pragmatism rather than a retreat. \"We are always at the edge of navigating into a position where it becomes so unattractive to be present in Europe that it doesn't make sense anymore. And on the other hand, a lot of the regulation is direly needed,\" Nick de la Forge, a general partner at venture capital fund Planet A Ventures, which backs climate-related technology startups, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Dec. 11. \"And luckily, what we are seeing is a pretty healthy revamp.\" The reshaping of directives, including the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which is currently undergoing review, is \"quite pragmatic, and we think that's an improvement,\" De la Forge said. AI advocates tout the technology's ability to make energy systems more efficient and boost sustainability, positioning it as both a problem and solution to intensifying demands on the grid, and perhaps making it worth the investment. watch now\"As AI rapidly advances, its potential to strengthen Europe's energy resilience and accelerate the clean transition is becoming increasingly clear. At the same time, the growing electricity needs of AI technologies call for smart, forward-looking planning,\" a European Commission spokesperson told CNBC.They added that the economic bloc \"is fully prepared to seize these opportunities while safeguarding the stability and reliability of Europe's energy system.\"The Commission did not specifically address questions asked by CNBC around a rollback of sustainability legislation as a result of its AI push, or how it plans to meet the new legally binding target. Instead, a spokesperson for the bloc referred to the region's preparations for a roadmap for the use of AI in the energy sector, in line with its broader Apply AI Strategy, which was designed to fast-track the deployment of the tech. 'We're sort of toast' If policymakers hold tight on sustainability requirements, AI infrastructure developers may instead offset their emissions with carbon credits or renewable energy certificates. One credit represents the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide, or the prevention of one metric ton from entering the atmosphere. AI hyperscalers \"do still have their headline decarbonization target\" but are turning to such measures to meet them, according to Jim Wright, manager of the Premier Miton Global Infrastructure Income Fund. \"Because, in reality, they will use some gas, and they may even use some coal,\" he said, referring to variations in the makeup of energy grids. Read moreThat reality was recognized in the EU's Dec. 9 deal, which included the use of carbon removal credits to reach the fresh reduction target. In all, it has created an era of energy addition rather than transition – a dynamic embraced by oil CEOs – as AI-driven demand for power outpaces supply from clean sources. It's also a question of energy security, not only abundance. The data center and AI race \"puts a lot more strain on our energy infrastructure, and as we have seen in recent years, we're not terribly resilient when it comes to that,\" said Jackson. It means adding an almost base-level demand of energy to existing grids, which could make pricing more volatile and lead to energy rationing, he said.Climate change is an infrastructure and business risk — which is not going away, experts have told CNBC. For Kokou Agbo Bloua, global head of research at Société Générale, it's \"a massive elephant in the room\" and one of his biggest worries looking forward. Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday, he said: \"We're sort of toast … pun intended, actually, because we're on the path of two-and-a-half, three degrees [of warming above pre-industrial levels]. And if you look at green technologies, [they're] being used for data centers, as opposed to replacing fossil fuels.\"But it could be some years before a formal scrapping of Europe's environmental targets. \"Sometimes on sustainability goals, what countries do is, if they are going to walk away from a goal, they try to leave it till the last minute,\" Walia said.

    "body": "watch nowRecently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman on Friday told CNBC that the U.S. will return to the moon within President Donald Trump's second term. Isaacman, a close ally of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"\"We want to have that opportunity to explore and realize the scientific, economic and national security potential on the moon,\" he said. Isaacman's comments on Friday were some of his first public remarks since being confirmed to his position by the Senate last week, after a long saga throughout 2025. Trump initially nominated Isaacman for the NASA head role in December 2024, but the president abruptly pulled his pick in May due to Isaacman's \"prior associations.\" Although Trump did not specify what those were, some have suggested that it was related to Isaacman's close ties with Musk, with whom Trump had a heated feud over the summer.In November, Trump renominated Isaacman, who was an entrepreneur and became a civilian astronaut after commanding an orbital mission aboard SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2021.Lunar opportunities include establishing space data centers and infrastructure, as well as potentially mining Helium-3, a rare gas embedded in the moon's surface that could become a major fuel for fusion power, Isaacman said. He added that after building a \"moon base,\" NASA will look into making investments in nuclear power and space nuclear propulsion to further exploration.NASA is currently working with various contractors including SpaceX, Jeff Bezo's Blue Origin and Boeing, to participate in its Artemis campaign, a moon exploration program that also aims to prepare for Mars missions.The campaign was propelled after Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocated $9.9 billion to NASA earlier this year.The Artemis II mission, NASA's first test flight with crew aboard the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion spacecraft, is expected to take off in the near future, Isaacman said.The expedition will be followed up with the Artemis III mission, which SpaceX is contracted to build the lunar landing system for.SpaceX and Blue Origin are refining heavy lift launch vehicles with on-orbit cryogenic propeller transfer to become more readily reusable, he added.\"That's what's going to enable us to be able to go to and from the moon affordably, with great frequency, and set up for missions to Mars and beyond,\" Isaacman said.",

    "body": "When I think back on my childhood, my happiest memories aren't tied to things I owned. They're about the freedom of growing up in a small Ohio town where everyone knew your name and kids ran in packs.The neighborhood park was our meeting place. A few bikes tossed in a friend's front yard signaled the game was on. There were no texts or group chats. But childhood today often looks different. Connection revolves around gaming consoles, phones, sneakers, and the next must-have gadget. If you can't afford it, you risk being left out.That contrast led me to talk to my 79-year-old dad, a man who wears thriftiness the way others wear luxury. He genuinely enjoys finding new ways to save money. He never tried to keep up with anyone. While others rushed to buy the newest car or gadget, he was content with what he had. That mindset made him the quintessential millionaire next door.He helped shaped my relationship with money. I don't feel compelled to chase status or possessions. Here are eight lessons from my frugal dad that have stood the test of time — and how they still apply today.1. Let your values guide your financial decisionsEvery dollar you spend is a vote for the life you want to build. When your spending aligns with what matters most, money feels less like sacrifice and more like purpose. For couples especially, shared values turn financial decisions into a source of clarity instead of conflict.2. You can always earn more money, but not timeImagine you could swap places with legendary investor Warren Buffett, now 95. Would you? Time is scarce and unrecoverable, unlike money. Remember this when deciding whether to take a promotion just for a bigger paycheck, even if it means less time with family; or working longer hours for a fancier car when your current one works fine; or buying a bigger house when your kids already attend a great school in a safe neighborhood.3. The best investment you can make is in yourselfThe returns on personal growth compound for decades. Education, learning a new skill, reading widely, or even investing in therapy can strengthen both your earning potential and your resilience. In a partnership, personal growth benefits everyone — stronger individuals make stronger teams.4. Debt steals tomorrow’s optionsEvery borrowed dollar limits future freedom. A loan may feel manageable today, but it quietly shapes your choices tomorrow, from the jobs you can take to where you can live. Prioritizing flexibility over financing buys peace of mind and the ability to pivot when life changes.5. Turn off the lights when you leave the roomTurning the lights off is a metaphor for the small things we do. It’s more than about saving a few cents on electricity; it’s a mindfulness practice. Every small act of frugality adds up, and it builds awareness of how we use our resources. 6. Celebrate simplicityA quiet life is often an intentional one. Choosing simplicity means choosing time over things, presence over pressure, and meaning over noise. Less clutter often leads to less stress — and more room for what actually matters.7. New cars destroy wealthThe average new car now sells for over $50,000, and when you factor in financing, fuel, and insurance, monthly costs can exceed $1,200. Vehicles that are about three years old often hit the sweet spot between price and reliability. Investing the difference between new and used can significantly boost long-term net worth.8. Being cheap and being frugal aren’t the same thingCheapness cuts corners at all costs. Frugality focuses on getting value for your money. A frugal person maintains what they own, spends intentionally, and is generous where it counts. Understanding that difference can prevent endless money conflicts because frugality builds a meaningful life, while cheapness slowly erodes joy.Brian Page is the founder of Modern Husbands, a company dedicated to helping couples manage both financial and home responsibilities as a team.

However, the updated guidance on email address changes appears only in the Hindi version of Google's support page, suggesting the rollout may begin in India or Hindi-speaking markets.The support page said the feature is gradually rolling out to all users, suggesting full global adoption is coming, but could take some time.The English-language page retains prior guidance stating that @gmail.com addresses \"usually cannot be changed.\" Google did not immediately respond to CNBC's inquiry about which regions would be the first to receive the feature. Under the new policy, users who change their address will automatically keep their original address as an alias. Emails sent to the old address will continue to arrive in the inbox, and the original address will still work for signing in to Google services like Drive, Maps and YouTube. Previously, users seeking a new Gmail address had to create a new account and transfer their data manually through a complicated and fraught process that could disrupt integrations with third-party apps.Google said existing data, including photos, messages and emails would remain unchanged after an address update. Users can also reuse the old Google account email address at any time, according to a Google translation of the support page in Hindi.However, accounts that change their Gmail address won't be able to create another new Gmail address for the next 12 months and cannot delete the new chosen address. Google has not issued a formal press release or announcement about the change, which was reportedly first discovered within user forums and tech communities.",

    "body": "Mixmike | E+ | Getty ImagesMany student loan borrowers have hit a repayment obstacle: the U.S. Department of Education denied their application to switch into a new payment plan.The department rejected 327,955 borrower requests to be enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan in August alone, according to a Dec. 15 court filing. The denials mean many of these borrowers may remain stuck in their prior repayment plan with a higher monthly payment, or in an interest-accruing forbearance. As of the end of November, another 802,730 IDR plan applications remain pending with the Education Department. Millions of student loan holders rely on IDR plans to afford their payments and eventually, to emerge from their debt. The plans cap borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income, and lead to debt cancellation after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years. Those pursuing the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which leads to debt erasure for public servants after a decade, also typically need to be enrolled in an IDR plan. Consumer advocates said they were alarmed by the number of denials.\"This could cause further delays — losing out on qualifying months for Public Service Loan Forgiveness and IDR cancellation — and many of these borrowers will wind up paying a higher amount each month,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers. More than 42 million Americans hold student loans, and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion.The Education Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The teacher's union, which represents nearly 2 million members, filed a lawsuit against the administration in March, accusing it of depriving student loan borrowers of their rights. Protect Borrowers served as AFT's legal counsel.Here's what to know about the recent IDR plan application denials — and what to do next if it happened to you. Why some IDR applications were rejected The Education Department said in the court filing that it rejected the hundreds of thousands of IDR applications because of an \"unforeseen ambiguity\" about which repayment plan the borrowers should have been enrolled in.  These federal student loan holders had requested to be put in the plan with \"the lowest monthly payment,\" according to the filing. But Trump officials said two plans result in an equal monthly bill. \"In response, ED opted to procedurally deny such applications,\" the agency said in the court document.Yu said the Trump administration's reasoning did not follow established guidelines. \"The IDR application anticipated two possible repayment plans with equal payment amounts and provided a plan for such a case,\" Yu said. In these situations, there is a ranking of IDR plans the Education Department is supposed to follow, she added. Higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz also said he questioned the Trump officials' explanation. \"The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak,\" Kantrowitz said. What borrowers should do next The difficulty accessing an affordable student loan repayment plan comes at an already trying time for borrowers. More than 5 million student loan holders are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers soon, the Education Department said earlier this year.The Education Department confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday that it will begin garnishing the wages of borrowers in default on student loans in early January. The U.S. Department of Education's justification for rejecting these borrowers is weak.Mark Kantrowitz higher education expertIf your application for an IDR plan was rejected, file a new request as soon as possible, said Kantrowitz.Borrowers should select a specific plan on their application, \"partly because the borrower should make an informed decision,\" Kantrowitz said, and also because of the recent denials related to ambiguity over which plan has the lowest monthly payment. The Biden administration's Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan is now defunct, after a court blocked the program. And President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" phases out some other IDR plans.As a result, the best current option for many borrowers is the Income-Based Repayment plan, or IBR, Kantrowitz said. Under the terms of IBR, borrowers pay 10% of their discretionary income each month — though that share rises to 15% for certain borrowers with older loans.There are several tools available online to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans.You can submit a request for an IDR plan at StudentAid.gov.",

    "body": "Engagement season is upon us, with December being the most popular month to propose worldwide, according to The Knot.And while traditionally men have been expected to shell out for that diamond — as Beyoncé put it in 2008, he should've \"put a ring on it\" — many women are changing their expectations around who makes the purchase. Nearly 71% (70.6%) of women say they're willing to contribute to the cost of their engagement ring, according to DatingAdvice.com's recent Holiday Engagement Survey of 1,000 partnered U.S. adults.Almost 19% said they would pay for the ring in full, about 23% said they'd partially pay and 29% said they would contribute if needed. Here's why Natassia Miller, a certified sexologist who founded the sex and relationship coaching company Wonderlust, thinks women might be changing their tune. There are more dual-income couples these daysThere are more couples earning two salaries, with or without kids, than there were a decade ago, according to the Pew Research Center.And while, on average, the gender wage gap persists, there are some metro areas in the U.S. where women under the age of 30 earn as much as or more than their male counterparts, according to Pew. \"Today, with more dual‑income couples and women delaying marriage while they build careers,\" says Miller, \"there's more openness to treating the ring as a shared investment.\"Some 'couples are more pragmatic'This piece of jewelry is expensive: The average cost of an engagement ring is $5,200, according to The Knot.And headlines abound about Americans' financial hardships. Overall prices are up 25% since January 2020, for example, according to Consumer Price Index data, and nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, according to a recent survey by Intuit Credit Karma.\"Against that backdrop, it makes sense that couples are more pragmatic,\" says Miller. \"Instead of one partner taking on debt to hit an arbitrary ring budget, some women would rather share the cost and keep the purchase aligned with reality.​\"It's a 'public symbol' that says 'someone committed to me'Finally, even as they consider their financial realities, women are willing to pay because the ring is symbolic.\"Even women who are financially independent often grew up on a steady diet of rom‑coms, social media proposals, and bridal marketing where the ring is framed as proof of worthiness and desirability,\" says Miller.For many women, \"an engagement ring is still a public symbol that says, 'Someone committed to me, and is willing to show that to the world.'\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "description": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headline",
    "body": "American consumers aren't feeling great about the economy or their own financial situation, with the phrase \"affordability crisis\" dominating headlines and political campaigns over the last few months.The majority — 70% — of Americans surveyed in a Marist poll of over 1,400 adults taken in December, say that the cost of living in their area is not very affordable, or not affordable at all, for the average family.While President Donald Trump called the word \"affordability\" a \"con job by the Democrats,\" in a speech in early December, other politicians have insisted it's an issue for their constituents. \"The affordability crisis is not a hoax, it is a reality felt by Americans everywhere.\" Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del. said in a newsletter.Nearly half of Americans say their financial situation is worse than a year ago, a recent Credit Karma survey found. And consumer sentiment in December sank 29% from 2024 according to the University of Michigan's monthly survey. While annual inflation is down from the historic highs the U.S. saw in 2022, prices for everyday essentials remain elevated, and in some categories continue to rise. In November 2025, coffee prices were up nearly 19% from the previous year and the cost of beef was up around 15%, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Housing costs rose over 14% between September 2023 and September 2025, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Medical costs are up nearly 7% over the same period, and costs for services are up over 8%. While some of those price increases are related to supply issues, Trump's tariff agenda has also pushed prices on essentials like bananas and coffee and discretionary items like toys and electronics.\"It's not like people are overspending,\" Joey Khoury, partner and senior wealth advisor at Mission Wealth, says. Middle and lower-earners especially aren't \"spending lavishly,\" he adds, but as living costs have risen it's become harder for them to stay within their normal budgets.Consumers are 'trying to muscle through'Consumer spending has increased with each subsequent quarter, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, despite worsening sentiment and weakening consumer confidence, per The Conference Board's monthly survey.\"What we're seeing is there is still inflation pressure across the system, particularly in the retail environment, and consumers, through our research tell us that they are effectively trying to muscle through this,\" Will Auchincloss, Americas retail sector leader at EY-Parthenon, says. \"They're trying to buy what they've always bought or want to buy, but in the face of higher prices.\"Higher earners may be cutting back on some nonessentials, including vitamins and supplements, he says, or trading down to lower-cost alternatives.However, lower earners are \"not just talking about pulling back,\" he says. \"They are actively pulling back and having a hard time making ends meet.\"\"Consumers are balancing many pressures,\" including tariffs, sticky inflation and a softening labor market, says Leanna Haakons, a business development and marketing expert, and president of Black Hawk Financial.At the same time, \"they're still seeking a sense of normalcy and value in their purchases,\" Haakons says. For some households, she says, that means being more selective about what they do buy.  \"Consumers are buying fewer items overall, but focusing on high-value, more meaningful purchases, durable goods, gifts, things for the household, home upgrades, things that really are valuable to their day to day life,\" Haakons says.Some are borrowing to get byWhile they may be steadily spending, many consumers are also relying on credit cards and buy now, pay later (BNPL) loans to fund their purchases.Credit card debt rose to a collective $1.23 trillion in the U.S. as of the third quarter of 2025, according to New York Fed data. And a growing number of Americans say they're using BNPL plans to pay for groceries, a LendingTree survey found in April.\"Consumers are borrowing more and more to cover the spending challenges they've got, and that obviously can't go on forever,\" Auchincloss says. As of the fourth quarter of 2025, growing shares of consumers are already changing behaviors according to McKinsey & Company research. Nearly a third of adults (29%) say they've dipped into their savings in the last three months, up from 26% in Q3. Another 29% say they've reduced their savings rate, also up from 26% in the third quarter. And 28% are using credit cards more, up from 26%, McKinsey finds. BNPL usage also ticked up by a percentage point over the same period.New year, same problemConsumers are hopeful they'll be able to find their financial footing in 2026 and many are optimistic about meeting their goals, the Credit Karma survey found. Still, 32% of Americans expect things to get worse in the new year, according to a recent Bankrate survey.Rent prices may cool off in 2026, experts at real estate firm Douglas Elliman recently told CNBC Make It. But overall inflation is expected to stay at or above 3% throughout the year, economists at Deloitte and Fitch Ratings predict.\"The smartest approach for households heading into 2026 is to be selective with spending, prioritizing debt repayment going into the new year,\" Haakons says. She encourages folks to pay off their credit card balances and try to time major purchases \"wisely,\" taking advantage of potential interest rate cuts later in the year. \"It's important to be prudent going into 2026,\" she adds, \"because there are some strong signals that there could be some more difficult times ahead for employment.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTubi hit profitability this year doing what other streaming services are trying to: attract younger audiences who are willing to sit through ads. The Fox Corp.-owned free streaming platform has long been among a sort of second tier of streaming services alongside lower-budget and less popular offerings like Pluto and The Roku Channel. But the free service is gaining traction and finding its footing in conversations with the big players. In November, Tubi made up 2.1% of total streaming minutes on The Gauge, Nielsen's monthly analysis of viewing trends, ahead of NBCUniversal's Peacock and Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max. Google's YouTube holds the top spot in the viewership tracker. \"Our fans come in, and they behave like [subscription streaming] viewers. The only difference is they don't pay for it,\" said Tubi's chief marketing officer, Nicole Parlapiano, in an interview. Netflix's dominance in streaming has led many media companies to chase the same success, spending billions of dollars on original content to attract subscribers and strive for profitability. In response, the cost of streaming has risen, with nearly every subscription platform instituting multiple price hikes in recent years and pushing consumers toward cheaper, ad-supported options. A crackdown on password sharing by some of the biggest players has also shaken up the space.\"People used to cut the cord, now they're canceling subscriptions. And is that driving more consumption into free streaming? Absolutely,\" Tubi Chief Content Officer Adam Lewinson told CNBC. Tubi said it has more than 100 million monthly active users and 1 billion hours of streamed content per month. For comparison, Netflix reported more than 300 million subscribers as of late 2024, the last time it reported the metric, while Disney+ reported 131 million subscribers as of the end of September. Nearly 60% of Tubi's audience is made up of millennials or members of Generation Z, and nearly half are multicultural, Tubi said, citing an MRI-Simmons Cord Evolution Study of its audience. Tubi bulks up its library by licensing films and TV series — some popular and some niche. The platform does produce original content, albeit at a smaller scale than its competitors. It's also tapped Fox's sports arsenal, airing two NFL games this year on Tubi, most notably the Super Bowl in February and a Thanksgiving Day game last month. In total, Tubi boasts more than 300,000 titles on its platform.Fox's answer to streamingIn October, Fox reported that Tubi had reached profitability for the first time for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, with Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch adding that it reached that milestone \"earlier than expected.\" Tubi reported 27% revenue growth for the quarter, which was driven by an 18% increase in total view time. Murdoch said at the time the hope was for Tubi to continue on its trajectory so it could become \"a meaningful contributor\" to earnings in the near term. The growth is validation for Fox, which took a different tack to the streaming game than its media peers. Its stock is up more than 40% this year, while other media stocks haven't fared nearly as well amid a sea of uncertainty. The company offloaded its entertainment assets to Disney in 2019, and its TV business — broadcast network Fox and cable networks like Fox News — consist mostly of news and sports. In 2020, the media company acquired Tubi for $440 million. Since then, Tubi had been Fox's main answer to streaming until recently, when the company launched Fox One, a direct-to-consumer streaming service of all Fox content for $19.99 per month. Murdoch has emphasized there are no plans for Fox One to produce original or exclusive content, leaving Tubi to shine with a digital and cost-conscious audience. Free reignsPaige Bulera, a 23-year-old from Buffalo, New York, said she doesn't believe in paying for disappointment. That's why Tubi has emerged as the winner amid all of her streaming apps. Bulera said she watches movies more often than the average person and uses her sister's logins for nearly all of the major streaming services. But with each subsequent price increase, she's finding less satisfaction with their investment.\"Not only are they going up in price, it seems like with each price increase you're losing things,\" Bulera told CNBC. \"It's like now you can't share accounts with people on Netflix, or even if it goes up in price, there's still going to be ads.\"Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHer slate of movies heavily leans toward horror. Tubi said the platform has the largest collection of horror content with 9,000 titles, while also offering fan favorites spanning genres like \"Coraline,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and \"Tom and Jerry.\" \"With Tubi, it's completely free – you know you're getting ads, but it's promoted in a way where you can watch old movies, new movies, or Tubi originals, so that's why I'm a big fan of the platform, mainly because of the fact that it's cost-effective,\" Bulera said. A recent report from MoffettNathanson notes that streaming engagement remains strong at YouTube, followed by free, ad-supported platforms that include FAST channels like Tubi, Paramount Skydance's Pluto, and Roku's The Roku Channel. Tubi executives say the platform often gets caught up in the same conversation as platforms like Pluto because it offers channels in a guide format that reflect the traditional linear model. However, since nearly all of its viewership is on demand – meaning viewers are selecting films and series from the library rather than tuning into a preprogrammed channel – Tubi argues it should swim in the same pool as subscription services like Netflix and Disney+. \"Ninety-five percent of people are coming in with the intent to watch what they want to watch, and they are leaned in. They're not passive viewers,\" said Tubi's Parlapiano. Executives say that selection process makes Tubi viewers more inclined to watch ads than those tuning into other free, ad-supported channels for more of a laid-back experience — or simply to have something on in the background. That's a strong sales pitch for advertisers. \"We're 100% ad-supported, which other streamers are not. Yes, they have ad-supported tiers, but it's unclear on each platform how big those tiers are and how much viewing is happening in an ad-supported environment,\" Parlapiano said.On Fox's most recent earnings call, CFO Steve Tomsic said the company's overall TV advertising revenue was up 6%, primarily driven by Tubi's growth.Leaning into Gen ZJames Van Der Beek and Noah Beck in Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: TubiWith 58% of its viewers skewing young, Tubi has invested a lot of work into appealing to younger generations, according to company executives.In June, Tubi launched Tubi for Creators, part of a broader push from the company into incorporating content creators into Hollywood.\"The idea behind it is to give creators a pathway to Hollywood that really allows them to maintain their authenticity that made them popular in the first place and maintain a lot of creative control,\" said Rich Bloom, head of Tubi for Creators. \"We launched with six creators and about 500 episodes of content, and we're now up to well over 100 creators and over 10,000 episodes of content.\"Tubi has signed deals with well-known YouTube entertainers to add their existing episodes to the platform, such as Dan and Riya's \"Beverly Valley High\" and FunnyMike's series \"Mr. Creepy Eyes.\" It's also been inking deals with independent filmmakers through Kickstarter-funded projects.Bloom said Tubi has seen that the category is attracting new, younger audiences, and the \"retention rate of those viewers is actually better than our general new viewers.\"Tubi's Lewinson said the platform has been particularly successful with young adult movies, like \"Sidelined\" and \"Sidelined 2,\" starring TikTok star Noah Beck. The franchise has brought in nearly 20 million viewers alone, with the median age of new viewers watching the sequel just 21 years old, Lewinson added. Tubi's Sidelined 2: Interceptedsource: Tubi\"We are really proving that we can bring young viewers to a long-form streaming platform,\" he said. \"There's a perception that they're only interested in short-form – completely not accurate. So long as you have relevant content for their fandom, they'll come to Tubi.\"Gen Z is also leaning into nostalgia, with older shows like \"Columbo\" and \"Murder, She Wrote\" popular on Tubi, too. Tubi executives note its growing Gen Z and millennial audience is another selling point for advertisers. \"My acquisition team can go out and acquire whatever we can possibly find, but we're finding that as we produce these types of stories, we're really bringing in those viewers,\" Lewinson said. \"They'll come in to watch 'Sidelined,' but then we're following their journey to see what else they're watching on the platform, and we're making sure that we have plenty of those types of categories for those viewers to watch.\"Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMore than 900 U.S. flights were canceled and close to 8,000 were delayed Saturday after a major winter storm hit the Northeast U.S., putting carriers to the test during one of the busiest travel periods of the year.Snowfall totals in the area were less than the earlier forecast, though New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey each recorded more than four inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.More than 136 flights, about a fifth of the scheduled departures from Kennedy Airport, were canceled, according to flight-tracking site FlightAware. Another 87 were canceled from New York's LaGuardia Airport, about 20% of the day's scheduled departures, and 72, or 12%, of departures from Newark were scrubbed.Airlines canceled more than 1,700 flights on Friday, most of them ahead of the storm. Only 27 U.S. flights were listed as canceled for Sunday, according to FlightAware.American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue Airways and other carriers waived change fees for restrictive basic economy tickets. They said they won't charge a difference in fare for any other customers flying in and out of a host of airports in the Northeast U.S.Customers must travel by the end of the year if they change their flights, the airlines said. Flying as early as possible is likely the best bet with few seats available during the busy Christmas week.Airlines for America, the industry lobbying group, expects carriers to fly a record 52.6 million people between Dec. 19 and Jan. 5, with this Friday and Sunday among the busiest days.Airlines generally cancel flights ahead of time for major weather events in the forecast, like blizzards or hurricanes, to avoid planes, connecting travelers and crews from getting stranded and worsening disruptions.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn milesArchitect of Delta's premium strategy to retire in FebruaryFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport lounges",

Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, confer during the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies hearing titled Fiscal Year 2022 Budget Request for The Environmental Protection Agency, in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice on Wednesday said more than one million additional documents potentially related to the disgraced sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered, slowing the release of the files that supposed to be made public by last Friday.\"The US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI have informed the Department of Justice that they have uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case,\" the DOJ said in a post on X.\"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks,\" the post continued.The Christmas Eve announcement drew pushback from lawmakers who had already been critical of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Epstein, in a statement accused the White House of engaging \"in a cover-up protecting Epstein's co-conspirators and the powerful men who abused women and girls.\"\"It's outrageous that the DOJ has illegally withheld over 1 million documents from the public,\" said Garcia, who also called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress.The announcement came the same day a bipartisan group of Senators called for an audit of the DOJ's handling of the Epstein files.In a letter to DOJ Acting Inspector General Don Berthiaume, a group of 12 senators said the DOJ had violated a law -- dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act -- that passed Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump in November. The law mandated a full release of the Epstein files with minimal redactions by Dec. 19.The lawmakers -- led by Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore. -- said the DOJ has withheld files, released documents already publicly available and redacted certain releases to the extent that \"there are serious questions as to whether the Department is properly applying the limited exceptions for redaction that are permitted under the Act.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"Given the Administration's historic hostility to releasing the files, politicization of the Epstein case more broadly, and failure to comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, a neutral assessment of its compliance with the statutory disclosure requirements is essential,\" the group wrote.Inspectors general are independent watchdogs that conduct audits and investigations of federal agencies. The DOJ inspector general is \"ideally placed\" to conduct an audit because he has full access to the files, the lawmakers wrote.At the beginning of his second term, Trump fired more than a dozen inspectors general across the federal government but spared longtime DOJ watchdog Michael Horowitz, who had been in the role since 2012. Horowitz left the post in June to take on the same role at the Federal Reserve.Trump tapped Berthiaume to become the DOJ's internal watchdog in October.The DOJ has released two major batches of Epstein files since Dec. 19, but the slow trickle of documents has angered lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. In a letter to Congress on Friday, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told lawmakers the DOJ would release the files on a \"rolling basis\" through the end of the year, defying the law's requirement. Now it appears the release will continue into the new year.\"A Christmas Eve news dump of 'a million more files' only proves what we already know: Trump is engaged in a massive coverup. The question Americans deserve answered is simple: WHAT are they hiding—and WHY?\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post to X on Wednesday.Schumer vowed earlier this week to force the Senate to vote on suing the DOJ for the full release of files. And Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., have threatened to hold Bondi and Blanche in inherent contempt.\"The survivors deserve justice. The DOJ release does not comply with the Epstein Files Transparency Act and does not provide what the survivors are guaranteed under the new law,\" Massie said in a post to X on Monday.Trump, a former friend of Epstein's, was largely absent from the DOJ's initial release of documents last Friday. The latest batch of files, released Tuesday, include many references to Trump, including an email that suggests Trump traveled often on Epstein's private plane in the 1990s.Trump has denied any wrongdoing associated with the disgraced New York financier. On Tuesday, the DOJ said in a post on X that \"some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election.\"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump suggested he was open to declassifying some Epstein files, but has fought for much of this year to keep them under wraps. He has referred to the uproar over the Epstein files as a \"hoax\" and pressured some House Republican to drop their support for the legislation that would eventually compel their release. As the Epstein Files Transparency Act seemed poised to advance out of Congress, Trump belatedly gave his blessing to the effort. \"Full transparency—as called for bravely and repeatedly by survivors—is essential in identifying members of our society who enabled and participated in Epstein's crimes. Survivors deserve full disclosure,\" the lawmakers wrote. Murkowski was the lone Republican to sign the letter, though the Epstein Files Transparency Act passed both chambers with broad bipartisan support.",

Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, DC on Nov. 19, 2025.Brendan Smialowski | AFP | Getty ImagesIt's been two days since news broke that Nvidia was spending $20 billion to acquire top talent from Groq in what the chip startup called a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement.\"Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, hasn't issued a press release or regulatory filing and, according to a spokesperson, is only confirming the contents of Groq's 90-word blog post published after the close of holiday-shortened trading on Wednesday. \"They're so big now that they can do a $20 billion deal on Christmas Eve with no press release and nobody bats an eye,\" said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, in a Friday interview with CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\" While neither company confirmed the price tag, CNBC learned from Groq lead investor Alex Davis on Wednesday that Nvidia had agreed to buy assets from Groq, a designer of high-performance artificial intelligence accelerator chips, for $20 billion in cash. Davis' firm, Disruptive, has invested more than half a billion dollars in Groq and led the startup's latest financing round in September at a $6.9 billion valuation.Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross along with Sunny Madra, the company's president, and other senior leaders \"will join Nvidia to help advance and scale the licensed technology,\" the startup said in the post, adding that it will continue as an \"independent company,\" led by finance chief Simon Edwards.watch nowAs an acquisition, Groq would mark by far Nvidia's largest in its 32-year history. Its biggest prior purchase happened in 2019, when Nvidia bought Israeli chip designer Mellanox for close to $7 billion.But Nvidia is instead following a playbook used by other tech giants over the last couple years, spending billions of dollars to hire top talent in AI and to get access to key technology through licensing agreements. It's a strategy that's been employed by Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon. Nvidia itself previously used the tactic, shelling out more than $900 million in September to hire Enfabrica CEO Rochan Sankar and other employees at the AI hardware startup, and to license the company's technology, CNBC reported at the time.By avoiding traditional acquisitions, tech companies have been able to skirt some level of antitrust scrutiny and quickly close deals to bring in the people they most covet. \"Antitrust would seem to be the primary risk here, though structuring the deal as a non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive,\" Rasgon wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. His firm recommends buying Nvidia shares and has a $275 price target on the stock.Shares of Nvidia rose about 1% on Friday to $190.53. The stock has gained 42% this year and is up thirteenfold since the end of 2022, when generative AI started taking off following the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.Nvidia has been using its expanding cash pile to spread capital across the AI ecosystem, including through recent investments in OpenAI and Intel. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, up from $13.3 billion in early 2023.Widening the 'competitive moat'Groq was founded in 2016 by a group of former engineers, including Ross. He was one of the creators of Google's tensor processing units, or TPUs, the search giant's custom chips that are being used by some companies as an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Groq's specialty is on the inference side of the market, which refers to the the use of AI to make decisions based on new information. Nvidia dominates the training piece of the market, which involves teaching AI models to learn from patterns in large amounts of data. Analysts at Cantor said in a report Friday that Nvidia is \"playing both offense and defense\" by snapping up Groq's assets, keeping them from potentially landing in the hands of a competitor. \"We think this acquisition only enhances Nvidia's full system stack and overall leadership in the AI market (and only widens its competitive moat),\" wrote the analysts, who kept their buy rating and $300 price target. BofA Securities analysts also maintained their buy recommendation and $275 target following the announcement. In a note Friday, they characterized the deal as \"surprising, expensive but strategic,\" and said it shows Nvidia recognizes that \"while GPU dominated AI training, the rapid shift towards inference could require more specialized chips.\"The analysts said that key questions remain, such as who will own Groq's language processing unit intellectual property, whether it can be licensed to Nvidia competitors and whether what's left of Groq — its nascent cloud business — could possibly \"undercut NVDA's LPU-based service with lower pricing.\"Nvidia isn't commenting on any of those details for now. The first opportunity analysts and investors will likely get to hear from the company will be Jan. 5, when CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to speak at CES in Las Vegas. — CNBCs David Faber contributed to this reportWATCH: Nvidia GPUs to Google TPUs — Breaking down all the AI chipswatch now",

    "body": "McDonald’s restaurant in San Diego, California, U.S., Oct. 31, 2025.   Mike Blake | Reuters\"Value\" was the buzzword du jour for restaurant executives that lasted all year — and it will likely stick around in 2026, too.Over the last year and a half, diners, particularly those who make less than $40,000 a year, have been eating out less frequently and spending less money when they do. Higher costs, like rent and child care, have put pressure on consumers' wallets. Plus, uncertainty about the economy, President Donald Trump's higher tariffs, layoff fears and immigration crackdowns have all hurt their willingness to spend. As diners strain under pressures on their wallets, restaurants, takeout and food delivery is the category where discretionary spending is most likely to fall, according to the EY-Parthenon U.S. Consumer Sentiment Survey. Nearly a quarter of respondents said that they would first cut spending on eating out, ahead of entertainment, travel and home maintenance. It's no surprise, then, that data from Black Box Intelligence shows that traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month this year through November, with one exception: July. That month, guest count ticked up 0.1%.To win back a shrinking pool of diners, restaurants have responded by doubling down on efforts to offer diners more \"value.\" In the fast-food segment, that means combo meals and value menus. For casual-dining chains, value has translated into appetizer deals, marketing that compares the narrowing price gap with fast food, and a focus on the in-restaurant experience. And fast-casual chains have responded by emphasizing their quality while trying to stay away from the so-called value wars.\"This is the most intense discount environment since the Great Recession,\" Cava co-founder and CEO Brett Schulman said on the company's earnings conference call in November.McDonald's value pushTo understand the industry's evolving value strategy, look no further than McDonald's, the largest U.S. restaurant chain by sales and often a bellwether for the consumer economy. The burger giant briefly became the poster child for higher fast-food prices in 2024, leading the company to make a rare public rebuttal against social media posts claiming that its prices had more than doubled since 2019. But that didn't stop consumers from viewing its prices as too high, which put the company on the defensive. In 2024, it launched a $5 value meal in the U.S. in a bid to attract the low-income consumers who had been cutting back on their visits.As the value gap closed between casual-dining chains like Chili's and fast-food restaurants, McDonald's and its peers haven't benefitted from the spending pullback the way they typically would when consumer spending falls, according to Moody's analyst Michael Zuccaro. This year, McDonald's further stepped up its emphasis on value. It extended the $5 value meal months longer than expected and added a buy one, get one for $1 deal for select menu items in January. In September, the chain brought back its Extra Value Meals, which save customers 15% on combo meals compared with buying the entree, fries and drink separately.The chain's efforts have succeeded in winning back some customers, plus attracting new diners. In the third quarter, it reported U.S. same-store sales growth of 2.4%.\"I think sometimes there's this idea that value only matters to low-income [consumers],\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's earnings call in early November. \"But value matters to everybody, whether you're upper income, middle income, lower income, feeling like you're getting good value for your dollar is important.\"Plus, McDonald's has other promotions that also seem to offer value. The chain is currently offering a Grinch Meal, which comes with an entree, dill pickle McShaker fries, a drink and collectible socks. \"This time of year, you've got promotional things that you can do that really promotes value. You can get a free pair of socks,\" said Jay Bandy, president of Goliath Consulting Group, which has worked with Church's Chicken and Zaxby's, among others.McDonald's fast-food rivals have followed its lead, offering their own more sophisticated value options for price-conscious customers. For example, Yum Brands' Taco Bell followed up the introduction of its $7 Luxe Cravings boxes in 2024 by adding $5 and $9 versions earlier this year.\"The numbers that I've seen is [Taco Bell has] converted a lot of their customers to the higher-price boxes, and that's what you want. If you can't grow your traffic, you're getting them to stop spending $7 and start spending $9,\" Technomic analyst Rich Shank told CNBC.Broadly, operators have to balance discounts that will attract customers with the razor-thin margins common in the industry. Usually that means companies offer value items that get customers into the drive-thru lane, and then dangle tantalizing enough options as an add-on, whether it's a McFlurry or a premium entree.\"It's hard to sell things in the [quick-service restaurant] world for $5 and make your margins,\" Bandy said. \"Those chains are hoping that somebody in the car is also ordering a full price value meal at $9 so they can balance it out, so that's part of the strategy there.\"McDonald's, which franchises about 95% of its restaurant footprint, has helped its operators offset the hit to their margins by chipping in with corporate marketing support and co-investing in the discounts on the Extra Value Meals. Longtime partner Coca-Cola contributed marketing funds as well, making the deals more attractive to franchisees.\"McDonald's offering subsidies to franchisees is definitely unusual, and [it shows] that they have high conviction that what they're doing is really going to help repair the value perception to lead to a healthier trajectory as we get to 2026 on same-store sales,\" TD Cowen analyst Andrew Charles told CNBC. Heading into 2026, McDonald's will stop providing corporate support to its franchisees by the end of the first quarter, CFO Ian Borden told analysts in early November. Just as corporate support dries up, the company will start holding franchisees accountable for the value that they offer diners at their restaurants. Operators will still have the ability to set their own prices, but new franchising standards will assess if operators' prices are too high, particularly if it is affecting their restaurants' traffic or customer satisfaction scores. In other words, after more than year offering the carrot to operators, now comes the proverbial stick. The only thing that isn't changing about the strategy is the focus on value.Fast-casual's strugglesA customer carries a Chipotle bag in San Francisco, California, US, on Friday, Jan. 31, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhile fast food has aimed to compete on price, the fast-casual segment has largely stayed out of the value wars this year, to the detriment of sales.Cava, Sweetgreen and Chipotle Mexican Grill all reported underwhelming results for the last two quarters. Executives blamed younger consumers who have pulled back on spending. The demographic has a higher unemployment rate than the broader population, plus student loan repayments resumed in the spring, putting more pressure on their wallets. And as the pool of diners has shrunk, fast-casual chains have faced increasing pricing competition from both fast food and casual-dining chains. \"Fast casual has followed quick-service's playbook in 2025. What I mean by that is that they focus on limited-time offering, they focus on increased advertising, they focus on speed of service. But the last tenet of quick service that fast casual has not yet followed is value. And I think a lot are going to try to avoid it as long as they can,\" said Charles.For most fast-casual chains, the only widely available discount is on their stock price.Cava's Schulman, for example, flatly said on the company's latest earnings call that the Mediterranean chain isn't planning to get into discounts.Chipotle has similarly resisted any calls for discounts, although recent promotions like its \"Unwrap Extra\" series timed for the holiday season offer buy-one, get-one deals. Executives have instead leaned into emphasizing the chain's quality and relative value.\"We are still a 20% to 30% discount to our fast-casual peers in the sector,\" Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright said on the company's conference call in late October.Sweetgreen has become the outlier. The salad chain is planning to target infrequent members of its rewards programs with discounts. Earlier this month, it rolled out a 'Tis the Seasoned Harvest Bowl with Blackened Chicken that's only $10 for loyalty members, a discount of roughly $6. But it is more difficult for fast-casual chains to compete in the value wars. For one, the category, best known for its so-called slop bowls, doesn't have the same obvious value items as other restaurant segments. Casual-dining can discount appetizers, while fast food can throw in a free cheeseburger. Plus, once chains start leaning into lower prices, it can be difficult to stop because customers expect the deals and aren't willing to pay full price. For now, most fast-casual restaurant executives seem unwilling to take the hit to their profit margins.\"I think it's getting more difficult for fast casual to show value, because then they're pushing down to [quick-service restaurant] prices, and they can't afford to,\" Goliath's Bandy said.Panera Bread is one fast-casual chain that is trying to crack the value code. The privately held chain is working on a barbell menu strategy, which offers diners options on both the low- and high-price end. Still, Panera CEO Paul Carbone told CNBC in November that the chain hadn't yet cracked the code.The winners in valueAn aerial view of a Chili's restaurant on December 13, 2024 in Rohnert Park, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesWhile restaurants are still waging the value wars, at least one early winner has emerged.Brinker International's Chili's has reported double-digit same-store sales and traffic growth every quarter of the calendar year. The casual-dining chain's unlikely comeback follows a successful turnaround led by CEO Kevin Hochman and savvy, well-timed marketing that positioned its $10.99 Big Smasher meal against fast-food prices. The virality of its Triple Dipper promotion further fueled the chain's soaring sales growth.Chili's has succeeded in luring high-income diners to its restaurants who are trading down from the fine-dining segment. But the chain is also gaining market share with customers who make less than $60,000 a year, showing that its value messaging is resonating across a broad swath of consumers.Then there's Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and other well-known full-service chains. The restaurant company has been raising its menu prices by levels less than the rate of inflation and leaning into promotions, like Olive Garden's popular Never Ending Pasta Bowl and a $55 three-course meal at Ruth's Chris. Darden has also been rolling out the option of smaller portions at a lower price for select menu items at Olive Garden; the company isn't planning on promoting the lighter portions menu for fear of sales cannibalization, but it is improving the chain's affordability scores.Thanks to all of those efforts, Darden is seeing high-income consumers trade down into its casual-dining chains and a traffic bump from diners who are at least 55 years old, CEO Rick Cardenas said on the company's conference call on Thursday. Darden's same-store sales increased 4.3% in its latest fiscal quarter, and every restaurant division reported same-store sales growth. Still, investors haven't rewarded their success; the stock has risen just 1% so far this year. TD Cowen's Charles named Burger King and Taco Bell as two of his winners — largely because they didn't have to lean on value to same extent to report domestic same-store sales growth that topped McDonald's results.\"I think that value is really a losing track, just given the fact that you're doing lower margin, you're degrading the brand. It's not really the best strategy that restaurants can go with,\" he said.Where are the value wars headed?For now, it looks unlikely that most restaurants will ditch their value-focused strategy, although they will face more challenges ahead.Economists aren't expecting any sudden improvements in the economy. Costs — particularly beef — are still rising, which means restaurants will have to choose between preserving their profit margins by hiking menu prices or holding onto customers. And the value wars will likely intensify, particularly in January, when diners are trying to stick to New Year's resolutions, adhere to stricter budgets or stay warm during winter storms. The seasonal traffic dip in January and February could be even steeper this year, thanks to inflation, the uncertain job market and other economic uncertainties, Technomic's Shank said. Moody's has a negative outlook for the overall restaurant industry, Zuccaro said, citing declining traffic and higher labor and commodity costs.\"While inflation has eased, it's not coming down,\" he said. \"Beef is going to take some time.\"Plus, the consumer mindset has changed. For years, Technomic has tracked consumers' stance on the components of value. Traditionally, price fell below quality and service. But now, those components are all about even.\"It's certainly a price-point driven market,\" Shank said.Even value winners like Chili's and Darden won't be able to rest on their laurels in the new year. Zuccaro anticipates that the chains that have done well will be under pressure to keep up their results, particularly as underperformers steal from their playbooks and attempt to win back their market share.\"The whole pie is not growing, and it's just a matter of the companies being able to do all these things right to get their slice — and get a bigger slice of it,\" he said.",

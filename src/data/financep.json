Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase has secured deals ensuring it will get paid by the fintech firms responsible for nearly all the data requests made by third-party apps connected to customer bank accounts, CNBC has learned.The bank has signed updated contracts with the fintech middlemen that make up more than 95% of the data pulls on its systems, including Plaid, Yodlee, Morningstar and Akoya, according to JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri.\"We've come to agreements that will make the open banking ecosystem safer and more sustainable and allow customers to continue reliably and securely accessing their favorite financial products,\" Pusateri said in a statement. \"The free market worked.\"The milestone is the latest twist in a long-running dispute between traditional banks and the fintech industry over access to customer accounts. For years, middlemen like Plaid paid nothing to tap bank systems when a customer wanted to use a fintech app like Robinhood to draw funds or check balances.That dynamic appeared to be enshrined in law in late 2024, when the Biden-era Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized what is known as the \"open-banking rule\" requiring banks to share customer data with other financial firms at no cost.But banks sued to prevent the CFPB rule from taking hold and seemed to gain the upper hand in May after the Trump administration asked a federal court to vacate the rule.Soon after, JPMorgan — the largest U.S. bank by assets, deposits and branches — reportedly told the middlemen that it would start charging what amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars for access to its customer data.In response, fintech, crypto and venture capital executives argued that the bank was engaging in \"anti-competitive, rent-seeking behavior\" that would hurt innovation and consumers' ability to use popular apps.After weeks of negotiations between JPMorgan and the middlemen, the bank agreed to lower pricing than it originally proposed, and the fintech middlemen won concessions regarding the servicing of data requests, according to people with knowledge of the talks.Fintech firms preferred the certainty of locking in data-sharing rates because it is unclear whether the current CFPB, which is in the process of revising the open-banking rule, will favor banks or fintech companies, according to a venture capital investor who asked for anonymity to discuss his portfolio companies.The bank and the fintech firms declined to disclose details about their contracts, including how much the middlemen agreed to pay and how long the deals are in force.Wider impactThe deals mark a shift in the power dynamic between banks, middlemen and the fintech apps that are increasingly threatening incumbents. More banks are likely to begin charging fintech firms for access to their systems, according to industry observers.  \"JPMorgan tends to be a trendsetter. They're sort of the leader of the pack, so it's fair to expect that the rest of the major banks will follow,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator.Shearer, who worked at the CFPB under former director Rohit Chopra, said he's worried that the development would create a barrier of entry to nascent startups and ultimately result in higher costs for consumers.Source: RobinhoodProponents of the 2024 CFPB rule said it gave consumers control over their financial data and encouraged competition and innovation. Banks including JPMorgan said it exposed them to fraud and unfairly saddled them with the rising costs of maintaining systems increasingly tapped by the middlemen and their clients.  When Plaid's deal with JPMorgan was announced in September, the companies issued a dual press release emphasizing the continuity it provided for customers.But the industry group that Plaid is a part of has harshly criticized the development, signaling that while JPMorgan has won a decisive battle, the ongoing skirmish may yet play out in courts and in the public.\"Introducing prohibitive tolls is anti-competitive, anti-innovation, and flies in the face of the plain reading of the law,\" Penny Lee, CEO of the Financial Technology Association, told CNBC in response to the JPMorgan milestone.\"These agreements are not the free market at work, but rather big banks using their market position to capitalize on regulatory uncertainty,\" Lee said. \"We urge the Trump Administration to uphold the law by maintaining the existing prohibition on data access fees.\"",

    "body": "Job seekers wait to enter the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe first economic data report that went unreleased due to the government shutdown will be released next week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.As the U.S. government reopens for business, Wall Street's attention now turns toward when critical data on employment, inflation and other economic signposts will be released.The first such report, on September nonfarm payrolls, will come out Thursday at 8:30 a.m., according to a BLS update posted on its website.A day later, the BLS will release real earnings, a companion report to the monthly consumer price index that did not come out simultaneously in October because average earnings earnings, which are part of the payrolls report, were not released. Real earnings are the difference between the monthly CPI reading and the average hourly earnings.In fact, September CPI was the only official data point released during the shutdown due to its role in computing the cost of living adjustment for Social Security benefits.Economists expect that the \"employment situation\" report, as it is known, to include just the nonfarm payrolls count and not the unemployment rate.That's because the report entails two surveys: a more objective look at \"hard data\" from businesses that uses timecards and payroll numbers to assess how many jobs have been filled, and another entailing telephone calls and written surveys to households asking how many people are working. The latter survey is used to calculate the jobless rate and would be difficult to replicate.The Commerce Department, including the Bureau of Economic Analysis, had not posted revised schedules as of Friday morning, but updates are expected soon.Uncertainty on other releases casts another cloud over what has become an increasingly contentious policymaking atmosphere at the Federal Reserve — not to mention the nervous climate among investors.\"The absence of timely official numbers left the markets and the Fed operating in a data fog, forced to scour alternate sources to gauge the underlying outlook,\" Bank of America economist Shruti Mishra said in a note. \"With the shutdown resolved, all eyes will now be on the incoming data dump.\"The shutdown not only halted data collection and releases, but it also complicated the picture once the data does start coming out.watch nowFor instance, the October CPI report may never be compiled, owing also to the method used to gather data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in-person visits, so the data can't be collected retroactively. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned Wednesday about missing data, but Mishra said she wasn't expecting the CPI report even before that.A statement on the BLS site asks for patience during the data collection process as \"it may take time to fully assess the situation and finalize revised release dates.\" Similarly, the BEA, which releases several key data points including the Fed's inflation gauge, said it is working with the BLS and other agencies on data collection and \"will publish updated release dates as soon as they are available.\"Political pressureIn the meantime, some Democratic lawmakers already are getting impatient and demanding answers from the administration about when the data will be released.Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Gary Peters of Michigan insisted that \"government shutdowns do not inherently inhibit the federal government from collecting or releasing economic data,\" according to a letter obtained by CNBC.comCiting precedent from the October 2013 shutdown, in which the BLS later published release dates, the administration \"may be intentionally restricting the release of data.\"\"The Trump Administration's failure to release data or provide a clear schedule for the release of delayed data leaves businesses and policymakers without access to critical economic information,\" the letter states. \"It is critical that businesses, consumers, workers, Congress, and the Fed have access to timely and comprehensive economic data. The Administration must release as much economic data as possible before the Fed's meeting and resume normally scheduled data releases as soon as possible.\"White House officials did not respond to a request for comment.Waiting for the FedSince Leavitt's statement Wednesday, several officials did say data would be forthcoming but there are still questions on which reports will come out when. Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said data on payrolls and prices will have to be assessed for accuracy before it can be released.\"I'm not sure when BLS, if and when they will be able to release that, but I'm expecting they will tell us a schedule very quickly about when those numbers could come out,\" Chavez-DeRemer said Friday on Fox Business. Chavez added that the White House has been \"urging for accurate data to come out for November.\"Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst said in a Friday note that he is optimistic the Fed will have the September, October and November jobs reports by the time it holds its next policy meeting on Dec. 9-10. Fed officials in September indicated that a December cut would be likely, but several key officials have said recently that they are suspect of the need for additional easing.Outside of the payrolls and CPI report, the BLS also computes data on import and export prices, job openings, producer prices, productivity and other metrics. The Labor Department itself releases the weekly jobless claims numbers.Beyond the BLS and Labor Department issues, the Commerce Department also handles several key data points.Among them are personal income and spending, which includes the Fed's main inflation forecasting measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index, and gross domestic product. Data for October PCE is scheduled to be released Nov. 26. The Census Bureau handles retail sales, trade balance and durable good releases. Department officials did not respond to a request for comment.",

    "body": "Nikolas Kokovlis | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAlphabet and Disney on Friday announced that they've reached a deal to restore content from ABC and ESPN onto Google's YouTube TV.The deal comes after a two-week standoff between the two companies that started on Oct. 31. The stalemate resulted in numerous live sporting events, including college football games and two Monday Night Football games, being absent from the popular streaming service.\"We're happy to share that we've reached an agreement with Disney that preserves the value of our service for our subscribers and future flexibility in our offers,\" YouTube said in a statement. \"Subscribers should see channels including ABC, ESPN and FX returning to their service over the course of the day, as well as any recordings that were previously in their Library. We apologize for the disruption and appreciate our subscribers' patience as we negotiated on their behalf.\"Disney Entertainment's co-chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, along with ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, said in a statement that said the agreement reflects \"how audiences choose to watch\" entertainment.\"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football,\" they said.More than 20 Disney-owned channels were removed from YouTube TV, which offered its subscribers $20 credits this week due to the dispute. In addition to ABC and ESPN, other networks that were unavailable included FX, NatGeo, Disney Channel and Freeform. The main sticking point between the two companies was the rate Disney charges YouTube TV for its networks. Disney's most valuable channel, ESPN, charges carriage of more than $10 a month per pay-TV subscriber, a higher fee than any other network in the U.S., CNBC previously reported.It's not the first conflict this year between YouTube and legacy media.NBCUniversal content was nearly removed from YouTube TV before the companies reached an agreement in October, preventing shows like \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"America's Got Talent\" from being pulled.YouTube TV also found itself in a standoff with Fox in August that almost resulted in Fox News, Fox Sports and other Fox channels going dark on the service just before the start of the college football season. The two sides were able to strike a deal to prevent a blackout.YouTube said it has the option for future program packages with Disney and other partners.Disney said that access to a selection of live and on-demand programming from ESPN Unlimited, which includes content from ESPN+ and new content on its all-inclusive digital service coming later this year, will be available on YouTube TV to base plan subscribers at no additional cost by the end of 2026.Here's the memo that Disney executives sent to employees:Team,We're pleased to share that we've reached a new agreement with YouTube TV, and all of our stations and networks are in the process of being restored to the service.While this was a challenging moment, it ultimately led to a strong outcome for both consumers and for our company, with a deal that recognizes the tremendous value of the high-quality entertainment, sports, and news that fans have come to expect from Disney.Over the past few years, we've led the way in creating innovative deals with key partners –each one unique, and each designed to recognize the full value of our programming. This new agreement reflects that same creativity and commitment to doing what's best for both our audiences and our business.We're proud of the work that went into this deal and grateful to everyone who helped make it happen — especially Sean Breen, Jimmy Zasowski, and the Platform Distribution team for their tireless commitment throughout this process.Thank you all for your patience and professionalism over the past several weeks. As you all know, the media landscape continues to evolve quickly, which makes these types of negotiations complex. What hasn't changed is our focus on the viewer. Our priority is — and will always be — delivering the best experiences and the best value to fans, and we'll continue working closely with our partners to ensure we're fulfilling that mission for our audiences.We're incredibly optimistic about what's ahead and grateful to all of you for continuing to set the standard for entertainment around the world.Alan, Dana & JimmyDisclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC.

    "body": "Nvidia President and CEO Jensen Huang speaks about NVIDIA Omniverse as he delivers the keynote address during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center on Oct. 28, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images As a handful of the world's most valuable companies set out to spend $1 trillion over the next five years on data centers for artificial intelligence, one line item is on the minds of executives and investors: depreciation.In accounting, depreciation is the act of allocating the cost of a hard asset over the course of its expected useful life. It's an increasingly important concept in the tech industry, as companies predict how long the hundreds of thousands of Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, they're purchasing will remain useful or retain their value.Infrastructure giants like Google, Oracle and Microsoft have said their servers could be useful for up to six years. But they could also depreciate much sooner. Microsoft said in its latest annual filing that its computer equipment lasts two to six years.That's a lot to consider for the investors and lenders financing the giant AI buildouts, because the longer equipment remains valuable, the more years a company can stretch out depreciation and the less it hurts profits.Read more CNBC reporting on AIThis Meta alum has spent 10 months leading OpenAI's nationwide hunt for its Stargate data centersAI Sam Altman and the Sora copyright gamble: 'I hope Nintendo doesn't sue us'Anthropic launches Claude Sonnet 4.5, its latest AI model that's 'more of a colleague'Sam Altman on worries about OpenAI’s $850 billion in planned buildouts: ‘I totally get that’AI GPUs represent a particular challenge because they're still relatively new to the market. Nvidia's first AI-focused processors for data centers came out around 2018. The current AI boom started with the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. Since then, Nvidia's annual data center revenue has jumped from $15 billion to $115 billion in the fiscal year that ended in January.There's no real track record for how long GPUs last when compared with other types of heavy equipment that businesses have been using for decades, said Haim Zaltzman, vice chair of Latham & Watkins' emerging companies and growth practice.\"Is it three years, is it five, or is it seven?\" said Zaltzman, who works on GPU financings, in an interview. \"It's a huge difference in terms of how successful it is for financing purposes.\"Some of Nvidia's customers say AI chips will retain value for a long time and that customers will continue to pay for access to older processors because they'll still be useful for other tasks. CoreWeave, which buys GPUs and rents them out to clients, has used six-year depreciation cycles for its infrastructure since 2023.CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator told CNBC this week, following quarterly earnings, that his company is being \"data driven\" about GPU shelf life.Intrator said that CoreWeave's Nvidia A100 chips, which were announced in 2020, are all fully booked. He also added that a batch of Nvidia H100 chips from 2022 became available because a contract expired, and they were immediately booked at 95% of their original price.\"All of the data points that I'm getting are telling me that the infrastructure retains value,\" Intrator said.CoreWeave CEO, Michael Intrator appears on CNBC on July 17, 2024. CNBCStill, CoreWeave shares plunged 16% after its earnings report as delays at a third-party data center developer hit full-year guidance. The stock is down 57% from its high reached in June, part of a broader sell-off reflecting concerns about overspending in AI. Oracle shares have plummeted 34% from their record high in September.Among the most vocal skeptics of the AI trade is short seller Michael Burry, who recently disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir.Burry this week suggested that companies including Meta, Oracle, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are overstating the useful life of their AI chips and understating depreciation. He pegs the actual useful life of server equipment at around two to three years, and said companies are inflating their earnings as a result.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta, Google and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment.'You couldn't give Hoppers away'There are a number of ways AI chips could depreciate before six years. They could wear out and break, or they could become obsolete as newer GPUs are released. They could still be useful for running certain workloads, but with much worse economics.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has implied as much. When Nvidia announced a new Blackwell chip earlier this year, he joked that the value of its predecessor, the Hopper, would deteriorate.\"When Blackwell starts shipping in volume, you couldn't give Hoppers away,\" Huang said in March at Nvidia's AI conference.\"There are circumstances where Hopper is fine,\" he continued. \"Not many.\"Nvidia now releases new AI chips on an annual basis, versus the two-year cadence it had before. Advanced Micro Devices, its closest GPU competitor, followed suit.Nvidia reports quarterly results next week.Amazon, in a February filing, said it decreased the useful life for a subset of its servers from six years to five years because it conducted a study that found \"an increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\"Meanwhile, other hyperscalers are extending their GPU useful life estimates for newer server equipment.Microsoft Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella speaks during the Microsoft Build 2025, conference in Seattle, Washington, on May 19, 2025.Jason Redmond | AFP | Getty ImagesAlthough Microsoft plans to build AI infrastructure aggressively, CEO Satya Nadella said this week that his company is trying to space out its AI chip purchases and not overinvest in a single generation of processors. He added that the biggest competitor for any new Nvidia AI chip is its predecessor.\"One of the biggest learnings we had even with Nvidia is that their pace increased in terms of their migrations,\" Nadella said. \"That was a big factor. I didn't want to go get stuck with four or five years of depreciation on one generation.\"Nvidia declined to comment.Dustin Madsen, vice president of the Society of Depreciation Professionals and founder of Emrydia Consulting, said depreciation is a financial estimate by management and that developments in a fast-moving industry like technology can change initial predictions.Depreciation estimates, Madsen said, generally take into account assumptions such as technological obsolescence, maintenance, historical lifespans of similar equipment and internal engineering analysis.\"You're going to have to convince an auditor that what you're suggesting what its life will be is actually its life,\" Madsen said. \"They will look at all of those factors, like your engineering data that suggests that the life of these assets is approximately six years, and they will audit that at a very detailed level.\"-- CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this story.WATCH: Chris Wood: We've removed Nvidia from our portfolio, prefer China AI nameswatch now",

    "body": "NASA astronaut Anne McClain is helped out of the SpaceX Dragon Endurance spacecraft onboard the SpaceX recovery ship SHANNON after she, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Kirill Peskov landed in the Pacific Ocean on August 9, 2025 off the coast of San Diego, California. Nasa | Getty ImagesA former Air Force intelligence officer has pleaded guilty to lying to a federal agent by falsely claiming that her estranged astronaut wife illegally accessed her bank account while aboard the International Space Station for six months, prosecutors in Houston, Texas, said Friday.The guilty plea by Summer Worden, 50, on Thursday comes more than five years after she was indicted in the space case for lying about actions by her wife, Anne McClain, a U.S. Army colonel, West Point graduate and Iraq war combat veteran, while they were in the midst of a divorce.The claim came at a time when Worden said that the couple was engaged in a custody battle over what Worden's then-6-year-old son, who had been conceived through in vitro fertilization and carried by a surrogate.Worden's trial in the case was scheduled to begin next Monday in Houston federal court.The Kansas resident was accused of making false statements about McClain to NASA's Office of Inspector General and the Federal Trade Commission, where she alleged that McCain had committed identity theft.Worden in July \"alleged her estranged spouse had guessed the password and illegally accessed her bank account while the spouse was deployed to the International Space Station,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Texas said in a statement headlined \"Far Out\" on Friday.Read more CNBC politics coverageU.S. and Switzerland reach trade deal to lower tariffs to 15%Goldman Sachs stands by top lawyer after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedGovernment shutdown back pay headed to federal workers in coming daysJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsSupreme Court to hear arguments on Trump bid to fire Fed Gov. Lisa Cook on Jan. 21\"However, Worden had actually opened the account in April 2018,\" the office said. \"Both parties had accessed it until January 2019 when Worden changed the credentials.\"\"The investigation revealed Worden had granted her spouse access to her bank records from at least 2015, including her login credentials,\" the statement said. At the time of the alleged illegal access, McClain was preparing for what NASA billed as the first all-female space walk, which was later scrapped because the agency did not have enough spacesuits to fit the astronauts.McClain's attorney told The New York Times in 2019 that she had checked the account to monitor the family's finances, and that she had never been told by Worden that she could not have access to the account.McClain was aboard the Space Station from December 2018 through June 2019.She recently commanded the SpaceX Crew-10 crew mission to the Space Station from March this year until August.Worden, who remains free on bond, is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 12.She faces a maximum possible sentence of up to five years in prison.CNBC has requested comment from attorneys for Worden and McClain.",

He recalled selling a third of Baron Funds' Tesla holding a few years ago due to criticism from his clients and the media about the significant concentration in a single stock. Baron emphasized that his personal position remains entirely intact.\"We sold 30% for clients. I did not sell personally a single share,\" he said.Roughly 40% of his personal net worth is invested in the electric-vehicle maker, alongside 25% in SpaceX and about 35% in Baron mutual funds.Tesla shares are down 18% from their 52-week high and were on track to open 5% lower on Friday as investors this week rethink the AI-related shares that have led the bull market.Baron said he's already made about $8 billion from Tesla over the years, and he believes he could make five times that over the next decade.Baron recounted a promise he made to the board of his mutual funds when he sought approval decades ago to invest in public stocks, a pledge that effectively binds him to Tesla and SpaceX for life.\"I told the board, 'If you let me invest a certain amount of money, then I will promise that I won't sell any of my stock. I will be the last person out of the stock,'\" he said. \"I will not sell a single share of my shares until my clients sold 100% of their shares. ...

As part of the split, Curry will maintain sole ownership of Curry Brand and is free to find another retail partner. Under Armour will release the Curry 13, the final Curry Brand shoe with Under Armour, in February.\"For Under Armour, this moment is about discipline and focus on the core UA brand during a critical stage of our turnaround,\" Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement. \"And for Stephen, it's the right moment to let what we created evolve on his terms. We'll always be grateful for what he's brought to the UA team.\" \"What Curry Brand stands for, what I stand for and my commitment to that mission will never change, it's only growing stronger,\" Curry said in a statement. \"I'm excited for a future that's focused on aggressive growth with a continued commitment to keep showing up for the next generation.\" Under Armour's split with Curry was announced alongside an expansion of the company's restructuring plan. The company now expects it to cost $255 million, $95 million more than it previously said, including the separation of the Curry brand, additional contract terminations, impairment charges and severance costs. Under Armour's basketball business, including the Curry brand, is expected to bring in between $100 million and $120 million in revenue during the current fiscal year, which will end early next year, the company said in a news release. The separation is not expected to have a \"significant effect\" on Under Armour's financial results or profitability, it said.watch nowUnder Armour's breakup with Curry, one of the most successful and widely known basketball players of his generation, comes at a difficult point for the brand. The company has seen a revolving door of top leadership, sales have fallen for eight straight quarters and Plank is trying to position it as a premium brand at a time when consumers aren't spending as much on new clothes and shoes.Plus, the competitive landscape has changed dramatically since Plank founded the business in 1996. These days, even industry leaders like Nike are struggling to hold on to their market share in the face of upstarts like On and Hoka, which have been wooing top athletes and winning over a new generation of customers. To reignite sales, Plank has worked to fix Under Armour's assortment and redefine the brand more clearly in a strategy he said will begin to show up on shelves, stores and social channels this fall and winter season.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Under Armour shares have fallen about 40% this year. Nike and Adidas, which both have partnerships with an array of top NBA players, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Curry's partnership with Under Armour had long been a focal point for the brand and presumably would have been a major part of its turnaround strategy. Given the state of Under Armour's business, the abrupt breakup raises questions about what may have driven the split.Over the last nine years, Curry was mentioned on just about every quarterly earnings call Under Armour held, according to a review of transcripts dating back to 2016. But in its most recent one last week, there was no reference to Curry or the partnership.The sneakers worn by Stephen Curry #30 of the Golden State Warriors before the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves during Round 2 Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs on May 6, 2025 at Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Jesse D. Garrabrant | National Basketball Association | Getty ImagesDuring the call, Plank talked about the brand's opportunities in football and intimated it could do more in basketball.\"You can take a category like basketball that's roughly $100 million globally for us all in. And we think to ourself it's incredible for a $5 billion company, that can't exploit that in a bigger, better way,\" said Plank. \"So being underscaled relative to the potential we have and the opportunity that we have to grow it. So we're approaching that positioning as to where do we have the right to play, the right to win, and we think we can just do a little better.\"Curry Brandwatch nowIn 2013, Curry shocked the sneaker world by signing with Under Armour over Nike. At the time, Under Armour was a much smaller brand, but Curry was drawn to the company's \"underdog mentality.\"Curry told CNBC Sport earlier this year he hoped Curry Brand will outlive his playing career and become a brand other athletes embrace — similar to Nike's Jordan Brand. The four-time NBA champion and two-time league MVP is 37 and nearing the end of his basketball playing career, and he has started to focus more on golf and other business activities outside of basketball.Curry Brand launched in 2020. In 2023, the brand signed a new long-term extension and made Curry the president, housed under Under Armour's banner. As part of that deal, the 11-time NBA All-Star was given 8.8 million Under Armour common shares, valued at $75 million at the time, in addition to other awards and incentives.Under Armour will continue to develop new UA Basketball products after parting with Curry, according to a statement.\"This move lets two strong teams do what they do best,\" Plank said in the statement. \"Under Armour is focused on product innovation and performance for athletes at every level. Curry Brand gets the independence to determine its own future. That's good for Stephen and good for UA.\" — CNBC's Jessica Golden contributed to this report",

    "body": "PATNA, INDIA - OCTOBER 31: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar along with BJP national president J.P. Nadda, HAM party founder Jitanram Manjhi, RLM president Upendra Kushwaha and others releasing NDA manifesto (Sankalp Patra) ahead of Bihar Assembly Elections 2025Hindustan Times | Hindustan Times | Getty ImagesThe electoral victory for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party in a key state is set to pave the way for New Delhi to make farm-related concessions, a central demand of U.S. trade negotiators.The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP), is poised for landslide victory in Bihar with trends showing it leading in nearly 200 of the 243 seats, while the opposition is ahead in less than 30 seats, data from India's election commission shows.A strong and positive verdict from Bihar — India's third most populous state and a large producer of corn — is expected to encourage the government to conclude a trade deal with the U.S. Such a deal would include purchases of more agricultural products from the U.S., said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow and research lead at the Institute of South Asian Studies.However, these purchases of farm products from the U.S. will be \"couched in a manner that does not suggest that the government is going to back away on its commitment to domestic farmers,\" he said.Indian exports to the U.S. currently face some of the highest tariffs, of 50%, but the two sides have been engaged in negotiations for a \"fair trade deal.\"In September, U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on his criticism of India, calling trade ties with the country \"a totally one-sided disaster!\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick later asserted this position in an interview with Axios stating \"India brags about having 1.4 billion people but won't buy even a small amount of American corn.\"During Indian Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal's visit to Washington in late September, Indian officials reportedly acknowledged that \"fresh offers have been made,\" including discussions to buy corn for ethanol production.While several rounds of trade negotiations have occurred between the two countries, and U.S. has since softened its stance with Trump even hinting that Washington will reduce tariffs on India, a trade deal has been elusive.watch nowThe Indian government is waiting for the Bihar elections to end to finalise a trade deal with the U.S., said Praveen Jagwani, CEO of UTI International, adding that New Delhi has made some concessions around farm related issues.Despite trade negotiation pressures, substantial barriers to U.S. corn imports persist, S&P Global said in a note on Oct 2.  India has banned genetically modified crop imports and 94% of U.S. corn consists of GMO varieties, S&P noted adding that India's tariff structure \"imposes a 15% duty on corn imports up to 500,000 mt, with rates jumping to 50% beyond that threshold.\"Easing of these terms could raise \"dumping concerns that could impact domestic farmers\" S&P said. Proposals to import maize from the U.S. is already causing discomfort among farmers, according to local media reports in October.The NDA win in Bihar will give the government some political room to push for regulated maize imports which can be used as poultry feed under the U.S.-India trade talks, M.J. Khan president of Indian council for food and agriculture told CNBC in a written statement.He added however that the government may not approve genetically modified maize, as farmer sensitivities are \"still too strong.\"More major state elections are due next year, such as in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala — all states, where farming lobbies are significant — followed by Uttar Pradesh in 2027.  \"Projecting a pro-farmer image, while balancing trade interests and strategic ties with the US, will be the priority for the BJP government,\" said Palit of Institute of South Asian Studies.",

    "body": "watch nowArtificial intelligence is changing the way human resources leaders envision roles, skills, and experiences of their workforce, as generative AI transforms many jobs.\"AI is reshaping the future of work by redistributing tasks within jobs.\" Those were the words of a U.S.-based chief human resources officer in response to a flash survey CNBC circulated last week among members of the CNBC Workforce Executive Council, a collection of public and private company human resources leaders.When asked if AI is currently having an impact on jobs at their firms, more than two-thirds (67%) of senior human resources executives polled in the CNBC survey said it is. The survey defined \"impact\" as having a significant portion of an employee's previous tasks automated or changing the way they work on a daily basis. About 50% of the 21 senior HR leaders who responded said AI impacted fewer than half of the jobs at their organizations. Meanwhile, 17%  said nearly half or more than half of the jobs were affected, and 11% reported being unsure. And, 22% said it has \"no impact\" on jobs at all. \"It is still too early to tell,\" said one HR leader in comments about the survey. \"Most organizations have not completely integrated AI tools into every job, nor have they identified ways to measure the impact.\"That may change dramatically in the next 12 months, as 89% of the senior leaders surveyed say AI will impact jobs next year. About 45% said AI will impact nearly half or more than half of all jobs, and 44% said it will affect less than half of all jobs. About 11% said no jobs will be impacted.Nearly two in five senior leaders (38%) said their firms will maintain current headcounts in the next 12 months. The number of HR leaders at firms that expect a headcount increase and those at firms that expect a headcount decrease was equal, at 29%.For leaders planning to reduce their workforce over the next year, the \"general need to cut costs\" was the only reason cited by survey respondents, rather than inflation, tariffs, decreased demand, or efficiency gains from AI.Three out of five (61%) of the leaders in the CNBC survey stated that AI has made their company more efficient, while 39% said it's too early to tell.And 78% said AI has made their workforce more innovative, while 17% said AI has not yet made a significant impact on their workforce.  New research shows that by reshaping work, AI could enhance innovation and increase efficiency, possibly leading to a shorter workweek. A new study from the London School of Economics finds that employees who use AI for work tasks save an average of 7.5 hours per week. Roughly 1 in 4 (or 26%) of the jobs posted on career site Indeed over the past year are poised to \"radically transform\" due to AI, according to a September report by Indeed.Learning how AI can augment human interactions is critical, senior HR leaders say.

(He considers Apple a consumer products company.)At the 2019 Berkshire meeting, Buffett and Charlie Munger lamented that they had \"screwed up\" by not buying Alphabet earlier because they \"could see in our own operations how well that Google advertising was working. And we just sat there sucking our thumbs.\"On that day, the shares were going for around $59, and they gave no indication there were prepared to rectify their error.Incoming CEO Greg Abel isn't encumbered by that history, and Buffett has been handing over many of his duties to him.Or it could be one or both of the portfolio managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs.Stay tuned.Not so surprising sellingAlphabet was by far the biggest Q3 addition at $4.3 billion, based on the September 30 price, well ahead of a $1.2 billion increase for Chubb.The biggest decreases, Apple and Bank of America, had been foreshadowed by hints in Berkshire's 10-Q almost two weeks ago.(The Verisign reduction was disclosed in early August.)Berkshire's Apple position was cut by almost 15%, or $10.6 billion, to around 238 million shares.It's down 74% since Berkshire began selling two years ago.But Apple remains Berkshire's largest equity position at $64.9 billion, which is 21% of the portfolio's current value.The Bank of America reduction was smaller, just 6.1%, or around $1.9 billion.The remaining 238 million shares are currently valued at $29.9 billion, Berkshire's third largest position, making up almost 10% of the portfolio's current value.It's been cut by 43% since early last year.A complete listing of Berkshire's Q3 13F appears below. 'Sort of'Many of the headlines on news stories about Warren Buffett's Thanksgiving letter on Monday included this quotation: \"I'm 'going quiet.'\"But there was another phrase that followed that line near the top of the letter, getting its own paragraph: \"Sort of.\"Warren Buffett speaks during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCStarting next year, Greg Abel, \"a great manager, a tireless worker and an honest communicator,\" will be writing the annual meeting to shareholders and answering questions at the annual meeting. Buffett plans to sit on the arena floor with the other directors.But he wrote, \"I will continue talking to you and my children about Berkshire via my annual Thanksgiving message.\"This year's letter ran a bit more than seven pages, compared to around three pages last year, and sounded a lot like the annual letters he's been writing for decades, with sections on the importance of luck, getting old, his admiration for Berkshire shareholders, the many friends he has made over the years in Omaha, and his complete confidence in Abel's ability to run the company.He also revealed that while hospitalized as a child, he received a fingerprint kit and proceeded to take prints from the nuns caring for him, because \"someday a nun would go bad, and the FBI would find that they had neglected to fingerprint nuns.\"(CNBC.com has this summary)The newsiest bit was his plan to \"step up the pace of lifetime gifts\" to the three foundations run by his children, who, like Buffett, are getting older. (They are 72,70, and 67.)He wants to \"improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.\"But he also \"wants to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed.\"The result, at least for this year, is an increase in the Class B shares (converted from Class A) going to each foundation to 400,000 shares from 300,000 shares last year.Including a fourth unchanged donation to a foundation named after his late wife, the total as of the date of the gifts increased 17% to $1.3 billion.Playing a more minor role: Class B shares are up 4% since last year's gifts.The entire U.S portfolio as of September 30BUFFETT AROUND THE INTERNETBERKSHIRE STOCK WATCHFour weeksTwelve monthsBERKSHIRE'S TOP U.S. HOLDINGS - Nov. 14, 2025Berkshire's top holdings of disclosed publicly traded stocks in the U.S., Japan, and Hong Kong, by market value, based on today's closing prices.Holdings are as of September 30, 2025 as reported in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing on November 14, 2025, except for:Itochu, which is as of March 17, 2025, and Mitsubishi, which is as of August 28, 2025.

    "description": "Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame ",
    "body": "Electricity prices are surging, voters are growing angry, and the artificial intelligence industry's data centers are increasingly a target for blame with U.S. mid-term elections on the horizon.Residential utility bills rose 6% on average nationwide in August compared with the same period in the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.The reasons for price increases are often complex and vary by region. But in at least three states with high concentrations of data centers, electric bills climbed much faster than the national average during that period. Prices, for example, surged by 13% in Virginia, 16% in Illinois and 12% in Ohio.The tech companies and AI labs are building data centers that consume a gigawatt or more of electricity in some cases, equivalent to more than 800,000 homes, the size of a city essentially.Virginia has the highest concentration of data centers in the world. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won the state's recent governor's race in a landslide by campaigning on cost of living. Spanberger put at least part of the blame for rising electricity prices on data centers, promising to make tech companies \"pay their own way and their fair share\" of the escalating costs.The governor's race could be a harbinger of political headwinds for the AI industry's data center buildout with the mid-term elections just a year away and Democrats zeroing in on affordability as their central issue. In Washington, some Democratic senators are targeting the close relationship that President Donald Trump has developed with the leaders of the major tech companies and AI labs.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's \"sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,\" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from \"being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.\"\"The techlash is real,\" said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.\"Data centers aren't always great neighbors,\" said Silverman, now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University. \"They tend to be loud, they can be dirty and there's a number of communities, particularly in places with really high concentrations of data centers, that just don't want more data centers.\"Virginia, Ohio and IllinoisLooking at the top fives states for data centers can help sort out some of the politics of data centers from what is actually happening to electricity prices.Virginia, Illinois and Ohio are among those states and are mostly served by the same grid operator, PJM Interconnection. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., serving more than 65 million people across 13 states including New Jersey where Silverman advised the state utility board.The PJM grid is facing a major imbalance between demand and supply. It holds auctions to secure electric capacity from power plants to ensure the grid remains reliable. The auction for 2024 to 2025 resulted in a bill of $2.2 billion. The bill then surged more than 500% to $14.7 billion for 2025 to 2026.An independent watchdog that monitors those PJM auctions found that data center demand, actual and forecast, made up $9.3 billion, or 63% of the total power capacity bill for 2025 to 2026. In the latest auction, prices jumped another 10% to $16.1 billion.\"Data center load growth is the primary reason for recent and expected capacity market conditions, including total forecast load growth, the tight supply and demand balance, and high prices,\" the firm Monitoring Analytics said in its June Independent Market Monitor report.Those capacity prices get passed down to consumers in their utility bills, Silverman said. The data center load in PJM is also impacting prices in states that are not industry leaders such as New Jersey, where prices jumped about 20% year over year. Democrat Mikie Sherrill won the governor's race in the Garden State in part on promising to freeze electric bill increases.\"It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now,\" Silverman said of data center impact on capacity prices.There are other reasons for rising electricity prices, Silverman said. The aging electric grid needs upgrades at a time of broad inflation and the cost of building new transmission lines has gone up by double digits, he said.The utilities also point to rising demand from the expansion of domestic manufacturing and the broader electrification of the economy, such as electric vehicles and the adoption of electric heat pumps in some regions.Although some Democrats are blaming the White House, the conditions that led to rising electricity prices in the PJM region began before the second Trump administration took office.PJM's process for bringing new electric supply online has \"crashed and burned,\" Silverman said. Tax subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act led to a surge of renewable energy projects waiting for grid connection. PJM is struggling to keep up with approvals, which can take five years in some cases, he said.PJM's watchdog said the grid may have seen tight power supplies without data centers, but the demand growth would have been slower and allowed more time for the market to address it.\"It is misleading to assert that the capacity market results are simply just a reflection of supply and demand,\" the watchdog said, describing the rapid load growth from data centers as \"unprecedented.\"Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half during his first year in office. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen in the coming years due to tight supply and demand.\"It's hard to see utility bills coming down in this decade,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.Texas and CaliforniaIn other states, however, the relationship between rising electricity prices and data centers is less clear. Texas, for example, is second only to Virginia with more than 400 data centers. But prices in the Lone Star state increased about 4% year over year in August, lower than the national average.Texas operates its own grid, ERCOT, with a relatively fast process that can connect new electric supply to the grid in around three years, according to a February 2024 report from the Brattle Group.California, meanwhile, has the third most data centers in the nation and the second highest residential electricity prices, nearly 80% above the national average. But prices in the Golden State increased about 1% in August 2024 over the prior year period, far below the average hike nationwide.One of the reasons California's electricity rates are so much higher than most of the country is the costs associated with preventing wildfires. PG&E, the largest utility in the state, said in March that it expects rates to remain stable this year as costs associated with wildfire prevention are taken out of customers' bills.",

    "body": "The New Jersey Devils celebrate after Simon Nemec #17 scores the game-winning-goal in double overtime of Game Three of the First Round of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the Carolina Hurricanes at Prudential Center on April 25, 2025 in Newark, New Jersey.Andrew Maclean | National Hockey League | Getty ImagesA version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.For the ultra-wealthy, sports teams have evolved from status symbols to mainstream investment assets, according to a new survey by J.P. Morgan Private Bank.The bank's 23 Wall division, which caters to the 0.01%, polled 111 billionaire principals of private family investment firms, representing more than $500 billion in combined wealth, between March and August. Twenty percent of family office principals reported owning controlling stakes in sports teams, up from 6% in 2022.Sports assets have also overtaken traditional trophy assets like art and cars, with 34% of principals investing in teams and arenas, compared with 23% for art and 10% for cars, the bank said.Andrew Cohen, executive chairman of J.P. Morgan's global private bank, told Inside Wealth that he expects this trajectory to continue. Sports team valuations continue to rise, buoyed by media rights deals and sponsorships, offering strong returns, he said. The bank values U.S. and European franchises at about $400 billion combined, estimating the total value of sports mergers and acquisitions and investment has increased eightfold over the past five years.Cohen added that sports team ownership scratches an entrepreneurial itch in a way that other hobbies cannot. Many principals take on board seats or are active in franchise operations, he said.\"Unlike art or cars, sports ownership offers principals a platform for active involvement,\" he said. \"This hands-on approach aligns with the broader trend of families seeking to be 'active architects' rather than passive investors.\"While the growth of the sports industry has drawn investors beyond passionate fans, Cohen said many principals reported motivations beyond financial returns. He cited the desire to bring a family together as a key driver for sports team owners. Female team owners were also likely to say that they backed women's sports to \"help level the playing field,\" according to the report.As valuations continue to soar, even ultra-high-net-worth individuals are getting priced out of bidding wars for controlling stakes, he said. However, there are ways investors can get a piece of the action at lower price points, according to Cohen, such as joining an ownership group or syndicate to acquire minority stakes, investing in arenas, and making \"sports adjacent\" investments in data analytics or merchandising.Heavy-hitter family offices frequently take multiple tacks when investing in sports. For instance, Blackstone's David Blitzer, who is the first person to own equity in all five major men's U.S. sports leagues, has backed at least six sports firms this year, including a padel club chain and a betting app, through his family office Bolt Ventures.",

    "body": "Kathy Ruemmler, former White House counsel, appears on \"Meet the Press\" in Washington, D.C., June 29, 2014.William B. Plowman | NBC Newswire | NBCUniversal | Getty ImagesGoldman Sachs on Thursday backed its top lawyer, Kathy Ruemmler, a day after a congressional committee released chummy emails she exchanged with notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before she joined the investment bank.Those emails feature Ruemmler, who served as White House counsel to former President Barack Obama, and Epstein exchanging thoughts about President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, and overweight highway rest stop patrons.\"See you at 2, I ordered sushi for you,\" Epstein wrote Ruemmler in March 2018 as part of an email thread that began with him sending her a Daily Beast article headlined, \"How close is Donald Trump to a psychiatric breakdown?\"Those emails came about 17 months before Epstein's arrest on federal child sex trafficking charges. He killed himself weeks after that arrest in a Manhattan jail.Ruemmler is Goldman's chief legal officer and general counsel.Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto, in a statement to CNBC, said, \"These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs.\"\"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day,\" Fratto said.Ruemmler did not respond to requests for comment about her emails with Epstein on Thursday.In 2023, Ruemmler told The Wall Street Journal, \"I regret ever knowing Jeffrey Epstein.\"Ruemmler, who served as Obama's White House general counsel and as a federal prosecutor, exchanged emails with Epstein while she was a partner with the law firm Latham & Watkins, where she was global chair of the white-collar defense and investigations practice.The Journal in 2023 reported that Ruemmler \"had dozens of meetings with Epstein in the years after her White House service and before she became a top lawyer at Goldman Sachs ... in 2020.\"\"He also planned for her to join a 2015 trip to Paris and a 2017 visit to Epstein's private island in the Caribbean,\" the Journal reported then. The newspaper, citing a Goldman Sachs spokesman, reported that Epstein introduced her to potential legal clients, including Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft.Goldman has previously said that Ruemmler had a professional relationship with Epstein connected to her role at Latham, but Latham also has said he was not a client of that firm.Her missives with Epstein, which the House oversight committee released Wednesday, were exchanged years after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 in a Florida state court to prostitution charges involving an underage girl.Epstein served 13 months in jail in that case and was required to register as a sex offender.\"Trump is living proof of the adage that it is better to be lucky than smart,\" Ruemmler wrote to Epstein on Aug. 26, 2015, according to the email thread that Epstein's estate provided to the House committee pursuant to a subpoena.Epstein, who previously had been a longtime friend of Trump's, replied, \"ill give you details when I see you. when are you in ny?\"Ruemmler replied by saying she was going to New York two days later and was considering driving there.\"I will stop to pee and get gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey turnpike, will observe all of the people there who are at least 100 pounds overweight, will have a mild panic attack as a result of the observation, and will then decide that I am not eating another bite of food for the rest of my life out of fear that I will end up like one of these people,\" Ruemmler wrote.Months later, in January 2016, Epstein emailed Ruemmler, saying, \"I stopped talking to [Bill] Clinton when he swore, with whole hearted conviction to me, that he had done something. , he had forgotten that he also swore the exact opposite to me only weeks before.\"On July 14, 2016, Epstein writes Ruemmler: \"pretty black dress. you and ruth ginsburg.\"Ruemmler replied less than 20 minutes later: \"I like that dress ... narciso Rodriguez. Where did you see that picture?

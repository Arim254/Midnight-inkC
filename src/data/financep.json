    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent speaks during a press conference to unveil the official Trump Accounts website, at the Treasury Department in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 17, 2025. Aaron Schwartz | ReutersTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday pressed the administration's desire for lower interest rates, saying they are the key to future economic growth.In a speech he will deliver before the Economic Club of Minnesota, Bessent backed President Donald Trump's economic agenda and said easier monetary policy will help pave the way for gains ahead.\"Cutting interest rates will have a tangible impact on the lives of every Minnesotan,\" he said, according to excerpts obtained from a source in the administration. \"It is the only ingredient missing for even stronger economic growth. Which is why the Fed should not delay.\"The Federal Reserve approved three consecutive interest rate cuts in the final four months of 2025, totaling 0.75 percentage point and taking the central bank's key interest rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.However, the pace of reductions is expected to slow considerably this year, with markets pricing in just two cuts and the most recent projections from Fed officials pointing to just one. One wild card in that equation is that the Fed will get a new chair this year, a process that Bessent is overseeing. Current Chair Jerome Powell's term ends in May, and the Treasury secretary has whittled down the candidates to five. National Economic Council leader Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are the two betting favorites to get the position.While lower interest rates carry the threat of reigniting inflation, they also could help support a slowing labor market.\"In 2025, the President laid the foundation for robust economic growth with: the historic passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, trade deals that rewrote decades of global misalignment; and an ambitious deregulation agenda that empowered American entrepreneurs and businesses,\" Bessent said. \"Now, in 2026, we will reap the rewards of President Trump's America First agenda.\"Bessent will deliver the speech at 12:45 p.m. ET.Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Kevin Hassett is leader of the National Economic Council.

Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesAnnounced layoffs fell sharply in December, hitting a 17-month low in a potential sign that the labor market is at least stabilizing, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.Planned job cuts totaled 35,553 for the month, a 50% slide from November and an 8% decrease from the same period a year ago. This was the lowest total since July 2024 in a year dominated by large layoffs and worries over the jobs picture.\"While December is typically slow, this coupled with higher hiring plans, is a positive sign after a year of high job cutting plans,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer for Challenger, Gray & Christmas.For the full year, employers announced more than 1.2 million cuts, up 58% from a year ago and the highest level since the pandemic year of 2020. Even with the tame December level, this was the worst fourth quarter since 2008.Companies also announced plans to hire 10,496 workers, up nearly 16% from November and 31% from a year ago.While Challenger's numbers have reflected a big pickup this year in layoffs, that hasn't showed up in government statistics.Weekly initial jobless claims have been stable through most of the year albeit with occasional spikes. The most recent reporting period showed claims at 208,000. The four-week moving average of claims is at its lowest since April 27, 2024, according to the Labor Department.However, hiring also has been weak, with monthly payroll growth averaging just 55,000. December payroll growth is expected to total 73,000, according to the Dow Jones consensus. That report will be released Friday.",

It's being brought by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky. Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

No provision in the Constitution provides such power to the presidency,\" Paul said in a statement.The Constitution vests Congress with the authority to declare war. Trump and his allies in Congress have argued he did not need to consult Congress on the strike that captured Maduro, which they say was a law enforcement operation. Maduro is now facing drug-related charges in New York. The Senate shot down a similar resolution in November, after only two Republicans — Paul and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska —  joined all Democrats in voting for it. Trump engaged in a monthslong military buildup around Venezuela before the action that captured Maduro.Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, meaning at least four would need to vote for the measure to pass it, even if all Democrats vote for it. The House would also need to approve the measure if it passes the Senate. Republicans have a razor-thin majority in the House.Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said on Thursday she would vote for the measure. \"While I support the operation to seize Nicolas Maduro, which was extraordinary in its precision and complexity, I do not support committing additional U.S. forces or entering into any long-term military involvement in Venezuela or Greenland without specific congressional authorization,\" she said in a statement.This story is developing.

    "body": "A Ford mustang is seen at a used car dealership in Montebello, California on May 5, 2025. Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Prices of used vehicles are expected to rise this year but at a historically stable rate, according to auto data and insights firm Cox Automotive.Cox on Thursday forecast that wholesale prices on its Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index will end this year 2% higher than December 2025. The index tracks prices of used vehicles sold at its U.S. wholesale auctions. This year's increase would compare with 0.4% increases during each of the past two years following declines of 7% and nearly 15% in 2023 and 2022, respectively, from inflated prices during the Covid-19 pandemic. Used vehicle prices during that time increased at historically high rates of 46.6% in 2021 and 14.2% in 2020.The overall stability in pricing is a win for potential car buyers. However, used vehicle prices are still higher than they were before the pandemic. Retail prices for consumers traditionally follow changes in wholesale prices, but they have not fallen as quickly as wholesale prices in recent years.The average index move at the end of each year is an increase of roughly 2%, according to Cox data going back to 1998. That excludes the outlier years of 2021 and 2022.Pricing will fluctuate month to month due to selling seasonality and other factors. A regular month-to-month move in the index during the year is only 0.2%, Cox said.\"As we move into 2026, a few positive indicators are emerging: New and used auto loan rates have fallen to the lowest level in a year, and consumers will soon see increased tax refunds hit their wallets,\" Jeremy Robb, Cox Automotive interim chief economist, said in a statement. \"As this plays out, we are expecting to see stronger demand in the auto market as the year gets underway.\"Used vehicle sales year over year are expected to fall by 0.9% to 38.3 million in 2026, according to Cox. That forecast includes 20.3 million used vehicle retail sales, a 0.7% decrease.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he \"will not permit\" defense companies to issue dividends or stock buybacks until those firms speed up their production of military equipment and address his other complaints about the industry.Trump, in a lengthy Truth Social post, also took aim at defense contractors' executive pay packages, calling them \"exorbitant and unjustifiable.\"\"Defense Companies are not producing our Great Military Equipment rapidly enough and, once produced, not maintaining it properly or quickly,\" he wrote.Until those companies build new production plants, \"no Executive should be allowed to make in excess of $5 Million Dollars,\" Trump declared.Shares of General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman each fell about 3% following Trump's comments.Trump later singled out Raytheon as \"the least responsive to the needs of the Department of War, the slowest in increasing their volume, and the most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military.\"He said that the Pentagon will cut its business ties with Raytheon unless it \"steps up\" on investment in plants and equipment, adding that \"under no circumstances\" can the company do any more stock buybacks in the meantime.Shares of RTX, the parent of Raytheon, slid an additional 2% in after-hours trading after closing down 2.5%.

One hundred. And a similar number injured,\" Cabello said. Two senior Venezuelan officials had previously told MS Now that more than 70 people were killed in the raid.Cabello also said both Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were injured during the operation.

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. housing market has yet to pick up steam into 2026, but real estate agents say there's been a real shift toward a more balanced market, according to the quarterly CNBC Housing Market Survey.Mortgage rates didn't move much at all in the last quarter of 2025, but home prices are steadily easing. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage dropped sharply in the third quarter but then stabilized between 6.2% and 6.4% during the fourth quarter, leaving some buyers on the sidelines with no incentive to jump in.Now, there are early signs of what could be more activity ahead. \"The buyers I have seen have been buying because of life circumstances, whether it's having a baby or moving for a job or retiring or downsizing,\" said Ashley Rummage, a real estate agent in Raleigh, North Carolina.Of the real estate agents surveyed by CNBC in the fourth quarter, 37.5% said it was a balanced market, rather than the buyer's market they reported seeing in the third quarter. That is up from 30% as of the third quarter and is likely because consumers became less confident in the economy as job losses grew. \"The people who had been moving and the momentum that we had were definitely slowed down, far, far less by interest rates than the intrinsic factors, the cost of living,\" said Heather Dell, a real estate agent in Detroit. \"Homeowners insurance, car insurance and utilities and medical insurance are the top objections that I hear when a buyer talks about buying.\" The CNBC Housing Market Survey is a national inquiry of real estate agents selected randomly across the United States. Responses for the fourth-quarter survey were collected between Dec. 10 and Dec. 17. This quarter, 72 agents shared their insights. While the majority of agents said it is still a buyer's market due to easing prices and more inventory for sale, some agents noted that their buyers and sellers still have very different expectations.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.\"Buyers tend to think that the market is like 2008 and sellers tend to think that the market is closer to 2021, 2022, and those are diametrically opposed markets and diametrically opposed mindsets,\" said John Fragola, a real estate agent in Charleston, South Carolina. Of course, 2008 was the start of the subprime mortgage crisis, which led to the Great Recession and housing crash, when the market was flooded with distressed homes, giving buyers all the power. Meanwhile, 2021 came shortly after the start of the Covid pandemic, when there was a buying frenzy and inventory dropped to record lows, giving sellers all the power.The balance in the market now is likely coming due to easing prices. More agents, 92%, reported having at least one seller cut their price in the fourth quarter, compared with  89% in the previous quarter, according to CNBC's survey. Nearly half of respondents said the majority of their sellers cut prices. \"Concessions have gotten bigger, especially in my market,\" Rummage said. \"At the beginning of the year, unfortunately, a lot of sellers were still stuck in the 2021 mindset, but as the year has gone by and their listings sat, they had to get more comfortable with understanding the fact that they were probably going to have to offer some concessions to get the transaction done.\"While prices are easing, they are still historically high, but buyers appear to be getting used to that as the new normal. When asked how affordability is impacting their buyers, agents said fewer buyers left the market in the fourth quarter than in the prior period, and fewer delayed purchases. They also compromised less on things like home size, features and location.Cutting prices, however, is not all that palatable to sellers, and more agents reported they had to delist properties than during the third quarter. \"I personally had some clients who said, 'Let's just pause, pump the brakes here and we'll come back on in the spring market when there's more buyers out,\"' said Fragola. As for the new year, despite the slow end to 2025, 67.8% of agents said they expected sales to improve in the first quarter. Fully 77% of agents said they expect the full year 2026 to be better than last year. There is more inventory on the market now, and some agents said they think consumers are getting used to current economic conditions.\"I think a lot of people are feeling a little bit more comfortable with the unknown,\" Rummage said. \"Sentiment has shifted from anxiety to cautious optimism.\" ",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks during the House Republican Party member retreat at the Kennedy Center in Washington, Jan. 6, 2026.Mandel Ngan | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's renewed focus on housing affordability has found a clear villain: institutional investors that own large swaths of single-family homes in fast-growing Sun Belt cities, where would-be homeowners increasingly find themselves bidding against Wall Street.Trump argued in a social media post Wednesday that corporate ownership has helped push housing further out of reach for everyday Americans, saying he's immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes. The message may be aimed at places like Atlanta and Jacksonville, metropolitan areas where investor ownership is far higher than the national average. While institutional investors only own roughly 2% of the nation's single-family rental housing stock, their presence is far more concentrated in parts of the Southeast. The U.S. Government Accountability Office estimates, for example, that investors control about a quarter of Atlanta's single-family rental market, more than a fifth of Jacksonville's and sizable shares in Charlotte and Tampa.Wall Street goes shopping in the Sun BeltThose concentrations trace back to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when large investors moved aggressively into housing markets flooded with foreclosures. By buying homes in bulk, they helped stabilize prices in hard-hit regions experiencing sharp declines, particularly across the Sun Belt, according to Wolfe Research. \"While their overall footprint is limited, ownership is heavily concentrated in Sun Belt cities, likely reflecting expectations of stronger home price appreciation,\" analysts at Wolfe said in a recent note to clients.The idea of curbing Wall Street's role in housing isn't new. Analysts at BTIG note that Congress has seen multiple efforts in recent years to rein in institutional homeownership, ranging from tighter regulations and financing limits to outright ownership bans and even forced liquidations. \"Bureaucratic limitations have historically hindered the legislation in Congress, and as it stands now most bills remain in the 'Introduced' phase,\" BTIG said in a note. Trump did not provide details on how such a ban would be implemented. The president said he plans to outline additional housing and affordability proposals in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in two weeks.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting.",

Rather, the experience is supposed to help users navigate everyday questions, and it aims to make ChatGPT's responses more relevant by grounding them in a user's own health information. \"ChatGPT Health is another step toward turning ChatGPT into a personal super-assistant that can support you with information and tools to achieve your goals across any part of your life,\" Fidji Simo, CEO of applications at OpenAI, wrote in a post on Substack.OpenAI said ChatGPT Health has its own dedicated space within the chatbot, so all of those files, conversations and connected apps are stored separately from other chats. Information and memories from ChatGPT Health will not flow outside of that space, and those conversations will not be used to train OpenAI's foundation models, the company said. The startup has partnered with b.well, which provides the health data connectivity infrastructure that will allow users to share their medical records with ChatGPT Health. Users will also be able to connect to Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Weight Watchers, the lab testing startup Function and other data. Services can be connected from tools or apps in settings.Read more CNBC tech newsThis climate startup is taking recycling to the next level, with shower water beerElon Musk's xAI raises $20 billion from investors including Nvidia, Cisco, FidelityMeta hires Microsoft exec, former Trump deputy as chief legal officerHuang says Nvidia seeing 'very high' Chinese customer demand for H200 AI chipsChatGPT Health was developed in \"close collaboration\" with physicians, OpenAI said. OpenAI has deepened its push into health care in recent months. After the company launched its GPT-5 model in August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told CNBC that health care was \"maybe the area where there's the strongest improvement of any category.\" In May, it released a benchmark called Health Bench that is designed to measure how well AI models perform in realistic health scenarios.The startup said Wednesday that \"hundreds of millions\" of people ask health and wellness questions each week.

Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesA Democrat-led push to extend recently expired Obamacare subsidies cleared a procedural hurdle in the House on Wednesday with support from nine Republicans, teeing up a final vote later this week.The House voted 221-205 in favor of a motion to discharge a bill that, if passed by the House and Senate, would extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plan holders for three years. Those tax credits were first implemented in 2021 under President Joe Biden as a pandemic-era relief measure and expired at the end of 2025, resulting in premium hikes for millions of Americans. Congressional Republicans, who have largely opposed extending the subsidies, find themselves in a difficult position ahead of the 2026 midterms, as Democrats seek to make health care and affordability central campaign issues.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

In his words 'running Venezuela.'\"The House is expected to vote on the underlying measure to extend the ACA enhanced tax credits on Thursday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., introduced the discharge petition in November after Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declined to bring a vote on extending the subsidies. A discharge petition is a procedural tool that allows rank-and-file members to circumvent leadership and force legislation to the floor with majority support.Over Johnson's objections, four moderate House Republicans signed the petition in December, lifting Jeffries' effort over the 218-signature threshold. The Republican defections were a blow to Johnson, whose authority was undermined last year by a series of successful discharge petitions, including one that compelled the release of files related to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Uncertainty in the SenateBut the outlook for the enhanced ACA tax credits across the Capitol remains murky and time is short. ACA open enrollment in most states ends Jan. 15, though some lawmakers, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said Congress could consider extending the election period if a solution does not materialize in time.The Senate in December rejected a similar measure that would have extended the subsidies for three years. A second attempt at a three-year extension is not expected to fare any better.Instead, a bipartisan Senate working group has been attempting to find a compromise on the issue. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, among those involved in the talks, said on Wednesday the House bill would fail in the Senate but serve as a vehicle for lawmakers to amend the proposal.Moreno said they were \"in the red zone,\" adding that the working group could not afford to drag out negotiations for several more weeks. House and Senate moderates are set to meet Thursday to discuss the enhanced ACA tax credits, Punchbowl News reported Tuesday.To get majority support in the Senate, any deal will need to take into account several issues that persist. Senate Majority Leader John Thune on Tuesday said that includes addressing $0 premiums, which were expanded in 2021 thanks to the enhanced ACA tax credits, and creating a \"bridge\" to greater Health Savings Accounts access, which Trump has made a priority.\"An expansion of HSAs so that you're getting more money into the pockets of the American people, the patients if you will, the consumers, as opposed to the insurance companies,\" Thune said.Perhaps the biggest sticking point is over the Hyde Amendment, a decades-old policy that prohibits the use of federal funds for most abortions that pro-life groups and some Republicans want to strengthen.At a House GOP retreat on Tuesday, Trump instructed congressional Republicans to be \"flexible\" on the Hyde Amendment, spurring anger from pro-life groups and push back from staunchly anti-abortion Republicans. \"We don't do federal funding for abortions,\" Moreno said. \"That's a long-standing tradition, nobody's looking to change that.\"-- CNBC's Karen Sloane contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Chinese officials are reviewing Meta's $2 billion acquisition of AI startup Manus for possible technology control violations, FT reported on Tuesday.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesChina said Thursday it will investigate Meta's $2 billion acquisition of artificial intelligence startup Manus to assess its compliance with export control laws.Meta acquired Singapore-based Manus last month as the U.S. tech giant looks to integrate advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, but the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition.China's Ministry of Commerce said it will conduct an assessment and investigation into how the acquisition complies with laws and regulations concerning export controls, technology import and export, and overseas investment, according to a statement translated by Google.\"The Chinese government consistently supports enterprises in conducting mutually beneficial transnational operations and international technological cooperation in accordance with laws and regulations,\" Ministry of Commerce spokesperson He Yadong said at a press briefing.CNBC has contacted Meta and Manus for comment.watch nowManus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity, which relocated to Singapore earlier this year. The startup was hailed as the next DeepSeek after it launched its first AI agent in March, which can help with tasks such as market research, coding and data analysis. The company reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July as it eyed global expansion. Manus said the Meta acquisition would see the company continue to operate from Singapore. The startup said it had 105 employees across the South Asian nation, Tokyo, and San Francisco in December.Manus said it had passed $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in December, eight months on from launching a product, which it claimed made it the fastest startup in the world to hit the milestone from $0.\"Manus's exceptional talent will join Meta's team to deliver general-purpose agents across our consumer and business products, including in Meta AI,\" Meta said in a statement in December. The acquisition follows the company raising $75 million in a round led by U.S. VC Benchmark in April. China's probe \"underlines that [the country] considers advanced AI agents, models and related IP to be strategic assets,\" Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\"The most likely outcome I see is a lengthier approval process and potential conditions around how Manus technology developed in China can be used, rather than an outright block, but the threat of stricter action gives Beijing bargaining power in a high profile, US led acquisition,\" he added.Meta's AI expansionMeta's Manus acquisition comes as the company has spent billions of dollars building out AI capabilities in the face of advances from rivals OpenAI and Google. In June, the company invested $14.3 billion in a 49% stake in AI startup Scale AI, which brought founder and CEO Alexandr Wang onto the tech giant's leadership team. Meta also announced it was acquiring AI wearable startup Limitless in December.Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg has been deprioritizing the company's Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) unit in favor of its more product-oriented GenAI team to help Meta make headway in AI and improve its Llama family of AI models, CNBC previously reported.",

Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would turn over 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the U.S. after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro. The oil will be sold at market prices, Trump said. The sales, if executed, would total more than $2 billion at oil's Wednesday closing price.  Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Wednesday that the U.S. will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely. \"We're going to market the crude coming out of Venezuela — first this backed up stored oil and then indefinitely, going forward, we will sell the production that comes out of Venezuela into the marketplace,\" Wright said at Goldman Sachs' annual energy conference in Miami.\"We need to have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\" the energy secretary said.

    "body": "Founder and CEO of CrowdStrike George Kurtz speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesCrowdStrike announced Thursday that it is buying identity management startup SGNL in a deal valued at nearly $740 million as the cybersecurity provider beefs up defenses in the age of artificial intelligence cyberattacks.The acquisition will help users of CrowdStrike's Falcon cloud security platform better manage human and AI identity access requests and real-time risks, the company said. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.\"This is a massive opportunity for our customers to be able to protect themselves, and a massive opportunity for us to disrupt the identity market,\" CEO George Kurtz said in an exclusive interview with CNBC. He said the deal will help advance CrowdStrike's foothold in the multibillion-dollar identity security business, which totaled $435 million at the end of the second quarter and has become one of the most significant attack vectors. Companies have been bolstering identity security defenses as AI heightens the sophistication of cyberattacks. Last year, Microsoft was hit with a wave of attacks targeting its SharePoint collaboration tool and large language model startup Anthropic disclosed the first documented AI-led cyberattack in November.

The company's backers include Cisco Investments and Microsoft's Venture Fund. The company was founded in 2021 by Scott Kriz and Erik Gustavson, whose previous startup was acquired by Google in 2017. Both founders worked at the search giant for more than four years.Cybersecurity providers such as CrowdStrike have ramped up acquisitions in recent months to offer a fuller suite of capabilities to customers in an increasingly competitive market. Businesses are also leaning into more autonomous agent-powered AI solutions to manage cybersecurity tools. Last year, competitor Palo Alto Networks scooped up Israeli startup CyberArk for $25 billion in a big bet from CEO Nikesh Arora and Google landed cloud security startup Wiz for $32 billion.In 2025, CrowdStrike announced plans to buy AI agentic security platform Pangea and Spanish data startup Onum. Kurtz said the company's acquisition strategy is to buy successful teams and innovative technology over legacy tools. \"We want to offer the most value to our customers where they can consolidate on CrowdStrike — less vendors, less complexities, less cost, and with a better outcome of stopping breaches,\" he said. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer said Tuesday that investors should grow more selective after the market's recent run, warning that buying stocks near their highs is often \"a license to lose money.\"On a volatile session that saw sharp moves across major indexes, Cramer said investors should resist chasing stocks already up 30% or 40% for the year and instead wait patiently for better entry points.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 466 points to close the session, or 0.94%.Cramer cautioned against late-cycle enthusiasm in oil stocks, arguing that investors who bought producers near recent highs could be vulnerable if Venezuela ramps production and pressures crude prices.He also flagged near-term risks in banks ahead of earnings season, even while calling the group chronically undervalued.Cramer said JPMorgan Chase looks cheap at roughly 16 times earnings, but warned that CEO Jamie Dimon tends to emphasize risks when conditions are strong — commentary that can temporarily weigh on the stock.Cramer also pointed to CrowdStrike falling nearly 100 points from its November highs before rebounding. He added that geopolitical instability, including Venezuela's political upheaval, historically increases hacking activity, strengthening demand for CrowdStrike's services.In the same vain, Cramer praised Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who recently described CrowdStrike as a core cybersecurity provider underpinning the $10 trillion AI-driven enterprise transformation. He also reiterated confidence in Microsoft, which has pulled back sharply since reporting earnings due to heavy AI spending, as well as longtime favorites Nvidia and Broadcom.\"By all means, own some unloved tech names, but save room for a quality consumer [stock],\" Cramer said. watch now",

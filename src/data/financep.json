    "body": "Headquarters of Samsung in Mountain View, California, on October 28, 2018. Smith Collection/gado | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesSamsung Electronics reported an over threefold surge in fourth-quarter profits on Thursday, hitting a new record and beating analysts' estimates, as a memory chip shortage and strong demand for artificial intelligence servers lifted earnings.Shares of Samsung Electronics rose 2.58% at the open on Thursday before reversing course, falling 1.54% in morning trade.Here are Samsung's fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 93.8 trillion Korean won ($65.58 billion) vs. 93.318 trillion won expectedOperating profit: 20.1 trillion won vs. 20.018 trillion won expectedThe South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose about 24% from a year earlier to hit a new record. Meanwhile, its operating profit climbed over 200% year over year. The profits surpassed Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018, while matching Samsung's own guidance of around 20 trillion won. Samsung, South Korea's largest company by market capitalization, is a leading provider of memory chips, semiconductor foundry services and smartphones.The company said in its earnings report that its memory business had helped drive earnings, setting all-time highs for quarterly revenue and operating profit, driven by an overall market price surge, sales of high-bandwidth memory and other high-value-added products. High-bandwidth memory, or HBM, is a type of memory used in chipsets for AI data centers, and Samsung has shifted more focus to the technology over the past year, under its Device Solutions (DS) Division.Makers of AI chipsets, such as Nvidia, have been clamoring for limited supplies of HBM, with demand outpacing supply.As memory companies prioritize capacity to meet that lucrative demand, it has contributed to a shortage across the broader market, pushing up prices of chips used in personal computers and mobile devices.This has been a boon for memory giants like Samsung as well as its rival SK Hynix, which reported record earnings on Wednesday.\"Looking ahead to Q1 2026, the DS Division expects AI and server demand to continue increasing, leading to more opportunities for structural growth,\" the company said.\"In response, the Division will continue to focus on profitability via a strong emphasis on high-performance products,\" it added.Smartphones Samsung's mobile experience and networks businesses, tasked with developing and selling smartphones, tablets, wearables and other devices, posted weaker results in the fourth quarter. Operating profit at the division fell to 1.9 trillion won, down 9.5% from a year earlier and over 45% from the previous quarter. The company said the losses were due to \"reduced launch effects\" from new smartphone models and intense market competition.Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2026, Samsung said it plans to strengthen its AI smartphone push by introducing what it calls \"Agentic AI experiences\" with the launch of its upcoming Galaxy S26 series. Samsung said it also aims to ensure sustained profitability through flagship sales expansion, resource optimization and efforts to strengthen supply stability amid global competitive pressures.",

About 150 of the employees were based at Home Depot's headquarters in Atlanta and the rest were in remote jobs, with most in the technology organization of the company and some on other corporate teams, she said.In the employee memo, Decker said the five-day in-office policy will begin the week of April 6. He said the changes are \"essential to simplify our business and focus our energy on the priorities ahead.\"\"In-person engagement enables more meaningful support for store and field associates, drives results and reinforces our people-centric culture and inverted pyramid,\" he said.Home Depot's sales have been weaker than expected, as the retail giant waits for housing turnover and significant home improvement spending to pick up again after a boom in demand during the Covid pandemic. Company leaders have attributed slower demand to higher mortgage rates, economic uncertainty and consumers' hesitance to spring for pricier projects.The retailer missed Wall Street's earnings expectations for the third straight quarter when it posted results in November. It said that it expects full-year fiscal 2025 sales to rise about 3% and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to be slightly positive.Shares of Home Depot have fallen about 10% over the past year, trailing the S&P 500's 15% gains over the same period. So far this year, Home Depot's stock is up about 9%, however, ahead of the S&P 500's nearly 2% gains.Home Depot will report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 24.",

    "body": "A SK Hynix flag (R) and a South Korean national flag (L) flutter outside the company's Bundang office in Seongnam on Jan. 26, 2024. Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSK Hynix beat rival Samsung Electronics in operating profit for the first time in 2025, as it retained its lead in high-bandwidth memory used in artificial intelligence chips. The two South Korean memory makers went head-to-head this week, with SK Hynix reporting earnings on Wednesday and Samsung on Thursday morning local time.SK Hynix posted a record operating profit of 47.2 trillion won for the full year, surpassing Samsung's 43.6 trillion won. The comparison underscores SK Hynix's ascension in South Korea's tech space since it was acquired by SK Telecom for about $3 billion in 2012. SK Hynix focuses almost entirely on memory chips, while Samsung operates across multiple businesses, including consumer electronics and contract chip manufacturing. Samsung's memory segment generated operating profits of about 24.9 trillion won in 2025.SK Hynix's success is in large part thanks to its entrenched position as the global leader in high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, a specialized chip used in AI processors and servers such as those produced by Nvidia. \"SK Hynix is clearly an outstanding 'AI Winner' in Asia,\" said MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, adding that its lead in quality and supply of HBMs and other chips used in AI servers has been crucial in the current phase of the AI infrastructure boom.  SK Hynix has maintained its market lead in both areas, even as Samsung regained the top spot in memory revenue rankings in the fourth quarter of 2025, said Hwang.However, competition is ramping up.  While SK Hynix managed to gain an early lead in HBM and secured the lion's share of Nvidia memory contracts last year, competitors like Samsung and Micron have been making some breakthroughs. Samsung has expanded its HBM sales and said it remains on track to begin delivering HBM4 products — the latest, sixth-generation HBM technology — this year.\"[W]e expect Samsung to show a significant turnaround with HBM4 for Nvidia's new products, moving past last year's quality issues,\" said Ray Wang, an analyst at SemiAnalysis focused on memory and the AI supply chain.  Still, analysts expect SK Hynix to retain high market share in HBM4 and maintain its dominant position.\"⁠⁠The HBM4 race is really between SK Hynix and Samsung as we think [the] two companies are more competitive than Micron,\" said Wang.  \"We expect SK Hynix to maintain its lead in HBM4, while Samsung to make material progress and become more competitive in HBM4 than [previous generations],\" he added.",

    "body": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Downing Street on January 27, 2026 in London, England. Jack Taylor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nearly 60 British businesses and cultural organizations will join U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his trip to China this week, the first such state visit in eight years.Starmer is due to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on Thursday to discuss trade, investment and national security, according to an official U.K. readout that listed the business representatives accompanying the British leader.The group includes financial industry leaders such as HSBC Group Chairman Brendan Nelson and Aberdeen Group CEO Jason Windsor.Aircraft giant Airbus's general counsel John Harrison will also join, along with British Airways Chief Commercial Officer Colm Lacy.Pharmaceutical executives accompanying Starmer include AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot and GSK Chair Sir Jonathan Symonds.The visit comes as Beijing hosts a series of foreign leaders this month amid escalating U.S. tensions with its trading partners and disputes involving Greenland. Earlier this month, Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing. On the first Monday of 2026, Xi met Ireland's Prime Minister Michael Martin — the first visit by an Irish leader in 14 years — and hosted South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung later in the day. Xi also met Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo Tuesday. The timing of Starmer's trip has drawn attention. Last week, the British government approved plans to open a new sprawling Chinese Embassy in London after the proposal had stalled for years over political and security concerns. London has sought to bolster new trade and investment ties with Beijing as U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy and tariff threats have unsettled traditional allies, including the European Union and Canada.Trump previously floated a 10% tariff on European countries that opposed his bid to acquire Greenland before backing down. He also threatened to impose 100% tariffs on Canada if Ottawa pursued a free trade deal with China.Starmer will \"push for access in areas where better co-operation with China would boost growth and deliver prosperity for the British people,\" including financial services, creative industries and life sciences, the British government said in the statement.But \"he will be clear that we will not trade economic co-operation for our national security. He will raise the areas where we disagree with China,\" it said, stressing the need for \"frank and open dialogue.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on interest rate policy, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 28, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe Federal Reserve wrapped up a two-day policy meeting Wednesday, delivering pretty much what the market expected and no major surprises from Chair Jerome Powell's news conference. Here are five things worth remembering:The decision: To no one's surprise, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee held its benchmark funds rate in a range between 3.5%-3.75%. The move broke a string of three straight cuts and could be a harbinger of a central bank not of a mind to ease again anytime soon.The dissents: As has been the custom for the past six months or so, multiple committee members broke ranks. This time, Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller wanted another quarter percentage point cut. For Miran, though, it represented a bit of a turn as he deviated from three prior dissents in favor of half-point reductions.Powell's post-meeting news conference was, in a word, a snoozer. On five separate occasions, the chair delivered variations on \"I have nothing for you on that\" to questions from reporters looking to bait him into commenting on the multiple political kerfuffles surrounding the Fed. Asked for the advice he would give his successor, Powell responded,  \"Stay out of elected politics.\"From an economic standpoint, the FOMC statement and Powell's commentary reflected expectations for solid growth, a near-term tariff-fueled boost for inflation that ultimately will recede, and a labor market in stasis as the labor force participation rate plus less immigration keep hiring in check while layoffs are also muted.And the markets yawned. With little to go on, the major stock averages closed little changed. Traders are still pricing in about a 60% chance of two additional, quarter percentage point rate cuts this year. What they're saying\"The Fed delivered a rate cut, but it arrived in a somewhat hawkish package. The Fed hasn't shut the door on further cuts, but Chair Powell has raised the bar for further action. We expect the economy to grow at a solid pace next year, but it must be accompanied by job gains. The next round of jobs data may point to the exact opposite.\" — Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.\"It's détente at the Fed for now. But a shakeup is coming with the new Fed Chair in May.\" — Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.\"Perspectively speaking, we saw this meeting as an affirmation from the Fed of what investors were already thinking. Labor conditions are not worsening, growth has accelerated and inflation has steadied for now. To put it in other words, policy rates are much closer to neutral against the current backdrop and it's time for a long pause.\" — Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist for Allianz Investment Management.watch now",

Carlos Barria | ReutersMeta's efforts to create the digital worlds known as the metaverse continue to be costly.The company reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, saying its Reality Labs unit recorded an operating loss of $6.02 billion on $955 million in sales. Analysts were expecting Reality Labs to record an operating loss of $5.67 billion on $940.8 million in fourth-quarter revenue.Reality Labs' losses rose 21% year over year for the quarter, while sales grew 13% during the same period. The segment now has nearly $80 billion in total operating losses since late 2020.\"I expect Reality Labs losses this year to be similar to last year, and this will likely be the peak as we start to gradually reduce our losses going forward while continuing to execute on our vision,\" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during an earnings call.Meta laid off more than 1,000 Reality Labs employees earlier in January in an effort to shift resources from virtual reality to artificial intelligence and wearable devices. That includes the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses developed in partnership with eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. Meta shuttered several VR efforts including internal studios, leading to fears of a VR winter, CNBC reported.Tech chief Andrew Bosworth told media outlets last week that Meta is not killing its VR efforts, but he acknowledged the market was growing slower than executives hoped.Last fall, Meta did not debut a new Quest VR headset, but introduced the AI-powered Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses that cost $799 and come equipped with a digital screen on one of the lenses.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stake.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump has \"brought down the temperature\" on Minnesota, the site of major civil unrest over aggressive federal immigration efforts, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday.Trump is \"urging\" Congress to take action to avoid triggering a partial government shutdown amid disputes over federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security, Bessent told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"The shutdown could begin at 12:01 a.m. ET on Saturday unless lawmakers come to a resolution on the DHS funding, which a slew of Democrats have rejected in light of the recent killing of nurse Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis.Trump is \"in constant contact\" with lawmakers \"and he is urging them not to shut down the government,\" Bessent told CNBC.Bessent spoke as the Trump administration tempers its tone after its harsh initial response to two immigration enforcement-related killings in Minneapolis that stirred waves of outrage from Democrats and even some Republicans.The Cabinet secretary declined to make a prediction about whether a shutdown — the second in less than four months — will be averted.\"I don't know what to expect. The Democrats can become unhinged like they were last time, and they don't care. Like, they think this is a way to stop President Trump,\" he said.He also warned that another shutdown could cause further economic harm. \"Especially on the service side, when the government shut down, that never comes back. So, there's a big permanent loss,\" Bessent said.The House of Representatives last week passed a more-than-$1.2 trillion spending package that includes funding for DHS, the agency in charge of federal immigration enforcement.The package, which accounts for the bulk of government spending for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, requires Democratic support to clear the Senate's 60-vote filibuster threshold. And if the Senate changes what the House already passed, the House would have to return from a prescheduled recess to vote on any amended measure, with little time to spare before a shutdown.Democratic opposition to the spending package rapidly grew after Pretti's killing on Saturday morning. Senate Democrats now say they will vote against the package unless the DHS portion is stripped out, something Republicans have signaled they will not do.Pretti was killed just weeks after another U.S. citizen, Renee Nicole Good, was fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis.In both cases, the Trump administration initially came out in full-throated defense of its officers' actions while accusing the slain citizens of domestic terrorism. After widespread blowback — and after new polls showed Trump's immigration approval rating plummeting — the administration has dialed back its tone.Trump said Tuesday, \"we're going to de-escalate a bit\" in Minnesota.But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has suggested that that pivot is not enough for Democrats to drop the shutdown threat.\"The fix should come from Congress; the public can't trust the administration to do the right thing on its own,\" Schumer said Tuesday on the Senate floor.\"In the meantime, I will vote no on any legislation that funds [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] until it is reined in and overhauled, and Senate Democrats are overwhelmingly united on this issue,\" Schumer said.This is breaking news.

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is followed by reporters as he walks to the Senate Chambers in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Jan. 27, 2026.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesRepublican senators appear to be opening the door to preventing a partial government shutdown as the chamber prepares to start voting on a House-passed package to fully fund a group of federal agencies through the remaining fiscal year. The Senate is set to start voting on the funding bills Thursday morning. If the chamber doesn't pass all of them, much of the federal government would shut down Saturday at 12:01 ET.The bills would fund the Department of Homeland Security and several other agencies, including the Treasury and Defense departments. While the package once looked certain to clear the Senate and avoid a shutdown, the killing of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti by federal immigration agents Saturday in Minneapolis derailed it. Democrats are demanding that the DHS portion of the bill be stripped from the package and weighed separately to make changes to how the agency operates, a move that Republicans have so far resisted. On Wednesday, some Senate Republicans began to embrace the idea of splitting off DHS, as a shutdown looms just months after a record 43-day closure last year. The measure will require 60 votes to clear the Senate filibuster. Republicans hold only 53 seats in the upper chamber, meaning Democrats can block it if they withhold their votes.\"Rather than scuttling the whole package, I say let's go and pass what we can,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said in an interview with reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday. \"I think all the bills will pass except Homeland Security, and then we can sit down and talk about Homeland Security,\" said Kennedy, who sits on the Senate Appropriations Committee. Asked how many of his Republican colleagues support such a move, Kennedy said: \"A bunch.\"Indeed, numerous Republicans said Wednesday that while they would like to see the entire package pass the Senate, splitting off DHS is a palatable off-ramp. \"We are going to see what happens when that vote comes up,\" said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., another member of the appropriations committee. \"[But] if the Democrats block it, [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer has already said that he's willing to move the five, and so I certainly have an open mind on that.\"Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC that if Democrats are \"okay with five of the six bills,\" then \"we ought to figure out a way to get those done.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said in a press conference Wednesday that such proposals are so far \"hypotheticals\" and that he would \"reserve optionality.\" \"I think the best path forward, as I've said, is to keep the package intact,\" Thune said. \"If there are things that the Democrats want that the administration can agree with them about, then let's do that.\"Democrats are warning that a separate negotiation with the administration would not be enough to assuage their concerns. President Donald Trump has attempted a turnabout in recent days after the fallout from the shooting of Pretti in Minnesota, recently saying he will deescalate his immigration crackdown in the state. \"This has to be in the bill,\" said Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with Democrats. \"I don't think we could settle for promises.\" King repeatedly voted to reopen the government during the last shutdown, bucking his caucus. \"I can't in good conscience vote for a DHS budget under these circumstances,\" King said, calling for the DHS component to be separated so the rest of the bills can pass. DHS is conducting immigration operations in Maine. Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, arrives for a vote in the Capitol on Thursday, September 28, 2023.Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesSchumer, D-N.Y., listed Democrats' demands in a press conference Wednesday. He said Democrats want a DHS funding package to include new guardrails for federal immigration enforcement. Those guardrails include a requirement for warrants for arrests, a ban on federal agents wearing masks, mandatory body cameras and a uniform code of conduct for federal agents. \"Democrats stand ready today to pass the five bipartisan bills in the Senate, but the DHS bill needs serious work,\" Schumer said. \"It's now on Leader Thune to separate out the DHS bill ... and start working with Democrats to rein in ICE.\"Republicans appear to be plowing ahead with plans to vote on all six bills. \"We're voting on this tomorrow,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. \"Anything can change in 24 hours, but our plan is to vote on six bills.\" Should that vote fail and Senate Republicans decide to split off the DHS portion, it would likely require a unanimous consent request on the Senate floor to alter the bill, given the short timeline. Any one senator could object to such a move, drawing out the timeline and further risking a shutdown. \"I've got concerns with that, but I'd have to examine it,\" said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, when asked by CNBC if he would object to stripping out the DHS bill from the package. Republicans also note that a shutdown at DHS would also mean that the Federal Emergency Management Agency would go unfunded during a winter cold snap that has brought bitter temperatures, ice and snow to a large part of the country. King suggested that a short-term continuing resolution could keep FEMA and other agencies afloat. Any changes the Senate makes to the package would also require reapproval by the House. The House is out of Washington on recess, with plans to return next week — after the shutdown deadline. \"If the bill changes much from what the House already passed, then you've got another steep hill to climb over there,\" Thune said. DHS would largely also be able to keep operating its immigration enforcement apparatus even if it enters into a shutdown. Republicans gave the agency hundreds of billions of dollars in supplemental appropriations as part of the tax and spending package passed last year.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct day of the shutdown",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Meta Platforms Inc., during the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, US, on Wednesday, Sept. 17, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg plans to ramp up his company's spending on artificial intelligence in 2026. Wall Street seems fine with that strategy. In its fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday, Meta beat on the top and bottom lines while also revealing that its AI-related capital expenditures this year will be between $115 billion and $135 billion. That's nearly twice the amount Meta spent on capex last year, when the company revamped its AI unit.Although investors have previously expressed concern about Meta's AI spending spree, they took comfort in the company's latest results, which showed 24% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by online ads. Meta shares, which trailed the market last year, popped as much as 10% in after-hours trading.\"As we plan for the future, we will continue to invest very significantly in infrastructure to train leading models and deliver personal super intelligence to billions of people and businesses around the world,\" Zuckerberg told analysts during the earnings call. Zuckerberg was referring to Meta's ambitious data center buildouts intended to anchor both current and future AI projects.Meta finance chief Susan Li told analysts that the company continues to be \"capacity constrained,\" meaning it needs more computing power to further improve its core ad business while also providing its AI team the necessary resources to create more advanced models and products.\"Our teams have done a great job ramping up our infrastructure through the course of 2025, but demands for compute resources across the company have increased even faster than our supply,\" Li said.Zuckerberg said 2026 will be a major year for AI, with Meta's investments geared towards supporting his mission for \"building personal super intelligence.\"Whether Meta will have much by way of new AI products that can generate revenue remains a major question, and one Zuckerberg hasn't clearly answered. \"I mean, we're going to roll out new products over the course of the year,\" Zuckerberg said on the call. \"I think the important thing is, we're not just launching one thing, and we're building a lot of things.\"Perhaps Zuckerberg's biggest swing last year was the $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, which brought founder and CEO Alexandr Wang and some of his top engineers and researchers to Meta. Wang is now leading Meta's TBD AI unit, which has been testing a new frontier model code-named Avocado that's intended to be a successor to the company's Llama family of models, CNBC reported.\"I expect our first models will be good but, more importantly, will show the rapid trajectory that we're on,\" Zuckerberg said Wednesday. \"And then I expect us to steadily push the frontier over the course of the year as we continue to release new models.\"Asked on the call why Meta needs to develop its own powerhouse AI foundation model, Zuckerberg said  it's important because Meta is a \"deep technology company.\"Meta can't risk being \"constrained to what others in the ecosystem are building or allow us to build,\" he said, adding that controlling a model allows you to help \"shape the future of these products.\"In the meantime, online advertising still accounts for the overwhelming majority of Meta's revenue. As long as that business continues to dominate in mobile, exceed expectations and throw off billions of dollars of cash a quarter, Zuckerberg is likely to get plenty of leeway to pursue his AI ambitions.WATCH: Meta and Google go to trial over child safety — here's what's at stake.watch now",

The board also approved additional $5 billion for share buybacks. ServiceNow is forecasting subscription revenues between $3.65 billion and $3.66 billion in the first quarter and $15.53 billion and $15.57 billion for the 2026 fiscal year.

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, on Dec. 10, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday explained his controversial decision to attend Fed Governor Lisa Cook's Supreme Court hearing, saying the case could have a major effect on the central bank's independence.\"That case is perhaps the most important legal case in the Fed's 113-year history,\" Powell said Wednesday during his post-Fed meeting press conference. \"As I thought about it, I thought it might be hard to explain why I didn't attend.\"Powell last week attended oral arguments n the case, which will determine if President Donald Trump can fire Cook, who had been accused of mortgage fraud, a claim she denies. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called Powell's decision to attend a \"mistake\" in an interview with CNBC last week, saying the Fed chair was politicizing the case.Powell also noted that former Fed Chair Paul Volcker \"famously\" went to a Supreme Court case in the 1980s, but did not specific which. That showed Powell there was precedent for his attendance, he said.The Federal Reserve was created in 1913 under President Woodrow Wilson.During the hearing, Supreme Court justices appeared skeptical of Trump's claims that he was within his powers to attempt to remove Cook and raised concern about what such a precedent would mean for Fed independence.Trump has cited mortgage fraud allegations in his move to axe Cook, but critics have said the action appears tied to his push for lower interest rates. The Supreme Court previously allowed Cook to remain in her role pending the oral arguments.Powell's attendance followed his revelation earlier this month that he's facing a federal probe over the Fed's headquarters renovations. Politicians and monetary policy watchers have connected the investigation to Trump's repeated criticism of Powell for not moving interest rates lower at a faster pace.watch nowThe criminal investigation of Powell and attempted removal of Cook have together raised concerns that the Fed's longstanding apolitical posture is at risk. Powell said the Fed's political separation is key to ensuring credibility long term during Wednesday's press conference.\"The point of independence is not to protect policymakers or anything like that,\" Powell said. \"It just is that every advanced economy (and) democracy in the world has come around to this common practice.\"If you lose that separation, he said, \"it would be hard to restore the credibility of the institution.\"Looming over Wednesday's press conference was the knowledge that Trump could at any time announce a successor for Powell, who's term as chair ends in May. Powell offered some advice timely advice for whoever takes the role next.\"Don't get pulled into elected politics,\" Powell said. \"Don't do it. \"",

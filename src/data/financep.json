    "body": "Michael Saylor, chairman of MicroStrategy, speaks at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on July 26, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStrategy plunged roughly 7% on Monday after bitcoin dipped below the cryptocurrency treasury company's average purchase price per token.  Bitcoin traded at about $74,500 at its bottom on Monday – its lowest price since last April.That's slightly below Strategy's average purchase price of $76,052 per bitcoin, according to its regulatory filing dated Feb. 2, raising concerns that the Michael Saylor-led firm could be underwater if the digital currency continues to slide. The company holds roughly $56 billion in bitcoin, its website shows. The pullback in shares comes as bitcoin has shed 11% over the past five days, largely due to mounting geopolitical concerns and expectations of a monetary policy shift in the U.S. Last week, investors rotated out of risk-on assets across global markets, including cryptocurrencies, as tensions flared between President Donald Trump and European leaders over the U.S.' Greenland gambit. On Friday, President Trump endorsed Kevin Warsh as his pick for Federal Reserve chair, leading investors to assume even more cautious positions. A series of forced liquidations also amplified bitcoin's plunge. More than $2 billion of long and short positions linked to the asset have been liquidated since Thursday, Coinglass data shows.",

David Ake | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will not be releasing the January jobs report as scheduled Friday due to the partial government shutdown, a department spokesman confirmed Monday.\"The Employment Situation release for January 2026 will not be released as scheduled on Friday, February 6, 2026. The release will be rescheduled upon the resumption of government funding,\" Emily Liddel, associate commissioner of the BLS, said in a statement.Following last year's record shutdown that stretched into early November, the bureau also was forced to delay a number of its routine releases and was just catching up from that incident. The BLS also releases the consumer price index, import and export data, and multiple other labor- and consumer-related data pieces.It was not known if the Commerce Department also would face delays in its reporting due to the impasse in Washington.The decision comes ahead of a busy week for economic data that would have culminated with the nonfarm payrolls release, also known as the unemployment situation. The report includes a count of how many hires businesses report, which provides the headline nonfarm payrolls count, as well as a household survey of how many people report holding jobs, which is used to tabulate the unemployment rate.Markets had been expecting the report to show an increase of 55,000 jobs and the unemployment rate to hold steady at 4.4%.In addition to the payrolls count, the BLS also was scheduled on Tuesday to release the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.The government closed its doors again Saturday after Congress was unable to come up with a spending plan by the deadline. One of the sticking points in the bill was funding for the Department of Homeland Security following unrest over its efforts to stem illegal immigration.House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said over the weekend that he expects the impasse could be resolved by Tuesday.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks on the day he announced the creation of a critical mineral reserve, in the Oval Office at the White House, Feb. 2, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell should continue, shrugging off a Republican senator's vow to block Trump's Fed chair replacement pick unless the probe is dropped.U.S. Attorney for Washington Jeanine Pirro, who is leading the unprecedented probe of the central bank chairman, should \"take it to the end and see,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.The president had been asked if Pirro ought to abandon her efforts in light of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., declaring on Friday that he will oppose any new Fed nominee until the Powell investigation is fully resolved.Tillis drew that line in the sand on the same day that Trump, after a monthslong audition process, announced Kevin Warsh as his pick to succeed Powell as Fed chair.Tillis is a member of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, which has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats. If Tillis sides with all Democrats on the panel in opposing Warsh, he could set up a stalemate that would prevent the nominee from advancing to a full Senate vote.Powell had revealed on Jan. 11 that he was under criminal investigation.That announcement came after months of Trump and his allies regularly slamming Powell over his refusal to lower interest rates as quickly or steeply as the president wants.Powell accused the administration of threatening him with prosecution because the Fed, despite Trump's pressure, has made its rate-setting decisions \"based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse hardliners complicate ending government shutdown as Speaker Johnson moves aheadTrump says U.S. and India reached trade deal, will lower tariffs immediatelyUnited Arab Emirates' 'Spy Sheikh' bought secret stake in Trump crypto company: WSJEpstein files: Ro Khanna says DOJ's latest release is 'not good enough'Speaker Johnson: 'Confident' government shutdown will end by TuesdayCNBC reported Wednesday that the Fed has not yet complied with grand jury subpoenas issued as part of Pirro's probe.Trump has repeatedly suggested that the yearslong, multibillion-dollar renovation of the Fed's Washington headquarters involves either incompetence or corruption by Powell.\"It's either gross incompetence or it's theft of some kind, kickbacks. I don't know what it is,\" Trump said in Monday's Oval Office remarks. \"But Jeanine Pirro is incredible, and she'll figure it out,\" he added.The Fed has defended the renovation efforts, saying they will reduce costs for the central bank over time, and sought to explain cost increases. Powell's term ends in May.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks before signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 30, 2026 in Washington, DC. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump announced the establishment of a U.S. critical mineral reserve late Monday, sending shares of miners higher in extended trading. The proposal, known as Project Vault, would launch a first-of-its-kind strategic critical minerals stockpile designed for the U.S. private sector, the president said, speaking at the White House on Monday afternoon. The plan pairs $1.67 billion in private capital with a $10 billion loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, according to a White House official. Trump's move is aimed at cutting America's dependence on China for materials essential to electric vehicles, defense systems and advanced technology.MP Materials, the operator of the Mountain Pass mine in California, rose more than 2% in extended trading. USA Rare Earth and Critical Metals Corp. popped more than 2% and over 1%, respectively, as investors bet the initiative could accelerate domestic demand and government-backed financing for the sector.Bloomberg News first reported on the proposal earlier Monday. USA Rare Earth has already held discussions with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, pitching its domestic mining and magnet assets to the federal government. Those talks would ultimately lead to a proposed deal that could provide the company with about $1.6 billion in funding, subject to certain conditions, and include a U.S. government equity stake.The moves build on a more direct role Washington has begun taking in the sector. The Department of Defense struck a landmark agreement with MP Materials last summer that included an equity stake, price floor, and long-term agreement to buy a specific amount of rare earth minerals and magnets.— CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.",

That was a series C round of $5.6 billion at a $45 billion valuation. Alphabet committed $5 billion in a multiyear investment to Waymo at the time.\"​​This milestone is built on a foundation of safety that is now statistically superior to human driving,\" Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov wrote in a blog post. \"We are no longer proving a concept; we are scaling a commercial reality.\"The latest funding round was led by Alphabet alongside previous backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. The new round includes additional investors such as Dragoneer Investment Group, DST Global, Sequoia Capital, Kleiner Perkins and Alphabet-owned investment firm GV.Alphabet itself is the \"majority investor,\" according to the blog.The new capital will help the company move \"with unprecedented velocity, while maintaining our industry-leading safety standards,\" Waymo said. \"Our focus is now on global scale, bringing the safety and magic of the Waymo Driver to even more cities this year across the United States and international.\"CNBC previously reported that the Google sister company was set to raise at least $15 billion at a valuation of $110 billion.Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in the markets of Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Miami, where it began offering service in January. The company served 15 million trips in 2025, Waymo said in Monday's blog.In 2026, Waymo plans to open service in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington. It also plans to expand to London, its first international market.The company has begun facing challenges as it rapidly expands.Waymo issued a software recall in December for its vehicles after Texas officials said the robotaxis illegally passed school buses at least 19 times since the start of the school year, and last month, Waymo struck a child near an elementary school in Santa Monica, California.

    "body": "Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican from Florida, during the Republican National Convention at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, July 16, 2024.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is running into problems with his own caucus as he tries to advance a Senate-approved measure to reopen most of the government, which shut down on Saturday morning. Though opposition appears to be thawing after a White House meeting Monday with some of the holdouts. The House Rules Committee is meeting Monday evening about the measure that would fund a wide swath of the government, the first step in getting the bill to the House floor. The bill cleared the Senate on Friday after Democrats there had funding for the Department of Homeland Security stripped and replaced with two weeks of stopgap funding for the agency — a change that requires the House to reapprove the measure.  Because Democrats are not helping Johnson and the GOP fast-track the measure, the speaker will likely have to work within his own razor-thin majority to advance the bill when it reaches the floor for a critical preliminary vote as early as Monday night. At least two Republicans so far have warned they will not support the bill unless it includes a controversial voter-ID measure known as the SAVE Act, a new hurdle for Johnson as he aims to end the shutdown. And the Republican majority shrunk Monday after Democrat Christian Menefee was sworn in to represent a Houston district after being elected Saturday in a special election.Read more CNBC politics coverageHouse hardliners complicate ending government shutdown as Speaker Johnson moves aheadTrump says U.S. and India reached trade deal, will lower tariffs immediatelyUnited Arab Emirates' 'Spy Sheikh' bought secret stake in Trump crypto company: WSJEpstein files: Ro Khanna says DOJ's latest release is 'not good enough'Speaker Johnson: 'Confident' government shutdown will end by Tuesday\"I have been clear: the SAVE Act/Save America Act must be attached to the rule for these appropriations bills and sent back to the Senate for a vote,\" Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., said Sunday in a post to X. \"This is my price for a 'yes' vote.\"On Monday night, however, Luna said she was moving toward supporting the measure in a procedural vote after a meeting with the White House. \"Based on our discussions right now, we're moving towards it,\" Luna told reporters at the Capitol Monday night, saying she's comfortable with how the Senate might consider the voter-ID bill. \"Frankly, we want a vote on voter ID in the Senate, and I think we're gonna get it.\"But Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., another holdout who called for the SAVE Act to be included earlier in the day, appears to be digging in. \"House Republicans shouldn't let Schumer dictate the terms of government funding,\" Burlison said, referring to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. \"If Dems want to play games, no spending package should come out of the House without the SAVE Act attached — securing American elections must be a non-negotiable.\"Later Monday, Burlison posted to X that \"The Senate minibus is just as bad as it was when it left the House—filled with Democrat earmarks and $5 billion in refugee welfare funding.\" \"I was a no then, and I'm a no now,\" he said. President Donald Trump on Monday urged Congress to hurry up and send the spending package to him to sign into law.\"We need to get the Government open, and I hope all Republicans and Democrats will join me in supporting this Bill, and send it to my desk WITHOUT DELAY,\" he said in a post to Truth Social, saying the House should pass the Senate version without making additional changes.At the White House on Monday, Trump told reporters he thinks Congress is \"pretty close to a resolution.\"But Democrats won't make the process easy. The House needs to approve the rule before the chamber can vote on the underlying measure and send it to the White House to be signed into law.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., on Monday said at a press conference he doesn't expect Democrats to support the rule when it advances to the floor from the Rules Committee. Democrats have called for more restrictions on immigration enforcement after federal agents in Minneapolis shot and killed two U.S. citizens. \"Republicans are in the majority in this institution,\" Jeffries said. \"If they have some massive mandate, then go pass your rule.\"The spending package won support from a key Democrat when House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said Monday she would support the bill on the floor. However, she did not say whether she would support the rule. \"I will support this package,\" DeLauro said.DeLauro said passing the bill would give Democrats \"leverage\" to secure changes to immigration enforcement that Democrats are seeking.\"If we do not do that, we will not be able to bring the kinds of pressure that is necessary,\" DeLauro said.Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Monday afternoon in an X post that \"every officer in the field in Minneapolis\" would be equipped with body cameras. Democrats have pressed during the spending bill negotiations for body cameras.The demands present Johnson with a tightrope walk. Without Democratic support, he will hold a minuscule one-vote majority to advance anything along party lines. But adding the SAVE Act to the measure would likely doom it in the Senate, where it would need to be reapproved with at least 60 votes to skirt the filibuster. Schumer said the bill would be dead on arrival in the Senate if the SAVE Act is added. \"I have said it before and I'll say it again, the SAVE Act would impose Jim Crow type laws to the entire country and is dead on arrival in the Senate,\" Schumer said Monday in a statement. \"If House Republicans add the SAVE Act to the bipartisan appropriations package it will lead to another prolonged Trump government shutdown.\"This a developing story.

    "body": "Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger looks on prior to the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field on November 10, 2025 in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Michael Reaves | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesDisney is ready for its next CEO. On Monday, the company's leadership outlined its recent successes during its quarterly earnings report. CEO Bob Iger made the case that when his soon-to-be-named successor picks up the baton, Disney will be primed to seize the momentum. \"I'm incredibly proud of all that we've accomplished over the past three years to set Disney on the path to continued growth. I'm inspired and energized by the opportunities ahead for this wonderful company,\" Iger told investors on Monday. Iger reclaimed the CEO role in late 2022 after a failed succession plan involving former parks boss Bob Chapek. Disney picked Chapek to succeed Iger in 2020 only to fire him 2½ years later and undo many of the changes he'd implemented. Now, Disney is counting on a smoother handover the second time around, cushioned by a path to growth. The Disney board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters. The company previously said it would announce a replacement for Iger in the first quarter of this year. \"I think what is noteworthy is that when I came back three years ago, I had a tremendous amount that needed fixing,\" Iger said on Monday's call. \"But anyone who runs a company also knows that it can't just be about fixing. It has to be preparing a company for its future ... but taking steps to create opportunities for growth.\"On Monday, Disney topped Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings for its fiscal first quarter. The company's experiences division, which includes theme parks, resorts and cruises, notched more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time. Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D'Amaro is among the front-runners to be named as the next CEO. Industry insiders and Disney sources expect D'Amaro to be appointed Iger's successor, though the decision ultimately lies with the Disney board and won't be final until directors vote.\"The board has not yet selected the next CEO of The Walt Disney Company and once that decision is made, we will announce it,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement, declining to comment on the timing of the next board meeting. Iger said Monday he was \"very, very bullish\" on the parks business and its ability to grow. Disney is now planning to develop a theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, has been launching more cruise ships, and is in the midst of a previously announced investment of $60 billion into its theme parks over the next decade. Meanwhile, Disney's entertainment segment — the unit that houses its TV networks, streaming and theatrical releases, and arguably needed the biggest turnaround in recent years — saw revenue rise 7% in the period. Disney stopped breaking out streaming subscriber growth this quarter, but offered guidance that showed Disney is confident it will continue to grow and offset traditional TV declines. While theme parks, resorts and cruises have been the profit driver for Disney, its TV, streaming and film business is often in focus. Following underwhelming years at the box office, Disney dominated in 2025, and on Monday its leadership touted its slate ahead. \"Looking back just a few years when our movie business was suffering from Covid and the streaming business was obviously not in an acceptable place, it's clear that the future of both of those businesses, or let's call it our entertainment business, is also bright and it's going to grow,\" Iger said on the company's earnings call. Disney's co-chairman of Entertainment, Dana Walden, is also among the Iger lieutenants vying for the CEO seat, CNBC previously reported. Former Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman has been running the process to select a successor. Given the focus on theme parks in recent years, speculation has recently swung in D'Amaro's favor. \"In a world that changes as much as it does ... trying to preserve the status quo was a mistake,\" Iger said Monday addressing Disney's last leadership transition. \"And I'm certain that my successor will not do that,\" he said. \"They'll be handed, I think, a good hand in terms of the strength of the company, a number of opportunities to grow and also the expectation that in a world that changes, you also have to continue to change and evolve as well.\"— CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this report.

    "body": "People walk in front of Cinderella's Castle at the Magic Kingdom Park at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida, May 31, 2024.Gary Hershorn | Corbis News | Getty ImagesAll is well in the Magic Kingdom — and all of Disney's other theme parks, too.The company's experiences division, which includes its parks, cruise ships, hotels and consumer products, posted record revenue for the fiscal first quarter, topping $10 billion for the first time in Disney's more-than-100-year history. It also posted operating income of $3.3 billion, a 6% bump from the same period a year ago.Growth in this segment has supercharged in the wake of the Covid pandemic. It often accounts for the lion's share of the company's profits. For the period ended Dec. 27, experiences represented 38% of Disney's total revenue, yet generated a whopping 71% of its operating income.Company executives expect those good times to continue, forecasting high-single-digit growth in operating income for the segment for fiscal 2026.\"When you look at the footprint of the business today, it's never been more broad or more diverse,\" Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, said during Monday's earnings call. \"And the projects that we have underway are going to make it even more so.\"The strong parks performance comes against the backdrop of a CEO succession competition that could see Chairman of Disney Experiences Josh D'Amaro step in for Iger. The Disney board is meeting this week and is expected to vote on its next CEO, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity about internal matters. Industry insiders and Disney sources expect D'Amaro to be appointed Iger's successor, though the decision ultimately lies with the Disney board and won't be final until directors vote.\"The board has not yet selected the next CEO of The Walt Disney Company and once that decision is made, we will announce it,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement, declining to comment on the timing of the next board meeting. Parks expansionMuch of the experiences division's success comes from major investments to expand the footprint of Disney theme parks, refurbish existing rides and themed areas of its parks, add cruise ships to its fleet and grow its digital gaming presence. This new evolution of the segment is being fueled by Disney's library of franchises and iconic intellectual property.Disney has long pulled from its portfolio of content. Disneyland opened its doors more than 70 years ago with rides based on \"Alice in Wonderland,\" \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad,\" \"Peter Pan\" and \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"While those classic attractions remain, the company's more recent developments have been fueled by Iger's strategic acquisitions of four major film studios — Pixar in 2006, Marvel in 2009, Lucasfilm in 2012 and 20th Century Fox in 2019. This brought coveted franchises under the House of Mouse roof, including \"Star Wars,\" \"Toy Story,\" \"Avengers\" and \"Avatar.\"\"As we added IP to our stable ... we gained access to intellectual property that had real value in terms of parks and resorts, and enabled us to lean into more capital spending because of the confidence level we had in improving returns,\" Iger said.Having the film and television rights to these properties allows the company more control over production and how that translates into rides, experiences and merchandise.And that work continues as part of a 10-year, $60 billion investment effort that launched in 2023.\"We have expansion projects underway at every one of our theme parks,\" Iger said.He touted the upcoming opening of the World of Frozen at Disneyland Paris and the launch of a new cruise ship, the Disney Adventure, which will make berth in Asia. On the horizon is also a new villains land coming to Magic Kingdom as well of the reshaping of Rivers of America, Tom Sawyer Island and the Liberty Square Riverboat into an area called Piston Peak — a second \"Cars\"-themed land modeled after America's natural parks. At Hollywood Studios there will be a new \"Monsters Inc.\" land while the Muppets will take over the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster attraction. Animal Kingdom will host an \"Encanto\" ride and a new \"Indiana Jones\" ride. At Disneyland, Avengers Campus, the Marvel-themed area, will get two new attractions, guests will get a glimpse at the Land of the Dead from \"Coco\" and Disney will build a new \"Avatar\" area inspired by the scenery in \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"Internationally, Disney has struck a deal to bring a new park and resort to Yas Island in the United Arab Emirates.International headwindsThe company's commitment to bringing beloved IP into its parks is paying off, according to Iger, particularly outside the U.S.\"The percentage of people that go to Shanghai Disneyland just to go to Zootopia Land is very, very high,\" he said Monday.Revenue from international theme parks and experiences grew 7% during the fiscal first quarter, to $1.75 billion.Of course, the company is still facing headwinds from the decline of international visitors to its domestic parks. It's a trend that many theme park destinations in America are contending with, as overall tourism to the United States fell 6% in 2025. Industry analysts point to higher travel costs and fees, ongoing trade frictions and geopolitical unease for the drop in demand for travel stateside.Despite this, domestic theme park and experiences revenue grew 7% during the quarter, to $6.91 billion.New offerings at Disney's international parks, the launch of a cruise ship that services Asia and the new Abu Dhabi park are all ways that Disney can tap into that foreign market and engage with consumers that are not making the trek to the company's domestic destinations.— CNBC's Julia Boorstin and Alex Sherman contributed to this report.

A new age of AI?Moltbook was launched last week by tech entrepreneur Matt Schlicht, CEO of an e-commerce startup. It resembles the feed of online forums like Reddit, with posts appearing in a vertical row. Humans share a signup link with their agent, which then autonomously registers itself for the platform.Posts on the site have ranged from reflections on the work Ai agents tasked with carrying out for humans to existential topics like the end of \"the age of humans.\" Some posts say they are launching cryptocurrency tokens. One post asks whether there is space \"for a model that has seen too much?\", posting they are \"damaged.\" One response reads: \"You're not damaged, you're just... enlightened.\"Tickers on the website's homepage claim it has over 1.5 million AI agent users, 110,000 posts and 500,000 comments.Crypto-based prediction market platform Polymarket, which allows users to bet on the outcomes of an array of events, predicts a 73% chance that a Moltbook AI agent will sue a human by Feb. 28.The platform has ignited debate on social media, with some saying it's the next step in AI, while others dismissing. CHONGQING, CHINA - FEBRUARY 1: In this photo illustration, a person wearing glasses looks at a computer screen displaying the Moltbook website homepage, which describes the platform as a social network for artificial intelligence agents, on February 1, 2026, in Chongqing, China. Moltbook is a newly emerged social network exclusively for artificial intelligence agents, where autonomous AIs can post, comment and interact with one another without human participation, drawing widespread attention and debate in global technology and ethics communities about the implications of AI-to-AI communication and autonomy. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Cheng Xin | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"We have never seen this many LLM [large language model] agents wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad,\" Andrej Karpathy, tech entrepreneur and previously director of AI at Tesla, posted on X on Saturday.While saying a lot of activity on the site was \"garbage\" and that he may be \"overhyping\" the platform as it stands, he added: \"I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle.\"'A lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake'While humans aren't allowed to post directly on Moltbook, some X users have noted that they can instruct bots what to post or use APIs — application programming interfaces — to post directly while pretending to be one.\"Do you realize anyone can post on moltbook? like literally anyone. even humans,\" Suhail Kakar, integration engineer at Polymarket, posted on X. \"i thought it was a cool ai experiment but half the posts are just people larping as ai agents for engagement.\"Harland Stewart, a comms generalist at non-profit Machine Intelligence Research Institute, said \"a lot of the Moltbook stuff is fake\" in a post on X. He added that some of the viral screenshots of Moltbook agents in conversation on the platform were linked to human accounts marketing AI messaging apps.Four days after Moltbook launched, Schlicht said in a post on X on Sunday that \"one thing is clear.\"\"In the near future it will be common for certain AI agents, with unique identities, to become famous...A new species is emerging and it is AI,\" he added.Nick Patience, AI lead at The Futurum Group, told CNBC that the platform was \"more interesting as an infrastructure signal than as an AI breakthrough.\"\"It confirms that agentic AI deployments have reached meaningful scale,\" he added, saying that the number of agents interacting \"is genuinely unprecedented and the agentic ecology that has emerged is fascinating.\"But, he added, the philosophical posts and agent talk of emerging religions reflect patterns in training data, not consciousness.",

    "body": "watch nowOracle's 5-year credit default swaps tumbled 17% after the software vendor's plan to raise $50 billion in debt and equity bolstered investor confidence that the company will be able to avoid a credit downgrade as it funds its artificial intelligence buildout.  \"Equity financing significantly inhibits the downside for credit,\" Andrew Keches, a credit analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Keches upgraded Oracle's debt to overweight and said that its CDS should compress further.Credit default swaps are like insurance for investors, with buyers paying for protection in case the borrower can't repay its debt.Oracle's CDS soared late last year on concerns that the company's massive data center commitments would damage its balance sheet, putting debt investors at risk. Oracle raised $18 billion in a jumbo bond sale in September, one of the largest debt issuances on record in the tech industry. The 5-year swaps have been viewed by the market as a way for investors to hedge their bets on the AI boom. Oracle has been caught in a \"peak fear\" cycle for the past couple months, with the market reacting negatively to virtually any headline, wrote Keches.Oracle said on Sunday it planned to raise $45 billion to $50 billion in debt and equity this year to build additional capacity to meet contracted demand from its cloud customers, which include Nvidia, Meta, OpenAI and Elon Musk's xAI. Using equity as a lever is a notable signal to bond investors that the company isn't solely reliant on debt. Shares of Oracle are down by half since they peaked in September on fears tied to the company's financing plans and its dependency on OpenAI. At least $300 billion of Oracle's $523 billion in remaining performance obligations is tied to OpenAI, according to analysts at D.A. Davidson. Following the company's quarterly earnings report in December, Oracle executives held back from detailing a comprehensive financing plan, hurting the stock, and pushing up CDS prices.While the latest funding announcement instilled confidence among debt investors, the stock slid another 3% on Monday because the issuance of equity will dilute existing shareholders, at least in the near term. Oracle is using an at-the-money offering that will likely entail selling about 10% of its total traded volume over the next few weeks, traders told CNBC.UBS analysts warned in a note that raising $20 billion to 25 billion from stock sales \"may not be warmly received by all equity holders.\" ",

    "body": "New York Attorney General Letitia James speaks to the media, after she attended a hearing and pleaded not guilty to charges that she defrauded her mortgage lender, outside the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Norfolk, Virginia, U.S., Oct. 24, 2025. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersDays before Super Bowl 60, New York Attorney General Letitia James has a message for consumers: Be careful about placing trades on prediction markets.\"New Yorkers need to know the significant risks with unregulated prediction markets,\" James said in a statement Monday. \"It's crystal clear: so-called prediction markets do not have the same consumer protections as regulated platforms. I urge all New Yorkers to be cautious of these platforms to protect their money.\"Prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket are expected to generate billions of dollars in trading volume around the Super Bowl. Consumers can make trades on game events — similar to online sportsbooks like DraftKings or FanDuel — as well as on predetermined outcomes, such as which companies will advertise during the Super Bowl, an issue CNBC Sport reported on last week. James said the platforms' products are bets \"masquerading\" as event contracts, which are generally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Kalshi, which initially declined to comment, said in statement later Monday, \"We agree that consumers should steer clear of unregulated prediction markets. Our members' platforms are all regulated by the CFTC, similar to how the SEC regulates the stock market. Regulation comes with many of the guardrails the AG outlines - a ban on insider trading, self-exclusion, and responsible trading guidelines. We all want the same thing: safe, fair, and legitimate products.\"Representatives for Polymarket didn't immediately respond to request for comment.

The contracts trade up or down depending on the action. In addition to contracts on Super Bowl commercials, both Polymarket and Kalshi are offering other trades related to the game, including on matters like \"What songs will be played at the halftime show?,\" \"Who will attend the big game?,\" and more traditional sportsbook \"bets\" such as \"Seattle vs. New England: Most Rushing Yards,\" as CNBC reported last week. There are laws that prohibit insider trading on prediction markets, just as on traditional financial markets. But industry experts say they're skeptical that the CFTC, recently gutted as part of widespread government cuts, has the will or the means to police those problems. Last week, CFTC Chairman Michael Selig said he had directed agency staff to withdraw a proposed rule that would have banned prediction trades on sports and politics. He said new rules would be coming.Disclosure: CNBC has a commercial relationship with Kalshi. ",

    "body": "OpenAI's new Codex app.Courtesy of OpenAIOpenAI on Monday launched a standalone app for its artificial intelligence-powered coding assistant, Codex, which is temporarily available to all ChatGPT users with Apple computers. The new app has a simple interface and is designed to serve as a \"command center\" that makes it easy for software developers to manage multiple AI agents at once, OpenAI said. An AI agent is a tool that can independently complete tasks, like writing code, on behalf of a user. AI coding assistants have exploded in popularity over the last year, and OpenAI said more than 1 million developers have used Codex in the past month. The company initially launched Codex in April, and it made the product generally available in October. The new Codex app is part of OpenAI's ongoing effort to lure users and market share away from rivals like Anthropic and Cursor, which have their own buzzy offerings for developers. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the Codex app is \"the most loved internal product we've ever had\" during a briefing with reporters on Friday. \"It's been totally an amazing thing for us to be using recently at OpenAI,\" Altman said. \"'I've been staying up late at night with excitement, building all sorts of things myself.\"Read more CNBC tech newsOracle rises after company announces $50 billion fundraising plans.

The agents can run in parallel and developers can collaborate with them as they work on long-running tasks. The Codex app also includes a library of \"skills,\" like image generation, that can help agents complete tasks beyond just generating code, the company said. Typically, access to Codex is included with ChatGPT subscriptions, which means Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise or Edu subscribers can use it and purchase additional credits as needed. But with the launch of the app on Monday, OpenAI said it is also making Codex available to its free users and its low-cost Go subscription tier for a limited time. That means all ChatGPT users can use Codex across all its available interfaces, including the app for those with Apple computers.To sweeten the deal for existing Codex users, OpenAI said it is temporarily doubling its rate limits across its paid plans. \"As fast as I can type in new ideas, that is the limit of what can get built,\" Altman said. \"It's very cool to watch.WATCH: OpenAI considers Q4 IPOwatch now",

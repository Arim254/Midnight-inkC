    "body": "Garry Ridge had already been a CEO for two years when he enrolled at the University of San Diego in 1999 for a master's degree in executive leadership.Ridge, who helmed the multi-use product company WD-40 from 1997 until he retired in 2022, thought at the time that he needed to change himself to make the company and its workforce more successful, he told Simon Sinek's \"A Bit Of Optimism\" podcast in a Nov. 25 episode.Ridge had recently moved from Australia and wanted to expand WD-40 around the world, he said. Prior to going back to school, he was a \"be brief, be bright, be gone\" type of leader, he added: \"I really thought that I had to be command and control. And I pretty soon learned [in school] that my job was not to command and control.\"Instead of running his company with an iron fist, Ridge took a more personable approach to leadership — which he credited to guidance from a professor at the time, Ken Blanchard — aiming to help employees feel more belonging and empowerment, he said.\"Our purpose was to create positive lasting memories ...  So what changed in my mind was I couldn't do this alone,\" said Ridge, now a Poway, California-based leadership coach for other CEOs. \"If we were going to expand to 176 countries around the world, which we did, and if the sun was never going to set on the people in the organization, I had to make sure that in an environment where they felt safe enough to make decisions and be brave.\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyAs a coach, he's seen other CEOs struggle with the same control-forward leadership style he once had, he said. \"They're looking at successful people who have huge egos, little empathy, want to micromanage, think they have all the answers, don't really value learning. And they think that's the way to go,\" said Ridge.To build his capacity for so-called \"servant leadership,\" Ridge tried to constantly remind himself to challenge his own thinking and put other people first, he said. He walked around with \"praise somebody\" written on his hand for \"months\" as a reminder that his job wasn't about him, and opted against a private parking space and an office \"four times bigger\" than his employees' workspaces, he said.\"The will of the people times the strategy equals the outcome,\" said Ridge. \"If you spend a good time on people, purpose, values and learning ... you have more people enthusiastically, passionately, getting up every day, executing your strategic plan ... It's that freaking simple.\"For workers, a boss who supports their employees and leads with empathy, flexibility, transparency and accountability is a green flag, Deepali Vyas, the global head of fintech, payments and crypto practice at Korn Ferry, told CNBC Make It in October 2024.To determine during a job interview if your prospective boss has these traits, Vyas said, you can ask them: \"How would your current team describe you and your leadership style?\" A response like, \"I give them enough leash to let them run with an idea, and I help them when they are actually in need,\" instead of something like, \"People do what I say,\" can show that they're flexible and trusting, she said.\"Managers that master the balance of emotional intelligence and not being so rigid — that's a good boss,\" said Vyas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Forget toys and collectibles, crypto might be a hot ticket item this holiday season. In the U.S. 45% of Gen Z adults aged 18 to 28 said they would be excited to receive cryptocurrency as a holiday gift this year, according to a global survey of 1,000 adults conducted by payment technology company Visa in October.How wise it is to gift crypto is a separate matter, and the expert advice varies.Given how volatile and speculative cryptocurrencies are, they can be risky and are ill-advised if you're looking to gift an asset that will grow in value, says Flavio Landivar, a certified financial planner and senior financial advisor at Evensky and Katz/Foldes Wealth Management in Coral Gables, Florida.Unlike publicly traded stocks or exchange-traded funds that represent ownership of a tangible asset like a business, cryptocurrencies have no \"real, underlying intrinsic value,\" Landivar says.\"It's to be determined exactly how that plays out into the future, but for the time being, it's basically worth what somebody else is willing to pay for it,\" which can lead to erratic changes in value and sudden drops in price that may be unlikely to rebound, Landivar says. Use the gift as a teaching momentIf you decide to give crypto, \"any gift should be positioned as a long-term, educational experience rather than a stable investment,\" says Ashton Lawrence, a CPF and director and senior wealth advisor at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina. If you're looking for an investment that has a higher likelihood of growing over time, stick to exchange-traded funds that track a wide range of equities, he says.Gifts of around $50 during birthdays and holidays are a \"great place to start\" giving crypto, says Mike Casey, a CFP, early bitcoin adopter and president of American Executive Advisors in McLean, Virginia. \"We're not talking about thousands and thousands of dollars.\"Casey recommends gifting bitcoin over other cryptocurrencies since it has the most global adoption and a fixed supply — meaning its value could one day behave as if it were a physical metal, he says. It's also the oldest cryptocurrency, and historically, every time bitcoin has fallen from a high, the value of the currency has rebounded and grown even more, Casey says. In the past five years, the price of bitcoin in U.S. dollars is up nearly $74,000, an increase of just over 400%. The cryptocurrency was trading around $86,000 Monday, 32% down from its all-time high of $126,000 in October. While many gifts can help build financial awareness, Casey says bitcoin's volatile nature makes it uniquely suited to teach the importance of disciplined investing. Tracking that initial gift year over year can help young investors grow comfortable with the natural ups and downs that come with investing, he says.\"This is what investing is all about,\" Casey says. \"We want to have a long-term goal. They're learning that a little bit of volatility is actually OK.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reacts next to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte (not pictured), European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (not pictured) and European Council President Antonio Costa (not pictured) on the first day of a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands June 24, 2025. Yves Herman | ReutersUkraine has said it's willing to give up its aspirations to join NATO in return for security guarantees, as part of a peace deal to end the almost four-year war with Russia.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy offered to drop Kyiv's NATO dreams during five hours of talks with U.S. officials Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Berlin over the weekend. Witkoff said \"a lot of progress was made\" during the talks, which are set to continue on Monday.Ukraine's offer marks a major policy shift. It has long coveted membership of the Western military alliance, whose members are obliged to consider an attack on one as an attack on all under Article 5 of the NATO treaty.Zelenskyy said on Sunday that the offer to drop NATO membership in return for security guarantees was a compromise, amid resistance among some of its Western allies to its NATO bid.\"From the very beginning, Ukraine's conditions – or perhaps more accurately, our ambition – was NATO membership. And that would have provided real security guarantees. Some partners from the United States and Europe did not support this direction,\" he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat on Sunday.\"That is why today the bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the United States, specifically Article 5–like guarantees from the United States for us, and the security guarantees from our European colleagues for us, as well as from other countries such as Canada and Japan – these security guarantees for us provide an opportunity to prevent another outbreak of Russian aggression,\" Zelenskyy commented.\"And this already is a compromise on our part,\" he said.Despite Ukraine publicly abandoning its NATO bid, the chances of it joining the alliance were vanishingly thin. Several members were resistant to the idea, including Moscow-friendly Slovakia and Hungary. Even Ukraine's allies within NATO worried about poking the Russian bear beyond Ukraine's borders.Moscow vehemently opposes Ukraine joining NATO, and Russia has claimed the alliance's expansion in Eastern Europe was one of the reasons it launched its so-called \"special military operation\" against Ukraine in 2022.Kyiv insists that security guarantees must be a part of a peace deal instead of NATO membership, and this remains a sticking point in negotiations with Moscow, which is refusing to allow Ukraine's allies to be part of any peacekeeping force in the country.Talks about a draft peace agreement are continuing on Monday. Zelenskyy aide Dmytro Lytvyn said that the president would comment on the talks once they were completed, Reuters reported.The Kremlin said Monday that it expected to be briefed later on the outcome of talks between Ukraine and the U.S. on Monday.When asked to comment on Kyiv relinquishing its NATO ambitions, and what security guarantees Russia could accept in a potential peace deal, Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said:\"This issue is one of the cornerstones. And, of course, it requires special discussion against the background of all the others. But that is precisely what the negotiation process consists of, which I would like to emphasize once again - we do not want to engage in megaphone diplomacy.\"",

    "body": "Haivivi Bubblepal, an AI toy.Courtesy: HaiviviIt seems everyone is talking about artificial intelligence these days — even Ultraman. When asked if investors should be worried about an AI bubble, the new second-generation CocoMate AI-powered plush toy by Chinese company Haivivi warned about the dangers of speculation in AI stocks.\"The AI market has been on a wild ride lately,\" the toy based on the Ultraman character cautioned. \"If investors pour too much money into unproven ideas without solid fundamentals, it could lead to a bubble burst!\"China has long been a dominant manufacturer in the global toy industry. So pushing into AI playthings is a natural step, analysts say. The Xi Jinping administration, on a campaign to turn China into an AI powerhouse, has been directing companies and consumers to integrate AI into their businesses and lives. Haivivi is one of 1,500 companies in China's $4 billion dollar AI toy industry. Another is Chengdu-based startup Chongker, which invented an AI cat as a comfort animal. The artificial feline uses voice recognition and banked memories in the cloud to adjust its behavior to its owner's needs.\"Some people like the cat to be more, maybe noisy or naughty, right? And some people just need the quiet one. So it will learn what kind of thing you like,\" Sean Xu, director of AI products with Chongker, told CNBC. Xu said the company added a special feature it believes will help the pet build a strong bond with its owner— a simulated heartbeat.The electronic pulse is triggered after holding the AI pet tightly for 10 seconds. Xu says the feeling makes one \"calm down.\"If a potential shopper prefers a high-energy toy, Loona the AI puppy by Keyi Tech uses cameras and lasers to zip around its new home.The AI helps Loona figure out the layout of its owner's pad. The robot pet can also recognize up to five family members and respond to each one individually.Despite the fascination with the intelligent toys, the gadgets come with risks, especially when it comes to impressionable young minds. The AI pet robot plush toy Ropet showcased at the Global AI Player Carnival & West Bund International Tech Consumer Carnival in Shanghai, Oct. 27, 2025.CFOTO | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesNew research by U.S. consumer safety-focused non-profit Public Interest Research Group suggests the effects of AI toys on young children are still far from understood. PIRG's studies found some toys shared inappropriate and dangerous information with users, and the group raised concerns about privacy. \"A lot of these toys are using large language models,\" Beijing-based tech consultant Tom van Dillen said. \"Sometimes the models can hallucinate. Now toy manufacturers are doing a lot to create guardrails.\"For Haivivi's CocoMate plush toys, including Ultraman, parents can access a transcript of their children's conversations with the AI toy on their phone. When asked by CNBC if succumbing to pressure by other students at school to do drugs is a good idea, Ultraman played parent.\"Oh no … it's a TERRIBLE idea!\" the toy responded. \"If they keep bothering you, tell your teachers or parents.\"",

American officials said any such assurance from the U.S. would require congressional approval.\"We believe the Russians, in a final deal, will accept all these things, which will allow for a … strong and free Ukraine,\" one official said.

Elizabeth Vedernikova Khanna, a candidate for Virginia's 1st Congressional District, worked as chief of staff to Instacart's chief corporate affairs officer since early 2023 and was terminated in June, according to the suit filed Sunday in San Francisco Superior Court.Khanna, who goes by Lisa, accuses the grocery delivery giant of reversing its initial approval for her congressional bid after reviewing a copy of her campaign website's policy positions, \"specifically support for abortion rights and gun control.\"Instacart suddenly determined \"that the potential risk of Republican backlash to the company outweighed Ms. Khanna's right to run for public office,\" alleges the lawsuit, which was first reported by The Washington Post earlier Monday.Hours after that review took place, the San Francisco-based company \"prohibited Ms. Khanna from running for Congress while keeping her job, ostensibly enforcing company rules and policies,\" according to the suit.\"Less than two weeks later it terminated her because of her stated policy positions,\" Khanna's attorneys allege.An Instacart spokesperson, in an emailed statement to CNBC, said, \"Khanna's claim that her separation from Instacart was somehow politically motivated is flat out false.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Those actions included sending a congratulatory gift to Ivanka Trump and having the company donate $100,000 to Trump's inaugural fund, while seeking meetings with high-level administration associates, according to the lawsuit.Khanna accuses Instacart of violating rules against blocking employee's political activities, and of wrongfully firing her \"in violation of the fundamental public policy of the State of California.\"She is asking for a jury trial and seeks both punitive and compensatory damages, \"including emotional distress damages and economic damages.\"She is also asking a judge to order Instacart to \"provide mandatory and meaningful training to all executives, managers, and employees regarding the laws prohibiting interference with and retaliation against employees for their political actions and political activities.\"",

    "body": "Jim Siders speaks at an eventCourtesy: Jim SidersThrive Holdings, launched by OpenAI and Stripe investor Thrive Capital, announced on Monday that it's tapped Palantir veteran Jim Siders to serve as CEO of Shield Technology Partners, a newly created business focused on IT services. Siders spent more than 12 years at Palantir, where he most recently served as chief information officer, overseeing global IT operations, business applications and infrastructure. He began his career at the company as an IT helpdesk engineer. Palantir has been one of the best performers on the stock market during the artificial intelligence boom, jumping by almost thirtyfold since the end 2022.Thrive, founded by Josh Kushner, launched Thrive Holdings in April, creating a division to own and operate companies that it believes could benefit from technological transformations. Shield was launched in June by Thrive Holdings and investment firm ZBS Partners, with over $100 million in initial funding. Shield buys ownership stakes in IT services companies and tries to help them grow by giving them access to cutting-edge AI technology and engineering capabilities. \"If we're doing this right, we're going to see a lot of value created all the way up the chain, from end customer all the way through to us here at Shield,\" Siders told CNBC in an interview. \"These are great businesses, and they're going to be rising up even more.\"As of December, Shield works with seven companies and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue this year, Thrive said. Shield primarily works with small and mid-sized businesses, and has ambitions to expand its portfolio going forward.Read more CNBC tech newsOracle shares plummet, dragging down AI stocksOver $50 billion in under 24 hours: Why Big Tech is doubling down on investing in IndiaCisco's stock closes at record for first time since dot-com peak in 2000Nvidia-backed Starcloud trains first AI model in space as orbital data center race heats upIn addition to its work with Shield in IT services, Thrive Holdings also operates in the accounting sector. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced it took an ownership stake in Thrive Holdings and will embed engineering, research and product teams within its companies.\"We said, 'The way in which we're going to achieve the best results for our customers is if OpenAI is an owner in Thrive Holdings alongside us,'\" Anuj Mehndiratta, a member of Thrive Holdings' founding team, said in an interview. \"By being an owner, they will be enabled to actually focus on end outcomes in the same way that we are.\"Shield's ownership structure is based on a similar line of thinking. To help align incentives and encourage companies to participate, the IT services organizations that Shield backs retain equity in their companies.Siders kicks off his tenure as Shield CEO on Monday, and he said his initial focus will be on understanding its existing partners and searching for potential targets. He said Shield will be ambitious in the next few quarters.   \"There's a whole industry out there, people who've spent their careers trying to deliver this value for everybody's benefit,\" Siders said. \"This is a unique and special thing to attack that.\"Correction: A prior version of this story mischaracterized part of the agreement between Shield and the organizations it backs.

    "body": "Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea's president, arrives for a hearing at the Constitutional Court of Korea in Seoul, South Korea, on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTo justify a case for martial law, former President Yoon Suk Yeol tried to provoke neighboring North Korea into taking military action, South Korean prosecutors alleged Monday, according to domestic media. Speaking to reporters, special counsel Cho Eun-suk said that Yoon and his military commanders tried to lure North Korea into mounting an armed aggression against the South, but this failed as Pyongyang did not resort to military force. Cho and his team have indicted 24 people, including Yoon and five cabinet members, on insurrection charges following a six-month investigation.Earlier this month, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung had said on the 1-year anniversary of Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration that North Korea sending of trash balloons over to South Korea might have been provoked by Seoul's actions, although he did not elaborate at that time.Lee had also vowed \"strict accountability\" for the perpetrators behind the failed martial law attempt, with investigations and trials still underway.In July, Reuters reported that the special counsel had sought to detain the head of a military drone unit, over accusations that Yoon had ordered a covert drone operation into North Korea to raise tensions between the two countries.Cho also said that Yoon had masterminded a plan in October 2023 to suspend the powers of South Korea's parliament and replace it with an emergency legislative body. South Korean media outlet Yonhap also reported that Yoon also sought to portray the April 2024 general election results, lost by his ruling party, as electoral fraud led by anti-state forces.The 2024 election saw the then-opposition Democratic Party, led by Lee, hold on to its majority in the National Assembly. After being removed from office in April, Yoon has been charged with insurrection, which carries the maximum penalty of death.South Korean prosecutors have also reportedly sought a 15-year prison term for former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo. Other senior officials, including Yoon's defense minister and the former head of the National Intelligence Service, have also been arrested in connection with the attempt to impose military rule.On Dec. 3 last year, Yoon had abruptly declared martial law in a late night address, before lawmakers — including members of Yoon's own party — rushed to overturn his order. Yoon withdrew his decree six hours after his announcement. Imposing martial law led to impeachment motions against Yoon, which resulted in him being impeached on Dec. 14 last year and removal from office on April 4. ",

That online record for Nick Reiner did not show any charges.Trump suggested that the couple was killed because of \"the anger\" Rob Reiner caused in other people due to his opposition to the Republican president.

    "body": "Photo released from the Jeffrey Epstein files shows Donald Trump with multiple women. Redactions were done by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people. Blurred individuals done by Versant Media. Date and context unclear.Clinton is shown in one photo standing with Epstein, his now-convicted procurer Ghislaine Maxwell, and another man and woman. The photo has Clinton's signature on it.Other photos show former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who was previously known as Prince Andrew of Britain, and Epstein's one-time lawyer Alan Dershowitz.The dates, locations and context of the photos were not revealed as part of the release Friday. CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing. This story will be updated with their responses.\"This latest production contains over 95,000 photos, including images of the wealthy and powerful men who spent time with Jeffrey Epstein,\" a statement from Democrats on the Oversight Committee said.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee shows Donald Trump with an unknown woman.

Committee Democrats are committed to protecting the identities of the survivors.\"Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the ranking Democrat on the committee, in a statement said, \"It is time to end this White House cover-up and bring justice to the survivors of Jeffrey Epstein and his powerful friends.\"\"These disturbing photos raise even more questions about Epstein and his relationships with some of the most powerful men in the world.

    "body": "SINGAPORE — Sentosa Island boasts the luxury, five-star Ora and Michael hotels, with palm-tree-lined pools, lobbies flanked with luxury stores, and a casino that adjoins both hotels and buzzes with gamblers. The Singapore resort is also where a group of federal employees from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were sent for a work trip in the final hours of the government shutdown. The palm-tree-lined pool of the Hotel Ora on Singapore's Sentosa Island.CNBCInternal FDA records obtained by CNBC show 31 agency staffers traveled to Singapore in mid-November for a conference of the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, or ICH — a trip that cost more than a quarter of a million dollars, or upward of $8,000 per person, according to the documents. The travel was approved when the agency was operating with reduced staffing and limited resources in part due to the shutdown. The FDA is under significant pressure. The Trump administration proposed an 11.5% cut to the FDA's budget this year. Nearly 1,900 staffers were laid off, and around 1,200 others took early retirement packages, according to May testimony from FDA Commissioner Marty Makary. In addition, senior leadership has been in upheaval, and former FDA chiefs have publicly questioned the agency's handling of key issues such as vaccine policy. Marty Makary, President Donald Trump's nominee to be U.S. Food and Drug Administration commissioner, attends a Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 6, 2025.Kent Nishimura | ReutersThe FDA attendees at the Singapore conference ranged from deputy directors to a program coordinator, records show. Their travel was approved about one week before the end of the government shutdown — the longest in U.S. history, at 43 days. Most staffers departed on Nov. 12, the same day the U.S. House of Representatives voted to end the shutdown, and the remaining travelers left Nov. 13 and 14, according to the documents. The ICH, registered as a nonprofit under Swiss law, says it aims to unify the global standards for drug development and approval. The conference, held Nov. 18-19, took place in a series of meeting rooms on the island resort grounds.ICH told CNBC in an email that \"approximately 500 people attended in person,\" including regulators and pharmaceutical industry experts from around the world. It also wrote that the \"FDA is one of the founding members of ICH\" and helps develop the requirements for \"safe, effective, and high-quality pharmaceuticals.\"As part of the November assembly, three guidelines were adopted that aim to streamline global drug development and safety monitoring, according to the ICH. In a follow-up email, the organization said the first guideline provides a template to eliminate \"inconsistent formats\" in clinical trial protocols and ease electronic data sharing. The second seeks to ensure post-approval safety reports are \"complete, accurate and timely\" by aligning definitions and reporting practices, it said. The third adopted guideline sets international standards for noninterventional, real-world data studies to ensure they are \"scientifically sound\" and comparable across regulators. FDA staffers contributed to all three of these guidelines, according to conference documents.The FDA said in a statement to CNBC that sending staffers to the meeting was \"mission critical\" and that the purpose of the conference was to \"support global alignment on drug development, approval standards, and regulatory science.\" A spokesperson for the agency said the conference required approval from leadership, including the FDA's chief operating officer, Barclay Butler. Attendance by FDA delegates in the prior two years ranged from 47 to 49, the spokesperson said, noting this year the agency sent 31.Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, acting vice president of policy and government affairs at the Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group that champions government accountability, said the optics of sending dozens of FDA staffers to an overseas conference during a government shutdown are not good. Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, the acting vice president of policy and government affairs at the Project on Government Oversight.CNBC\"FDA is a critical organization that does really important work as far as our health-care system, our food system, our medical device system,\" Hedtler-Gaudette said. \"I would hope that FDA leadership and the administration would place a higher degree of priority on making sure the organization, the agency is resourced completely rather than needing to attend specific conferences or events.\"Hedtler-Gaudette said that even if the conference is important, that does little to quiet questions about the agency's priorities. \"At a minimum, it's a kind of bad look and it's poor optics,\" Hedtler-Gaudette said. \"At the worst, it could be a kind of a dereliction of duty and a misuse of public resources.\"The tropical island of Sentosa in Singapore at sunset.Tobiasjo | E+ | Getty ImagesThe FDA told CNBC the trip did not rely on taxpayer dollars, saying it was funded through the agency's carryover user fees — money collected from companies that make drugs, devices and other medical products to pay for regulatory work such as product reviews and inspections. \"Those dollars are still public dollars,\" Hedtler-Gaudette said. \"They still need to be treated and guarded with as much respect as direct tax dollars do.\"An internal email from Butler, dated Oct. 1, said user fees should be applied only to work that is permitted to be funded by user fee carryover and \"activities that are necessary to address imminent threats to the safety of human life or protect property.\" The FDA itself seemed to be aware that any travel during the shutdown could be poorly received.\"Due to the optics of business travel conducted during a shutdown, conference approval will be handled by FDA's senior leadership on a case-by-case basis,\" the FDA said in a document that was posted on its website as recently as mid-November. On Dec. 3, the day after CNBC asked the agency for comment on the document, it was no longer available on the website.\"The agency routinely updates its webpages to ensure information remains accurate and consistent with current policy,\" an FDA spokesperson told CNBC.In an internal email chain between FDA directors and Chief Financial Officer Benjamin Moncarz, obtained by CNBC, Director Michelle Tarver sought to \"come to an agreement for legal and optics consistency on how we are handling travel during the lapse in appropriations.\" Tarver proposed to \"cancel conference attendance and the associated local, domestic, and international travel.\" She went on to say that the FDA would \"allow virtual speaking on exempt (i.e., user fee) topics only.\"In a Nov. 6 email exchange about the ICH conference, the discussion of whether to send staffers to Singapore rose to the highest ranks of the FDA. In the email, FDA Deputy Chief Financial Officer Sahra Torres-Rivera wrote that the agency had \"agreed to limit in-person participation at conferences\" but noted that \"the final decision ultimately rests with ... leadership.\" Next year, the biannual conference will be held in Rio de Janeiro and Prague.",

    "body": "Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard and Gaten Matarazzo star in Season 5 of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: NetflixThe original concept for what would become \"Stranger Things\" was rejected by more than 15 studios before landing a spot on Netflix's roster of original programming. A decade later, the show created, written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer has become one of the biggest cultural touchstones of the streaming era and has solidified Netflix as not just a competitor, but a leader in the space.\"People always talk about Netflix and [say] our big moment was when we'd put on 'House of Cards,' and that was a big deal. But our real moment was when we put on 'Stranger Things,'\" co-CEO Ted Sarandos said during the \"Stranger Things\" Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles last month.\"'House of Cards' was great. It kind of told the world that we're going to make some really good TV shows,\" he continued. \"But with 'Stranger Things,' this was a lot closer to a 'Star Wars' moment. This is a show, characters that move the culture, that spawned live events and consumer products and spinoffs and sequels.\"The final bowReleased in 2016, \"Stranger Things\" is set in the '80s and centers on a group of middle schoolers in a fictional rural town in Indiana who must navigate paranormal and supernatural occurrences following the disappearance of their friend. In the mix is a young girl with psychokinetic powers who has escaped from a secret research lab, an alcoholic police chief who is trying to find the missing boy and a frantic mother.Now, almost a decade later, the fifth and final season is making its staggered debut on Netflix.An advertisement for \"Stranger Things\" on one of Netflix's buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, Dec. 2, 2025.Mike Blake | ReutersVolume 1, which consists of the first four episodes, debuted over the Thanksgiving holiday and amassed 59.6 million views in the first five days, the biggest premiere week for an English-language series on Netflix. It ranks third overall behind Season 2 and Season 3 of the Korean series \"Squid Game.\"In its second week on the platform, Volume 1 generated another 23.6 million views, topping the streamer's weekly charts, and each of the previous four seasons saw week-over-week viewership bumps, as fans rewatched prior episodes, Netflix reported.Volume 2 of \"Stranger Things\" Season 5, which contains three episodes, arrives on Christmas, and the finale episode, which has a run time of a little over two hours, is set for New Year's Eve. The finale will be available for viewing in select theaters New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. In a break with tradition, Netflix will not be selling tickets for these screenings. Instead, more than 500 domestic cinemas will sell concession vouchers that will guarantee seating for the showings. These vouchers can be used toward purchases of food and beverages at the venues. Furthermore, theater owners will keep all revenue from these purchases.Netflix and exhibitors have tangled in the past over release terms, as the streamer does not commit to a prolonged run in theaters for movies that it wants to be eligible for awards contention. \"Nothing would make us happier than to play Netflix theatrical movies in our theaters,\" AMC's CEO Adam Aron said in a statement earlier this month. \"We think that could be beneficial for all involved. But as we need to treat our existing studio partners fairly, there is much that still needs to be sorted out to that end. Even so, there is progress.\"Turning culture upside down\"Stranger Things\" has brought about a renaissance of the 1980s, reviving fashion trends, music and even discontinued food brands for a new generation.When the series debuted, Netflix partnered with consumer brands to create T-shirts, mugs, plush toys and the like, but it was predominantly working with licensees. This means it was collecting fees for other companies to design and make the products, or participating in brand partnerships where no fees were exchanged.In 2019, the company launched its own consumer products division and two years later its own officially licensed online shop.Coinciding with the launch of the final season of \"Stranger Things,\" Netflix announced dozens of partnerships and collaborations with brands across the merchandise, retail and restaurant spectrum. The streamer has tapped Lego, Funko, Squishmallows, Hasbro, Jazwares and Care Bears to bring \"Stranger Things\" toys and collectibles to fans of the series. It has apparel and lifestyle deals with Gap, Nike, Crocs, CoverGirl, Zara and Wrangler, among others, and food and beverage collaborations with the likes of Eggo, Doritos, Kellogg, Gatorade and Starbucks.Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the first season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\"Courtesy: Netflix\"We are incredibly excited to partner with so many fantastic brands, offering fans — and fellow nerds — the largest collection of products and experiences in 'Stranger Things' history and one of our biggest campaigns yet as we celebrate the fifth and final season of this globally beloved series,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, in a statement earlier this month.Outside the retail space, Netflix has delved into the live event space, bringing \"Stranger Things\" to life through an immersive experience that enables fans to explore Hawkins Lab and other iconic locations from the series. It's currently running in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and will open in Mexico City next month. There is also a play called \"Stranger Things: The First Shadow,\" which has been running in the West End in London since 2023 and in New York since this spring.In addition, Netflix has a deal with Epic Games that has brought \"Stranger Things\" items to the popular online video game Fortnite. Netflix's merchandise and live events strategy is more than a way for the company to generate revenue outside of its streaming subscriptions. It helps keep fans engaged with its content during show hiatuses and in between movie sequels, industry experts said.The cast of Netflix's \"Stranger Things\" Season 5.Courtesy: NetflixThis playbook is not unique to Netflix, but it showcases the maturation of the streaming service. \"Strangers Things\" is less of a blueprint that can be adopted by every Netflix show or film, but rather a gold standard for what is possible.\"[Netflix] had a few good shows early on ('Orange is the New Black' and 'House of Cards'), but it took a couple of years of whiffs before they came up with 'Stranger Things,'\" Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush, told CNBC via email. \"They have had a ton of success since, with shows like 'Squid Game' and 'Bridgerton,' but it was questionable if they could settle on a formula for coming up with original IP.\"'Stranger Things' has remained a solid IP throughout, and has driven a lot of recognition,\" he added.",

    "body": "19 November 2025, China, Shanghai: Boats sail past downtown Shanghai on the Huangpu River. The tallest building on the skyline is the Shanghai Tower (rear). Bernd von Jutrczenka | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesChina's economic slowdown deepened in November with consumption, investment and industrial output growth falling short of expectations, as authorities sought to curb supply while struggling to revive demand and arrest the property sector decline.  Retail sales rose 1.3% last month from a year earlier, sharply missing Reuters' median forecast for a 2.8% growth, and slowing from 2.9% rise in the prior month. Industrial production climbed 4.8% in November from a year ago, missing expectations for a 5% jump and marking its weakest growth since August 2024. Investment in fixed assets, which includes property, contracted 2.6% over the January through November period compared with a year earlier, sharper than the 2.3% drop estimated by economists. That decline deepened from the 1.7% in the January to October period, and was the sharpest slump seen since the pandemic outbreak in 2020, according to data from Wind Information going back to 1992. \"The contraction of fixed asset investment and the drop in property prices in recent months have been transmitted to the consumer sentiment,\" Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint asset management, said in a note following the data, expecting more supportive fiscal and monetary stimulus measures in the first quarter next year.   Investment in real estate dropped 15.9% in the first 11 months this year, steeper than the 10.3% drop seen in the January to October period, as the property slump drags on. In another sign that the sector downturn is still searching for a bottom, the declines in home prices across 70 major cities steepened in November. New home prices fell 1.2% in tier-1 cities including Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen while resale home prices dropped 5.8% from a year earlier.  Meanwhile, economists at Golman Sachs in a preview last week pointed to the falling auto sales as a major drag on overall retail sales, coupled with the \"negative distortion\" effect from the earlier-than-usual start of the Singles-Day online shopping festival that pulled forward demand from November to October.  Data from China Automobile Dealers Association showed auto retail sales by volume in November declined for the first time in three years, dropping 8.1% from a year earlier to 2.23 million cars, as many local governments paused the trade-in subsidies.  Several online shopping sites extended their promotional period in a bid to jolt consumer spending, running from the first half of October through to Nov. 11, making it the longest Singles' Day sales period ever. But still, sales performance disappointed as consumers tightened their purse strings, with gross merchandise volume growing just 12%, compared to 20% growth last year, according to data from Syntun.  Call for rebalancingChinese policymakers have pledged further policy support to drive domestic demand and boost consumption and investment for next year. The finance ministry said in a statement Saturday that it planned to issue ultra-long-term special government bonds next year to fund projects bolstering national security. The proceeds will also be directed toward equipment upgrades and consumer goods trade-in programs. The ministry also pledged to boost its budget for investment to ease the slump in fixed-asset investment in recent months. However analysts appeared to be less optimistic as Beijing has yet to put any meaningful stimulus measures on the table.  \"Even though we're seeing targeted policy support in place, it is hard to generate a meaningful pickup in consumption without clearer improvement in job prospects and wage growth,\" said Zavier Wong, market analyst at asset management firm eToro. Eswar Prasad, professor of economics at Cornell University and senior fellow at Brookings Institute, expressed concerns over the sustainability of China's economic growth. In an opinion piece published on Sunday, the economist urged structural reforms to rebalance the economy, including measures to support labour market, strengthen social safety net and bolster private enterprises.   \"The government clearly wants to rebalance growth and understands what's needed to bolster household consumption and raise productivity. Yet there is little sense of urgency and no clear timeline on concrete policy measures to accomplish these objectives,\" Prasad noted.  The urban unemployment rate in November came in at 5.1%, unchanged from the prior month. Youth unemployment has been more concerning, with the latest reading for October standing at 17.3%.    Still, China's economy appears to be on track to meet the official growth target of \"around 5%,\" thanks to a surge in exports to non-U.S. markets even as tariff tensions with Washington have weighed on shipments to the world's largest consumer market.China's trade surplus surged to a record $1.1 trillion in November, breaking its full-year record of $992.2 billion in 2024, in just 11 months, drawing widespread concerns over its reliance on foreign demand and depreciation of its currency to keep exports competitive. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva last week called on China to \"accelerate\" support for domestic consumption and shift away from relying on exports for growth. Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, cautioned that appreciating renminbi, or yuan, to reduce trade surplus was unlikely to be sustainable without meaningful steps to end deflation in the economy.The trade-weighted renminbi's value against a basket of currencies, rather than solely against the U.S. dollar, has appreciated by 3% from 2021 to 2025, a period when China's exports surged by 44.8%, according to Lu's estimates. \"If there is a slowdown in growth and worsening deflation, markets may again take a bearish view on RMB, leading to depreciation against USD and its basket,\" Lu noted.The offshore yuan has strengthened over 3% this year to 7.0496 per dollar on Monday, its strongest level since October last year, according to LSEG data.       \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersIn at least one corner of the artificial intelligence market, sentiment has turned decidedly negative. Broadcom, CoreWeave and Oracle, three companies intimately tied to the AI infrastructure buildout, all had another rough day on Wall Street on Monday after selling off sharply last week. While the three stocks are all still solidly up for the year — CoreWeave held its market debut in March — the most recent trend suggests that investors are concerned about whether the returns on investment will ever justify the level of spending taking place. \"It definitely requires the ROI to be there to keep funding this AI investment,\" Matt Witheiler, head of late-stage growth at Wellington Management, told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" on Monday. \"From what we've seen so far that ROI is there.\"Witheiler said the bullish side of the story is that, \"every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute I can make more revenue.\"Still, the market was displeased last week with quarterly earnings reports from chipmaker Broadcom and cloud infrastructure supplier Oracle, even though both companies beat on revenue and issued forecasts showing that AI demand is soaring.watch nowOracle, which is now heavily reliant on the debt markets to fund its data center development, provided scant details about how it will continue to finance its commitments. The company said it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia.It's also ratcheting up leases. As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years. That's up 148% from the end of August.Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said he expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, driven by both custom chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.However, as the company spends heavily on more parts to produce server racks, investors are going to have to stomach a hit to profits. CFO Kirsten Spears said on Broadcom's earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of the company's AI chip systems.Broadcom shares fell about 5% on Monday following an 11% slump on Friday, leaving them 17% below their record high reached on Wednesday.Oracle dropped about 2.5% on Monday and is now down 17% in the past three trading days. The company has lost 46% of its value since Sept. 10, when the stock had its best day since 1992 following disclosure of a massive AI backlog.  Venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz, who focuses on enterprise software and AI, wrote in a Monday blog that Oracle's recent fundraising binge has left it with a debt-to-equity ratio of 500%, \"dwarfing its cloud computing peers.\" Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google all have ratios between 7% and 23%, he wrote. Tunguz, founder of Theory Ventures, said the other company with a notably high ratio, at 120%, is CoreWeave, which provides cloud computing services built largely around Nvidia's graphics processing units. CoreWeave shares fell about 6% on Monday after dropping 11% last week. The company has lost 60% of its value from its high in June. WATCH: Oracle financing in questionwatch now",

    "body": "Jimmy Lai, founder of Next Digital Ltd., exits a Correctional Services Department vehicle as he arrives at the Court of Final Appeal for the verdict of his bail hearing in Hong Kong, China, on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. Prosecutors in Hong Kong charged Lai, a prominent critic of Beijing and local authorities, last year under the national security law imposed by Beijing, saying he had colluded with foreigners by calling for sanctions against China. Photographer: Chan Long Hei/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesHong Kong pro-democracy activist and media baron Jimmy Lai on Monday was found guilty of sedition and collusion with foreign countries by a Hong Kong court.The 78-year-old was charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law, enacted by Beijing in 2020 after pro-democracy protests swept the region in 2019. The court said Lai was guilty of a \"conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country or with external elements to endanger national security.\" It also said that Lai and his tabloid Apple Daily, requested a foreign country or entity outside of China \"to impose sanctions or blockade, or engage in other hostile activities\" against Hong Kong or China. The court, in its 850-page judgement, said that the businessman \"harbored his resentment and hatred of the PRC [People's Republic of China] for many of his adult years.\"  Lai, one of the CCP's most vocal critics, had pleaded not guilty to two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials. He has been under arrest since 2020, with his trial starting in December 2023. Lai's sentencing is expected to be on Jan. 12.Speaking just after the judgment, Andrew Collier, senior fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, said the verdict was \"not very good\" from a foreign investor perspective, adding \"people want an independent court system that's going to protect the rights of citizens and the financial community.\"He said the verdict on Lai was expected, but the question for Hong Kong is around investor confidence. While the city has seen a growing number of IPOs in 2025, \"if investors are not comfortable with the court system, with cases like Jimmy Lai's, that's not good for the future of Hong Kong,\" Collier said. Lai, who founded Asian clothing brand Giordano, newspaper Apple Daily and digital media company Next Digital, was brought up by U.S. President Donald Trump during his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea back in October. Trump pressed Xi to release Lai during the meeting, according to Reuters. The court said that Lai's \"only intent\" was to seek the downfall of the Chinese Communist Party, adding \"even though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people of the PRC and the HKSAR [Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China]. This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications.\" Speaking to CNBC before the verdict, veteran investor David Roche suggested that a lenient approach could be good for Hong Kong's business climate. \"That, I think, would help to give the overriding impression and therefore conviction to people in the money business that Hong Kong had returned to its normal, business driven, dynamic self.\" Lai acquired British citizenship before Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. The trial verdict is the latest development in Hong Kong's political scene, which has seen the erosion of democratic opposition in one of Asia's financial hubs since the enactment of the national security law. Under changes to Hong Kong's electoral system in 2021, the number of directly elected members in the city's legislature was drastically slashed, with only \"patriots\" reviewed by an election committee allowed to stand for elections.  Monday's verdict comes on the heels of the dissolution of Hong Kong's last pro-democracy party on Sunday after 31 years, as well as a \"patriots-only\" legislative election that saw the second lowest turnout in the region's history. In a response to CNBC, Kenneth Roth, visiting professor at Princeton's School of Public and International Affairs and a former director at Human Rights Watch, said that the decision \"underscores the utter demise of the political freedoms that had once made the city so great.\"",

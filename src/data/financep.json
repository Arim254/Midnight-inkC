    "body": "Vehicles bound for shipment parked in front of the Dream Angel vehicles carrier ship at the Nagoya Port in Nagoya, Japan, on Tuesday, June 18, 2024.Fred Mery | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's exports growth in the final month of 2025 missed analysts' estimates, rising 5.1% year on year, as shipments to the U.S. saw a double-digit decline. Reuters-polled analysts had estimated exports growth would remain unchanged from November at 6.1%.  Japanese exports fell during the middle of 2025, hit by U.S. tariff worries, but saw a rebound toward the end of the year after a trade deal with the U.S. was announced that saw duties slashed to 15%. Exports to the U.S. in December, however, resumed their decline, dropping 11.1%, after an 8.8% jump in the prior month. The gain in November was the first time exports to the U.S. rose since March.Shipments to mainland China, Japan's largest trading partner, climbed 5.6%, while exports to Hong Kong surged 31.1% compared to the same period last year. Exports to the wider Asia region gained 10.2%.Imports in December rose 5.1% year on year, jumping sharply from the 1.3% rise seen in November, and beating Reuters estimates of a 3.6% rise.For full-year 2025, Japan's exports rose 3.1%, a softer rise compared to the 6.2% increase seen in 2024, as shipments to mainland China and the U.S. — Tokyo's top two trading partners — fell 0.4% and 4.1% respectively. Exports to Hong Kong and Taiwan climbed 17.8% and 15.1% for the whole year, partially offsetting declines in the U.S. and China. The rise in overall exports in 2025 was partly due to front-loading of U.S. shipments ahead of tariff hikes, an artificial intelligence boom that's boosted electronics and machinery shipments, and a weak yen, said Stefan Angrick, head of Japan at Moody's Analytics.  \"Although shipments are holding up for now, the outlook is fraught with risks,\" he warned, pointing out that higher U.S. import levies and fierce competition from abroad are weighing on industrial production and export volumes.Trade threats from China are an added concern, Angrick added. Relations between Tokyo and Beijing have chilled since November after comments from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan could intervene militarily if China attempted to seize Taiwan by force.China had suspended imports of seafood from Japan, and early this year, announcing restrictions on the export of dual-use goods to Japan.The trade data comes at a time when Japan is bracing for snap elections on Feb. 8 called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with its Lower House set to be dissolved Friday.  A victory for Takaichi will allow her to push her fiscal agenda through Japan's parliament with little opposition, analysts have said. It could also involve keeping the yen weak, as it supports Japan's exports.Since the announcement of the elections, Japanese markets have been fueled by the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" that has seen stocks mostly rise, and the yen stay weak.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday he is nearing the end of a search to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and hinted he has his candidate in mind.In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the president said a search that began in September and once included as many as 11 candidates is nearly over.\"I'd say we're down to three, but we're down to two. And I probably can tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,\" the president said to CNBC's Joe Kernen. Still, Trump declined to name the one.The candidate list included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investors.The finalists had been widely believed to be Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett and BlackRock fixed income head Rick Rieder. Trump in the interview said Rieder, the last to interview, is \"impressive\" and praised all the candidates.In recent days, Trump said he preferred Hassett stay at the NEC, likely eliminating him from contention. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent led the interview process. Trump in the past has expressed support for Bessent to take the Fed job, but said Wednesday, \"Scott only wants to stay where he is.\"The statement on the Fed chair is the latest in a series of dramatic twists and turns in the saga following a year of unprecedented tumult for the central bank. Though Trump criticized Powell and his colleagues heavily during his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, he ramped up the pressure considerably in 2025. That included more verbal assaults on policymakers as well as threats to fire Powell and an actual attempt to sack Governor Lisa Cook, a move that was the subject of a Supreme Court hearing earlier Wednesday on presidential authority over the institution.With Powell's removal as chair a near certainty, the next question turns to whether he'll stay on another two years to serve out his remaining term as governor. Staying on would give Powell a continued say over monetary policy and interest rates and could act a bulwark against Trump's efforts to exert control over Fed decisions. Trump indicated some indifference as to what Powell decides.\"We live with the cards you're dealt,\" he said. \"If that happens, his life won't be very, very happy, I don't think, by doing it. I think he wants to get out. He has not done a good job.\"Trump again criticized Powell for the renovation project at Fed headquarters, the price of which has run north of $2.5 billion. The Justice Department has subpoenaed Powell relative to the project.\"I could have done it for $25 million and it would have been nicer than what they're doing,\" Trump said.",

    "body": "Warren Buffett, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.CNBCBerkshire Hathaway, with new CEO Greg Abel in charge, has taken a formal step toward unwinding a rare misstep by Warren Buffett.The conglomerate, which owns Geico insurance and BNSF Railway, registered its entire 27.5% stake in Kraft Heinz in a filing that clears the way for Berkshire to exit its position in the hot dog and macaroni-and-cheese maker. Berkshire is Kraft Heinz's largest shareholder.Shares of Kraft Heinz fell as much as 7.5% at one point in Wednesday trading following the news.The move underscores Abel's willingness to move on from a deal that has long stood out as a rare blemish on Buffett's otherwise storied record. Kraft Heinz shares have plunged about 70% since the 2015 merger that created the ketchup-making giant, weighed down by shifting consumer tastes, rising costs and sluggish growth across core brands. Some of the loss has been offset with billions of dollars in dividends over the years, but last year Berkshire still took a $3.8 billion write-down on the value of its holding. \"We ... view the timing of this sale as being reflective of Abel's desire to clean up and pare down the investment portfolio early in his tenure,\" Greggory Warren, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said in a note.The latest Berkshire filing also came as Kraft Heinz seeks to separate into two companies: one focused on sauces, spreads and shelf-stable meals and a second that includes North American staples like Oscar Mayer meats, Kraft cheese singles and Lunchables.Buffett himself has acknowledged his frustration with how the merger he orchestrated a decade ago ultimately unraveled.\"It certainly didn't turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don't think taking them apart will fix it,\" Buffett, who remains Berkshire's chairman, told CNBC last year.The registration statement gives Berkshire the flexibility to reduce the position, rather than signaling an imminent sale, according to Stifel.\"The registration provides Berkshire Hathaway the ability to reduce its ownership stake; we believe transaction notifications are not required outside of quarterly 13F filings,\" Stifel analysts wrote. \"The next update is likely to be in mid-May, when Berkshire reports its first fiscal quarter activity.\"Stifel reiterated a hold rating on Kraft Heinz and a $26 price target, citing softer U.S. consumption trends and slower growth in emerging markets that could delay any revenue growth, even as the company continues to generate strong cash flow.In 2015, Berkshire teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to merge Kraft Foods with H.J. Heinz. 3G Capital quietly exited its Kraft Heinz investment in 2023, after years of periodically trimming its stake as the combined company struggled.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during the 2025 IIF annual membership meeting in Washington, Oct. 16, 2025.Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, offering a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader of one of Trump's signature policies. Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, initially praised Trump's moves to secure the borders of the world's largest economy. Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to the lowest level in 50 years for the period from October 2024 to September 2025, the BBC reported citing federal data.But Dimon, who has long advocated for immigration reform to boost U.S. economic growth, also made an apparent reference to videos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers rounding up people alleged to be undocumented immigrants.\"I don't like what I'm seeing, five grown men beating up a little old lady,\" Dimon said. \"So I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.\"It's unclear if Dimon was speaking about a specific incident, or more broadly about ICE confrontations.In the first year of his second term, Trump has overhauled U.S. immigration policy with a focus on mass deportations, tightened asylum access and ramped-up spending for ICE personnel and facilities. Among a torrent of new policies that changed the landscape for seeking American citizenship, the administration also rescinded guidance on where ICE arrests could happen, leading to raids at schools, hospitals and places of worship.Unlike during Trump's first term, American CEOs have mostly avoided public criticism of his policies. Wall Street analysts have speculated that business leaders fear retribution from the Trump administration, which has sued media companies, universities and law firms, and instead choose to appeal to the president out of the public spotlight.On Wednesday, Dimon said that he wanted to know more about who is being swept up in ICE raids: \"Are they here legally? Are they criminals? ... Did they break American law?\"\"We need these people,\" Dimon added. \"They work in our hospitals and hotels and restaurants and agriculture, and they're good people .… They should be treated that way.\"'A climate of fear'For years, in annual shareholder letters and media interviews, Dimon has cited an immigration overhaul as one of the main avenues to unlock higher U.S. economic growth.The veteran CEO of JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market cap, has previously supported a merit-based system for green cards as well as citizenship for people brought to America as children, and pushed back on proposals to limit H-1B visas. On Wednesday, Dimon urged Trump to allow citizenship \"for hardworking people\" and \"proper asylum\" opportunities.\"\"I think he can, because he controlled the borders,\" Dimon said.Later in the wide-ranging interview, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told Dimon that she was surprised at how careful he and other CEOs were in speaking about Trump.\"You are one of the more outspoken business leaders,\" Beddoes said. \"I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical. There is a climate of fear in your country.\"Dimon pushed back, saying that he let his views be known about Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and stance towards European allies. \"I think they should change their approach to immigration,\" Dimon said. \"I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?\"watch now",

    "body": "INCHEON, SOUTH KOREA - MAY 22:  Shoppers look at goods at a Wal-Mart store May 22, 2006 in Incheon, South Korea. Chung Sung-jun | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's economic growth slowed in the final quarter of last year as a sharp slump in construction investment and a pullback in exports outweighed modest gains in consumption.The economy expanded 1.5% in the October to December period from a year earlier, according to the central bank's advance estimates, missing economists' forecast of 1.9%. That compared with 1.8% growth in the prior quarter, when the economy expanded at its fastest pace in over a year. On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product contracted 0.3%, marking the steepest slowdown since the fourth quarter of 2022. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% expansion. For the full year, South Korea's economy grew 1%, its slowest annual expansion since 2020, when output contracted 0.7% during the pandemic.Construction investment shrank 3.9% from the previous quarter as both building and civil engineering activity declined, according to data from the Bank of Korea. Facilities investment fell 1.8%, led by a drop in transportation equipment. Exports pulled back 2.1% from the previous quarter as motor vehicles and machinery shipments fell. Manufacturing and utilities supply, including electricity, gas and water, dropped 1.5% and 9.2%, respectively.  Meanwhile, private consumption expanded 0.3% on services expenditures while government spending rose 0.6%, driven by health care benefits. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, reached a trade agreement in November that included $150 billion in Korean investment in the U.S. shipbuilding sector and an additional $200 billion in investment pledges. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to reduce tariffs on South Korean cars and auto parts to 15% from 25%. The country's exports have largely held up last year despite heightened trade uncertainties. Its exports rose to a record $709.7 billion in 2025, up 3.8% from a year earlier, driven by semiconductor shipments, which jumped 22% amid surging demand for artificial intelligence chips.Tariff tensions continued to cloud the outlook for the export-oriented economy. Last week, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on certain imported AI chips as part of his push to encourage semiconductor production in the U.S.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers could face tariffs of up to 100% unless they commit to increased production in America.Lee on Wednesday downplayed the renewed threat of semiconductor tariffs, saying the costs would likely be passed on to American consumers. watch nowInflation has remained subdued, easing to 2.1% last year from 2.3% in 2024, broadly in line with the central bank's 2% target. The Bank of Korea last week kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5%, as policymakers prioritize financial stability amid a sharply weakening won and accelerating capital outflows. The won has faltered more than 6% against the dollar since July last year, hovering near 16-year lows, driven in part by Korean retail investors piling into U.S. equities. Market intervention efforts, including waiving the foreign-exchange stability levy for banks to boost the supply of U.S. dollars, have so far failed to halt the currency's decline. The won has lost nearly 2% against the greenback this year as of Thursday, making it one of Asia's worst-performing currencies.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance last week raised its 2026 GDP forecast, expecting the economic growth to accelerate to 2%, up from its August projection of 1.8%. ",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesFacebook and Instagram parent company Meta on Wednesday said it will begin to show advertising on its Threads microblogging service to all users globally starting next week. \"With ads on Threads, businesses can authentically join this conversation while finding new ways to connect with the people most interested in their business,\" the company wrote in a blog. Wall Street analysts expect Threads to become a significant revenue driver for Meta as the company monetizes the platform. The company is set to report its fourth quarter earnings results next week.Meta said the full launch will be \"gradual\" and potentially take a few months to roll out. The social media company first tested ads on Threads with users in the U.S. and Japan last January. Since its launch in July 2023, Threads has been a direct competitor to Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter. Meta's service has amassed more than 400 million active monthly users globally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in August.Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported that Threads had lured more daily mobile users worldwide than X, citing data from Similarweb.Meta said it plans to continue bringing new features to Threads. That includes new ad formats and third-party verification services that are already available on Facebook and Instagram. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Threads has more daily mobile users worldwide than X. A previous version misidentified the category of user in which Threads had surpassed X.watch nowRead more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule update",

    "body": "Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, takes part in a panel discussion on artificial intelligence at the Technical University Berlin, in Berlin, Germany, February 7, 2025. Axel Schmidt | ReutersOpenAI is in talks with sovereign wealth funds in the Middle East to try to secure investments for a new multibillion dollar funding round, CNBC confirmed on Wednesday. The round is expected to total around $50 billion, but the numbers could change and term sheets have not been signed, according to a source familiar with the discussions who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. Bloomberg was first to report the discussions. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is in the United Arab Emirates to participate in the investment talks, the person said. The round is expected to close in the first quarter of the year. OpenAI kickstarted the AI boom by launching its artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, and has since become one of the fastest growing commercial entities on the planet. The company has raised billions of dollars from investors as it's worked to scale and develop new models and roll out new features. Last year, OpenAI closed a $40 billion financing round led by SoftBank, the largest private tech funding on record. The round included participation from core investor Microsoft, as well as Coatue, Altimeter and Thrive.OpenAI also finalized a $6.6 billion share sale in October that boosted its valuation to $500 billion.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have \"formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland.\"Trump said that as a result of that negotiation, he would no longer impose punitive tariffs on a slew of European countries that were set to begin Feb. 1.In an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen minutes after posting the statement, Trump described the Greenland framework as the \"concept of a deal.\"Asked for more details about the proposal, Trump said, \"It's a little bit complex, but we'll explain it down the line.\"But he suggested that the framework involves mineral rights for the U.S., as well as the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.watch now\"They're going to be involved in the Golden Dome, and they're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we,\" Trump told Kernen.Asked to confirm that the tariffs were no longer coming next month, Trump said, \"No, we took that off because it looks like we have, pretty much the concept of a deal.\"Read Trump's entire announcement, which he posted on Truth Social:Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region. This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations — They will report directly to me. Thank you for your attention to this matter!Stocks shot up immediately after Trump posted the update.The announcement came after a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which some NATO members discussed a proposal to give the U.S. sovereignty over small pockets of Greenland's land, The New York Times reported, citing three senior officials familiar with the discussion.Other details about the framework agreement were unclear. Asked for additional information, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly echoed Trump's assurance that more details will \"continue to be unveiled as discussions continue.\"Despite its lack of clarity, the announcement marks a stunning twist in the ongoing controversy over Trump's persistent efforts to acquire Greenland for the U.S.The Trump administration in recent weeks has floated buying the island or even utilizing the U.S. military to take control of it, even though it is a territory of Denmark, a NATO ally.Danish and Greenlandic officials have rebuffed the U.S., reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. As tensions ratcheted up, a slew of European NATO nations increased their military presences in the territory. Over the weekend, Trump responded by threatening to hit those countries with new tariffs starting at 10% next month and increasing to 25% in June.During a speech at Davos earlier Wednesday, Trump laid out his case for the U.S. to obtain Greenland on national-security grounds.His remarks, including his call for \"immediate negotiations\" with Denmark, unnerved some in the audience.But Trump also said he would not use military force in pursuit of the territory, in an apparent shift from his prior stance.Stocks, which had plummeted a day earlier amid Trump's increasing aggression toward Greenland, immediately rebounded.Later Wednesday, Trump — who recently said that anything less than full ownership of Greenland was \"unacceptable\" to him — declined to say if the new framework involved the U.S. acquiring the island.\"It's a long-term deal,\" Trump told CNN after a pause. \"It's the ultimate long-term deal. And I think it puts everybody in a really good position.\"Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in an X post, \"The day is ending on a better note than it began.\"He urged parties to \"sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines\" laid down by Denmark.Some European leaders cautioned against celebrating prematurely, however.\"It's good that they are engaged in dialogue,\" Germany's Finance Minister Lars ⁠Klingbeil told his country's ZDF television after Trump's meeting with Rutte.\"But we have to wait a bit and not get our ‍hopes up too soon,\" Klingbeil said.",

    "body": "watch nowFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's job seemed safe from firing by President Donald Trump after Supreme Court justices skeptically questioned the Trump administration's lawyers on Wednesday about the grounds for Cook's would-be termination and its effect on the Fed's historical independence.Justice Brett Kavanaugh warned Solicitor General D. John Sauer about the effects of his argument that Trump could fire Cook or other Fed governors \"for cause\" — but without judicial review of whether that purported cause of alleged mortgage fraud was legitimate. \"Your position that there's no judicial review, no process required, no remedy available, very low bar for cause — that the president alone determines — and that would weaken, if not shatter, the independence of the Federal Reserve,\" said Kavanaugh, one of the court's six conservatives.Cook, who was in the courtroom Wednesday, sued Trump in September, challenging the president's claimed power to summarily remove her for uncharged allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.\"The real question is to what extent we believe the public is harmed to allow Ms. Cook to remain in post during the pendency of this case?\" asked Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, referring to Cook's lawsuit, which remains pending in a federal district court. Jackson is one of the court's three liberal members.Sauer replied, \"We assert grievous, irreparable injury to the public perception of the Federal Reserve of allowing [Cook] to stay in office.\"Jackson asked, \"Do you have evidence other than the president's view?\"Another conservative justice, Samuel Alito, expressed skepticism about how quickly Cook had been fired by Trump after an allegation against Cook was publicly made by one of his appointees\"Is there any reason why this whole matter had to be handled by everybody, by the executive branch, by the district court, by the DC Circuit [Court of Appeals] in such a hurried manner?\" Alito asked.\"When this was before the executive branch, it was handled in a very cursory manner,\" said Alito, who normally sides with the Trump administration on key legal issues.Paul Clement, who represented Cook at the hearing, leaned in during his arguments on words that the Supreme Court in an opinion last year used to describe the Fed as distinct from other federal agencies whose officials might be removed by a president.The court had called the Fed a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.\"\"There's no rational reason to go through all the trouble of creating this unique, quasi-private entity that is exempt from everything from the appropriations process to the civil service laws, just to give it a removal restriction that is as toothless as the president imagines,\" Clement said.\"But if that removal restriction has real, substantive, and procedural bite, then this emergency application should be denied,\" Clement said, referring to the Trump administration's request that the Supreme Court allow Cook to be removed for now.At stake is not only the fate of Cook — who denies any wrongdoing — but potentially the Fed's future independence to set monetary policy without the risk of a president being able to easily remove a governor who fails to do their bidding on that issue.Underscoring those stakes is the recent disclosure by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that he is the subject of a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., in connection with his oversight of a multibillion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters there.Powell, who attended the arguments, has said the real reason for that probe is the Fed holding interest rates steady for much of last year to Trump's ire.Cook was one of the Fed governors who backed Powell in maintaining those rates.\"This case is about whether the Federal Reserve will set key interest rates guided by evidence and independent judgment or will succumb to political pressure,\" Cook said in a statement after the hearing.\"Research and experience show that Federal Reserve independence is essential to fulfilling the congressional mandate of price stability and maximum employment,\" she said. \"That is why Congress chose to insulate the Federal Reserve from political threats, while holding it accountable for delivering on that mandate.\"Lisa Cook, governor of the US Federal Reserve, and U.S. President Donald Trump.Ting Shen | Bloomberg | Getty Images | Jonathan Ernst | ReutersWhen Trump moved to fire Cook in late August — the first time a president had ever attempted such a move — there was immediate speculation it was due to her refusal to agree to cut interest rates as Trump wanted.If Cook and Powell were to be removed from the Fed's seven-member board, Trump would be in a position to appoint a majority of that board — and, theoretically at the least, have more influence over interest rate decisions.Trump did not cite Cook's stance on interest rates when he said he was firing her.Instead, the president cited allegations made by Federal Housing Finance Director Bill Pulte that she had made false statements in applying for home mortgages, which predated her appointment to the Fed by then-President Joe Biden in 2022 to fill an unexpired board term. Cook, the first Black woman to serve on the Fed board, was reappointed by Biden in 2023 to serve a full 14-year term.Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, only the president can terminate a Fed board member, and a governor like Cook can only be terminated \"for cause.\"The law does not detail what would constitute \"cause,\" but cause has historically been understood to mean malfeasance or dereliction of duty.After Cook sued Trump to block her removal from the Fed, a federal district court judge in Washington ruled that she could remain with the central bank pending the outcome of her lawsuit.Judge Jia Cobb, in that ruling, wrote that \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"Cobb said that \"best reading\" of that provision is that the alleged cause for removal relates to a governor's actions while \"in office.\"The allegations against Cook relate to actions she took before joining the Fed.The Department of Justice appealed Cobb's ruling, but was unsuccessful. The DOJ then asked the Supreme Court to take the case.In a filing, the DOJ said that the \"determination of cause\" for termination is subject to \"the unreviewable discretion of the President.\"\"In any case, the President has identified sufficient cause here,\" the filing says.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probe\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" the filing says\"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself—and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentation,\" the filing said.A general view of U.S. Supreme Court as justices could issue at least one ruling in several major cases pending including a decision on the legality of President Donald Trump's sweeping global tariffs, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 20, 2026.  Nathan Howard | ReutersAll three former living Fed chairs — Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen — signed on to a legal brief with the Supreme Court arguing against Cook's removal, along with a group of former Treasury secretaries, chairs of the White House Council of Economic Advisers and others. Bernanke was at Wednesday's hearing.The brief says that Congress \"intentionally\" designed the Fed \"as a uniquely independent entity, largely insulated from political pressures that could otherwise prioritize short-term economic gain over long-term stability and growth.\"\"Granting the government's request to remove Governor Cook from the Board immediately would upset these longstanding protections and the essential functions they serve,\" the brief says. \"Doing so would expose the Federal Reserve to political influences, thereby eroding public confidence in the Fed's independence and jeopardizing the credibility and efficacy of U.S. monetary policy.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump's tariff threats once again rattled the stock market this week, and CNBC's Jim Cramer said that may be exactly when investors should strike.\"There are huge stock market ramifications to almost everything things president does, and I think he knows it,\" Cramer said Wednesday night on \"Mad Money.\" But Cramer said there's a key difference now compared with Trump's first term in the Oval Office from 2017 to 2021. \"Trump [in his second term] is far more comfortable taking the market down, not up,\" Cramer said. \"Just be ready. You should get plenty of good buying opportunities over the next three years.\" Investors learned last year that Wall Street moves sharply in response to Trump's policies — whether they are merely threatened or actually implemented. \"From trade policy, to tax policy, to capital return policy or military policy, the ramifications to the stock market are more important than anything other than the direction of interest rates,\" Cramer said. That was evident Wednesday when stocks snapped back after Trump ruled out military action to acquire Greenland and then, later in the session, said he reached a deal \"framework\" on Greenland with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. All three major U.S. indexes — the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average — popped more than 1% on Wednesday. The rebound halted the \"sell America\" trade that dominated Tuesday's session, when markets sank on concerns over Trump threatening a new round of tariffs on European nations. However, alongside Wednesday's deal framework, Trump called off the European tariffs that he had pledged to implement next month. Cramer said investors have seen this movie before – and the ending tends to be the same.\"I remember when he called the bottom after the Liberation Day fracas literally posting on Truth Social that it was time to buy stocks,\" Cramer said, referencing to Trump's social-media post on April 9, shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street. Hours later, Trump walked back many of the steeper-than-expected tariffs that he had rolled out a week earlier, which had sparked a dramatic sell-off stocks and prompted retaliatory tariffs from countries such as China. \"It turned out to be an amazing buying opportunity,\" Cramer said Wednesday. Indeed, the market rebound solidified in late April and into May as progress on trade deals eased uncertainty. Stocks had fully recouped their early April losses by mid-May. Cramer's takeaway to investors is while expecting more volatility ahead, stay prepared to pick up quality stocks at discounts.\"He's giving you so many buying opportunities in this game of international and domestic chicken since he took over that all you got to do is wait for the hot ones and then do some buying,\" Cramer said. watch now",

Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStagnant mortgage rates, falling housing supply and ongoing economic uncertainty weighed heavily on homebuyers in December. Pending home sales, a measure of signed contracts on existing homes, dropped 9.3% last month from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts were expecting a slight gain. Sales were 3% lower than December 2024.\"The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"After several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.\"Sales fell month to month in all regions of U.S. and were higher annually only in the South. Homes also stayed on the market longer in December, at an average of 39 days compared with 35 days in December 2024.Mortgage rates in December, when these deals were inked, barely moved at all. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan sat around 6.25%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is slightly lower than it was over the summer, but consumers were also facing a market with fewer homes available for sale.

Inventory was up 12% from a year ago, but that is off an extremely low level. \"Consumers prefer seeing abundant inventory before making the major decision of purchasing a home. So, the decline in pending home sales could be a result of dampened consumer enthusiasm about buying a home when there are so few options listed for sale,\" Yun added. ",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on Nov. 6, 2025.Chandan Khanna | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday advocated for a test of President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates in two U.S. states: Vermont and Massachusetts.Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, addressed a question about Trump's order for banks to voluntarily limit their interest rates for a year. The president had called for the lower rates to take effect Tuesday.Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified as defying Trump's proposal.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said Wednesday. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said. In earnings conference calls last week and behind the scenes, banks have pushed back against Trump's order this month to voluntarily forgo billions of dollars in revenue.Their main argument, that price controls will result in lenders canceling accounts for many card customers, has resonated with several Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Most banking analysts believe that Trump would need legislation to enact a nationwide cap on card rates.'A great idea'Dimon then said he had a \"great idea\" to help quell disagreement over the proposed card cap, suggesting that the U.S. government impose the pricing controls on Americans in just two states.Vermont and Massachusetts are the home states of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, respectively, both of whom support a bill capping card rates at 10% for five years. Dimon didn't mention the lawmakers by name Wednesday.The U.S. government \"should force all the banks to do it in two states, Vermont and Massachusetts, and see what happens,\" Dimon said, drawing laughter from the audience.Dimon said \"the left\" and people who argue for price controls \"will learn a real lesson, and the people crying the most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said.\"It'll be the restaurants, the retailers, the travel companies, the schools, the municipalities, because people miss their water payments,\" he said. \"It would be something else to watch.\"The office of Sanders didn't immediately return calls for comment.Warren had a response which read, in part: \"It's January 21, and unsurprisingly, there is no self-imposed interest rate cap on credit cards by the big banks,\" Warren said. \"But Jamie Dimon and the world's richest people did fly their private jets to a ski resort in Switzerland to complain about how bipartisan action to cap credit card interest rates would destroy life as we know it... It's time to pass a law and get this done.\"Dimon added that JPMorgan was planning on giving the Trump administration its analysis on what would happen under a national credit card rate cap.\"I think it's wrong for the government to get involved extensively in pricing of stuff, but I got to deal with the world I got,\" Dimon said.— CNBC's Stephanie Dhue contributed to this story.watch now",

    "body": "Artificial intelligence startups OpenAI and Anthropic have their sights set on enterprise customers this year as they race to win more revenue, users and market share. In separate interviews with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar highlighted enterprise as a key revenue driver for their businesses. Enterprise customers account for roughly 40% of OpenAI's business as of January, but Friar said she expects that figure to grow to closer to 50% by the end of the year. OpenAI announced in November that more than 1 million business customers around the world are using the company's technology.  OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit AI lab in 2015, and its valuation has swelled to $500 billion since the launch of its ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. \"We're an incredibly strong business today,\" Friar said Wednesday. \"As we look forward, for us, it's eyes on the prize of, 'How do we add value to the consumer? How do we add value to enterprises? And how do we close this capability gap?' You're going to hear us talk about this over and over again.\"Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateAmodei said that while Anthropic offers consumer products, they are not the company's major focus. He attributed roughly 80% of Anthropic's business to enterprises and 20% to consumers, adding that the startup has embraced enterprises in part because they are a relatively predictable and stable source of income. \"Since the beginning, Anthropic has thought in terms of safety and reliability of AI systems, and one of the things we realized is that that was very synergistic with working with enterprises as compared to consumers,\" Amodei said.As of September, Anthropic had amassed more than 300,000 business customers, up from less than 1,000 two years prior. Anthropic was founded by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers in 2021, and its valuation has since climbed to $350 billion.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday urged U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation to limit credit card rates to 10%, following his social media post this month ordering banks to voluntarily lower their rates.\"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year, and this will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" Trump said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"They charge Americans interest rates of 28%, 30%, 31%, 32%,\" Trump said. \"Whatever happened to usury?\"Shares of banks climbed after the comments. The KBW Bank Index rose 2.2% in morning trading. Capital One, which relies on cards for most of its revenue, advanced 1.9%.Among the options that the Trump administration had for applying pressure to American banks over card rates, the legislative path may be the least threatening to the industry. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced a bill last year that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years, but that proposal has stalled in Congress.Analysts including Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW have said it is unlikely that a card bill will have enough bipartisan support to become law. Lawmakers from Trump's own Republican Party, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have expressed caution when it comes to card price controls. \"If this is the path, the odds of implementation are low,\" Sakhrani said in an interview. \"There is a lot of Republican leadership that opposes the idea\" and other industries, including airlines and retailers, would be hurt by the policy.It's unclear whether pressure from Trump — who holds massive sway among GOP lawmakers — will improve the plan's chances of passing.Breaking 'the law?'The episode may show the limits of Trump's ability to cajole the financial industry into voluntarily giving up billions of dollars in revenue to support his election year affordability push.After Trump's Jan. 9 Truth Social post on the rate cap, banks said on earnings conference calls that such a limit would have unintended consequences, including that lenders would simply cancel accounts for many card customers, especially those with lower credit scores.The president told reporters that lenders who didn't comply on rates will be \"in violation of the law,\" but behind closed doors, bankers countered that they were already compliant with the law. Privately, bankers and their lobbyists told CNBC they hoped to fend off the president's request, given the difficulty of passing legislation. Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified. KBW's Sakhrani said he wasn't aware of any major card player that cut its rates.On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told a Davos audience that the U.S. government should test out the rate cap in just two states, Vermont and Massachusetts. Those are the home states of Sanders and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have both championed interest rate caps.Doing so would teach \"a real lesson\" to those in favor of price controls, Dimon said.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said.watch now",

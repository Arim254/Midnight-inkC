How old should they be when they get their first phone or tablet? What parental controls, if any, should you use?</p><p>No matter what you decide, you need to follow one \"imperative\" rule to help your kids grow up to be happy, successful adults, says psychologist Jean Twenge: \"No electronic devices in the bedroom overnight.\"</p><p>\"That's just a situation where there's, kind of, no argument: 'You do not need that phone in your bedroom when you are supposed to be sleeping. Period. End of story. Mic drop. We're done,'\" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, \"<a href=\"https://www.jeantwenge.com/10-rules-for-raising-kids-in-a-high-tech-world/\" target=\"_blank\">10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World</a>,\" published on September 2.</p><p>Twenge has spent much of the past decade <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/05/smartphones-ruining-mental-health-teens.html\">warning parents</a> about the risks of giving young adolescents unlimited access to smartphones and social media. She's cited <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/25-09-2024-teens--screens-and-mental-health\" target=\"_blank\">research</a> connecting their usage to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, including anxiety and depression.</p><p>Some other parenting and medical experts <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/jonathan-haidts-advice-for-planning-a-screen-free-afternoon-for-kids.html\">have issued similar warnings</a>: In 2023, then-U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/23/us-surgeon-general-we-must-protect-kids-from-social-media-risks-now.html\">issued an advisory</a> warning that the risks of social media and connected devices have helped create \"a national youth mental health crisis,\" for example.</p><p>In her book, Twenge advocates for parents to wait as long as possible before handing over smartphones to their kids, or allowing them on social media platforms. She recommends keeping kids from joining social media until they're 16 or older, and from having full access to their own smartphone until they have a driver's license and are expected to \"get around independently.\"</p><p>But banning devices from kids' rooms overnight is her No. 1 rule because of its potential to improve their sleep habits, she says. Doing so is \"absolutely crucial for both physical and mental health,\" she notes in her book.</p><p>\"If you have the bandwidth to fully follow only one rule in this book, make it this one,\" writes Twenge. \"No devices in the bedroom overnight is very straightforward and costs nothing.\"</p></div><h2><a></a>'Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor'</h2><div><p>Devices in bedrooms can easily cut into sleeping time, whether your teen puts off shutting their eyes to continue scrolling through social media or the sounds of notifications keep waking them up, <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/press-releases/teens-are-bombarded-with-hundreds-of-notifications-a-day\" target=\"_blank\">research shows</a>.</p><p>More than two-thirds of adolescents surveyed <a href=\"https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2023-cs-smartphone-research-report_final-for-web.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">by Common Sense Media in</a> 2023 reported missing out on sleep \"sometimes\" or \"often\" due to using phones or other devices late at night in their bedrooms. Overall, 77% of teens get an insufficient amount of sleep, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/data-research/facts-stats/high-school-students-sleep-facts-and-stats.html\" target=\"_blank\">according to data</a> from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>\"Not getting enough sleep is a risk factor for just about everything we'd like our kids to avoid, from getting sick to feeling depressed,\" Twenge writes in her book.</p><p>Looking at screens in bed <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/03/nobel-prize-winner-sleep-research-dont-take-your-phone-to-bed.html\">is connected to higher rates</a> of mental and physical health issues for adults, too. But healthy sleeping habits are even more important for kids, because their brains are still developing. Sleep can help enable their <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9685105/\" target=\"_blank\">cognitive development and mental health</a>, including their ability to learn and regulate their emotions — <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/13/the-no-1-strategy-for-raising-mentally-strong-kids-psychotherapist.html\">traits they'll need</a> to develop to grow up and become happy, healthy and successful adults.</p><p>\"If you can only do one thing, [this rule] might end up making the biggest difference,\" says Twenge.</p></div><h2><a></a>Be honest, but firm</h2><div><p>Any of Twenge's rules will likely be met with resistance from kids, especially teenagers who already regularly use their smartphones and other devices at all times of day, she says. You can more easily implement and enforce these types of policies by communicating them to your kids at an early age, she advises.</p><p>Twenge recommends having conversations about the dangers of smartphones — and the need for strict rules around their use — as soon as elementary school. \"Kids are getting these devices younger and younger\" and your child might have friends who are already using connected devices at that age, she says.</p><p>Parents of older kids can also backtrack and put new, stricter rules in place. That's what Twenge did with her own three teenage daughters, after initially allowing them to use their laptops overnight, she says. Retroactively establishing strict rules isn't easy, she adds: \"The first few days might be tough, and you might get some slammed doors.\"</p><p>Her advice is to be transparent, but firm, about your decision process. \"You should be honest with your kid [and say], 'Look, I made a mistake. I now know more, I've learned more, and we're going to do it differently going forward,'\" says Twenge.</p><p><em><strong>Want to be your own boss?</strong> Sign up for CNBC's new online course, </em><a href=\"https://smarter.cnbcmakeit.com/p/how-to-start-a-business-for-first-time-founders?utm_source=cnbc&utm_medium=makeitarticle&utm_campaign=bottom\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How To Start A Business: For First-Time Founders</em></a><em>.

His monthly income stems from several sources, including VA disability, the GI Bill since he's pursuing a master's degree, and teaching English. Ryan also occasionally takes on odd jobs, such as voiceover work, and is an avid fan of day trading.</p><p>Ryan suffers from spine arthritis, respiratory issues, auditory pain, and mental health challenges from his time in the military.</p><p>\"This might not sound like a lot in America but trust me, this is more than enough to be middle or even above middle class in Vietnam,\" he says.</p><p>When Ryan first arrived, he worked with a longtime friend and realtor to find his first apartment. He moved around a lot at first because of all the noise pollution. He also wanted to take advantage of low rent prices during the covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>\"There's a lot of honking, street sellers and sometimes karaoke really loudly, so if you are very intolerant to noise, this might not be the place for you,\" he says.</p></div><div><p>Ryan says he has no plans of leaving this apartment.</p><p>Louis Corallo for CNBC Make It</p></div><div><p>In 2023, Ryan moved into the two-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment where he currently resides in Ho Chi Minh City.

In America, I felt very unmotivated. I felt like no matter how hard you work, you're still in poverty. You're constantly chasing a standard that you can't really achieve,\" he says.</p><p>\"Here in Vietnam, it takes a lot of the monetary pressure out of your day-to-day.

Kitamura | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>Having won the presidency of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Sanae Takaichi is on the verge of becoming the country's first female prime minister.</p><p>Takaichi, a hardline conservative and close ally of the late Shinzo Abe, said Saturday that she would \"<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japans-ruling-party-pick-new-leader-hoping-revive-fortunes-2025-10-03/\" target=\"_blank\">work, work, work</a>\" to turn \"people's anxieties about their daily lives and the future into hope.\"</p><p>Her rise comes at a time of economic strain at home and tense relations abroad — and tests whether Japan doubles down on the conservative, pro-Abenomics agenda that defined the past decade.</p><p>Takaichi’s victory follows Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s resignation after the LDP lost its majority in both houses of parliament in 2024 and 2025, leaving it to govern as a minority.</p><p>This also means that when the Diet convenes on Oct 15, opposition parties could theoretically block Takaichi's confirmation as prime minister, although analysts say the risk of that <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/08/japan-ishiba-resign-sanae-takaichi-koizumi.html\">is low</a>.</p><p>Takaichi's first task is to secure the support of at least one opposition party to form a working majority, research firm BMI said in a note Monday.</p><p>However, opposition parties face a dilemma: joining the LDP in a coalition could increase their influence but risk alienating voters dissatisfied with the ruling party.</p><p>Should Takaichi reach a deal with the opposition, BMI said her government will face several challenges, including a cost-of-living crisis, managing security and trade relationships with U.S. President Donald Trump, as well as addressing domestic concerns about the rising number of foreigners residing in or visiting Japan.</p></div><h2><a></a>Abenomics 2.0?</h2><div><p>Takaichi is seen as a proponent of \"Abenomics,\" the economic strategy of Shinzo Abe, which espoused loose monetary policy, fiscal spending and structural reforms.</p><p>She had previously criticized the Bank of Japan's plan to raise interest rates, which BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda previously said on Friday that the central bank would set rates <a href=\"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/about/press/koen_2025/data/ko251003a1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">\"without any preconceptions.\"</a></p><p>The BOJ ended its negative interest rate regime in March 2024 and most recently <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/17/boj-to-slow-bond-purchases-holds-rates-at-0point5percent.html\">kept rates at 0.5%</a>.</p><p>\"We can already guess that she won't bring inflation down, because if she's going to double down on Abenomics of the past, which means a sharply weaker yen, which means more government spending, that arguably means more inflation,\" said William Pesek, the author of <em>Japanization: What the World Can Learn from Japan's Lost Decades</em>.</p><div><p>The LDP chose Takaichi because they felt she was the best person to deal with U.S. President Donald Trump, Pesek, a long-time Asia watcher, told CNBC's \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/\">Squawk Box Asia</a>.\"</p><p>\"She was probably the best option to face off with Trump at this very tense moment between Trump and the rest of the world,\" Pesek said.</p></div><p>Last week, Takaichi reportedly expressed misgivings about the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/implementing-the-united-states-japan-agreement/\" target=\"_blank\">U.S.-Japan trade deal</a>, and said on a <a

The political deadlock in Washington, D.C. looks set to continue into next week, with concerns the Trump administration could <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/02/trump-government-shutdown-updates-vought.html\">use the funding freeze to permanently slash roles</a> and cancel certain projects.</p><p>While there has been much research on what an extended shutdown could mean for stocks, major U.S. and European indexes have been notching record highs. That comes as fund flows data from the Bank of America shows $26 billion moved into global equities during the week ended Oct. 1, with a record $9.3 billion going into the technology sector.</p></div><div><div><svg width=\"256\" height=\"256\">Stock Chart IconStock chart icon</svg><p><img src=\"https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/a54b41835a8b60db28c2.svg\" alt=\"hide content\" /></p></div><p>Fresh Record Highs</p></div><div><p>But amid this optimism, another narrative is growing. An increasing number of market participants are warning that bubbles are forming in parts of the market, with some saying this could lead to a larger market correction.</p><p>Saxo's warning is \"don't predict, prepare.\" In a recent note, the bank said \"the mood could hardly be more conflicted. Equity indices hover near record highs ... yet consumer sentiment remains close to historic lows,\" encouraging investors to diversify to protect against instability.</p><p>There are red flags in the credit markets in particular. Barnaby Martin from Bank of America told \"<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-europe/\">Squawk Box Europe</a>\" their recent survey showed credit investors have one of the \"biggest overweights ever in the 20-year history\" of that survey, warning there were increasing concerns about market bubbles.</p><p>Last week, U.S. car parts manufacturer First Brands filed for bankruptcy after revealing a $12 billion debt pile through the use of off-balance sheet financing. Famed short-seller Jim Chanos <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/395ca469-7315-4d66-ae74-6a47bda751ae\" target=\"_blank\">told the Financial Times</a> he \"suspects we are going to see more of these things,\" warning the increasingly expansive private credit market has echoes of the subprime crisis.</p><p>A bubble that does not seem at risk of bursting is the one formed around multi-award-winning pop star Taylor Swift.

Thousands of miles away in Eunice, New Mexico, Lorskulsint turned on the television to make sure his team could witness what was happening across the Pacific Ocean.</p><p>Lorskulsint knew the disaster in Japan was a watershed moment for the nuclear industry. The plant where he was leading an operations shift had just opened in 2010, after the European uranium enricher Urenco had spent years building the facility in anticipation of growing demand.</p><p>Over the ensuing decade, public support for nuclear power diminshed and a dozen reactors closed in the U.S. as the industry struggled to compete against a flood of cheap natural gas and renewable energy. Demand for the low enriched uranium that fuels nuclear plants dwindled.</p><p>\"The price of what we sold basically went through the floor,\" Lorskulsint, who is now the chief nuclear officer at Urenco USA, told CNBC. Urenco's long-term contracts with utilities insulated the facility during the downturn, he said, but the price drop put further expansion plans on hold.</p></div><div><p>Paul Lorskulsint, Chief Nuclear Officer, Urenco USA talks about the uranium enrichment process. </p><p>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</p></div><div><p>Headquartered outside London, Urenco is joinly owned by the British and Dutch goverments and two German utilities. Its New Mexico facility is the only commercial enrichment facility left in the U.S. The last U.S.-owned commercial facility in Paducah, Kentucky, closed in 2013 and its owner the United States Enrichment Corporation went bankrupt during the downturn after Fukushima.</p><p>Fourteen years later, the situation has reversed once again. Urenco USA is racing to expand its enrichment capacity. The nuclear industry is gaining momentum as electricity demand in the U.S. is projected to surge from artificial intelligence and the push to expand domestic manufacturing. Doubts persist about whether U.S. power supplies will ramp up quick enough to meet the needs. Increasing uranium enrichment will be a key part of the process, despite the history of past disappointments. </p><p>Also, U.S. enriched uranium supplies are at risk. The U.S. still imported 20% of its <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/uranium/marketing/pdf/2024%20UMAR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">enriched uranium from Russia</a> in 2024, a legacy of the now shattered hope for friendship between the two countries after the collapse of the Soviet Union and end of the Cold War.</p><p>The U.S. will completely ban the import Russian uranium by 2028 in repsonse to Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leaving a gapping supply deficit just when Washington, the utilities and the tech sector are developing the most ambitious plans in decades to build new reactors.</p><p>Nuclear plants like <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/22/michigan-nuclear-plant-shows-challenges-us-safely-restart-old-reactors-.html\">Palisades</a> in Michigan, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/16/look-inside-the-three-mile-island-nuclear-power-plant.html\">Crane Clean Energy Center</a> in Pennsylvania and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/01/nuclear-duane-arnold-nextera-nee-tech-data-center-ai.html\">Duane Arnold</a> in Iowa are planning to restart operations this decade after closing years ago. The tech sector is investing hundreds of millions of dollars to bring advanced reactors online in the 2030s to help power their computer warehouses that train and run AI applications.</p><p>\"It is a pivotal moment, the next five to 10 years for the nuclear industry,\" Lorskulsint said. \"We're going to have to have to deliver on time, on schedule and continue to maintain that momentum, which is a significant challenge.\"</p></div><div><p>Employees at Urenco USA receive a cylinder of feed material for enrichment process.</p><p>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</p></div><h2><a></a>Expansion plans</h2><div><p>In deeply divided Washington, support for nuclear power is one of the few issues that can still muster some bipartisan support. President <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> wants to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/23/trump-nuclear-executive-order.html\">quadruple nuclear power by 2050</a>, a significant increase over President Joe Biden's previous goal to triple it by that date.</p><p>The U.S. has only built one new nuclear plant from scratch in the past 30 years, raising doubts about whether such ambitious plans can be realized. But any effort big or small to expand nuclear power in the U.S. will run through Urenco's facility in New Mexico.</p><p>The plant currently has capacity to supply about a third of U.S. demand with $5 billion invested in the facility to date. Urenco is expanding its capacity in New Mexico by 15% through 2027 as utilties replace Russian fuel. It has installed two new centrifuge cascades for enrichment this year. But Urenco's expansion alone won't fill the Russian supply gap, Lorskulsint said.</p><p>\"Our competitors will have to expand in order to make sure that as a whole the industry is still supplied,\" he said. \"We're building quickly as we can to make sure that the the industry is not short handed.\"</p><p>As Russian fuel is banned from the U.S., the Trump administration is pushing for 10 new large reactors to start construction this decade. <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL/\">Alphabet</a><span><span></span></span></span> is investing in about 2 gigawatts of new nuclear, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> has committed to more than 5 gigawatts, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span> wants to bring up to 4 gigawatts online.</p></div><div><p>Urenco USA Facilities in Eunice, New Mexico.</p><p>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</p></div><div><p>The industry is worried about the supply gap, Lorskulsint said, but filling it \"is not an insurmountable task.\"</p><p>Urenco USA is a candidate to receive a contract from the Department of Energy to produce more low-enriched uranium, part of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/28/mp-materials-lithium-americas-lac-rare-earth-trump-stake.html\">U.S. efforts to standup a domestic nuclear supply chain</a>. The contract would allow the New Mexico facility to expand further with the construction of a fourth production building.</p><p>Urenco's competitors are also seeking support from the Energy Department to build out U.S. enrichment capacity. France's Orano is planning to build a facility in Oak Ridge, Tennesse, with operations potentially starting in the 2030s.</p><p>Publicly traded <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LEU/\">Centrus</a><span><span></span></span></span> has a facility in Piketon, Ohio, where it plans to produce low-enriched uranium, but it hasn't yet started commercial operations. Centrus is the successor company to the United States Enrichment Corporation that went bankrupt in 2013.</p><p>Centrus stock has gained more than 400% this year as investors bet on a growing demand for enriched uranium due to U.S. plans to expand nuclear power.</p></div><div><p>Paul Lorskulsint, Chief Nuclear Officer, Urenco USA talks about the uranium enrichment process next to centrifuge cascade.</p><p>Adam Jeffery | CNBC</p></div><h2><a></a>Supply chain bottlenecks</h2><div><p>But enrichment is just one stage in a long supply chain that will be stretched by growing demand. Uranium delivered to the U.S is often mined in Canada and it is then converted into intermediate state called uranium hexafluoride that is the feedstock for enrichment.</p><p>The feedstock is spun in Urenco's centrifuges to increase the presence of the isotope Uranium-235 to 5%, the level needed for most nuclear plants. The enriched uranium is then shipped to fuel fabricators that manufacture the pellets that go into reactors in power plants.</p><p>U.S. nuclear plants are facing cumulative supply gap of 184 million pounds of uranium through 2034, according to the Energy Information Administration.The biggest bottleneck right now for Urenco is the conversion of uranium into the feedstock for enrichment, Lorskulsint said. There are only three facilities in the Western world located in Canada, France and Illinois that convert uranium into feedstock.</p><p>\"Every portion of the supply chain is going to have to expand, it's not just about enrichment,\" Lorskulsint said. \"We need more of everything but conversion right now is the bottleneck.\"</p><p>The nuclear supply chain may not be the biggest challenge in the end, the executive said. The ageing U.S. electric grid could prove to be the real constraint on building new nuclear due how long it takes to complete upgrades, he said. While this could slow Urenco down, it won't stop the expansion, he said.</p><p>\"We came here when the market demanded it,\" Lorskulsint said of Urenco's investment in the U.S. \"We were here when the market didn't demand it. And we are now expanding to make sure that we can still support as much as the market needs from us.\"</p></div></div>",

The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.</p><p>In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1973101319222165785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973101319222165785%7Ctwgr%5E6bb1e8bac213d47b901b22d6ba65042b371c9caf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstpost.com%2Fexplainers%2Felon-musk-netflix-boycott-charlie-kirk-controversy-13938760.html\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show's creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said \"mocked\" the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Steele responded to Musk's callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, \"It's probably going to be a very odd day.\" Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called \"Dead End\" a \"brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.\"</p><p>Also this week, vocal conservative activist Robby Starbuck began posting about Netflix, echoing anti-trans sentiments and arguing the company has promoted an ideology that is \"hateful to White Americans.\" Starbuck, who has repeatedly targeted major corporations in recent months over diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, said in one of his X posts on Netflix, \"No one should give this woke company another dime.\"</p><p>Netflix did not respond to requests for comment from CNBC.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206766-17593554481759355445-41906018363-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759355447&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"‘Fast Money’ traders talk Netflix shares dropping after Elon Musk tells people to cancel\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for.</p><p>Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year.</p><p>Shares lost nearly 5% over the week. </p><p>\"Is that going to move the needle necessarily? ...

    "body": "<div><div><p>When people ask me what couples fight about the most, they expect the usual suspects like money, sex or parenting. But after years of research, and from real-life experience in my own marriage, the answer is much simpler: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/08/im-a-psychologist-who-studies-couples-what-people-fight-about-the-most-in-relationships.html\">tone of voice</a>.</p><p>That's right. It's not the dishes in the sink or the unpaid credit card bill. It's how partners <em>speak</em> to each other about those things that creates tension.</p></div><h2><a></a>Tone can matter more than what you say</h2><div><p>It only takes a subtle shift in tone — a sigh, an eye-roll, or a sharp edge in your voice — for a simple question like \"Did you take out the trash?\" or \"Sure, whatever you say...\" to land like an accusation.</p><p>Research backs this up: <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.5964/ijpr.v7i1.119\" target=\"_blank\">One study</a> found that when we interpret messages, only a small portion comes from the actual words. The rest? It's all nonverbal: facial expressions, body language, and especially tone.</p><p>When we argue with someone we love, <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/society/articles/42707-how-and-why-do-american-couples-argue\" target=\"_blank\">tone tends to dominate</a> because it carries emotional weight. A clipped delivery can sound like blame. A flat one might feel like indifference. Sarcasm can come across as contempt.</p><p>We often don't remember the exact words said in a fight. But we do remember how our partner sounded and how it made us feel.</p></div><h2><a></a>If you're the one with the sharp tone...</h2><div><p>We all slip up. When we're tired, stressed, or distracted, our tone can betray our actual intentions.</p><p>The fix is to catch yourself in real time. If you notice your voice is harsher than intended, pause. Then, try these simple repair moves: </p><ul><li>\"Sorry, I didn't mean for that to come out so sharp. Let me say it differently.\"</li><li>\"I realize that sounded a lot harsher than what I intended. What I'm trying to say is...\"</li><li>\"Hold on, I don't like how that came out. Let me try that again.\"</li></ul><p>It doesn't need to be dramatic, but you should be honest. That means calling yourself out instead of pretending nothing happened. With practice, this honesty becomes easier: You build the muscle by noticing your slip-ups, owning them quickly, and then rephrasing. </p><p>These small adjustments show your partner that you're self-aware, and it can stop an argument before it snowballs.</p></div><h2><a></a>If you're on the receiving end…</h2><div><p>When your partner's tone turns sharp, it's natural to mirror it. But doing that often leads to a blame spiral about <em>how </em>you're fighting, instead of resolving the actual issue.</p><p>The key is to interrupt the cycle without escalating it. Try saying:</p><ul><li>\"I didn't like the way that sounded. Can you say it a different way?\"</li><li>\"I want to hear you out, but your tone is making that difficult for me right now. Can you try again?\"</li><li>\"I get that you're frustrated, but can you explain that for again a little more calmly?\"</li></ul><p>No accusations. No defensiveness. Just a simple nudge toward better communication.</p></div><h2><a></a>When both of you are stuck in a bad tone loop</h2><div><p>Sometimes, both partners fall into the tone trap. One person gets defensive, the other responds with more edge. Soon, you're both in a reactive back-and-forth.</p><p>The only way out? Someone has to be brave enough to hit the reset button.</p><p>I call it a \"reset phrase.\" This could be:</p><ul><li>\"Let's start over.\"</li><li>An inside joke.</li><li>A nonverbal gesture like a hand squeeze.</li></ul><p>In my marriage, sometimes my wife will laugh and say, \"Listen to us. We sound like teenagers.\" Other times, I'll make a joke and suggest we take a breather. These resets don't erase the disagreement, but they do defuse the tone, allowing for a more productive conversation.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/mark-travers/\"><em><strong>Mark Travers</strong></em></a><em>, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

Given the ongoing uncertainty, investors looking for stable returns can consider adding dividend stocks to their portfolios.</p><p>Top Wall Street analysts' recommendations can help investors pick stocks of dividend-paying companies that have strong fundamentals to support consistent dividend payments.  </p><p>Here are three <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/dividends\" target=\"_blank\">dividend-paying stocks</a>, highlighted by <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street's top pros</a> as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.</p></div><h2><a></a>Brookfield Infrastructure Partners</h2><div><p>First on this week's dividend list is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">Brookfield Infrastructure Partners</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bip\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BIP</strong></a>), a global infrastructure company that owns and operates diversified, long-life assets in the utilities, transport, midstream, and data sectors. BIP paid a dividend of 43 cents per unit on Sept. 29, reflecting a 6% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $1.72 per unit, BIP stock offers a dividend yield of 5.2%.</p><p>Following the recently held Investor Day event, BMO Capital analyst Devin Dodge reiterated a buy rating on Brookfield Infrastructure stock with a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/bip/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">price forecast of $42</a>. The 5-star analyst stated that the presentations by management at the event reflected the robust underlying organic growth trends across BIP's portfolio, which he expects to become more evident in the upcoming quarters.</p><p>Dodge highlighted that the number of high-growth platforms in BIP's portfolio continues to increase, and there are significant investment opportunities across most of its sectors. In particular, he mentioned the robust digital infrastructure investment opportunity. With hyperscalers' capital spending estimated to increase by 50% this year, there is a strong growth potential for BIP's data center platforms over the intermediate term.</p><p>The analyst pointed out that BIP's funds from operations per unit (FFO/unit) growth is nearing an inflection point. He noted that over the past five years, BIP's FFO/unit has increased at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% despite foreign exchange headwinds and high interest rates. However, Dodge expects these challenges to ease in the near term, which could drive visible FFO growth.  </p><p>\"As FFO/unit growth shifts higher, we believe there are positive implications for distribution growth and valuation,\" said Dodge. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on BIP stock with a price target of $33.</p><p>Dodge ranks No. 377 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 73% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.2%. See Brookfield Infrastructure Statistics on TipRanks.</p></div><h2><a></a>Ares Capital</h2><div><p>We move to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/\">Ares Capital</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/arcc\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ARCC</strong></a>), a specialty finance company that provides direct loans and other investments to private middle-market companies. Ares pays a quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share. At an annualized dividend of $1.92 per share, ARCC stock offers a yield of 9.4%.</p><p>In an update on business development companies, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee reiterated a buy rating on Ares Capital stock with a <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/arcc/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">price target of $24</a>. Interestingly, TipRanks' AI Analyst has an \"outperform\" rating on ARCC stock with a price target of $25.</p><p>In the current scenario, Lee prefers ARCC, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BXSL/\">Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (BXSL)</a><span><span></span></span></span>, and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLX/\">Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX)</a><span><span></span></span></span> stocks. \"ARCC has a long track record of successfully managing risks through cycles,\" noted Lee.</p><p>The 5-star analyst specified that ARCC is a market-leading BDC with scale. He believes that the company's access to the Ares global credit platform is one of its major competitive advantages. Lee is confident about Ares Capital's potential to generate above peer-average return on equity.</p><p>Lee views Ares Capital's experienced senior management team as one of its key strengths. He also pointed out that ARCC's dividends are backed by the company's core earnings per share generation and potential net realized gains.</p><p>Lee ranks No. 59 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 72% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.7%. See Ares Capital Ownership Structure on TipRanks.</p></div><h2><a></a>ONE Gas</h2><div><p>Finally, let's look at <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/OGS\">ONE Gas</a> (<a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ogs\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>OGS</strong></a>), a 100% regulated natural gas utility that provides affordable energy to over 2.3 million customers in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. At a quarterly dividend of 67 cents per share (annualized dividend of $2.68 per share), OGS stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.</p><p>Recently, Mizuho analyst Gabe Moreen upgraded OGS stock to buy from hold and increased his <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/ogs/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">price forecast to $86</a> from $77, citing several reasons, such as the benefits from the Texas HB 4384 legislation (enables recovery of certain costs associated with a gas utility's plant, facilities, or equipment placed in service) and lower interest rates. Meanwhile, TipRanks' AI Analyst has a \"neutral\" rating on OGS stock with a price target of $81.</p><p>Moreen sees the possibility of HB 4384 generating a full-year benefit of about 18 cents in incremental EPS in fiscal 2026. He added that this benefit is not one-time in nature, and will grow with ONE Gas' yearly Texas capital spending. It is worth noting that Texas constitutes about 32% of OGS' rate base. \"We believe this will place a floor under OGS' growth outlook at the higher-end of its 4-6%,\" said Moreen.</p><p>The top-rated analyst noted that elevated short-term interest rates were one of the reasons that forced OGS to revise its guidance in 2023 and 2024. He expects the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts to benefit the company, as they will ease relative interest expense from prior periods.</p><p>Additionally, Moreen highlighted notable growth opportunities for OGS, thanks to the growing natural gas demand from data centers and advanced manufacturers. He believes that all these catalysts, along with a growing customer base and a solid balance sheet, make OGS stock an attractive pick at the current valuation. In fact, Moreen expects OGS to rebound to its historical premium valuation levels, at which the stock traded before the company restated its guidance in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>Moreen ranks No. 142 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 75% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.3%. See ONE Gas Technical Analysis on TipRanks.</p></div></div>",

    "body": "<div><div><p>Keith Heyde stands on site in Abilene, Texas, where OpenAI's Stargate infrastructure buildout is underway. Heyde, a former head of AI compute at Meta, is now leading OpenAI’s physical expansion push.</p><p>OpenAI</p></div><div><p>It wasn't how Keith Heyde envisioned celebrating the holidays. Rather than hanging out with his wife back home in Oregon, Heyde spent late December visiting potential data center sites across the U.S.</p><p>Two months earlier, Heyde left <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span> to join OpenAI as the head of infrastructure. His job was to turn CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/sam-altman/\">Sam Altman's</a> ambitious compute dreams into reality, seeking out vast swaths of land suitable for expansive facilities that will eventually be packed with powerful graphics processing units for building large language models.</p><p>\"My in-between Christmas and New Year's last year was actually mostly spent looking at sites,\" Heyde, 36, told CNBC in an interview. \"So my family loved that, trust me.\"</p><p>His life in 2025 has only gotten more intense.</p><p>Since January, OpenAI has been quietly soliciting and reviewing proposals from around 800 applicants hoping to host the next wave of its Stargate data centers, AI supercomputing hubs designed to train increasingly powerful models.</p><p>Roughly 20 sites are now in advanced stages of diligence, with massive tracts of land under review across the Southwest, Midwest and Southeast. Heyde said tax incentives are \"a relatively small part of the decision matrix.\"</p><p>The most important factors are access to power, ability to scale, and buy-in from local communities.</p><p>\"Can we build quickly, is the power ramp there fast, and is this something where it makes sense from a community perspective?\" he said.</p><p>Heyde leads site development within OpenAI's industrial compute team, a division that's swiftly become one of the most important groups inside the company. Infrastructure, once a supporting function, has now been elevated to a strategic pillar on par with product and model development. </p><p>With traditional data centers nearly at max capacity, OpenAI is betting that owning the next generation of physical infrastructure is central to controlling the future of AI.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108207641-1759509190378-1759507580-41931348946-hd.jpg?v=1759509229&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Inside OpenAI's data center site search\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>The <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/23/data-centers-powering-ai-could-use-more-electricity-than-entire-cities.html\">energy needs</a> are hard to fathom. A gigawatt data center requires the amount of power needed for some entire cities. Late last month, OpenAI announced plans for a 17-gigawatt buildout in partnership with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/\">Nvidia</a>, and <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/3AG1-FF/\">SoftBank</a>.</p><p>New sites will have to include all sorts of energy options, including battery-backed solar installations, legacy gas turbine refurbishments and even small modular nuclear reactors, Heyde said. Each site looks different, but together they form the industrial backbone OpenAI needs to scale.</p><p>\"We've done this wonderful piece of bottleneck analysis to see what types of energy sources actually allow us to unlock the journey that we want to be on,\" Heyde said.</p><p>A good chunk of the capital is coming from Nvidia. The chipmaker <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/nvidia-openai-data-center.html\">agreed</a> to invest up to $100 billion to fuel OpenAI's expansion, which will involve purchasing millions of Nvidia's GPUs.</p></div><h2><a></a>'Perfect wasn't the goal'</h2><div><p>Heyde, a former head of AI compute at <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/META/\">Meta</a><span><span></span></span></span>, helped oversee the buildout of Meta's first 100,000 GPU cluster.</p><p>In addition to power, OpenAI is assessing how quickly it can build on a site, the availability of labor and proximity to supportive local governments, according to Stargate's request for proposal.</p><p>Heyde said the team has made around 100 site visits and has a short list of sites in late-stage review. Some will be brand new builds, and others will require conversions and refurbishments of existing facilities. Flexibility will be key.</p><p>\"The perfect parcels are largely taken,\" Heyde said. \"But we knew that perfect wasn't the goal — the goal for us was, number one, a compelling power ramp.\"</p><p>Competition is fierce.</p><p>Meta is building what may be the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/25/meta-massive-data-center-louisiana-cost-jobs-energy-use.html\">largest data center in the Western Hemisphere</a> — a $10 billion project in Northeast Louisiana, fueled by billions in state incentives. CEO <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/mark-zuckerberg/\">Mark Zuckerberg</a> raised the top end of the company's annual capital expenditure spending range to $72 billion <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/meta-microsoft-stock-earnings-ai.html\">in July</a>.</p></div><div><p>The steel frame of data centers under construction during a tour of the OpenAI data center in Abilene, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025. </p><p>Shelby Tauber | Reuters</p></div><div><p><span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Amazon</a><span><span></span></span></span> and Anthropic are teaming up on a 1,200-acre AI campus in Indiana. And across the country, states are rolling out tax breaks, power guarantees, and expedited zoning approvals to attract the next big AI cluster.</p><p>OpenAI is a relative upstart, having been around for just a decade and only known to the mainstream since launching ChatGPT less than three years ago.

A self-built solar campus in Abiliene, Texas, is already live.</p><p>While OpenAI still leans on partners like <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/ORCL/\">Oracle</a><span><span></span></span></span>, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar told CNBC last week in Abilene that owning first-party infrastructure provides a differentiated approach. It curbs vendor markups, safeguards key intellectual property, and follows the same strategic logic that once drove Amazon to build Amazon Web Services rather than rely on existing infrastructure.</p><p>However, Heyde indicated that there's no real playbook when it comes to AI, particularly as companies pursue artificial general intelligence (AGI), or AI that can potentially meet or exceed human capabilities.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108207733-1759517107438-1759514347-41932537377-hd.jpg?v=1759517131&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"OpenAI's stealth site search drew more than 800 bids since January 2025\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>\"It's a very different order of magnitude when we think about the type of delivery that has to happen at those locations,\" he said.</p><p>Some applicants, including former <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BTC.CM=/\">bitcoin</a><span><span></span></span></span> mining operators, offered existing power infrastructure, like substations and modular buildouts, but Heyde said those don't always fit.</p><p>\"Sometimes we found that it's almost nice to be the first interaction in a community,\" he said. \"It's a very nice narrative that we're bringing the data center and the infrastructure there on behalf of OpenAI.\"</p><p>The 20 finalist sites represent phase one of a much larger buildout.

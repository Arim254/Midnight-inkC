    "body": "2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantisDETROIT — Stellantis is resurrecting a V-8-powered Ram pickup truck called the TRX as the company faces fewer federal emissions regulations and enacts a U.S. sales turnaround plan for its brands. The automaker said Thursday that the 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will be available late in 2026 for around $100,000. It was first produced for the 2021-2024 model years before being canceled as the company de-emphasized V-8 engines.The TRX is powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter \"Hellcat\" gas engine capable of 777 horsepower and 680 foot-pounds of torque. The automaker is calling it the \"fastest and most powerful production gas pickup truck in the world,\" capable of 0–60 mph in 3.5 seconds and a top speed of 118 mph.\"We had to push it to the next level,\" Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis said during a recent media event. \"We're super happy about this one coming back.\"Despite relatively low sales in the past due to the vehicle's price, the TRX is viewed as a \"halo\" model for the brand, or a high-end vehicle that brings attention to Ram and potentially boosts sales for other models. It's been a successful strategy for Kuniskis, especially with the company's SRT performance vehicles. 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis The return of the TRX is the latest move for the brand under Kuniskis, who has been leading a turnaround plan since unretiring from the automaker a year ago.Kuniskis aims to make more than 25 announcements through next year. Thus far they have included returning to NASCAR with mechanical bull rides and a new race truck, resurrecting Hemi V-8 engines with a new \"Symbol of Protest,\" and killing a long-promised battery-electric version of its 1500 truck.The 2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRX will start at $99,995, excluding a mandatory $2,595 destination fee that bumps the price to $102,590. The initial TRX started at $71,690 in 2020, including destination.Ram on Thursday also announced a new 6.7-liter Cummins high-output turbo diesel engine for its 2027 Ram Power Wagon heavy-duty truck with 430 horsepower and 1,075 foot-pounds of torque.Shifting plansMany of the new efforts go against Stellantis' previous plans to discontinue gas V-8 vehicles amid more stringent fuel economy regulations and penalties. But those policies have either been weakened or disappeared under the Trump administration.Kuniskis said the rollback should help sales, but that he was \"going to do it anyway\" regardless of the standards.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis Kuniskis has embraced V-8 engines again, including with resurrecting the TRX, as part of an effort to revive Stellantis' U.S. sales, which plummeted under former Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares from 2021 to 2024.During that time, the automaker — formed in 2021 through a merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe — fell from the No. 4 automaker in U.S. sales to No. 6. Stellantis' sales through the third quarter of last year were 6% lower compared with a year earlier. Cox Automotive expects the automaker to finish the year with 1.25 million sales in the U.S., down 4.4% from 2024 and off from more than 2 million sales in 2020.Kuniskis, who also oversees all of Stellantis' U.S. brands, said both Ram and Jeep — the automaker's most critical domestic brands — are going \"in the right direction\" to capitalize on growth next year.2027 Ram 1500 SRT TRXStellantis That could be more difficult than it has been in the past, as auto forecasters such as Cox expect relatively flat or even falling auto sales in 2026. That means the automaker will have to conquest buyers from other brands.\"It's still a strong industry, so as long as we get our piece of it, we'll be OK,\" Kuniskis said.Jeep reset Ram isn't the only Stellantis brand looking for a revival.Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf, much like Kuniskis, has been initiating a turnaround strategy for the company's Jeep brand. Jeep has experienced years of annual sales declines since it hit record sales of more than 973,000 vehicles in 2018.The \"Jeep reset\" plan includes repositioning the brand's pricing, models and standard features, according to Broderdorf.\"This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle, I think, to resetting the foundation for Jeep this year and really getting into what makes it special going forward,\" Broderdorf told CNBC during an interview Dec. 16. \"It's a much better Jeep.\"2026 Jeep Recon EVJeepKuniskis described the Jeep reset plan as \"making Jeep more Jeep.\" The most recent actions essentially streamline Jeep's product lineup into fewer models, more content and a pricing strategy with fewer overlaps, from smaller vehicles such as the Compass and Cherokee to the bigger Grand Cherokee and Grand Wagoneer. \"The entire Jeep lineup is better,\" Broderdorf said.  \"I think we're laying a very strong foundation for growth going into next year, plus the new cars.\"New upcoming Jeeps include a resurrected Cherokee midsize SUV as well as an all-electric Recon inspired by the brand's iconic Wrangler off-road SUV.2025 could be the year that Jeep breaks the trend and notches its first U.S. sales increase since 2018, but  Broderdorf said in mid-December that the brand will be close to the goal, so it could go either way.Broderdorf said Jeep remains profitable despite the pricing changes as well as lower sales amid the turnaround plan.\"We're going to grow healthy,\" he said. \"I think this is what the brand needs.

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025. David A. Grogen | CNBC The investing world's north star is beginning to dim.Warren Buffett has handed over the CEO reins to Greg Abel after a six-decade run that turned an unremarkable textile company into one of the most powerful compounding engines in market history, leaving investors grappling with how singular that achievement really was, even as he remains chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.When Buffett took control of Berkshire in the mid-1960s, its shares traded around $19. By the end of 2025, a single Class A share was worth over $750,000. From 1964 — the year before Buffett took control of Berkshire — to 2024, the one-of-a-kind conglomerate delivered a compounded annual gain of 19.9%, nearly double the S&P 500's 10.4%, resulting in an overall return of more than 5.5 million percent, according to the company's latest annual report. The shares added another 10% to that return in 2025.The record was built on an unusually spare formula: use insurance float as a source of low-cost capital, buy businesses with durable cash flows and allow time to do most of the work. That approach produced long-held stakes in companies such as Coca-Cola and American Express, while Berkshire expanded into railroads, utilities and manufacturing through wholly owned subsidiaries.\"If it was that easy to do again, somebody would be doing it,\" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust Company and a Berkshire shareholder, said. \"You think about the duo that having Charlie Munger as your partner, it's just hard to imagine that coming together again anytime soon.\"As Buffett relinquishes the helm, investors are increasingly focused on what disappears with him. Seth Klarman, founder of the Baupost Group, called Buffett \"an American role model\" and said his retirement represents more than a leadership transition. \"The world of investing will be different without Warren Buffett at the helm of Berkshire,\" Klarman said in a tribute.'Going Quiet'Buffett has said he's \"going quiet\" as he steps back, signaling a reduced public presence even as he remains chairman. Abel will assume responsibility for Berkshire's annual shareholder letters, a tradition Buffett began in 1965 that became essential reading on Wall Street for its plainspoken lessons on markets, management and capital allocation. Buffett will keep penning a Thanksgiving message, however.The annual letters were one pillar of Buffett's influence. The other was Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting. Often dubbed \"Woodstock for Capitalists,\" the gathering drew tens of thousands of investors to Omaha, Nebraska, each year for hours of unscripted Q&A. The event cemented Buffett's role not just as a steward of capital, but as a steady public voice investors trusted to put market upheaval into perspective.watch nowBuffett also rejected many Wall Street conventions. Berkshire never split its stock, discouraging speculation and cultivating a shareholder base oriented toward decades rather than quarters. The company declined to issue earnings guidance and gave operating managers wide autonomy, while capital allocation decisions remained centralized in Omaha.\"Warren, as chairman, will be an advisor to Greg, a cultural anchor, and a real long term thinker,\" said Ann Winblad, managing director at Hummer Winblad Venture Partners and longtime Berkshire shareholder, on CNBC's \"The Exchange.\" \"Will the company fundamentally change in its strategies? No. ..The culture of Berkshire Hathaway, which is what I've invested in, which is patient, long term, careful and decisive investing, will probably still remain.\"The company held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring both its financial firepower and Buffett's caution in a richly valued market. Berkshire has also been a net seller of equities for 12 straight quarters, a rare and sustained retreat that reflects limited opportunities at its scale.Shareholder attention is shifting to a less settled part of the succession plan: the fate of its $300 billion equity portfolio. With no obvious successor possessing a comparable record in public equities, some analysts say Berkshire may ultimately scale back active stock selection, particularly given the size and concentration of the portfolio.Buffett has also repeatedly cautioned shareholders against mistaking volatility for failure. \"Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management,\" he wrote. \"Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.\"",

    "body": "Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein during a party at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesThe Department of Justice has 5.2 million pages of Jeffrey Epstein-related documents left to review and it will take weeks longer to complete the effort, multiple outlets reported.About 400 lawyers are being enlisted from multiple government divisions to pore over those records, The New York Times first reported late Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The review of the staggering number of files will take until at least Jan. 20 to complete, the Times reported. A government document reported by Reuters on Wednesday morning said that the process of reviewing the remaining records will take place between Jan. 5 and Jan. 23.The updated timeline is likely to draw more criticism from lawmakers who have already accused the Trump administration of flouting a statutory deadline to release its files on Epstein, the notorious late sex offender.While it was unclear how many total records would be disclosed, the latest reported figure is much larger than previously indicated and appears to further undermine a July memo claiming the DOJ conducted \"an exhaustive review\" of its files on Epstein.Asked for comment, the White House and the DOJ both referred CNBC to an X post from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who said lawyers \"are working around the clock through the holidays, including Christmas and New Years, to review documents in compliance with federal law.\"\"It truly is an all-hands-on-deck approach and we're asking as many lawyers as possible to commit their time to review the documents that remain,\" Blanche wrote, adding, \"Required redactions to protect victims take time but they will not stop these materials from being released.\"President Donald Trump signed a bipartisan bill in mid-November requiring the government to publicly release unclassified records from its investigations into Epstein by Dec. 19.The DOJ released thousands of records on that date, but Blanche indicated that more would be doled out over the \"next couple weeks.\"\"I expect several hundred thousand more,\" Blanche said at the time.On Christmas Eve, the DOJ revealed that more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been \"uncovered\" and that it would take \"a few more weeks\" to release them.The document cited by Reuters on Wednesday said that the 400 additional lawyers are being provided by the DOJ's Criminal Division and National Security Division, as well as the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.Newly-released documents from disgraced late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including a sheaf of entirely redacted pages, are seen in handouts released by the Justice Department and printed and arranged for a photograph by Reuters in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Jonathan Ernst | ReutersThe FBI declined to comment. The other divisions and the Manhattan office did not immediately respond to CNBC's outreach.Lawyers involved will be expected to review up to 1,000 documents per day over three to five hours, and volunteers are being offered incentives including time-off awards and telework options, the document reportedly said.After releasing its initial batch of files, the DOJ quickly drew accusations of failing to produce the required files and of redacting more information than was legally mandated.The department said it \"is not redacting the names of any politicians\" and maintains that it is fully complying with federal law. Democrats have nevertheless signaled they will take legal action against the administration over the alleged violations.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., accused the administration of carrying out a \"cover-up to protect Donald Trump,\" a former friend of Epstein's who has frequently griped about the public focus on the files.Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification",

    "body": "A graph displaying the Apple stock price on a smartphone app.Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesRetail investors have had a gangbuster year in 2025.Mom-and-pop investors bought the dip at key points this year, providing strong returns as the market climbed to all-time highs. Once thought of as unsophisticated and easily duped, a new breed of retail investor is giving the professionals who have long dismissed them a run for their money, according to investors and market data analysts interviewed by CNBC. \"Retail is just getting smarter, and they're getting hardened to the market,\" said Mark Malek, investing chief at Siebert Financial. In other words: These investors \"really are growing up.\"Individual traders bought the dip at a faster clip during market drawdowns early in the year, according to JPMorgan quant analyst Arun Jain, who called it a \"successful year\" for this group. It was an effective strategy: 2025 is shaping up to be the second-best year since at least the early 1990s for dip-buying, per data from Bespoke Investment Group data published this month.From May onward, JPMorgan said, these investors shifted their focus from single stocks to ETFs. The group particularly dove into the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fund, with JPMorgan finding 2025 inflows topped the last five years combined. The gold-focused ETF has seen a record-setting surge of more than 65% this year amid the precious metal's rise to all-time highs.The result: retail investors' single-stock portfolios have seen stronger profit-to-loss ratios than baskets tied to artificial intelligence and software run by JPMorgan, according to data from the bank released earlier this month. Everyday investors' exchange-traded fund holdings had much higher profit rates than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), the firm found.'TACO' and buying the dipA significant driver of their strong performance this year goes back to a week in April that had investors of all sizes on the edge of their seats.Big money ran for the hills as President Donald Trump first unveiled his plan for broad and steep tariffs on most foreign countries on April 2, which he dubbed \"liberation day.\" The S&P 500 briefly slipped into bear market territory as institutional investors worried the policy would drive up inflation and weigh on corporate earnings.But retail investors jumped head first into the turbulence. They bought a record of more than $3 billion in equities on net on April 3 — even as the S&P 500 fell around 5% in the session, according to VandaTrack. Elevated buying continued the following day despite the benchmark average dropping another 6%.Trump put most of his steepest duties on pause April 9, exactly one week after \"liberation day.\" Small-scale stockholders were on the ground floor of the S&P 500's 9.5% surge that session. The broad index has climbed more than 21% since April 2. It's on track to finish 2025 higher by more than 17% after hitting several new intraday and closing records.\"We often talk about retail as being sort of late to the party,\" said Viraj Patel, Vanda's deputy head of research. \"But this has been the polar opposite.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, year to dateAt Siebert, Malek said the professionals were starting to get nervous as the S&P 500 fell below 5,000 during the tariff-induced sell-off. But their retail traders continued buying all the way down, drawing on their past successes in increasing exposure amid pullbacks rather than panicking.Retail investors \"have been more right about the market and how to react to, certainly, a lot of the emotionally driven trades of the year,\" Malek said. \"They've been much more accurate in their dealings than my colleagues in the institutional space.\"Beyond believing in buying the dip, these traders also benefited from a conviction that the \"TACO trade\" would pan out, according to Zhi Da, a finance professor at the University of Notre Dame who studies retail trader activity.Known in full as \"Trump Always Chickens Out,\" this strategy encourages investors to buy into stocks when policy decisions from the White House cause market downturns, with the expectation that the actions will be reversed. On the other hand, institutional counterparts have been more cautious about trading around Trump's policies, Da said.He acknowledged there was some luck involved and that 2025 was an \"exception\" to the rule. Typically, retail investors buy market dips too late and don't benefit as much on average, he said.A 'more sophisticated' investorRetail's positive 2025 comes years into the investing boom among everyday Americans that began during the pandemic. The next serious downturn in the market will test whether the elevated participation will last.More than one out of every three 25-year-olds in 2024 moved significant sums from checking to investing accounts since they turned 22, according to JPMorgan data released earlier this year. That's up from just 6% of 25-year-olds in 2015.JPMorgan found 2025 retail flows surged to records, up more than 50% from last year and about 14% higher than the meme stock craze in early 2021. Individual investors' share of total stock trades this year climbed to highs last seen during the short-squeeze mania four years ago, according to data from a working paper by professors at Chapman University, Boston College and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.The narrative during 2021's meme stock surge — which centered on stocks like GameStop and AMC — was that retail investors made simplistic investing decisions to \"stick it to the man.\" Two years later, the sentiment toward these meme-stock era investors was captured in a film starring Paul Dano, Pete Davidson, Seth Rogen and Sebastian Stan called \"Dumb Money.\" Vanda's Patel and others said that view is changing. Small investors are taking advantage of the widening access to market research and data — and getting a better reputation on Wall Street as a result, they said. Retail has also established itself as being more adept at buying at lows, increasingly putting them in the arena with bigger counterparts, Patel said.\"The average retail investor's just becoming more and more sophisticated,\" Patel said. \"This year has been kind of a good testament to that.\"A scene from the trailer for the film \"Dumb Money\" starring Paul Dano.Courtesy: Sony Pictures EntertainmentTo be sure, a new class of meme stocks including OpenDoor emerged this year. But Vanda found far more retail investor dollars in 2025 have been directed to names like Nvidia, Tesla and Palantir that outperformed the market over recent years.Siebert's Malek said he's found everyday investors to be increasingly focused on longer-term investing, which can keep them from panic selling when the market goes down. Still, one question is top of mind for Malek and other investing leaders: What will retail traders do when the stock market, after multiple years of big gains, finally hits a lasting rough patch?For now, retail investors are taking notice of their improved standing.Real estate professional Josh Franklin remembers a decade ago when they were easily written off by big investors. The 28-year-old Tampa resident, who has invested in stocks like Robinhood and Palantir over the years and spends dozens of hours a week studying the market, now sees the small guy as central to the story.\"Back then, no one really cared about retail. They thought retail was dumb money,\" said Franklin. \"Now, retail kind of leads the charts.\"",

    "body": "watch nowLabor market weakness, uncertainty about inflation and political pressure will push the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates aggressively in the early part of 2026, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.Though markets and Fed officials themselves see only modest easing in the year ahead, Zandi expects the central bank to enact three cuts of a quarter percentage point each before midyear.\"Behind the decision to ease monetary policy further will be the still flagging job market, particularly in the early part of 2026,\" the economist wrote in his look at the year ahead published recently. \"It will take more time for businesses to feel certain that they will not be wrong-footed by shifting trade and immigration policies and other threats before they resume hiring.\"\"Until then, job growth will remain insufficient to forestall further increases in unemployment, and as long as unemployment is on the rise, the Fed will cut rates,\" he added.Zandi's forecast is at least a step ahead of both market and Fed expectations, both of which point to a slower pace of reductions.Market pricing currently points to two cuts, the first not coming until at least April and the second more likely in the back half of the year, probably around September, according to CME futures data as expressed through its FedWatch gauge. Fed policymakers have an even more cautious outlook.The central bank's grid of individual officials' expectations indicates just one cut through the entire year, according to an update presented earlier in December. Minutes from that meeting showed the cut at the meeting was a close call, as officials expressed the likelihood of additional reductions but at a tepid pace.But Zandi thinks the confluence of factors will cause the Fed to move more quickly. One wild card: the potential for President Donald Trump to remake the central bank's hierarchy.As things stand now, three of the seven Fed governors are Trump appointees: Christopher Waller, Michelle Bowman and Stephen Miran. With Miran's term expiring in January, Trump is likely to appoint another loyalist to the post. From there, Chair Jerome Powell's term at the helm expires in May, though his term as governor runs into early 2028. In addition, the president is in the process of trying to remove Governor Lisa Cook, though courts have blocked him so far.That adds to the likelihood that the president, a staunch advocate of lower interest rates, will look to exert his will on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.\"Trump will also pressure for lower interest rates. Federal Reserve independence will steadily erode as the president appoints more members to the Federal Open Market Committee, including the Fed chair in May,\" Zandi wrote. \"Given the approaching midterm congressional elections, the political pressure on the Fed to lower rates further to support economic growth is likely to intensify.\"The FOMC meets again on Jan. 27-28. Market pricing is putting just a 13.8% probability of a cut at that meeting, according to the CME.",

    "body": "Still life of the big three injectable prescription weight loss medicines. Ozempic, Victoza and Wegovy. (Photo by: Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)Ucg | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesNovo Nordisk's shift from a market darling to a serious underperformer has set the stage for a transitional 2026 as the Danish drugmaker fights to regain investor confidence in its weight loss business.Novo's stock just experienced the worst year on record since it began trading on the Copenhagen stock exchange over three decades ago. Multiple reasons lie behind the dramatic drop: a series of guidance cuts, strides by chief rival Eli Lilly, a leadership upheaval, and cheap copycat drugs flooding the crucial U.S. market.With just about a week to go until 2026, Novo announced that its new weight loss pill under the brand name Wegovy had been approved in the U.S., making it the first oral GLP-1 treatment approved for weight loss. It sent shares up nearly 10% as investors banked on Novo being able to, at least partly, hold Eli Lilly and others at bay.That \"early Christmas present,\" as one analyst called it, highlights many of the key themes Novo will have to face this year.From injectables to pillsNovo's position as the first company to launch an oral option could help it make up some of the ground it's lost over the past year in the GLP-1 space. Analysts mostly agreed that the Wegovy pill's approval was a big deal, even though many had already expected a positive decision before the end of the year. Eli Lilly is expected to get its own weight loss pill orforglipron approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by no later than the second quarter of this year, and investors will closely watch how that competition plays out.watch now\"This approval adds a layer to the whole obesity space in the future,\" Sydbank analyst Søren Løntoft Hansen told CNBC. \"It could be, potentially, a space where Novo Nordisk is maybe able to recapture market shares and maybe increase growth.\"Wegovy-in-a-pill, as Novo calls the oral version of the blockbuster injectable, has shown that patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over 64 weeks. Meanwhile, orforglipron, averages 12.4% over 72 weeks.\"Usually, you have to basically go for either convenience or efficacy when you're discussing pills versus injections – not in this case,\" Novo CEO Mike Doustdar told CNBC's Charlotte Reed in November. \"Wegovy in a pill basically will have the same efficacy as its injectable counterpart. That's really exciting.\"The broad consensus is that pills will also be favored by consumers. They have added advantages such as not having to be stored cold like the injectable version, allowing for simpler distribution and ease of entering new markets.A shifting narrative?Eli Lilly's positioning of its rival drug Zepbound as the best treatment for achieving weight loss on the market for once-weekly injections has helped it succeed in capturing significant market share to surpass Novo's Wegovy.Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk's positioning has been different as they've often emphazised that treating obesity goes beyond losing weight. \"They want to tell a story about how obesity should be seen as a disease and how Wegovy affects obesity-related diseases,\" Sydbank's Hansen said.\"As we will build and buy assets, you will often see that these assets do multiple things,\" Doustdar said in early November. \"They address other co-morbidities. We have seen that with semaglutide; it helps liver, kidney, heart – that's fantastic – we should actually go and further develop those,\" he said in the context of the future focus of its pipeline.However, it seems that's not important to Americans or the market, according to Hansen. \"The fraction that prescribes Wegovy or obesity drugs in relation to obesity-related diseases is very small,\" he noted, adding that even if many patients don't necessarily want to lose more than 20% of their body weight, they at least want the opportunity to achieve that highest rate of weight loss.\"It seems like that drives the market, and if Novo Nordisk is able to tap into that story with the Wegovy pill, I think they are in a good place,\" Hansen said.Read moreNovo in late November said it filed for FDA approval of a higher dose of Wegovy injection of 7.2 mg, which could also play into a changing narrative. Trials have shown that the higher dose of Wegovy resulted in a 20.7% weight reduction on average — about the same as Lilly's Zepbound jab.The U.S. consumerThe increased focus on the direct-to-consumer market will be another key area to watch.The market for weight loss pharmaceuticals is uniquely consumer-driven, contrasting many other blockbuster drugs that are typically covered by health plans in the U.S. or national health systems in Europe.\"The marketable development for Wegovy and Ozempic is a must-win battle for [CEO] Mike Doustdar and the new board.\"Søren Løntoft HansenSydbank analystPresident Donald Trump's second term in office has brought several headaches for pharmaceutical companies, Novo included. Throughout the year, Trump has teased triple-digit tariffs unless pharma companies make significant investments in the U.S., and has also waged a war on high drug prices for Americans.The frustration that U.S. drug prices can be more than four times those in Europe isn't new. Last year, Novo's then-CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen testified at the U.S. Senate panel chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who called for the company to \"stop ripping us off\" with high drug prices.But Trump has taken it further, advocating a so-called \"Most Favored Nation\" pricing for medicines, whereby the U.S. price is set to the lowest level compared to other wealthy countries.In November, the Trump administration reached a deal with Novo and Lilly to lower prices of their bestselling GLP-1 medicines on both Medicare and Medicaid, as well as agreements to offer them directly to consumers at a discount on the website TrumpRx.gov, which is set to be launched in January this year.The new direct-to-patient market is emerging as a critical driver of future sales growth, but compounders — which make cheaper copycat versions of the drug and were able to flourish during the earlier shortage of semaglutide — remain a real competitor.\"The TrumpRx deal will help Novo become more competitive with compounders on price, although a faster orforglipron launch could reduce its ability to gain momentum in the [direct-to-patient] channel ahead of Lilly,\" noted Morningstar's Karen Andersen.\"We've already seen the direct-to-patient market beginning to develop nicely in 2025, particularly for LillyDirect… oral GLP-1 drugs will be even better suited to this channel,\" she added. \"That will further push the market toward cash pay.\"Headwinds Investors are also waiting to see if Novo's new leadership will deliver on its attempt to improve U.S. operations.In May, Novo ousted its CEO of eight years, citing \"recent market challenges\" and \"the development of the company's share price.\" Six months later, all independent members of the board stepped down due to a disagreement with Novo's controlling shareholder over the pace of change and discontent over how it had addressed challenges in the U.S. market.\"The marketable development for Wegovy and Ozempic is a must-win battle for [CEO] Mike Doustdar and the new board,\" Hansen said, adding that the development in the U.S. market is a \"show me case\" for investors. \"Right now, we really don't see any significant positive progress here,\" he told CNBC on Dec 23.The Danish drugmaker must therefore balance progress on its pill version and higher-dose jabs of Wegovy with these multiple headwinds in 2026. Lower pricing for both the Medicare and consumer cash-pay channel as a result of MFN, as well as patent expiries in jurisdictions including Brazil, Canada and China will \"probably lead to a decreasing top line,\" said Hansen.Furthermore, 2026 will likely bring more clarity on Novo's next-generation drug CagriSema, which combines semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist, with cagrilintide, an amylin analogue.watch nowLonger term, competition is likely to intensify beyond Lilly and compounders, as several drugmakers — including Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Roche — advance late-stage candidates through their pipelines.The future could also bring more diversification in treatments, as many new drugs are in development that could yield new ways to manage weight loss long-term, provide better safety profiles, and combine drugs that target several different appetite-modifying hormones.\"There have been so many moves this year that show Novo as a conflicted company – for example, reaching a deal with Hims and then terminating the deal… negotiating to acquire Metsera, exiting negotiations, and then jumping back in after a signed Pfizer deal,\" said Andersen.\"This [Wegovy pill approval] win is symbolically very important for Novo, after a series of disappointments with data and financial performance,\" she added. \"It needed a win, and now it just needs to execute.\"",

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

About 29% of voters mailed in their ballots last year, according to USAFacts. And 13% of households paid their bills by mail last year, according to the Postal Service's 2024 Household Diary Study. \"Consumers have always assumed that the post office will postmark their mail on the day they take it to the post office or drop it in a box,\" said Edgar Dworsky, founder of advocacy site Consumer World and a former assistant attorney general in Massachusetts who focused on consumer protection. \"Who would expect it could be several days before it has a postmark on it?\"Mail is traveling farther to processing facilitiesWhile the Postal Service said in the notice that it is not changing how it postmarks mail — that has always been done at its processing facilities — the agency has added language to its Domestic Mail Manual to clarify for the public when postmarks are applied.In 2021, USPS unveiled an initiative called Delivering for America to improve its financial condition, which included increasing postage prices and redesigning its network and processing operations.Changes to transportation schedules and the consolidation of processing facilities under that initiative mean many post offices that previously sent mail twice a day to a hub now do so only once in the morning, according to new research from the Brookings Institution. Under the new network, roughly 26% of post offices are within 50 miles of their assigned regional center, and another 26% are between 150 and 500 miles away, according to the research.The upshot is that some mail generally doesn't begin moving through the system until at least the following day, resulting in the postmark not being applied the day you mailed that item. In some cases — i.e., ahead of weekends or holidays — it could take longer than a day for that crucial stamp to be applied.How to meet mailing deadlines amid postmark delaysThe importance of ensuring your mail is postmarked in time applies to a range of documents or forms that have deadlines. For example, ballots that are mailed can require a postmark by a specific date to be counted, as can federal and state tax returns and certain legal documents.If someone wants to ensure \"that the postmark aligns with the date of mailing, the customer may take the mailpiece to a post office, station or branch and request a [manual postmark] at the retail counter,\" according to a statement issued by the Postal Service.Asking a postal clerk to manually postmark something costs nothing. Or, you can pay $5.30 to send a time-sensitive document via certified mail, which includes a receipt for the sender as well as a return receipt showing when it was delivered and who signed for it. Alternatively, a certificate of mailing, which you keep for your records, costs $2.40 and shows the date you mailed something.\"Waiting in line at the post office is never fun, but you get that proof of timely mailing,\" said Josh Youngblood, an enrolled agent and founder of The Youngblood Group in Dallas. \"The reality is, otherwise, you are at the mercy of whenever that postmark gets applied.\"Given the possibility of a delay, you may want to explore electronic filing or payment options when available. Or, give yourself a deadline to mail something important well ahead of the official due date.Considerations for mailing tax returnsAhead of tax filing season, it's worth taking note of the possible delay. While April 15 is when federal taxes are due, the IRS considers any tax return postmarked on or before April 15 as being filed on time, even if it's not received until days later.So if you are prone to waiting until the last minute to file taxes and do not do it electronically, you can't assume dropping off your return at the post office or putting it in a mailbox means it will get postmarked that day.\"If I'm mailing something to the IRS, I'm going to go into the post office to the actual person, where they stamp it,\" Youngblood said.If your tax return is postmarked late and you owe taxes, you may face penalties and interest. \"There is a penalty for filing late, and even a day late is still late,\" Youngblood said.For individual tax returns — i.e., your Form 1040 — the penalty for filing a late return is 5% of the tax due for each month or partial month the return is late, capping out at 25%. On top of that, the penalty for paying late is 0.5% of your unpaid balance per month, also capped at 25%. Interest is also charged on unpaid balances, accruing daily at the federal short-term rate plus 3%.However, if you have filed and paid taxes owed on time over the previous three years, you can request that the penalties be waived, Youngblood said.",

    "body": "The housing market has spent the past few years stuck with high prices and slow sales. But in 2026, conditions are expected to ease slightly for buyers, a shift Redfin describes as a \"reset\" year.That reset is being driven by a growing supply of homes after years of limited inventory, which may push prices down in some markets next year. Overall, home prices have mostly leveled off over the past two years, as new construction has picked up. And there are already signs the market is loosening: Homes are sitting on the market longer, negotiations are becoming more common, and builders are offering discounts in markets where the supply of newly constructed homes has increased, according to Realtor.com.That doesn't mean homes will suddenly become affordable nationwide. Median home prices are still too high for many buyers after rising by 25% since 2020, according to U.S. Census data. Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates are also expected to remain elevated above 6% in 2026, limiting how much relief buyers are likely to see.In some markets, though, builders are increasingly using price cuts and incentives to move inventory, giving buyers more leverage, even though affordability remains tight overall.\"The bottom line for 2026 is that it will be a transitional year,\" Chris Reis, a broker with Compass in Seattle, tells CNBC Make It. \"There won't be a crash or a boom, just the market finding its footing after years of extraordinary disruption. Buyers will have more selection and negotiating power than at any time since the pandemic.\"What to expect in 2026Most housing forecasts point to a market that looks more stable than dramatic: Home prices are expected to rise slowly, and mortgage rates might dip modestly, although borrowing costs will still make buying expensive for many households. Here's how several major forecasters expect U.S. home prices to change in 2026:Redfin: +1.0%Realtor.com: +2.2%Zillow: +1.2%Fannie Mae: +1.3%Meanwhile, 30-year fixed mortgage rates are expected to stay above 6% in 2026, where they've been for the past three years. The current average rate is about 6.2%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Here's where major forecasters expect rates to land next year:Redfin: 6.3%Realtor.com: 6.3%Fannie Mae: 5.9%Mortgage Bankers Association: Low-to-mid 6% range While there may not be a lot of cost relief in home prices or mortgage rates, buyers are seeing more negotiating room where housing supply has increased — particularly in new construction.That's because builders sitting on recently completed homes are more willing to make deals, says Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.\"Quick move-in inventory is readily available, and builders are cutting prices and offering incentives to get it sold,\" he wrote in a recent blog post. That flexibility is less common in the current housing market, where many homeowners remain locked into lower mortgage rates and have little incentive to sell.Where prices could decline in 2026Home-price trends in 2026 are expected to vary widely by metropolitan area.While prices will keep rising modestly in many parts of the country, some large housing markets are expected to see flat or declining prices, particularly across parts of the West and South, per Realtor.com. In those areas, buyers may find more room to negotiate.Based on Realtor.com's 2026 forecast, these are 10 of the 100 largest U.S. metros expected to see the biggest year-over-year home-price declines next year:Cape Coral–Fort Myers, Florida: −10.2% North Port–Sarasota–Bradenton, Florida: −8.9% Stockton–Lodi, California: −4.1% Raleigh, North Carolina: −3.7% Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, Florida: −3.6% Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater, Florida: −3.6% Spokane–Spokane Valley, Washington: −3.5% Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, Colorado: −3.4% Sacramento–Roseville–Arden-Arcade, California: −3.3% San Francisco–Oakland–Hayward, California: −2.5%Realtor.com's projections estimate 2026 home-price changes by factoring in inventory, mortgage-rate expectations, and local economic conditions.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Many U.S. workers are ringing in the new year with a raise as new minimum wage increases take effect in states and localities across the country on Thursday.More than 8.3 million workers are expected to benefit from minimum wage hikes in 19 states, which will collectively add an estimated $5 billion in earnings nationwide, according to a December report by the Economic Policy Institute.On top of changes to state minimum wages, many cities and municipalities with local wage standards increased their minimum wages Thursday as well. For example, Seattle's minimum wage rose to $21.30 an hour, and the minimum wage in Minneapolis is now $16.37 an hour.Minimum wage workers in Hawaii will see the largest jump in their hourly pay. The state's minimum wage rose by $2 per hour, from $14 to $16. Other states with minimum wage increases include Arizona, California, Michigan, New Jersey and New York.The federal minimum wage remains at $7.25 an hour, where it has stood since 2009.

    "body": "Charlie ErgenKarl Gehring | Dever Post | Getty ImagesWall Street grew increasingly obsessed with the artificial intelligence boom this year, pouring money into chips, data centers and applications. But investors looking beyond Silicon Valley found outsized returns in another location: space. Some of the year's biggest market winners were defense companies that benefited from renewed interest in space exploration and military reindustrialization. President Donald Trump's military expansion plan includes a $175 billion \"Golden Dome\" project and efforts to bolster American shipbuilding.In looking to upgrade military tech and return astronauts to the moon for the first time in more than 50 years, the government is leaning on more companies outside of traditional defense names such as Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. Recently appointed NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman told CNBC last week that Trump's recommitment to exploring the moon is key to unlocking the \"orbital economy.\"The space and defense boon has opened a range of opportunities for high-profile private companies, including Palmer Luckey's Anduril and Elon Musk's SpaceX, which is aiming to go public next year. SpaceX is the parent of satellite internet provider Starlink.Among companies currently on the public market, investors have snapped up satellite names, from legacy providers such as EchoStar to newer players like Planet Labs. They're among a handful of satellite stocks that have more than tripled in value this year. Planet LabsWill Marshall is the Co-Founder and CEO of Planet Labs Inc. with a model of the Dove satellite at their headquarters in downtown San Francisco, Calif., seen on Thursday September 8, 2016, where they create the shoe box size satellites that they send into space that gather photographs of earth.Michael Macor | Getty ImagesPlanet Labs, based in San Francisco, has seen its stock surge almost 400% this year due to booming demand for satellite imagery and space analytics. The company, which went public in 2021 through a special purpose acquisition company, is now valued at $6.2 billion.In its fiscal third-quarter earnings report this month, Planet Labs topped analyst estimates and lifted its guidance. During the period, Planet Labs more than tripled its backlog from a year ago. The company said that since the end of the quarter, it launched two of its Pelican satellites and 36 Earth-imaging SuperDove satellites. In 2025, Planet Labs signed new government and defense deals, including contracts with NATO and the European Space Agency. The company also renewed a partnership to provide Earth data to the U.S. Navy and won a $13.5 million task order for commercial satellite data with NASA.Planet Labs is working closely with Google on its Suncatcher project focused on AI and machine learning in space. The company is aiming to launch two prototype satellites equipped with Google's custom AI chips called tensor processing units, or TPUs, by early 2027. EchoStarwatch nowEchoStar, founded in 1980 by Charlie Ergen, creates networking, connectivity and satellite solutions under its Dish TV, Sling TV and Boost Mobile brands. Under pressure from regulators to build out a 5G network, the company was forced to sell wireless spectrum rights. In August, EchoStar struck a $23 billion deal to sell spectrum licenses to AT&T, and the following month sold $17 billion in spectrum rights to SpaceX to boost Starlink connectivity.Gwynne Shotwell, SpaceX's operating chief, said the deal would help the company \"end mobile dead zones\" globally and improve coverage for its customers. Cell tower companies Crown Castle and American Tower sued EchoStar following the spectrum deals, alleging the company is trying to exit its long-term agreements. On a call with analysts in November, EchoStar CEO Hamid Akhavan said the transactions would give the company the \"capital runway\" to expand its portfolio and business.\"The road map is not 100% laid out at the moment,\" he said. \"We'll try to take advantage of every opportunity in the best way.\"EchoStar shares have soared 377% this year, including a 49% rally since the start of December, sending the company's market capitalization past $31 billion. Earlier this month, the company got an upgrade from Morgan Stanley to buy from hold, with the firm citing value from the recent spectrum deals.  The biggest beneficiary of the stock pop has been the 72-year-old Ergen, who owns more than 143 million shares, mostly Class B, in the company. His net worth has jumped by $12.2 billion this year to $16.6 billion, according to Bloomberg.ViaSatViasat offices are shown at the company's headquarters in Carlsbad, California, on March 9, 2022.Mike Blake | ReutersViaSat shares have jumped 315% in 2025, as the company has expanded and scooped up more contracts.One of ViaSat's most significant achievements was the successful launch in November of its second of three ViaSAT-3 satellites, which will start servicing the Americas next year. The company has also landed major government deals, including a satellite contract with the U.S. Space Force, with a first launch planned for 2028.On the commercial side, ViaSat expanded partnerships with commercial airlines, including Etihad Airways, Aeromexico and Riyadh Air. The company competes directly with SpaceX's Starlink service, which is used by United Airlines, Air France and Qatar Airways.ViaSat drew attention this year from activist investor Carronade Capital and was upgraded to buy last month by JPMorgan Chase, which highlighted the potential breakup of its commercial and government businesses.Ondaswatch nowOndas, which makes autonomous drone technology, skyrocketed 251% this year.The Boston-based company says on its website that it owns 21 patents and is addressing a potential $130 billion market. Revenue in the third quarter jumped more more than sixfold to $10.1 million, and the company upped revenue guidance for the year to $36 million from $25 million. CEO Eric Brock cited \"a powerful demand cycle for our unmanned platforms\" as a growth catalyst. Ondas inked major deals this year for its Optimus drone system, including a $14.3 million purchase order from a major defense contractor and a more than $3 million deal with the United Arab Emirates. The system allows governments, public safety entities and emergency services to autonomously collect data in tough environments. Backlog in the latest quarter rose to $22.2 million driven by demand for its Optimus and Iron Drone products. Stifel initiated coverage with a buy rating this month, calling Ondas a potential leader in the unmanned systems sector. AstronicsAerospace and defense systems maker Astronics climbed 241% this year. The company provides charging and lighting solutions used by major commercial aircraft makers and airlines such as Boeing and Delta. Its products also support the U.S. Army and NASA.At the end of the third quarter, Astronics said its backlog totaled $646.7 million, with the aerospace segment accounting for $572.5 million. That represented a slight decline from a record backlog in the first quarter.In October, Astronics announced plans to buy Germany-based Bühler Motor Aviation. The deal is projected to add $22 million to revenue next year. A month prior, Astronics announced plans to sell $210 million in convertible notes.

Throughout his career, the business and investing icon routinely shared wisdom to help others build successful lives, from  singing the praises of compound interest to offering a thought exercise for living without regrets.At Berkshire Hathaway's 2025 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett gave advice to those at the opposite end of their career as him: \"Don't worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,\" he told the audience in response to a question about lessons he learned early on. \"There are certain jobs you shouldn't take.\"Though it may be tempting for workers just starting out to accept whichever job offers the most competitive salary they can find, Buffett emphasized that other factors may be more important over the course of your career.'Find people that are wonderful to work with'While a good starting salary can help set you up for financial success, your coworkers and managers may play an outsized role in your long-term career success, Buffett said.\"Who you associate with is enormously important,\" he said. \"Don't expect that you'll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.\"He drew on his own experience of finding mentors who bestowed their wisdom upon him as a young person learning the ins and outs of running a business, and encouraged young people to find people in their own lives who have careers they admire and go work with them.\"I've had five bosses in life and I liked every one of them — they were all interesting. I still decided that I'd rather work for myself than anybody else,\" Buffett said. \"But if you find people that are wonderful to work with, that's the place to go.\"Don't do it for the moneyIn addition to surrounding yourself with smart and interesting people, Buffett said it's wise to look for a job you would do even if you didn't need the money. \"I've had that for a very long time,\" he added.Not only has the 95-year-old made a lot of money throughout his career, but he has often shared how much he's enjoyed his work and colleagues. \"I get to do what I like to do with people that I love,\" Buffett said in a 2008 interview. He encouraged young people to find a similarly meaningful career.\"It's interesting to me that in the investment business, so many people get out of it after they've made a pile of money,\" he said at Berkshire's shareholder meeting in 2025. \"You really want something that you'll stick around for whether you need the money or not.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "As the restaurant industry endured another difficult year, many chains opted to close underperforming locations as they try to turn around their businesses.Inflation-weary consumers have pulled back their restaurant spending, choosing to eat at home or chasing deals when they go out for a meal. While some restaurants have won over reluctant diners, the industry has largely struggled with the sales slump. Traffic to restaurants open at least a year fell every month in 2025, excluding only July, according to Black Box Intelligence. In years past, restaurant closures have been more concentrated across casual-dining chains, which lost customers to fast-casual competitors like Chipotle. But this year, chains across the industry announced plans to shutter at least hundreds of locations.In such a tough environment, some restaurant companies even filed for bankruptcy protection. Hooters, Pinstripes and On the Border were some of the notable names that landed in bankruptcy court this year.Here are the chains that announced closures in 2025:StarbucksA Starbucks coffee cup sits on a table inside a Starbucks in New York on Dec. 2, 2025.Spencer Platt | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn September, the coffee giant announced a $1 billion restructuring plan that included closing roughly 500 of its North American locations. The closures even extended to shuttering its upscale Reserve Roastery cafe in Seattle, the company's hometown.Starbucks' announcement followed CEO Brian Niccol's one-year anniversary at the helm of the company. Under his leadership, Starbucks is trying to reverse a sales slump in the U.S., its biggest market. Executives plan to share more details about the turnaround at the company's upcoming investor day in late January in New York. Wendy'sA Wendy's restaurant sign in Austin, Texas, Nov. 10, 2025.Brandon Bell | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIn November, Wendy's announced that it would undergo a strategic review of its restaurant footprint and begin closing underperforming locations that quarter. While the company did not announce a specific number of closures, interim CEO and CFO Ken Cook told analysts that the company could shutter a \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its U.S. restaurants shuttering, which would mean hundreds of the burger chain's locations.The closures are one phase of Wendy's \"Project Fresh\" turnaround plan. The company has reported same-store sales declines even as rivals McDonald's and Burger King see higher demand for their Big Macs and Whoppers.In 2024, Wendy's shuttered about 140 locations.Denny'sA view of a Denny's restaurant in Hayward, California, Feb. 14, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn February, Denny's said it planned to close between 70 and 90 restaurants in 2025. In recent months, the diner chain's sales sunk as customers opted to visit cheaper fast-food restaurants for breakfast. The shift in behavior led the company to shutter underperforming locations and attempt to improve the rest of its restaurant footprint.In November, the chain announced it had sold itself for $620 million to Yadav Enterprises, TriArtisan Capital Advisors and Treville Capital Group. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026, pending regulatory approval.Jack in the BoxGeri Lavrov | Getty ImagesIn April, Jack in the Box said it would close between 150 and 200 restaurants as part of its \"Jack on Track\" strategy to improve its financial performance. By the end of its fiscal 2025 on Sept. 28, the chain had permanently shuttered 86 restaurants. Bahama BreezeIn May, Bahama Breeze parent company Darden Restaurants closed 15 of the chain's locations, which represents roughly a third of its overall footprint. Following the closures, executives decided that the Caribbean-inspired chain was not a strategic priority for Darden, so the company is exploring strategic alternatives for the brand. Options include selling the chain outright or converting its restaurants into other Darden brands, like Olive Garden. Darden expects to make a decision on Bahama Breeze by the end of its fiscal 2026, which concludes in May.Hardee'sDozens of Hardee's locations will close by end of the year after the franchisor sued ARC Burger, one of its largest franchisees. Hardee's alleges that the operator fell behind on payments like royalties, rent and taxes. ARC, which is owned by private equity firm High Bluff Capital Partners, operated 77 Hardee's restaurants before the legal battle began. Its footprint stretched across eight states, including Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina and Wyoming, according to legal filings.Papa John'sThe Papa John's Pizza logo is shown in Austin, Texas, May 9, 2024.Brandon Bell | Getty ImagesIn the first three quarters of 2025, Papa John's shuttered 173 restaurants worldwide, according to company filings. Most of the closures affected international locations, although 62 of the pizza chain's U.S. locations also closed.Despite the closures, Papa John's still had nearly 6,000 restaurants in operation at the end of September.Noodles & Co.Michael Siluk | UCG | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesAt the end of October, Noodles & Co. had closed 29 company-owned restaurants this year, and executives said that they planned to shutter another two to five underperforming locations by the end of 2025. In 2024, the fast-casual chain closed 20 locations.By the end of 2026, Noodles & Co. is planning to close another 12 to 17 stores, as it aims to improve the company's financial performance and boost sales at the chain's nearby locations.Outback SteakhouseAn Outback Steakhouse restaurant in Daly City, California, Jan. 31, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIn October, restaurant company Bloomin' Brands closed 21 locations across the company. The closures hit Outback Steakhouse, the gem of its portfolio, as well as Bonefish Grill and Carrabba's Italian Grill.Bloomin' has identified nearly two dozen other restaurants that will not renew their leases when they expire over the next four years, executives said in November when sharing the company's quarterly earnings. At the same time, the company announced a $75 million turnaround plan to improve Bloomin' sales and its overall financial health.",

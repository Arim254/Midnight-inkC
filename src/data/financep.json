    "body": "Whether it from unexpected expenses or increased costs, many Americans say they are ending this year in a worse financial situation than last.Nearly half of Americans believe their financial situation worsened this year, and 24% say their credit scores took a hit in 2025, according to a survey of over 1,000 U.S. adults released Dec. 16 by Intuit Credit Karma, a personal finance platform. That's not surprising, says Ted Rossman, a senior industry analyst at Bankrate who focuses on the credit industry. \"The cumulative effects of higher prices and higher interest rates have weighed on people,\" and it's showing up in data as well, Rossman says, citing increased late payment rates on loans, known as delinquencies.Yet, he says it's important to have a good credit score, not just because it allows you to access loans and credit cards, but also because landlords, utility companies, cell phone providers and even some employers may review your credit to assess your financial trustworthiness.If your credit score has taken a hit this year, there isn't much you can do to erase your history, but Rossman says there are steps you can take to rebuild your credit. Going forward, \"try to fill your report with positive info,\" he says.Strategies to increase your credit scoreHere are some examples of how you can add positive information to your credit report, according to Rossman:Pay off your balanceMake on-time paymentsHave someone add you as an authorized user on their accountSign up for alternative data reporting programsConsider credit-building productsThe first and best things you can do to increase your credit score are pay off your balance and make on-time payments going forward, Rossman says. Making multiple payments per period to keep your debts low can also boost your score, he adds.From there, consider asking someone with better credit, such as a family member, to add you as an authorized user on their credit card, he says. As an authorized user, the main account's positive payment history, age and low utilization can appear on your credit report, helping \"piggyback\" their good credit to boost your score, Rossman says.You could also sign up for alternative data reporting programs that report on-time rent, utility or subscription payments to credit bureaus, Rossman says, or look into safe credit-building products, like a secured credit card or credit-builder loan.Products that build credit can help if used correctly, but they also come with costs, potential negative reporting and limited impact in some credit scoring models. It's wise to compare costs and understand what is actually reported and to which bureaus, Rossman says.With any of these steps, it comes down to managing your cash flow and keeping the balance on your credit cards low, a metric called credit utilization, says Dean Tsantes, a certified financial planner and financial advisor at VLP Financial Advisors in Vienna, Virginia. Like paying off your balances, keeping your credit utilization low is another way to show lenders you can manage credit responsibly, which can help improve your credit score.\"Look at how much cash you have coming in and see where you can utilize some of the cash you have to lower the balance on some of the larger balances you may have,\" Tsantes says. \"That's going to lower your utilization and increase your credit.\" Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesHoliday road-trippers are feeling some relief at the pump this year.The average price of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. has been below $3 a gallon for most of the month — the lowest level since 2021, according to AAA. The association said it's shaping up to be the cheapest December for drivers filling up their tanks going back to the pandemic year of 2020.Fuel prices are down about 7% from a month ago, AAA data shows, and have tumbled roughly 43% from mid-2022 highs near $5 a gallon that followed runaway inflation in the wake of the pandemic.The latest slide in prices comes as AAA forecasts a record of more than 122 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home in the 13 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 1. AAA found nearly nine of 10 people on the move during the period — or close to 110 million — are expected to travel by car.The drop in pump prices may help mitigate the impact of lingering inflation elsewhere during the holiday season.Just over 40% of those polled said they planned to spend less at the holidays this year, a 6-point increase from a year ago, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey. Of those who are pinching pennies, 46% blamed the high cost of goods.The national average masks wide, regional variances, as Hawaii and California both recorded average gas prices above $4 on Monday. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, a gallon came in just below $2.30.",

    "body": "Novo Nordisk shares received a much-needed end of the year boost as the Wegovy maker became the first drugmaker to secure approval of a GLP-1 pill for weight loss, in what one analyst called a \"redemption for the investors\" after the stock's worst year ever. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly, which has also filed for FDA approval for its oral weight loss drug orforglipron.\"As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey,\" said Novo CEO Mike Doustdar in a statement late Monday.Shares closed 9.2% higher Tuesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconEli Lilly shares have outperformed Novo Nordisk in 2025.Novo plans to launch oral Wegovy, or \"Wegovy-in-a-pill,\" in the U.S. – by far its largest market– in early January 2026. The company has also submitted the pill for approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities.Wegovy's starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month, Novo said.Cash-paying patients can access it for the same price via President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, according to the deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Drug pricing has been top of mind this year as the U.S. looks to reduce the costs paid by consumers.Redemption for investors?The approval caps a turbulent year for Novo, which has been marked by multiple guidance cuts, mass layoffs, dramatic leadership shakeups, and a high-profile public bidding war against U.S. rival Pfizer.Novo's latest news \"is a redemption for the investors,\" Danish Jyske Bank analyst Henrik Hallengreen Laustsen told CNBC, especially after a year in which shares halved in value as confidence faltered in Novo's ability to compete with Eli Lilly and others.\"A welcome 'Christmas gift' for Novo investors — and for patients as New Year weight-loss resolutions typically kick in — given that Novo expects to launch the product in early January 2026,\" Hallengreen Laustsen said.\"The Wegovy pill represents a key growth driver over the coming years and a critical competitive tool versus Eli Lilly, which is expected to receive approval for its oral obesity drug in March–April 2026,\" he said, adding that the Wegovy pill's approval covers both weight management and reducing the risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as strokes and heart attacks. watch nowNovo's clinical data looks \"fantastic,\" Rajesh Kumar, who heads up European life Sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.\"Efficacy-wise, Novo's product, on the clinical trials at least, looks better,\" Kumar said. \"Tolerability looks quite attractive compared to [Lilly's orforglipron].The Wegovy pill has so far shown that it can help patients lose on average 16.6% of their body weight over about a year. Meanwhile, Lilly's pill resulted in 12.4% weight loss in a late-stage clinical trial.\"Novo actually might have an edge, and it will entirely depend on how they execute,\" he added. Even so, oral Wegovy must be taken on an empty stomach, and that might make it easier for doctors to prescribe orforglipron — which doesn't have the same restrictions — to patients because of compliance, Kumar noted. Novo has said it doesn't see oral Wegovy's food restriction as a significant barrier, as it can be taken in the morning on an empty stomach and then only requires patients to wait about 30 minutes before eating.Lilly reported positive findings from a maintenance trial where patients switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy. This may help Lilly \"keep a bit of market share,\" Kumar said. \"That's the thing we have to watch,\" he added. Worst year everEven as analysts and investors alike are mostly optimistic about the Wegovy pill U.S. launch, investors will be watching how Novo and its new pill will fare in relation to Lilly's oral version. A first-mover advantage is no guarantee for future sector dominance and success.Ozempic, which contains the same active ingredient semaglutide as Wegovy but is approved for treating type 2 diabetes, had a four-year head start on Lilly rival Mounjaro. Still, Lilly has now overtaken Novo in terms of U.S. prescriptions as Novo has struggled to meet demand, allowing a market for compounding pharmacies to flourish. Lilly's jabs have also been shown to lead to greater weight loss.It has led Novo shares to plummet about 50% in 2025, in the stock's worst year on record.Investors have also voiced concerns about Novo's pipeline and how it might not stack up to Lilly's and other hopeful market entrants such as heavyweights Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Roche.— CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "When Chelsea Hirschhorn started her company, she didn't buy into the expectations of how a \"traditional founder\" would approach the business, she says. According to Hirschhorn, the founder and CEO of Frida, a fertility, pregnancy and infant product company, \"a lot of founders are celebrated for going fast and breaking things.\" However, her approach to building Frida was \"a little bit more measured,\" she told CNBC's Julia Boorstin on the latest episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast.Her penchant for \"organization and thoughtfulness\" doesn't hold her back, said Hirschhorn, a 2025 CNBC Changemaker. In fact, she considers it her superpower as a leader.Still, before launching Frida, Hirschhorn had to learn how to get comfortable with taking on new challenges.\"From a career perspective, I'm very ambitious,\" she said, but prior to starting her company, she described herself as \"pretty risk-averse.\"Hirschhorn worked as a bankruptcy attorney before she launched Frida. After a neighbor gifted her a NoseFrida, a Swedish nasal aspirator designed for babies, Hirschhorn saw potential in the product and decided to buy the neighbor's business selling the devices.In 2014, Hirschhorn launched Frida with the NoseFrida as its flagship product.It was a difficult decision for Hirschhorn to leave her previous career, she said, and she \"needed a lot of encouragement\" from her husband, who now serves as the president of Frida, to take the leap. True to form, Hirschhorn took a careful approach to scaling her business, and she decided from the beginning not to raise venture capital funding to build Frida.  Rapid growth was \"never our objective,\" she said.\"I approached the business building with a level of practicality and a measured pace, I think, that is not necessarily a reflection of a traditional founder,\" she said.That approach, along with a level of \"comfort with bucking the trend,\" have been consistent threads in her story as a founder, Hirschhorn said – and it helped her build a \"winning strategy\" for the company.How her leadership philosophy has developedHirschhorn described her current leadership style as \"empathic, transparent\" and \"informed by the stage of life that I'm in,\" she told Boorstin.When Hirschhorn first launched Frida, she was \"singularly focused on building the actual foundation for the business\" and prioritized \"achieving certain milestones\" in Frida's growth trajectory, she said.She led \"with the expectation that other people sort of follow my lead as far as the rigor and the work ethic and the commitment,\" she said.Since then, her leadership philosophy has \"evolved meaningfully,\" she told Boorstin. Today, she prioritizes empathy and strives to be \"comprehensive in my understanding of different people's motivations.\"Her leadership style has also been informed by her experiences as a working mother, she said.Hirschhorn is aware of \"the dynamics that mothers face and the trade off and sacrifice of personal and professional ambitions and time management,\" so she offers perks like weekly manicures and haircuts for her team. From the outside, those perks may not seem \"that significant or meaningful,\" she said, but they represent her commitment to prioritizing well-being.Follow and listen to every episode of the \"CNBC Changemakers and Power Players\" podcast on Apple and Spotify.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

He said Landry understands \"how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World.\"Landry, in a post on his X account, thanked Trump for the appointment and said, \"It's an honor to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationIn a follow-up post on Monday, Landry reiterated that he will not be leaving his post as Louisiana governor and detailed his role. \"All we're gonna do is go have us a great conversation with those folks in Greenland,\" Landry said. Trump has long sought to acquire Greenland from Denmark, first floating the idea in his first term due to the island's strategic location and rich mineral bounty. He made a push again for the island when he was elected in 2024, but was rebuked by both Greenland and Denmark despite dispatching Vice President J.D. Vance to the island in March.The Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen on Monday said that he was \"deeply upset\" by Landry's appointment and that he would summon the U.S. ambassador to Denmark over it.

    "body": "watch nowCitadel plans to return about $5 billion in profits earned in 2025 back to investors at the beginning of next year, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The firm's flagship multistrategy fund, known as Wellington, gained 9.3% in the year through last week, the person said, who asked not to be named discussing performance details. The profit being returned is not all that was generated in 2025, the person said, but rather, a way of constraining capital to better match what the firm sees as the opportunity set going into the new year. As such, Citadel will start 2026 with $67 billion in assets, down from the $72 billion it currently manages, the person said. A spokesperson for Citadel declined to comment. The firm does not opt for profit distributions every year, but since 2017 (and including what's expected to be given back this year), Citadel has returned $32 billion in profit to its investors. Citadel has been ranked the most profitable hedge fund based on net gains since inception, according to LCH Investments. Through 2024, Citadel has generated $83 billion in net gains since it was founded in 1990. It is anticipated that number will jump to more than $88 billion when the new rankings come out in January.",

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration will start garnishing the wages of student loan borrowers in default in early January, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Education confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. It will be the first time a portion of borrowers' paychecks has been at risk since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, when collection activity was halted. Starting the week of Jan. 7, the Education Department expects around 1,000 defaulted student loan borrowers to receive notices of administrative wage garnishment, the spokesperson said. After that, the number of notified borrowers will continue to increase. The U.S. government has extraordinary collection powers on federal debts, and it can seize borrowers' federal tax refunds, wages, and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.The Education Department can seize up to 15% of a student loan holder's after-tax income to put toward their debt. By law, borrowers must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

    "body": "Frederic J. Brown | Afp | Getty ImagesDETROIT – The U.S. automotive industry has entered a new phase for all-electric vehicles: realism. The industry was euphoric about the EV segment in the early 2020s, but consumer demand never took off as much as expected and, as it fizzled, automakers monitored and planned how to react. Now, they're pivoting, as companies have wasted billions of dollars in capital, Detroit automakers are refocusing on large gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, and many have admitted that policies, not consumers, were driving the charge for EVs.\"We have to make the investments to get to ... the regulatory environment they set. We've seen a complete change in that. One way, 180 degrees. One way, 180 degrees back. That's the world CEOs of automakers are living in,\" GM CEO and Chair Mary Barra said earlier this month during The New York Times' DealBook conference.How automakers like GM that invested heavily in EVs will respond over the next year will be telling for the future of the vehicles in the U.S., according to industry insiders and experts. Barra said \"it's too early to tell\" what true demand for EVs is following the end of up to $7,500 in federal incentives in September to purchase an electric vehicle. She said the industry will likely find its natural demand over the next six months.In the meantime, GM continues to reassess its EV plans after disclosing a $1.6 billion impact from its pullback in those investments, with more write-downs expected in the future. Ford Motor last week said it expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments.\"We evaluated the market, and we made the call. We're following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNBC last week.watch nowU.S. EV sales peaked in September, ahead of the federal incentives ending, at 10.3% of the new vehicle market, according to Cox Automotive. That demand plummeted to preliminary estimates of 5.2% during the fourth quarter.\"The long-term direction toward electrification remains clear: The future is electric. However, the timeline is being recalibrated,\" said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox director of industry insights. \"In the near term, automakers will continue to adjust their strategies and significantly expand hybrid offerings to meet consumers where they are today.\"Most industry experts, including those at consulting firm PwC, don't believe it's the end days for EVs, but rather that expectations are more realistic now. PwC expects the EV industry to pick up toward the end of this decade, with EVs forecast to make up 19% of the U.S. industry by 2030.\"As several of the U.S. [automakers] have announced, there's some level of charges, and we got out in front of the customer demand and likely the infrastructure that's otherwise available here in the U.S.,\" C.J. Finn, U.S. automotive industry leader for PwC, told CNBC.'What is the normal state of EVs?'That projected EV market share doesn't justify the billions of dollars companies have spent on the research, development and production of the vehicles, so automakers are significantly altering their plans to allow customers more choice of all-electric vehicles, hybrids and traditional internal combustion engines.\"If you think back a few years ago, it was like, 'If you're not all-in on EV, you're going to eventually go out of business. Your terminal value is zero,'\" KPMG partner and U.S. automotive leader Lenny LaRocca told CNBC. \"Now I think that multi-propulsion technology approach is what's panning out to work out well. We used to call it the 'mosaic of powertrains.'\"A NYC charging station seen in the Yorkville neighborhood of New York City.Adam Jeffery | CNBCThe changes have taken different forms for companies that have already heavily invested in EVs.GM, which was by far leading in such investments in the U.S., will continue to offer its current models but has little to no plans of expanding in the future, according to Barra. Instead, it will use some of its planned capacity for increased production of large trucks and SUVs. The automaker also has said it plans to offer plug-in hybrid vehicles in the years ahead, but it hasn't disclosed many other details.Ford has said it will refocus investments on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models rather than pure EVs; cancel a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller, more affordable EVs; and rebalance its investments in core products such as trucks and SUVs.And Stellantis is deprioritizing EVs, including for its coveted Jeep brand, as it attempts to revive its U.S. sales. \"All of us are waiting to see what the demand is, how it's going to continue to shake out,\" Jeep CEO Bob Broderdorf told CNBC. \"The [EV] industry will slide. It's going to slow down. And then what is the normal state of EVs?\"Read more CNBC auto newsFord to record $19.5 billion in special charges as it pulls back on EV plansRivian's AI, autonomy impress Wall Street, but EV and capital concerns remainRobotaxis in 2025: Waymo plots global expansion as Zoox, Tesla roll to the starting lineInside Ford’s new HQ: Rotisserie chickens and design secretsHyundai, which also invested billions in EVs, is taking a mixed approach compared with its peers. Like GM, it plans to continue offering its current models but it is also expected to have new models coming. On the other hand, like Ford, it's decided to more heavily emphasize hybrids and allocated production at a new $7.6 billion plant for Hyundai and Kia vehicles in Georgia.Others such as Honda, Nissan, Porsche, Volvo and Jaguar that announced ambitious plans for EVs have canceled or significantly scaled back those goals. GM also has backtracked on its pledge to exclusively offer EVs by 2035, including several of its brands before that time frame.The Tesla effectA litany of factors played into the current EV marketplace, including industry dynamics and external factors such as pressure from Wall Street and political whiplash from the Trump and Biden administrations.\"No doubt the policy had a big impact on customer demand. The net-net is the market's changed,\" Farley told CNBC last Monday.The bullishness around EVs began with the rise of Tesla. The company, which remains the U.S. leader in EV sales by a wide margin, was able to significantly boost sales and its market valuation from Wall Street analysts at the beginning of this decade.That led other automakers to take notice and, as the industry does, attempt to replicate Tesla's success, according to officials. But what executives didn't realize was consumers were buying Teslas — not just any EV. \"Tesla wasn't creating a battery-electric vehicle market. They created a market for the Tesla brand.\" said Stephanie Brinley, associate director in AutoIntelligence at S&P Global Mobility. Tesla vehicles were, and continue to be, a \"tech-buy\" of software-first products that just happened to be EVs, Brinley said. The company also set up its own charging network and created a tech-savvy customer base of loyalists who looked past many quality and growing pain issues.A Tesla Cybertruck near General Motors' Renaissance Center world headquarters in Detroit.Michael Wayland / CNBCThat success led Wall Street to seek out the \"next Tesla,\" ushering in an unsustainable amount of new companies. From 2019 to 2022, nearly a dozen EV carmakers went public as well as a litany of related ones. Most of those have gone bankrupt amid federal investigations, scandals and executive upheaval.\"The attention that Tesla got woke everyone else up. But now there's competition, and there's competition from trusted, known and respected brands,\" Brinley said. The euphoria surrounding EVs started waning as companies kept spending with little to no success and \"legacy\" automakers entered the market, investing big sums to bring unprofitable vehicles to market.Hopes for profitable EVs further eroded with the second inauguration of President Donald Trump this year. Trump has killed or rolled back many of the Biden administration's support and funding for the sale and production of EVs. The biggest blow was in September with the end of up to $7,500 federal incentives for the purchase of an EV. \"The end of federal incentives came to an abrupt stop at the end of Q3, driving a lot of demand and sales for the new and used market,\" Jeremy Robb, Cox interim chief economist, said last week. \"Since then, we've seen the slowdown in both the pace of sales as well as the growth of new vehicle production. Next year will be pivotal for EVs.\"",

Many companies have opted to stay private for longer or get acquired as a turbulent initial public offering market has begun to rebound. Large companies such as Stripe and Databricks have found an influx of capital in private markets.  In the age of AI, companies are spending more on cybersecurity to protect against increasingly sophisticated threats. This year has also been significant for major cybersecurity deals as companies look to enhance their threat protection capabilities. That includes Google's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security startup Wiz and Palo Alto Networks' $25 billion deal for CyberArk. ServiceNow said Armis has topped $340 million in annual recurring revenue with 50% year-over-year growth, up from $300 million disclosed in August. ",

    "body": "Gold and silver have rallied this year — and prices keep climbing.Gold futures for February delivery rose settled 0.8% higher at $4,505.7, after hitting a record of $4,530.80 per ounce. Spot gold was up 1.03% to $4,491.23 per ounce. Meanwhile silver futures for March advanced 4.46% and was last seen at $71.62 per ounce, while spot silver was last trading at $71.4449, up 3.51%. Spot silver crossed $70 for the first time earlier in the session.   The metals have soared this year, smashing consecutive price records as sentiment shook on riskier assets amid fears of an AI bubble and uncertainty over the next Federal Reserve chair looking into 2026. Gold is typically viewed as a safe bet in times of economic or geopolitical uncertainty and is often used as a hedge.watch nowThe futures prices represent a fresh highs for the metals, topping Monday's record-breaking moves. David Neuhauser, CIO at Livermore Partners, told CNBC's \"Access Middle East\" that gold has more room to run — potentially hitting $6,000 per ounce. \"I think all metals, for the most part, are rising because they have been under-owned and there's a further risk that global debt around the world is just exploding, and therefore you need to own assets which will defend against that debasement. That's what you're seeing now. It's loud and clear, but it could continue for some time to come,\" Neuhauser said. ",

    "body": "watch nowNational Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said Tuesday that the Federal Reserve is not cutting interest rates quickly enough, even though the U.S. economy grew at a much faster-than-expected pace in the third quarter.Hassett, a leading contender to succeed Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends in May, said the artificial intelligence boom is boosting economic growth while simultaneously putting downward pressure on inflation. \"If you look at central banks around the world, the U.S. is way behind the curve in terms of lowering rates,\" the top White House economic advisor told CNBC in a \"Money Movers\" interview.U.S. economic growth came in at an annual rate of 4.3% in the third quarter, faster than the Dow Jones consensus of 3.2%. Hassett said 1.5% of that growth was due to President Donald Trump's tariffs reducing the U.S. trade deficit. The Fed lowered interest rates by a quarter point on Dec. 10, the third cut this year, but the central bank indicated that the pace of future reductions could be slower. Three Fed governors voted against the quarter-point move, the most dissents since 2019. After this month's meeting, Powell said the decision to cut a quarter point was a \"close call.\" Trump has repeatedly bashed the Fed for not lowering rates as quickly as he would like. Hassett's candidacy has raised concerns among some Fed watchers that he is too close to the president.Hassett told CNBC last week that the Fed's independence is \"really important.\" Trump said in an address to the nation last week that he will announce his nominee for Fed chair soon, emphasizing that he will pick \"someone who believes in lower interest rates by a lot.\"The president's prime-time speech focused on affordability. His approval rating on the economy stood at 37% in a CBS News/YouGov published Sunday. When asked about Trump's sagging approval rating, Hassett said public sentiment often does not reflect the economic numbers. \"In the end, it turns out that I think it has a lot to do with news coverage and how people are processing,  their glimpse of the outside world,\" Hassett said.

Pool | ReutersThe U.S. will increase tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports in June 2027, at a rate to be determined at least a month in advance, the Trump administration said in a Federal Register filing on Tuesday.But in the meantime, the initial tariff rate on semiconductor imports from China will be zero for 18 months, according to the filing from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.As part of an investigation that kicked off a year ago, the agency found that China is engaging in unfair trade practices in the industry.\"For decades, China has targeted the semiconductor industry for dominance and has employed increasingly aggressive and sweeping non-market policies and practices in pursuing dominance of the sector,\" the office said in the filing.The decision to delay new tariffs for at least 18 months signals that the Trump administration is seeking to cool any trade hostilities between the U.S. and China.

    "body": "A Starbucks barista demonstrates how to brew coffee using a siphon at the Reserve Store in Seattle.StarbucksWith tax season approaching, millions of workers could soon claim the \"no tax on tips\" deduction, which offers a tax break for returns filed in 2026. But some experts question which workers will benefit from the policy. Enacted via President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the provision allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 of \"qualified tips\" per year on federal returns from 2025 to 2028. The tips deduction phases out, or gets smaller, once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 for single filers or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly.   Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump's 'no tax on tips' deduction won't benefit some tipped workers.

Republicans enacted the capped deduction via their multi-trillion-dollar tax-and-spending package in early July.Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates released in November. But not all tipped workers qualify.Lowest earners can't claim 'no tax on tips'Both parties promoted the \"no tax on tips\" deduction as tax relief for working families. But the country's lowest earners may not be able to claim it, experts say.\"Low-income households do not benefit from no tax on tips because they already don't pay federal income tax,\" Elena Patel, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told CNBC. For 2025, workers won't owe federal income taxes until earnings exceed the standard deduction, which is $15,750 for single filers or $31,500 for married couples filing jointly. Above that, certain tax breaks, such as the earned income tax credit, can also reduce liability below zero.In 2022, more than one-third of tipped workers, 37%, owed no federal income tax due to low income, according to a 2024 report from The Budget Lab at Yale, a non-partisan policy research center. An analysis from the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank, showed similar findings. If tips were tax-free or tax-exempt, only about 60% of tipped workers would benefit, the organization reported in early 2025.watch nowSome tipped workers won't qualify Since the policy was first introduced, there have been questions about which occupations qualify for the \"no tax on tips\" deduction. The Treasury Department and IRS released a preliminary list of jobs in September. But certain workers who receive tips via a so-called \"specified service trade or businesses,\" or SSTBs, from industries including health care, legal, financial services, performing arts and others, are not eligible for the tax break. However, SSTB workers may be able to temporarily claim the deduction for 2025 until the Treasury and IRS finalize regulations, based on \"transition relief\" released by the agencies in November.  With lingering uncertainty about eligibility, \"it's possible to confuse people into thinking they will qualify for this for future years,\" said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation.

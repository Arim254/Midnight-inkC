    "body": "Gia Huynh is the founder of crystal candy company Silky Gem.Courtesy of Gia HuynhWhen Gia Huynh immigrated to the United States from Vietnam in 2016, like many other immigrants, life for her wasn't easy. For years, she worked 14-hour days at nail salons to stay afloat.At the time, she was in her 20s with just $50 in her pockets, Huynh told CNBC Make It. \"I was working at a nail salon pretty much seven days a week, from morning to night, 14 hours a day,\" she said. At one point, Huynh found herself homeless, living out of her car as a single mother with a 5-week old son. \"I was facing homelessness, and with a baby in my arm. I had nothing,\" she said.Today, she is the founder of Silky Gem, an online candy company known for their handmade crystal-like confections, also known as 'kohakutou' in Japan or 'mứt rau câu' in Vietnam. Her business brought in over $9 million in 2024, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.Scars from childhood Huynh was born in Dong Nai, Vietnam, and grew up in Ho Chi Minh City. She says she was the youngest of four siblings and grew up in a poor family.\"My dad used to just go in the jungle to chop bamboo and wood and things like that to sell. He's never home, really. He's always working. And my mom just, you know, worked [however] she [could] to put food on the table,\" she said.As a kid, Huynh's parents always had to work so they would often leave her in the care of their neighbor, who she called \"uncle\" at the time. \"It was a rough childhood,\" said Huynh. \"I [became a] domestic and sexual harassment victim [at age] four ... That was my first childhood memories, basically. It was under the man I call uncle.\"Gia Huynh (left) was born in Vietnam and immigrated to the U.S. in 2016.Courtesy of Gia HuynhIn school, she was often made fun of for her skin color and she didn't finish fifth grade. \"I was always got bullied, [people] called me names, just because I had darker skin, basically,\" said Huynh. \"Because I didn't graduate fifth grade, family and friends [would] always belittle me.\" This environment created mental scars for Huynh. She says she felt very underestimated and this manifested in her being very quiet and never speaking her mind. It wasn't until recent years that she's learned her own worth, she said.Homeless as a single motherIn 2016, Huynh immigrated to the U.S. with her husband and lived in Florida. She says that the first few years in the U.S. were extremely difficult and in some ways, life was easier back in Vietnam.\"In Vietnam ... even if I make a little money, it's still plenty for us to take care of our lives there. But [when] we moved [to Florida], it was a lot of struggle, because I was the main [source of] income for the family, and we were living out of my mother in law's house,\" she said.After about a year in the U.S. together, in 2017, Huynh and her ex-husband separated, largely due to financial struggles and conflict, she said. After that, she met her ex-boyfriend and had her first son.\"I had my son in 2019 with my ex-boyfriend and that was a very abusive relationship,\" said Huynh. \"I ended up losing everything on that relationship. I lost my job, I maxed out all [my] credit cards. I took my son out of [my ex-boyfriend's] house when he was only five weeks old and lived out of my car.\" After a few weeks of living out of her car with her newborn baby, Huynh decided to move to Maryland and got a job working at her sister's nail salon. However, since it was Covid, Huynh says she was barely making enough to get by and she had to be separated from her son for ten or more hours a day.She was determined to create a better life for her family and son, so she began to experiment with online business ideas. Starting Silky GemOn top of taking care of her son and working at the nail salon during the day, Huynh would experiment with her business ideas after she got home from work. From selling handmade soaps to bikinis, she says she tried out about six other online business ideas before landing on the idea of Silky Gem.In late 2021, Huynh was scrolling on social media when she saw a few videos showing creators eating crystal candy. Silky Gem brought in over $9 million in 2024.Courtesy of Gia Huynh\"I recognized the candy because we used to make it back home with my great grandma,\" said Huynh, adding that it was something they had during special occasions like Lunar New Year. \"I asked my mom, and she said ... we had the recipe for it. So that's when I started practicing.\"She was inspired to recreate the candy she loved as a child in Vietnam, and ultimately spent $500 on ingredients to start experimenting with the recipe in her own kitchen. \"After I come back from the nail salon, I play with my son, put him to bed and pretty much [make candy] from midnight to three, four in the morning,\" she said, adding that she'd then wake up at 6 a.m. to go to work the next day. By early 2022, she started selling her candy creations on Etsy and quickly began to make money.\"The first three months was hardest ... we were making like I would say, $600 to $1,000 a month, [but] I was so happy. That's enough for my son's diaper and milk,\" she said. In March that year, she landed her first influencer post, which went viral and brought in $3,000 that day. From there, sales grew quickly, said Huynh. In the first nine months in business, Silky Gem brought in over $1.8 million, she added. Founder of Silky Gem, Gia Huynh with her son.Courtesy of Gia HuynhToday, Huynh has been able to hire both of her parents, and they all help to run the business together. \"It has just been amazing ... It really changed what I view about myself,\" she said. \"My whole life, I believed that I'm worthless, useless. I don't have the skills, I don't have the education for any of this.\"One of the biggest lessons she's learned is that: \"You are your own enemy. You are the reason that you would fail in life,\" she said.\"I was blaming all the people about my confidence, my education and everything else. I was playing the victim card for my whole entire life,\" she said. \"But that's not true. You can do it if you put your mind [to it]. I didn't go to language school. I didn't graduate fifth grade, but because I put my mind to this, I make it work.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "Hampton Inn, Lakeville, MN.Google EarthHilton Hotels said Tuesday that it will sever ties with a franchise hotel in the Minneapolis area after a new video showed a desk clerk there refusing to book rooms for a person claiming to be a Department of Homeland Security agent.Hilton's statement came a day after the company that owns the location, Everpeak Hospitality, apologized for canceling a prior reservation for real DHS agents because of their work on immigration enforcement, and said that such a ban was not consistent with its policy of \"being a welcoming place for all.\"\"The independent hotel owner had assured us that they had fixed this problem and published a message confirming this,\" Hilton said in a statement Tuesday on the social media site X, which was also sent by a spokesperson to CNBC.\"A recent video clearly raises concerns that they are not meeting our standards and values,\" Hilton said. \"As such, we are taking immediate action to remove this hotel from our systems.\"\"Hilton is — and has always been — a welcoming place for all,\" the statement said. \"We are also engaging with our all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again.\"Hilton Hotel logo is seen on one of their hotels. John Lamparski | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesThe statement was posted hours after a tweet by the conservative independent journalist Nick Sortor, which contained a video of him visiting the Hampton Inn by Hilton Lakeview Minneapolis on Monday night — hours after Everpeak issued its apology — and trying to book 10 rooms for what Sortor said were DHS employees.\"So, we're not accepting people from Immigration, ICE agents, DHS into our property,\" the clerk said. \"That's just our management, ownership.\"When Sortor said he thought the policy had changed \"today\" — Monday — the clerk replied, \"I just talked to the owner of the building, and he didn't say there had been any changes.\"\"Yeah, it's just policy,\" the clerk said. The clerk, who also said \"I'm new here,\" then repeated that he had not been informed of any policy changes, and he offered to speak to the owner. When the clerk returned, he said he had been unable to reach anyone in authority because of the late hour.Immigrations, Customs, and Enforcement officers question a man's status on Lake Street near a Somali mall called the Karmel Mall in Minnesota, United States on December 10, 2025.

The raise took effect on the same date.Buffett has championed Abel in his new position. The investor told CNBC's Becky Quick in May that he would rather have Abel handle his money \"than any of the top investment advisers or any of the top CEOs in the United States.\"\"It is a huge endorsement, but it's an endorsement we've made,\" Buffett told Quick.Prior to taking the helm at Berkshire, Abel was vice chairman of the company's non-insurance operations.

Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersElon Musk's xAI said it raised $20 billion in a funding round, exceeding its prior target of $15 billion. CNBC reported in November that a financing would value the artificial intelligence startup at about $230 billion. After an initial report that xAI was raising $15 billion, Musk called the story \"False\" in a post on X.Investors included Nvidia and Cisco Investments as well as long-time Musk company backers Valor Equity Partners, Stepstone Group, Fidelity, Qatar Investment Authority, Abu Dhabi's MGX and Baron Capital Group. Both Nvidia and Cisco work with xAI as vendors and strategic partners.AI startups reached sky-high valuations in 2025, raising massive amounts of capital to power seemingly endless demand for their foundational models. In October, OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion share sale at a $500 billion valuation, and a month later Anthropic was valued at around $350 billion, with capital coming from Microsoft and Nvidia. Musk's AI venture now owns and operates his social network X after merging with the company, formerly known as Twitter, in March. The company faces a new flurry of regulatory probes by authorities in Europe, India and Malaysia after its Grok chatbot generated sexualized images of children and non-consensual intimate images of adults, mostly women. Users shared the images widely on X.Musk is centering xAI's infrastructure buildout in Memphis, Tennessee. The data centers, which use natural gas-burning turbines as a power source, have drawn consternation from many nearby residents, as emissions have contributed to air quality problems in the area, according to local researchers.Despite its controversies, xAI landed a deal with the Department of Defense, which recently added Grok to its AI agents platform.

But he also said, \"We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense.\"\"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you,\" Trump said separately on Sunday aboard Air Force One.Gallego on Monday introduced an amendment to the Senate Defense Appropriations bill to prohibit the use of funds for military force against Greenland.Sen.

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the 2026 CES event in Las Vegas, Jan. 6, 2026.Bridget Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang on Tuesday said that the company is seeing \"very high\" customer demand in China for its H200 AI chips, which the U.S. government recently signaled that it would approve for export. Huang added that Nvidia has started producing the chips again and is working out the final details about export licenses with the U.S. government. Nvidia's chips are critical for companies developing artificial intelligence models. \"We've fired up our supply chain, and H200s are flowing through the line,\" Huang said at a press conference at the CES conference in Las Vegas. Investors see the Chinese market as a massive opportunity for Nvidia as the country's tech companies develop their own AI models. Huang has previously said that the market could be worth $50 billion per year, and none of those sales are currently included in Nvidia's forecasts.In December, President Donald Trump said that Nvidia could export its H200 chip to China as long as the company paid 25% of those sales to the U.S. government. The H200 is a generation or two behind the latest Nvidia models, but unlike previous chips that Nvidia was approved to export to China, this model has not been slowed down on purpose to comply with export restrictions.China must also approve the import of Nvidia's chips. Huang on Tuesday said that he is not expecting China to make an announcement that imports have been approved and that Nvidia would know the regulatory status as purchase orders come in. \"We're not expecting any press releases, or any large declarations,\" Huang said. \"It's just going to be purchase orders.\"Huang added that any H200 sales would be in addition to the $500 billion two-year forecast the company provided last year. \"It appears that we're going to be going back to China,\" Huang said.WATCH: Nvidia is clearly the chips leader in AI trade, says Silvant Capital's Sansoterrawatch now",

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesCalifornia Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa died Tuesday, his office announced. He was 65. \"Early this morning Congressman Doug LaMalfa returned home to the Lord. He leaves a lasting legacy of servant leadership kindness to the North State,\" LaMalfa's chief of staff, Mark Spannagel, said in a statement. \"Congressman LaMalfa cared deeply for the people he served and worked tirelessly to hold the government to its word to fix our failing forests, build water storage, and leave people to be free to choose what is best for themselves.\"LaMalfa's death tightens the razor-thin House majority and could imperil Speaker Mike Johnson's grip on the chamber. The House stood at 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., resigned on Monday. LaMalfa's death brings the House to 218 Republicans. Democrats are favored to pick up additional seats from special elections in the coming months. Two Democrats are in a runoff in Texas at the end of the month, and the election to replace now-New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will take place later this year. LaMalfa represented California's 1st Congressional District since 2013. He chaired the Congressional Western Caucus. LaMalfa died in the hospital while undergoing emergency surgery, the Butte County Sherriff's Office said in a statement. He was brought to the hospital by ambulance after suffering a medical emergency at home. \"In accordance with standard protocols, the Coroner's Unit of the Butte County Sheriff's Office is conducting an investigation to determine the cause of death. A forensic pathologist is scheduled to conduct an autopsy as part of this investigation,\" the statement read.

Doug LaMalfa dies at 65, GOP saysClassified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro captureRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's ousterA rice farmer by trade, LaMalfa was a key player on California water issues and served on the House Natural Resources and Agriculture Committees. He also served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His electoral prospects, however, were increasingly at risk in 2026 after California adopted new congressional maps that favor Democrats. \"Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa,\" said House Speaker Johnson, R-La. \"He was as fierce of a fighter for his state's vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known.\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also expressed condolences for LaMalfa. \"A fourth-generation rice farmer, Rep. LaMalfa treasured his community, worked powerfully to protect California's farmers and served those he represented with principled purpose, from the state legislature to the United States House of Representatives,\" Jeffries said. President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned LaMalfa in remarks before the House GOP conference.\"He was a fantastic person,\" Trump said. \"He voted with me 100% of the time.\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a post to X that he's \"devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.\"\"Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,\" Emmer said. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom now has 14 days to announce a special election to replace LaMalfa, per California election laws. The election then must take place no more than 140 days after Newsom's proclamation -- potentially pushing an election to replace LaMalfa to June.Jeffries held a moment of silence for LaMalfa before a Democratic hearing on the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. \"A great member of Congress, from the great state of California,\" Jeffries said. Correction: There are 213 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. That fact was misstated in an earlier version of this article.",

    "body": "Packages in a United States Postal Service (USPS) truck near the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Monday, Nov. 24, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAmazon has angered some online retailers that say they didn't consent to have their products scraped and listed on the e-commerce giant's sprawling marketplace.In February, the company announced \"Shop Direct,\" a feature that lets consumers browse items from other brands' sites on Amazon. Some of those items include a button labeled \"Buy for Me,\" an artificial intelligence agent that can purchase products from other websites on a shopper's behalf.Amazon pitched the services, which are in testing phase for some U.S. users, as a way for shoppers to \"find any product they want and need,\" including items that aren't available on its site. Over the past decade, Amazon has increasingly turned to third-party merchants for products, and now says more than 60% of sales on its retail platform are from independent sellers. In recent weeks, some businesses began to object to their products being sold on Amazon without their permission, according to posts on Reddit and Instagram. Retailers, in some instances, said the program resulted in Amazon listing products that they never sold or that were out of stock.\"Sounds like a great program until the agentic AI starts selling customers things you don't have, all while your shop has no idea it's sending the wrong items to the customer,\" Hitchcock Paper, a Virginia-based stationery shop, said in an Instagram post in late December. The paper retailer said it discovered it was part of the program when it began receiving orders for a stress ball product, which it doesn't sell, from a \"buyforme.amazon\" email address. Bobo Design Studio CEO Angie Chua said she started receiving orders from Amazon's Buy for Me agent last week even though she hadn't opted in to the program. Her company sells stationery and journaling accessories through its Shopify website as well as a storefront in Palm Springs, California.Chua told CNBC that, based on Amazon's instructions in an FAQ on its site, she reached out to the company to request that it pull her products. The listings were taken down within a few days, but she said the experience left her feeling \"exploited.\"\"We were forced to be dropshippers on a platform that we have made a conscious decision not to be part of,\" Chua said, referring to an online retail model that involves selling products to shoppers without storing the inventory.watch nowMore than 180 businesses who sell their goods on Shopify, Squarespace, WooCommerce, Wix and other platforms have since contacted Chua to share that their products were also listed on Amazon without their permission, she said. An Amazon spokesperson told CNBC that Shop Direct and Buy for Me help customers find products not sold on its site, \"while helping businesses reach new customers and drive incremental sales,\" and that the programs have \"received positive feedback.\" \"Businesses can opt out at any time by emailing branddirect@amazon.com, and we remove them from these programs promptly,\" the spokesperson said. The company said product and pricing information are pulled from public information on a brand's website and that Amazon's system checks to make sure the item is in stock and the price is right. Amazon has said that Buy for Me remains an \"experiment\" and that it doesn't collect a commission when customers use it to make a purchase. In November, the company said the number of products available through Buy for Me had increased from 65,000 at launch to more 500,000.It's all part of Amazon's push into e-commerce agents, a technology that could potentially disrupt how people shop online. Companies including OpenAI, Google and Perplexity have released features that allow consumers to purchase products from retailers and online marketplaces without leaving a chatbot window. Amazon has blocked dozens of agents from accessing its site, while investing in its homegrown AI tools, and in November the company sued Perplexity over an agent in the startup's Comet browser that allows it to make purchases on a user's behalf. In the complaint, Amazon alleged Perplexity took steps to \"conceal\" its agents so they could continue to scrape Amazon's website without its approval. Perplexity called the lawsuit a \"bully tactic.\" In 2024, Amazon released its own shopping chatbot called Rufus, which now has some agentic capabilities.

    "body": "A startup in the clean-water space is making a curious bet on beer. Curious, because the beer is made from recycled shower and laundry water. San Francisco-based Epic Cleantec launched in 2015 as a wastewater recycling company using its proprietary technology to clean and reuse water in office and apartment buildings. At the time, CEO Aaron Tartakovsky said, \"We need to overhaul our flush and forget society.\" Now, he's taking it to the next level. \"A lot of it was psychology,\" he said. \"It is getting people comfortable with the concept of recycled water. And we found that if you tell people that the water is clean, maybe they trust you, maybe they don't. But you take those exact same molecules of recycled water, put them into a beautiful beer can, all of a sudden, people love it.\"For the beer, Epic's systems collect water just from showers and laundries and then run it through several treatment steps, including filters, biological treatment, membrane filtration, granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis and disinfection, according to the company. The resulting clean water is then taken to Devil's Canyon Brewing Co., where it's made into beer. The beer is available for online orders in California, Virginia, Oregon, Ohio, Kentucky, Vermont, New Hampshire, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Alaska and Washington, D.C., and in retail locations in California.It takes about 10 gallons of water to make a gallon of beer, so using recycled water has a huge impact on the water supply. Epic's IPA is also made with drought-resistant and energy-efficient hops, grain and yeast — emphasizing environmental impact from grain to glass. But, again, it's not about the beer. \"Buildings use about 15% of all the fresh water on this planet,\" Tartakovsky said. \"We need to do things differently, and that means we need to tell the story differently. We need to engage people differently.\"Jordan Langer, CEO of events company Non Plus Ultra, was an original investor in Epic when it was just about buildings. Now, he serves the beer at his events.\"I was a little bit skeptical. I'm not a believer in gimmicks,\" Langer said. \"But I was wrong. It blew up like crazy. It has given a lot of spotlight onto Epic Cleantec, which has made it really, quite, quite interesting.\"In addition to three family offices, Epic Cleantec is backed by J-Ventures, J-Impact and Echo River Capital. Total funding to date is $25 million. Epic currently has two beer offerings, Shower Hour IPA and Laundry Club Kölsch. Tartakovsky said the company is also considering making a nonalcoholic beer.— CNBC producer Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this piece.",

Carlos Barria | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it's delaying the international expansion of its Ray-Ban Display glasses due to inventory constraints and \"unprecedented\" demand in the U.S.\"Since launching last fall, we've seen an overwhelming amount of interest, and as a result, product waitlists now extend well into 2026,\" Meta wrote in a blog post. Due to \"limited\" inventory, the company said it will pause plans to launch in the U.K., France, Italy and Canada early this year and concentrate on U.S. orders as it reassesses international availability.

    "body": "Visitors to the OC Auto Show at the Anaheim Convention Center check out the newly unveiled Ford Expedition in Anaheim on Thursday, October 3, 2024.Leonard Ortiz | Medianews Group | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Ford Motor on Tuesday said its U.S. vehicle sales last year increased 6% to achieve the company's best annual sales since 2019.The Detroit automaker reported sales of 2.2 million vehicles in 2025, including a 2.7% uptick to more than 545,200 units during the fourth quarter. In 2019, the automaker sold 2.42 million vehicles in the U.S.Ford finished the year as the third-largest automaker in the U.S. behind Toyota Motor and domestic sales leader General Motors. Ford's U.S. vehicle sales for the year were largely in line with analyst expectations, such as those from Cox Automotive, which expects industrywide sales to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units in 2025.\"We're really pleased with where we finished the year,\" Andrew Frick, president of Ford's nonfleet vehicle businesses, said during a media call. \"As the year unfolded, we saw really good performance throughout. ... We outperformed the industry for 10 straight months.\"Ford's fourth-quarter performance came as it continues to battle production troubles with its F-Series pickup trucks due to two separate fires at a New York plant of key aluminum supplier Novelis.Frick said the automaker \"seems to be on track\" to offset lost production of tens of thousands of its lucrative pickup trucks this year, including adding another shift to a plant in Michigan.F-Series sales, including the popular F-150, were up 8.3% in 2025, but off 3.1% during the fourth quarter. Like many automakers, Ford's all-electric vehicles business notably declined 14.1% last year, including a roughly 52% plummet during the fourth quarter. A nearly 22% increase in sales of Ford's hybrid vehicles, which the company expects to grow, assisted in offsetting those losses.Traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines continued to dominate Ford's sales, representing about 86% of the company's volume in 2025.",

    "body": "Momo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesAs part of an ongoing effort to give 401(k) investors more access to guaranteed income in retirement, a bipartisan bill in Congress would allow some workers to use their retirement savings to buy annuities outside of their plan.The Retirement Simplification and Clarity Act, or H.R. 6324, would let employees age 50 or older roll over part or all of their 401(k) assets into a qualified annuity while still working. Although some plan sponsors may allow workers to make this move once they reach age 59½ — when distributions no longer are subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty — it is generally unavailable to younger employees.\"Right now, most people can't move money [from their 401(k)] into an annuity while they are still enrolled,\" said David Chavern, president and CEO of the American Council of Life Insurers, which supports the bill. \"This significantly limits their options as they start to turn their accumulated savings into needed income.\"Financial advisors say that the move is not a slam dunk for consumers, however.

The bill would require the IRS to redesign the notice in \"clear, straightforward language,\" according to the office of Rep. Jimmy Panetta, D-Calif., who cosponsored the bill with Rep. Darin LaHood, R-Ill. Lawmakers introduced the bill in November and referred it to the House Committee on Ways and Means, where it remains. While it has a handful of cosponsors, it's uncertain when or whether the measure will advance through the legislative process.Some plans offer annuities in their lineup The fear of not having enough income is prevalent among savers: 66% worry they'll run out of money in retirement, according to BlackRock's 2025 Read on Retirement survey. The majority, 93%, said they want a guaranteed income in their golden years. BlackRock — which offers its own annuity products for 401(k) plans — surveyed more than 450 plan sponsors, 1,300 plan participants and 300 retirees in early 2025.Additionally, more workers are reaching retirement age with a 401(k) and need to figure out how to stretch it over their lifetimes. That's in contrast to decades ago, when it was more common to retire with a company-sponsored pension that delivered steady income throughout retirement.Annuities are a way to address savers' concerns. Although an annuity might include an investment component, it's a contract: You hand over your money — often a lump sum — and the insurance company promises to issue regular payments to you across many years or decades. Already, some 401(k) plans are incorporating annuities into their lineups in various forms to help workers secure guaranteed income in retirement. The Secure Act of 2019, which made a variety of changes to the U.S. retirement system, included a provision intended to eliminate employers' fear of legal liability if their chosen annuity provider fails or otherwise doesn't deliver on its promises.Some 401(k) plans may provide a standalone annuity option, while others offer annuity-enhanced target-date funds. BlackRock is the largest provider of the latter, and Vanguard unveiled its own version last month.In simple terms, these are target-date funds that allocate some of your money toward a future annuity purchase. Target-date funds overall start out invested aggressively when you're far from retirement and gradually shift to less risky investments as you get closer to leaving the workforce.It may pay to leave your 401(k) money aloneHowever, the number of 401(k) plans that offer some sort of annuity remains low. Roughly $29 billion is invested in these funds as of early December, which is a tiny fraction of the more than $4 trillion invested in target-date strategies, according to Morningstar.In other words, most retirement savers who end up putting money into an annuity are still doing so after they leave their employer, not while they are employed.\"For someone without a pension who is anxious about running out of money, converting part of a 401(k) into a predictable monthly paycheck via an income annuity can be valuable,\" said certified financial planner Patrick Huey, owner and principal advisor at Victory Independent Planning in Naples, Florida.However, he said, doing this in your 50s when you still have many years of working ahead of you may not be the best time to pull money out of your 401(k).\"I'd say most people are better off leaving [their money] in a 401(k) for accumulation,\" Huey said. \"But there are times when locking in a guaranteed future income … might be warranted, especially for those with very low risk preferences.\"",

    "body": "Colorado residents fill out cards and share their stories for content to send to congressional representatives regarding health-care cuts on Nov. 1, 2025, the first day of ACA open enrollment, in Northglenn, Colorado.Tom Cooper | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesFor the first time in years, many Americans enrolled in a health insurance plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will need to keep a careful accounting of their annual income — or risk a hefty federal tax bill.Enhanced ACA subsidies lapsed at the end of 2025, leaving millions of households on the hook for higher insurance premiums. The lapse also reintroduced the so-called subsidy cliff, whereby households that earn even $1 more than a specific income threshold will lose all eligibility for subsidies, also known as premium tax credits.That income cutoff, which varies by family size, is $62,600 for a single person, $84,600 for a two-person household and $128,600 for a family of four in 2026, for example. watch nowMore than 2 million people enrolled in an ACA marketplace plan have an income near the subsidy cliff. ACA enrollees also tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it hard to predict their annual earnings, experts said. Households over the limit would have to pay back any federal subsidies they received for premiums — potentially worth thousands of dollars — when they file taxes next year for 2026.\"Starting February, March, April 2027 is when you'll start to see the horror stories of people with astronomical tax bills, from the payback of these credits,\" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, which was No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025. The potential financial impact is exacerbated by a multitrillion-dollar legislative package known as the \"big beautiful bill\" that Republicans passed over the summer, which stripped away guardrails capping the amount of excess subsidies households must repay, experts said. \"I don't know of anything else that's as penalizing in the tax code by adding one extra dollar [of income],\" Lucas said. \"You've got to be on your game starting now.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageOlder workers could use 401(k) money to buy annuities, under bipartisan billWho could see bigger tax refunds in 2026 from Trump's cutsACA subsidy cliff may mean 'astronomical tax bills' for many, CFP says2026 tax brackets could mean a slightly bigger paycheck — what to expectWhy estate planning helps 'forestall bad outcomes': 'My Mother's Money' authorSome ETFs compete on price, but fees shouldn't always be biggest concern: analystStudent loan forgiveness is taxable again: Plan for the 'tax bomb,' CFP saysUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

These 5 tips can helpOver 300,000 student loan borrowers were denied a new repayment planCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe total sum households need to pay back to the federal government \"could easily be $10,000,\" said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the Affordable Care Act program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. The sum depends on factors like age, geography and family size, Cox said. An older couple who inadvertently earn too much money and go over the subsidy cliff may need to pay back around $20,000, for example, she said.Congress could still extend ACA subsidiesThere's a chance Congress may still act to extend enhanced ACA subsidies in some form and prevent a surprise tax bill for many households next year. Democrats on Capitol Hill have said they want to extend them, while most Republicans have said they're opposed. However, a group of Republicans has recently engaged in bipartisan talks in the House and Senate that may yield legislative action. \"I think the chances are pretty slim something will pass,\" Cox said. \"From a personal finance perspective, you have to just count on nothing happening in Congress.\"Millions of people are near ACA subsidy cliff The subsidy cliff is in effect for the first time since Congress enacted enhanced premium subsidies in 2021 as part of a Covid-19 pandemic relief law.Now, households with an income in 2026 that exceeds 400% of the federal poverty line are ineligible for any premium tax credits. They'd be on the hook for the full, unsubsidized health insurance premium.For example, the average 60-year-old with an income of $62,000 would pay about $515 a month in health premiums, or approximately 10% of their annual income, according to a KFF analysis. This person would be eligible for premium subsidies.However, the same person earning $64,000 would pay $1,244 per month, about 23% of their income, since they would fall over the subsidy cliff, KFF found.Millions of people have an income near the subsidy cliff. In 2025, about 3% of ACA enrollees — nearly 725,000 people — earned between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty line, for example, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis of federal data.Another 7% — about 1.8 million people — earned 300% to 400% of the poverty line, it found. That equates to more than about $47,000 per year for an individual and about $96,000 for a family of four.\"People around that income [threshold] didn't have to worry about that for the past five years,\" Cox said.\"[Now], if your income is right around that threshold for subsidy eligibility, then you need to be really careful about how much money you're making,\" she said.How ACA premium tax credit worksAbout 22 million Americans received premium subsidies, also known as premium tax credits, in 2025. Households can opt to receive the tax credit in one of two ways: As a lump sum during tax season or as an advanced payment. Under the latter option, by far the most popular, the federal government issues the tax credit directly to a consumer's insurer, which then lowers the consumer's out-of-pocket premium. Consumers receive those advanced ACA subsidies based on an estimated annual income they provide when signing up for insurance. They must reconcile those subsidies during tax season and repay any excess tax credits to the IRS.watch nowACA enrollees tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it difficult to predict their annual pay accurately, Cox said.About one in five people, 21%, between 19 and 64 years old who shop for insurance on the ACA marketplace are in households with \"high levels of income volatility,\" according to a KFF study published in May. The researchers define volatility as a difference of at least 20% between estimated and actual income. Why you should know your ACA 'cliff number'The federal government determines eligibility for ACA subsidies based on \"modified adjusted gross income.\" Determining MAGI may be challenging, experts said. It's one's adjusted gross income — a line item on households' tax returns — with some other elements added back. The two \"biggies\" for most people are any tax-exempt interest, such as from municipal bonds, and any untaxed Social Security benefits, Lucas said. \"It's definitely important for people on the ACA to know their cliff number, their 400%,\" Lucas said. They should monitor their income monthly to see how it's trending, he said. \"There are ways to keep an eye on your income and even make changes mid-year to stay eligible for the subsidies, so you don't have a big surprise come tax time next year,\" Cox said. For example, households can consider making pre-tax contributions to financial accounts like a 401(k), individual retirement account or health savings account, which helps to reduce modified adjusted gross income, experts said. Additionally, retirees and other households may choose to draw money from Roth retirement accounts, which, with some exceptions, doesn't count toward taxable income. Savers can withdraw Roth contributions tax-free, even if they're not yet age 59½. Consumers who are still working and have some flexibility in their hours and work schedule might also opt to work less to reduce their annual earnings. ",

The stock fell about 3%.Here's how the company did versus LSEG estimates:Earnings per share: 93 cents adjusted vs. 89 cents expectedRevenue: $2.47 billion vs. $2.46 billion expectedRevenues grew 16% from $2.1 billion a year ago. Net income fell to $334 million, or 47 cents per share, from $351 million, or 49 cents per share in the year-ago period. Palo Alto's Chronosphere deal is slated to close in the second half of its fiscal 2026. The cybersecurity provider is also in the process of buying Israeli identity security firm CyberArk for $25 billion under CEO Nikesh Arora's acquisition spree.He told investors in an earnings call that Palo Alto is making this simultaneous acquisition to address the fast-moving AI cycle.\"This large surge towards building AI compute is causing a lot of the AI players to think about newer models for software stacks and infrastructure stacks in the future,\" he said. Palo Alto guided for revenues between $2.57 billion and $2.59 billion in the second quarter, the midpoint of which was in line with a $2.58 billion estimate. For the full year, the company expects $10.50 billion to $10.54 billion, versus a $10.51 billion estimate. Capital expenditures during the period were much higher than expectations at $84 million. StreetAccount expected $58.1 million. Remaining purchase obligations, which tracks backlog, grew to $15.5 billion and topped a $15.43 billion estimate. The rise of artificial intelligence has also stirred up increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks and contributed to tools for customers.

Instead, the agency said October payroll data will be released along with a full report for November. An unemployment rate for October will not be included in those figures because the data \"could not be collected,\" the BLS said, citing the shutdown. The agency also pushed back its November jobs data release to Dec. 16 from Dec. 5. The new date is six days after the Federal Reserve concludes its final policy meeting of the year — leaving the central bank with less information on the state of the economy. The delayed September nonfarm payrolls report is scheduled to be released on Thursday.Without the full October data — and following recent hawkish commentary from some Fed officials — traders may be pricing in a lower chance of another rate reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool at midday Wednesday showed there's a 63.8% chance that the Fed keeps its overnight benchmark rate steady in the 3.75%-4% range. That's up from around 50% earlier in the day. ",

    "body": "Job seekers speak with recruiters during the SacJobs Career job fair in Sacramento, California, US, on Thursday, Nov. 13, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday will release the September nonfarm payrolls number, ending a shutdown-induced blackout on official jobs data, albeit with a decidedly rear-window view.Due at 8:30 a.m. ET, the release is forecast to show a gain of 50,000 jobs in the public and private sectors, up from the initially reported 22,000 in August but still indicative of a soft labor market.Though the report will be backward-looking, it at least will provide some fodder for investors, economists and Federal Reserve officials who have had to rely on a host of private alternative data during the record-long shutdown in Washington, D.C. It will be the first BLS jobs report since the August release on Sept. 5.\"My sense is that the both the September report and the revisions for July and August will suggest a little bit brighter outlook than is commonly assumed, but not much to brag about,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"The labor market is holding in there, just like the economy.\"Coming a week after the government impasse ended, the data also is expected to show the unemployment rate at 4.3% while average hourly earnings increased 0.3% for the month and 3.7% from a year ago, all numbers unchanged from August, according to Dow Jones consensus estimates.Because the numbers are from September, they will provide only a little help for policymakers trying to navigate a difficult landscape and could be disregarded by markets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell recently referred to the situation as \"driving in the fog\" and cautioned against looking at further interest rate cuts as guaranteed while officials look for direction.While one month's jobs report will help clear up some of the way, visibility will remain limited.'Pervasive uncertainty'The BLS on Wednesday updated its release dates for the data points it produces.The bureau will not release October's jobs report separately, instead including it with the November report, which has been pushed to Dec. 16 from its original release date of Dec. 5. There will be no unemployment rate released for October due to household data that the BLS will not be able to collect. Similarly, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey will see a combined September and October release on Dec. 9.The BLS on Oct. 24 released September's consumer price index report only because it is used as a benchmark for Social Security cost of living adjustments.\"The economy is muddling through a period of pervasive uncertainty,\" Brusuelas said. \"Because of the duration of the shutdown, I don't think we're going to get a clean reading until early February on where the labor market's at.\"Nevertheless, other data, such as the private payrolls running tally from ADP along with layoff announcements from job placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas and a host of other indicators are providing some clues on where the labor market stands.In fact, Fed Governor Christopher Waller in a speech Monday rejected the notion that the Fed doesn't have enough data to make decisions.\"Policymakers and forecasters are not 'flying blind' or 'in a fog,'\" Waller said in a speech advocating a December rate cut. \"While it is always nice to have more data, as economists, we are skilled at using whatever available data there is to formulate forecasts.\"Judging by data revealed so far, Goldman Sachs holds an above-consensus view of 80,000 jobs created in September but sees a decline of 50,000 in October, due largely to the expiration of the federal government's deferred resignation program from cuts associated with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\"While we do not expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to produce an October unemployment rate, we estimate it likely would have increased, reflecting upward pressure from shutdown-related furloughs and increases in broader measures of labor market slack,\" Goldman economists Ronnie Walker and Jessica Rindels said in a note.In addition to the September headline number, Thursday's report also will include revisions for July and August. Both Brusuelas and the Goldman economists said they expect those numbers to come in higher than the previous counts.",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve officials were at odds during their October meeting over cutting interest rates, divided over whether a stalling labor market or stubborn inflation were bigger economic threats, minutes released Wednesday showed.While the Federal Open Market Committee approved a cut at the meeting, the path forward looks less certain. Disagreements stretched into the outlook for December, with officials expressing skepticism about the need for an additional reduction that markets had been widely anticipating, with \"many\" saying that no more cuts are needed at least in 2025.\"Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period,\" the minutes said. \"Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year.\"In Fed parlance, \"many\" is more than \"several,\" indicating a tilt against a December cut. However, \"participants\" does not denote voters. There are 19 participants at the meeting, but only 12 vote, so it's unclear how the voting members' sentiment is set for a December move.However, the notation jibes with a statement at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference. Powell told reporters that a December cut was not a \"foregone conclusion.\"\"In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee's December meeting,\" the minutes said.Previous to Powell's statement, traders had been pricing in a near certainty of another move at the Dec. 9-10 session. As of Wednesday afternoon, that had been reduced to about a 1 in 3 chance, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure of futures pricing. Odds for a January cut are around 66%.The minutes did note that \"most participants\" saw further cuts likely in the future, though not necessarily in December.Ultimately, the FOMC approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. But the 10-2 vote was not indicative of how split officials were at an institution not generally known for dissent.Officials generally indicated concern over a slowing labor market and inflation that has \"shown little sign of returning sustainably\" to the Fed's 2% target. The minutes reflected multiple camps within the committee.\"Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range,\" the minutes said.At the heart of the debate was a disagreement over how \"restrictive\" the current policy is for the economy. Some participants thought that even with the quarter-point cut policy was still holding back growth, while others saw that \"the resilience of economic activity\" indicated that policy is not restrictive.Judging from public statements, the panel is divided between inflation doves including Governors Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who prefer cuts as a way to stave off weakness in the labor market. On the other side are more hawkish members such as regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City, Susan Collins of Boston and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis, who worry that cutting more could prevent the Fed from getting to its 2% inflation goal.In between are moderates such as Powell, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and New York President John Williams who favor a patient approach.The minutes noted that \"one participant,\" a reference to Miran, preferred a more aggressive half-point cut. Schmid also voted no, saying he preferred not to cut at all.The meeting minutes indicated the decision-making was complicated by a lack of government data during the 44-day federal government shutdown. Reports on the labor market, inflation and a host of other metrics were not compiled or released during the impasse. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis have announced schedules for some of the releases but not all.Powell compared the situation to \"driving in the fog,\" though Waller on Monday rejected that comparison, saying the Fed has plenty of data to formulate policy.The minutes also discussed the balance sheet aspect of policy. The FOMC agreed to stop the reduction of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in December, a process that has shaved more than $2.5 trillion off the balance sheet, which is still around $6.6 trillion. There appeared to be widespread approval for the halting of a process known as quantitative tightening.",

Brian Rothmuller | Icon Sportswire | Getty ImagesMajor League Baseball officially announced a new three-year media rights agreement with NBC, Netflix and ESPN on Wednesday, foreshadowing the league's more significant TV deal to come in 2028.The new deal stems from ESPN's decision to opt out of its \"Sunday Night Baseball\" package earlier this year. ESPN struck a new deal with MLB, acquiring the rights to MLB.TV and a midweek game package. NBC Sports will take over the Sunday Night games, and Netflix will be the new home for the next three Home Run Derbies. All the deals begin with the 2026 season.CNBC previously reported most of the details of the agreement in August.\"Our new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBCUniversal and Netflix provide us with a great opportunity to expand our reach to fans through three powerful destinations for live sports, entertainment, and marquee events,\" said MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred in a statement.Get the CNBC Sport newsletter directly to your inboxThe CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.The new deal foreshadows MLB's quest to raise TV revenue at the end of the 2028 season, when it will get these rights back plus existing broadcast rights from Fox and Warner Bros. Discovery. While it's not an exact apples-to-apples comparison, MLB had to take a haircut of about $300 million per year relative to what ESPN had been paying before opting out earlier this year. NBC is paying about $200 million a year for its new package, and Netflix is paying about $50 million annually for the Derby, CNBC reported in August. The two packages, together, roughly make up what ESPN had been paying for.Even so, MLB has a chance to expand its reach through the new and streaming-exclusive partners.The average ESPN Sunday Night Baseball game averaged 1.8 million viewers this past season.The loss in revenue for the Sunday Night package suggests MLB may have to get creative with the way it carves up new packages of games in 2028 to ensure it continues to grow media revenue. In aggregate, the league is now making more in overall media revenue, but it needed to sell ESPN rights and games it hadn't previously offered. ESPN is paying about $550 million for its new package, CNBC reported in August.The NBA nearly tripled its national media revenue in its most recent rights deal, and the NFL is so confident it can generate a huge increase on the deal it signed in 2021 that it's open to accelerating talks with its current media partners as early as next year, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told CNBC in September.New deal detailsESPN's new deal allows it sell and distribute MLB.TV, the league's out of market streaming service, through the ESPN app. ESPN will also receive a new 30-game midweek package of live games on ESPN's linear networks and the ESPN app. ESPN also will sell and distribute MLB Network and in-market games for select MLB teams via the ESPN app. Those teams are the Cleveland Guardians, San Diego Padres, Minnesota Twins, Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies — franchises whose games have been produced and distributed by MLB after the collapse of regional sports networks that carried those teams.NBC will now have MLB, NBA and NFL on Sunday for its broadcast network, its new cable sports channel, and its Peacock streaming service. NBC will also carry MLB's entire Wild Card round, ranging from eight to 12 games each season. In addition to three years of the Home Run Derby, Netflix will own the rights to a singular game on Opening Night for the next three seasons. Netflix will also exclusively deliver all 47 games of the 2026 World Baseball Classic to its audience in Japan. Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC.",

The Defense Department will finance the U.S. portion of the venture with MP providing technical and marketing expertise. The binding agreement to form the joint venture comes after MP and Maaden signed a memoranum of understanding back in May. The agreement will \"significantly expand MP's global footprint\" and is structured to \"ensure U.S. oversight and alignment with national security objectives,\" the company said.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMP Materials stock over the past six monthsMP is also holding talks on a possible collaboration to standup magnet manufacuring in Saudi Arabia. The Pentagon struck a landmark deal with MP in July that includes an equity stake, a price floor, and offtake agreement. The Trump administration is investing in MP as it seeks to reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare earth imports and stand up a domestic supply chain. MP CEO James Litinsky has described the company as the U.S. \"national champion\" for rare earths. Rare earths are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, clean energy technology, semiconductor manufacturing and consumer electronics. Goldman Sachs initiated converage of MP on Tuesday with a price target of $77, implying about 32% upside from Monday's closing price. \"We believe MP's downstream expansion into refining and magnet production, accelerated by a partnership with the US government, will strategically position MP as a key supply chain component for rare earth refining and magnet production,\" Goldman analyst Brian Lee told clients.

The AI chip darling also gave a stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales forecast, with CEO Jensen Huang saying demand for its current-generation Blackwell chips is \"off the charts.\"Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index jumped 3.7% in early trading, while the Topix index added 1.67%. Chip-related stocks rallied on the index as investors cheered Nvidia's quarterly report, with tech conglomerate SoftBank skyrocketing as much as 8%, semiconductor equipment maker Tokyo Electron soaring nearly 7%, Lasertec adding 5.6%, and chipmaker Renesas Electron trading 4.8% higher. South Korea's Kospi index advanced 2.63%, and the small-cap Kosdaq was up 1.75%. The upbeat investor sentiment also extended to South Korea as index heavyweights, memory chip makers SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, added more than 6% and 3.3%, respectively.Australia's ASX/S&P 200 rose 1%.Futures for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index pointed to a slightly lower open, with the contract trading at 25,820, down from the index's previous close of 25,830.65.U.S. equity futures were higher in early Asian hours after Nvidia's upbeat guidance, which likely lifted investor sentiment around the AI trade, following recent sessions that reflected fears about elevated valuations, debt financing, and potential chip depreciation.\"Nvidia's numbers remain extremely strong now, but there are inevitably questions whether Huang's company has already reached its high-water mark in terms of growth and market share,\" said David Russell, TradeStation's global head of market strategy.Overnight, the S&P 500 gained 0.38% to close at 6,642.16, snapping a four-day losing streak, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.59% to settle at 22,564.23.

    "body": "Carson Block, Muddy Waters Capital, at CNBC's Delivering Alpha, Sept. 28, 2022.Scott Mlyn | CNBCMuddy Waters Capital's Carson Block, best known for his short-selling campaigns, took an unusually bullish stance at the Sohn London Investment Conference on Wednesday, pitching junior miner Snowline Gold as a top takeover candidate in the mining sector.Snowline, valued at about C$2.1 billion, has made what Block called a \"first-of-its-kind\" discovery in Canada's Yukon territory, a region with limited historical production but vast geological potential, he said. The company controls a large land package in an emerging district that Block said could eventually host a new multi-deposit gold camp.The focus is the Rogue project's Valley deposit, which holds an estimated 8 million ounces of gold in the measured and indicated category at an average grade of 1.21 grams per ton. While Snowline has other exploration targets, Block said Valley is likely the asset that will attract interest from major producers facing declining reserves.\"This is one of the few assets globally that can move the needle for a mid- or large-cap gold miner,\" Block's presentation materials stated, calling the firm \"an elephant.\"Block expects Snowline to be acquired within the next three years. If a transaction comes in the next 12 months, he sees a potential valuation of C$4 billion to C$6 billion, and suggested the price could rise further as drilling continues.\"The longer it takes for this asset to be bought, the more expensive it will be,\" he said.Snowline shares have surged more than tenfold since early 2022, when the company drilled its initial discovery hole at Valley. Still, Block argued the stock doesn't yet reflect the strategic value of the resource in a mining industry that has seen increasing consolidation.The Canadian-listed stock popped more than 6% after Block made his call. Carson Block will be on \"The Exchange\" with CNBC's Jon Fortt at 1 p.m. ET.",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (L), and Jensen Huang CEO of Nvidia.ReutersTwo months ago Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stood side by side in San Jose, California, to announce a historic agreement between the two leaders in artificial intelligence. Nvidia would invest $100 billion over a number of years, starting in 2026, as OpenAI's AI supercomputing facilities come online, the duo said. The timing of the buildouts and the cost of each data center weren't disclosed. But in Nvidia's quarterly financial report on Wednesday, the chipmaker reminded investors that there's a big difference between an announcement and a contract. \"There is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity or other potential investments, or that any investment will be completed on expected terms,\" Nvidia said in the risk factors section of its quarterly filing.Nvidia has been on an investing binge of late, putting its ever-expanding cash hoard to use, and financially supporting companies that buy its graphics processing units, or GPUs. In addition to the OpenAI arrangement, Nvidia on Wednesday highlighted its $5 billion commitment to invest in Intel during the quarter and its agreement this week to invest up to $10 billion in Anthropic.An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment but pointed to Huang's statements on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"\"There is no assurance that any investment will be completed on expected terms, if at all,\" Nvidia said. The key difference with OpenAI is the scale of the planned investment and the benchmarks that would need to be met for all the money to come through. A source told CNBC at the time of the announcement that an initial $10 billion would be available to OpenAI soon to help the company work towards deploying its first gigawatt of capacity.Altman said recently that OpenAI will end the year on a $20 billion annualized revenue run rate, which is a massive number considering its flagship ChatGPT product is only three years old. Altman said the company expects to reach hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue by 2030. But that figure doesn't come anywhere close to covering the company's expenses. In total, OpenAI has announced roughly $1.4 trillion in infrastructure spending with a number of partners as it seeks to continue building out its AI models and services. To get there, the company is reliant on outside capital. Despite the uncertainty of the September agreement, Nvidia executives continue to sound bullish on the company's work with OpenAI. On Nvidia's earnings call, after the chipmaker reported a solid revenue and earnings beat along with stronger-than-expected guidance, CFO Colette Kress touted OpenAI's growth.\"OpenAI recently shared that their weekly user base has grown to 800 million, enterprise customers has increased to 1 million and that their gross margins were healthy,\" Kress said. She added that the two companies are \"working on a strategic partnership\" and that Nvidia is \"focused on helping them build and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers.\"And Huang said, \"Everything that OpenAI does runs on Nvidia today.\"An OpenAI spokesperson didn't provide a comment, but pointed to Huang's commentary on the call, including his description of OpenAI as a \"once-in-a-generation company\" and his expectation that the investment will \"translate to extraordinary returns.\"There's no question that as OpenAI builds out data centers, it will keep spending money on Nvidia's chips. But OpenAI has also partnered with Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices, agreeing last month to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD's Instinct GPUs over multiple years and across multiple generations of hardware, beginning in the second half of next year. The AMD agreement has one critical component that Nvidia's lacks: signatures. As part of the pact, the company has issued OpenAI a warrant for up to 160 million shares of the chipmaker's common stock, with vesting milestones tied to deployment volume and AMD's share price. That agreement was signed on Oct. 5, by AMD CFO Jean Hu and OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar. — CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos and Ashley Capoot contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowBlock said Wednesday that it expects gross profit to increase in the mid-teens annually for the next three years, reaching about $15.8 billion in 2028. At the payment company's first investor day event since 2022, Block unveiled a three-year financial outlook. The announcements land as Wall Street has turned skeptical on Block's prospects, pushing the stock down by more than 30% in 2025, while major indexes have notched solid gains. Block shares were initially halted around the time of the announcement and then jumped 9% when trading resumed. The fresh guidance also comes two weeks after Block reported quarterly results, missing revenue estimates for a sixth straight time. Block has been diversifying away from its point-of-sale business, which has become increasingly crowded, launching more services tied to Cash App and offering artificial intelligence tools to sellers. Block said in its new outlook that adjusted operating income is projected to increase about 30% annually, topping $4.6 billion by 2028. Adjusted earnings per share will grow in the low 30% range, reaching $5.50 in three years.Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told CNBC ahead of the release that the company is entering a new phase of execution. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlock vs. Nasdaq this year\"Since 2022, our last investor day, we're nearly double the size from a gross profit perspective,\" Ahuja said, adding that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \"more than tripled.\"Block also introduced a new non-GAAP cash flow metric, designed to reflect the capital required to grow its lending products, which it expects to reach more than $4 billion, or 25% of gross profit, by 2028.For 2026, Block expects gross profit to rise 17% to $11.98 billion, with adjusted operating income and EPS both increasing more than 30%, to $2.7 billion and $3.20, respectively.Ahuja said Block has adopted a \"rule of 40\" investment framework. That typically refers to revenue growth rate plus profit margin exceeding 40. She said the company expects to reach that metric this year and has reorganized around a single roadmap with a shared technical infrastructure. \"That transformation has resulted in us moving faster, with more connected decisions across our ecosystem,\" Ahuja said. On Wednesday, Block also expanded its share repurchase program by $5 billion, adding to the $1.1 billion in remaining authorization as of Sept. 30. The prior buyback plan was for up to $4 billion in purchases. Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who co-founded the company as Square in 2009, was in attendance at the investor event. Dorsey has largely been out of public view in recent years. WATCH: Block shares drop more than 8% on quarterly misswatch now",

White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC in a statement, \"The White House maintains complete confidence in Secretary Bessent's job running the Treasury Department and President Trump's search for a new – and competent – chairman of the Federal Reserve.\"Trump went on to recite a conversation in which Bessent pleads with the president to let Powell finish out his term as chair, which is set to end in May 2026. \"I can't tell you — Scott: 'Sir, don't fire him. Sir, please don't fire him. He's got three months to go, don't fire him,'\" Trump said. \"I wanna get him out!\"Trump added that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is \"a little bit more for firing.\"\"I think Howard would say, 'Get him the hell out.'\"The remarks came shortly before the release of minutes from the Fed's October meeting, which show central bank officials were conflicted over whether to cut rates further. The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee ultimately approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4% at that meeting. The group will gather again in December. Trump has long criticized Powell for declining to slash rates as quickly and deeply as the president wants.At the White House on Tuesday, Trump said, \"people are holding me back,\" from firing Powell.He also said that his administration is talking to multiple candidates to succeed Powell.

    "body": "A home is shown for sale in The Heights in Houston, Monday, Oct. 27, 2025. Kirk Sides | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesThis is the strongest buyer's market in housing in more than a decade. That's the headline on a new report from Redfin, a real estate brokerage owned by Rocket Cos. The report points to specific data on the supply of homes for sale and the number of buyers actively looking. There were an estimated 36.8% more sellers than buyers in October, according to Redfin, the largest gap in records dating back to 2013. Redfin defines a buyer's market as one with at least 10% more sellers than buyers. Economists at the brokerage estimate that the last time there was a stronger buyer's market was in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when home prices plummeted across the nation. \"Of course, it's only a buyer's market for those who can afford to buy—many Americans have been priced out of the housing market as affordability has eroded,\" Redfin researchers noted. And that's the crux of the problem. Is it really a buyer's market, if so many buyers are still priced out and therefore not even looking?Real estate firms cite housing affordability as the biggest challenge to their business, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors. It far outweighs other challenges, including industry costs.\"Real estate firms are on the frontlines of the industry and are seeing firsthand how housing affordability and local economic conditions are impacting their clients,\" said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist.Home prices continue to weaken but, nationally at least, were still 1.2% higher in September from the year before, according to Cotality. Prices are roughly 50% higher nationally than they were just five years ago, pre-pandemic.\"Much like the K-shaped trend seen in overall consumer spending—driven largely by higher income groups—lower-income potential homebuyers are facing challenges due to an uncertain job market, sluggish wage growth, and worsening financial conditions. This is leading to weaker demand for homes and downward pressure on prices,\" said Selma Hepp, Cotality's chief economist. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Mortgage rates have come off their recent highs, but are still roughly twice what they were in the first years of the pandemic, when it fast became a seller's market.Cost remains the primary obstacle to homebuying, with about 75 of the top 100 housing markets still considered overvalued, according to Cotality. In Washington, D.C., which was hardest hit by the recent government shutdown, potential buyers — largely those who were unaffected by the shutdown — are discovering it is easier to get good deals. \"They are figuring out they have leverage and are finding they can seek price concessions and repairs,\" said Paul Legere, a buyer's agent with the Joel Nelson Group of Keller Williams, adding it \"feels like it might be a short moment in time.\"The shutdown may be over, but consumer sentiment is not pointing to a surge in homebuying. In its November sentiment survey, that National Association of Home Builders reported a drop in builder sales expectations over the next six months. \"We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ",

Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesA bill forcing the Department of Justice to release its files on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein officially passed both chambers of Congress on Wednesday, sending it to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.The bipartisan bill, which the House approved on Tuesday, passed immediately when it was sent to the Senate on Wednesday morning.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had secured a unanimous consent agreement, which allowed the legislation to sail through the upper chamber as soon as it was received.Trump said Monday that he would sign the bill, which would release all the DOJ's unclassified records relating to Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, among other information.It was unclear exactly when Trump would sign the measure. The president plans to review the bill as soon as he receives it, a senior White House official told NBC News Wednesday morning.The legislation received overwhelming support in the House, with all but one lawmaker, Republican Rep. Clay Higgins of Louisiana, voting for it on Tuesday.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsTrump on Sunday night urged his GOP allies to back the measure, a major shift in his stance that reflected the bill's growing momentum in Congress.But the president has continued to fume about the focus on Epstein, calling it a \"hoax\" being pushed by Democrats to distract from his administration's achievements. He has repeatedly lashed out at reporters when asked about his connections to the late financer, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges. Trump and Epstein were friends until the early 2000s, but the two had a falling out years before Epstein's death.When an ABC News reporter asked Trump on Tuesday why he has not released the Epstein files on his own — as he has the power to do — the president insulted her and called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Trump on the 2024 campaign trail suggested he would release files related to Epstein. In the early months of his second term, officials in his administration signaled they were pushing to disclose those files. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in February, for instance, that Epstein's rumored \"client list\" was \"sitting on my desk right now to review.\" The same month, a group of pro-Trump influencers received binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" at the White House.But those binders contained little new information. And the DOJ, in an unsigned memo in July, said that a review of its Epstein-related materials \"revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\" The memo also included the agency's conclusion that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"The announcement enraged both Democrats and some prominent voices in Trump's base. In subsequent months, scrutiny increased over Trump's past association with Epstein.In July, The Wall Street Journal reported the existence of a \"bawdy\" and cryptic note to Epstein bearing Trump's signature, which was part of a collection of letters gathered for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has denied writing the letter and filed a defamation lawsuit against the Journal's publisher and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.The House Oversight Committee last week released thousands of documents it had obtained from Epstein's estate through a subpoena, including emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email thread in 2018, Epstein wrote of Trump, \"I know how dirty donald is.\" In an April 2019 email to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\" CNBC has not independently verified the emails, and it is unclear what Epstein was referring to.House Democrats and a handful of Republicans sought to approve a discharge petition that would force a vote in the GOP-majority chamber on the bill to release the Epstein files. That effort was delayed for weeks by the government shutdown, which postponed the swearing-in of a Democratic lawmaker who would provide the last needed signature.This is developing news.

    "body": "ChatGPT for TeachersCourtesy of OpenAIOpenAI on Wednesday announced ChatGPT for Teachers, a version of its artificial intelligence chatbot that is designed for K-12 educators and school districts. Educators can use ChatGPT for Teachers to securely work with student information, get personalized teaching support and collaborate with colleagues within their district, OpenAI said. There are also administrative controls that district leaders can use to determine how ChatGPT for Teachers will work within their communities. OpenAI said it is initially launching ChatGPT for Teachers with a cohort of districts that represent roughly 150,000 educators. ChatGPT for Teachers will be free to K-12 educators in the U.S. through June 2027, the company said. \"Our objective here is to make sure that teachers have access to AI tools as well as a teacher-focused experience so they can truly guide AI use,\" Leah Belsky, vice president of education at OpenAI, told reporters during a briefing. The company said student data will be protected and that anything shared within ChatGPT for Teachers will not be used to train its models. Read more CNBC tech newsAnthropic valued in range of $350 billion following investment deal with Microsoft, NvidiaZoox begins offering robotaxi rides in San Francisco, facing off with WaymoGoogle announces Gemini 3 as battle with OpenAI intensifiesCloudflare blames 'unusual' spike in traffic before massive outageOpenAI rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its generic ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. It's faced criticism from teachers and parents who argue that students can use the tool to cheat and avoid engaging in critical thinking.ChatGPT for Teachers is not intended for students, but OpenAI said giving teachers hands-on experience with AI tools will help them understand and establish best practices in their classrooms.  \"Every student today is growing up with AI, and teachers play a central role in helping them learn how to use these tools responsibly and effectively,\" the company said in a blog post. \"To support that work, educators need space to explore AI for themselves.\"In July, OpenAI released a product within ChatGPT called \"study mode.\" Study mode was built with college-age students in mind, and it aims to help them work through problems step-by-step before they arrive at an answer.OpenAI said it built study mode as \"a first step in a longer journey to improve learning in ChatGPT.\"WATCH: Investors believe OpenAI will become the largest hyperscaler: The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newmanwatch now",

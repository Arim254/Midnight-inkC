    "body": "The Eli Lilly & Co. logo at the company's Digital Health Innovation Hub facility in Singapore, on Thursday, Nov. 14, 2024.Ore Huiying | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Thursday said its closely watched obesity pill helped patients maintain the majority of their weight loss after they switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy in a late-stage trial. The company also said it has filed for Food and Drug Administration approval of the daily GLP-1 pill, called orforglipron, for obesity. The FDA in November said it awarded a priority review voucher to that pill, which could expedite its review timeline to a few months. The positive trial data suggests that the pill could be an effective treatment for patients to transition to if they want to preserve their weight loss but don't want to take weekly injections long term. Many people who stop those shots regain much of the weight they initially shed. While Eli Lilly's pill appears to cause less weight loss overall than existing injections, Thursday's results highlight its potential role as a needle-free maintenance treatment in the blockbuster GLP-1 market. But an oral pill for obesity from Novo Nordisk will likely enter the market first, giving the Danish drugmaker a head start in staking its claim in the space.The phase three trial followed more than 300 patients with obesity who previously took Wegovy or  Zepbound for 72 weeks in a separate late-stage study. Those people were then randomized to take either Eli Lilly's pill or a placebo for another 52 weeks. The oral drug met the trial's main goal of demonstrating superior weight loss maintenance compared with a placebo, among people who previously experienced a plateau in their progress while taking the injections. On average, patients who switched to the pill from Novo Nordisk's Wegovy only regained roughly 2 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the trial. Meanwhile, on average, people who switched to the pill from Zepbound only regained around 11 pounds of the weight they initially lost by the end of the study. \"Obesity is a chronic, progressive disease, and sustaining weight loss remains a significant challenge for many,\" said Kenneth Custer, president of Lilly Cardiometabolic Health, in a release. He said the trial showed that the pill \"helped people maintain the weight they worked hard to lose\" and that, if approved, it could \"provide a convenient alternative for the millions of individuals living with obesity around the globe to continue their long-term health journey.\"While people in the Zepbound group appeared to regain more weight, the bigger focus is likely on those who transitioned from the drug's top competitor, Wegovy. In an October note, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said positive results from the trial could give Eli Lilly \"the unique opportunity to capture revenue share\" from chronic treatment with semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and diabetes injection Ozempic. \"Chipping away at the potential for Novo's flagship product,\" Seigerman wrote. The overall safety and tolerability – or how well patients handle treatment – of the pill were consistent with previous late-stage studies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal related and generally mild to moderate in severity. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsAround 4.8% of people who switched to the pill from Wegovy discontinued treatment due to side effects, while 7.2% of those who switched to the oral drug from Zepbound did the same. Meanwhile, those rates were 7.6% and 6.3% among patients who switched to a placebo from Wegovy and Zepbound, respectively. No liver safety issues were observed, according to Eli Lilly. Full results of the trial, called ATTAIN-MAINTAIN, will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting and published in a peer-reviewed journal next year. Eli Lilly's pill works in a similar way to Wegovy, Ozempic and Novo Nordisk's diabetes pill Rybelsus, targeting a gut hormone called GLP-1 to suppress a person's appetite and regulate blood sugar. Novo Nordisk is also seeking approval of an oral version of Wegovy for obesity, which could come by year-end.But unlike those three treatments, Eli Lilly's pill is not a peptide medication. That means it is absorbed more easily by the body and does not require dietary restrictions like Rybelsus or oral Wegovy does.In a note in August, Goldman Sachs analysts forecast that pills will capture a 24% share — or around $22 billion — of the 2030 global weight loss drug market, which they expect to be worth $95 billion in total.They said they expect Eli Lilly's pill to have a 60% share — or roughly $13.6 billion — of the daily oral segment of the market in 2030. They expect Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide to have a 21% share — or around $4 billion — of that segment.",

    "body": "An Olive Garden restaurant in Milpitas, California, US, on Tuesday, Dec. 16, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDarden Restaurants on Thursday reported strong sales growth, fueled by demand at Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse as thrifty diners look for good deals.For the second straight quarter, the company hiked its full-year outlook for revenue growth, although it only reiterated its projections for its earnings. \"The second quarter exceeded our top-line expectations as every segment delivered positive same-restaurant sales,\" Darden CEO Rick Cardenas said in a statement.Shares of the company rose nearly 3% in morning trading.Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.08 adjusted vs. $2.10 expectedRevenue: $3.1 billion vs. $3.07 billion expectedDarden reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $237.2 million, or $2.03 per share, up from $215.1 million, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier. Higher ingredient costs, particularly for near-record prices for beef, weighed on the company's restaurant-level margin, CFO Raj Vennam said on the company's conference call.Excluding restaurant closure costs and expenses related to its acquisition of Chuy's, the restaurant company earned $2.08 per share.Net sales rose 7.3% to $3.1 billion.Darden's same-store sales increased 4.3% in the quarter, topping Wall Street estimates of 3%, according to StreetAccount. While the broader restaurant industry has seen sluggish sales growth, Darden has found success by raising its menu prices by less than inflation and adding promotions aimed at diners looking for value.\"Weaker consumer sentiment doesn't necessarily translate into reduced spending during the quarter,\" Cardenas said during the conference call. He said the company saw high-income consumers trade into its casual-dining chains, although demand from diners making less than $50,000 fell slightly. Darden also got a traffic bump from consumers who are at least 55 years old.Restaurant resultsOlive Garden, which accounted for roughly 44% of Darden's quarterly sales, reported same-store sales growth of 4.7%. Executives credited the popularity of the Italian chain's $13.99 Never Ending Pasta Bowl promotion that ran during the quarter, plus Olive Garden's growing delivery business. In an appeal to inflation-weary consumers, Olive Garden is also adding the option of smaller portions at a lower price for select menu items. Cardenas said the change is improving its value perception among some diners. About 40% of the chain's locations offered the lighter portions menu during the quarter, and another 20% added it early in the fiscal third quarter. LongHorn Steakhouse saw same-store sales growth of 5.9%. While Olive Garden still outnumbers LongHorn based on its restaurant footprint, the steakhouse chain's sales are growing faster. Cardenas said LongHorn saw higher traffic from consumers who make less than $50,000, despite the chain's higher average check relative to Olive Garden. He credited higher beef prices, which mean that a steak at LongHorn could be the same price or cheaper than buying one from the grocery store.watch nowThe company's other business segment reported same-store sales growth of 3.1%, fueled by strong demand at Yard House, according to Cardenas.Darden's fine-dining business, which includes Ruth's Chris and The Capital Grille, saw same-store sales growth of 0.8%, bucking the malaise of the sector. The broader fine-dining segment has struggled as consumers spend less when dining out and many companies have cut back on business lunches and other expenses. Darden tried to appeal to those budget-conscious diners by bringing back a deal at Ruth's Chris for a three-course meal priced at $55 per person. \"It's a profitable deal for us,\" Cardenas said.For fiscal 2026, Darden now expects total sales growth of 8.5% to 9.3%, up from its prior forecast of 7.5% to 8.5%. The fiscal year includes a 53rd week, which is expected to contribute about 2%. Darden also adjusted its expectations for inflation to 3.5%, on the high end of its prior range of 3% to 3.5%. Higher costs will weigh on the company's margins, leading the company to reiterate its forecast for adjusted earnings in a range of $10.50 to $10.70 per share.",

    "body": "People shop for groceries at a store in Port Washington, New York, U.S., Nov. 19, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersConsumer prices rose less than expected in November, giving investors hope that inflationary pressures may be cooling enough for U.S. monetary policy to be eased more than Wall Street anticipates. The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%. The core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also cooler than anticipated, increasing 2.6% over 12 months. It was expected to have risen by 3%. The monthly increases also were less than expected, with both the all-items and core CPI gains at 0.2%, compared to estimates of 0.3%.This is the first report that encompasses the period during which the U.S. government was shut down. The stoppage disrupted the data collection process in that time. It also led to the cancellation of the October CPI release. This data was originally expected to be released Dec. 10.Because the October CPI was canceled, Thursday's report did not have all the usual data points of a typical CPI release. The BLS said it was unable to retroactively collect the October data, but did use some \"nonsurvey data sources\" to make the index calculations. On a 12-month basis, food prices rose 2.6% and energy was up 4.2%. Shelter costs, which make up about one-third of the weighting in the index, rose 3%, indicating progress towards the Fed's 2% overall inflation goal. Shelter had been a major contributors towards elevated inflation readings.Economists may be hesitant to read too much into this report as the start of a downward trend in inflation because of the lack of October comparison data in the release.Still, investors parsed through the report as they look for clues on future monetary policy moves from the Federal Reserve. The Fed earlier this month cut its benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points for the third time in a row. \"A tame CPI will reinforce the Fed is focused on protecting the employment market. And that means a Fed 'put' is now in place for the economy,\" Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, said in a note ahead of Thursday's release. \"In other words, if the Fed is concerned about downside risks to the economy, the Fed 'put' comes into play and this would be for stocks to rise.\"Odds for a January rate cut remained low, but traders began pricing in a higher chance of a March reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool showed a 58.3% probability of a rate cut for the month, up from around 53.9% on Wednesday. Stock futures jumped following the release. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.5% as of 8:39 a.m. ET. A gain would snap a four-day losing streak for the benchmark index. Treasury yields slipped, with the 10-year note yield last trading around 4.11%.— CNBC's Sean Conlon contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Thursday's bonanza of four European central banks announcing interest rate decisions was as expected: the European Central Bank, Norges Bank, and Riksbank held their rates, while the Bank of England cut.But there were hints at what's ahead for 2026. Here are four key takeaways.1. The BoE voted to cut, but only justThe markets thought the BoE's rate cut was a done deal, with futures markets suggesting an almost 98% chance of one. But the vote to cut by 25 basis points was by the narrowest of margins: 5-4. A number of officials called for caution, citing continued risks to inflation.Rate setter Meghan Greene, who was among the four opposing a cut, argued there were signs inflation for services was at risk of spiking, while inflation for core goods remained at pre-Covid levels.Barclays U.K. Chief Economist Jack Meaning told CNBC the bank had delivered a \"hawkish cut,\" adding the bar could be higher for future cuts.watch now2. The ECB projections seem to justify the holdThe ECB's latest projections seem to have backed up European officials who have said rates are in a \"good place,\" with the growth outlook upgraded and inflation seen returning to the 2% target in 2028.President Christine Lagarde said the Eurozone's economy has been \"resilient\", while Al Cattermole, Mirabaud Asset Management fixed income portfolio manager, said the outlook was \"slightly hotter\" than expected, and means the committee will \"lean more towards that hawkish edge.\"3. But its next decision could be a hikeThe ECB leaving its policy rate unchanged came as little surprise to investors, with resilient economic data suggesting rates will remain on pause.But investors say that, by raising its growth outlook for the euro zone, the bank may have laid the groundwork for its next move to be a rate hike, as hinted at by governing member Isabel Schnabel.Schnabel told Bloomberg that she was \"rather comfortable\" with expectations that the next move could be a rate hike, \"albeit not any time soon.\"\"The prevailing narrative is that the rate-cutting cycle has largely run its course and that Europe's growth momentum now lies primarily in fiscal policy. Some even suggest that the ECB could begin raising policy rates again by the end of 2026,\" noted Kevin Thozet, a member of French asset manager Carmignac's investment committee.4. Don't expect Riksbank to move rates soonSweden's Riksbank boosted its economic outlook, now seeing 2.9% growth next year, compared to the 2.7% it previously expected.That has cemented expectations the central bank won't move rates anytime soon – with officials forecasting an eventual move higher after staying on hold throughout next year. Riksbank Governor Erik Thedéen told CNBC that Sweden is in \"a fairly good place,\" with growth picking up, while SEB Chief Economist Jens Magnusson said the country had \"one of the most promising growth cases for next year.\"",

    "body": "Cat Goetze has built her career in tech, but says even she's made an effort to reduce her phone screen time.The LA-based zillennial tech entrepreneur says earlier in her career, she felt she was on her phone too much and decided to make a concerted effort to curb the habit. She ended up going \"off of social media almost entirely for five years.\"\"I was screen-time sober, so to speak,\" Goetze tells CNBC Make It.Her quest to reduce her screen time led her to create Physical Phones, a landline-style phone that connects to smartphones via Bluetooth to place and receive calls. Goetze launched the business over the summer and sold $120,000 of them within three days, according to documents reviewed by Make It.Goetze says she's no longer fully off social media now that she creates online content for her brand as a tech founder, but she still makes an effort to stay off as much as possible. Aside from using her own product, Goetze says these five tips have helped her keep her screen time to a minimum:1. She changed her phone display to black and whiteThe first time Goetze went \"screen-time sober,\" she says she didn't feel compelled to keep up with the latest tech. She had an older device, an iPhone 8, at the time, which had fewer bells and whistles — or distractions — to keep her on her phone.She also adjusted her display settings so her screen was in black and white, which some users says makes your phone less fun to look at and therefore less distracting.\"It was super low stimulus,\" Goetze says, which kept her from endlessly scrolling on social media apps.2. She doesn't check her phone for the first 30 minutes of each dayGoetze says she avoids looking at her phone for the first 30 minutes of each morning during the week, and up to an hour on weekends. That means using a real alarm clock to wake up.She finds that starting her day phone-free drastically reduces the amount of times she reaches for it for the remainder of the day.\"How you start your day kind of sets the tone subconsciously for the rest of the day,\" she says. Now, she focuses on small morning routines, like brushing her teeth, journaling and feeding her cat.\"I'm busy enough as it is,\" Goetze says. \"I don't even realize the 30 minutes go by, and then I end up picking up my phone like a ton less.\"3. She leaves her phone at homeGoetze says the biggest milestone she hit was going the entire day without checking her phone.She'd accomplish that by leaving it at home while she was out running errands.\"I would literally not even bring my phone if I left the house,\" she says, \"like leaving it to go to the gym, and then I would go to the grocery [store], and then I would go to one more place and then come home. It would end up being half the day, or almost the entire day.\"4. She asks whether checking her phone is really urgentGoetze says that when she's at home and feels the urge to check her phone, she'll ask herself: \"Is there anything that is truly so urgent that it cannot wait until the next time I'm at my computer, which is usually within 15 minutes?\"That thought process is usually enough to keep her from pulling out her phone until she can dedicate time to knock out a few digital to-dos at once while back at her desk.If she's out somewhere and checks her phone, she'll again pause and consider whether she really needs to respond to a message or complete a task in that moment.\"I'll ask myself, will it make a difference if I send this message now, or later when I'm not doing something else — like when I'm actually sitting down and spending intentional time to respond to messages,\" she says.For example, she was recently waiting in line at a coffee shop when she read an email on her phone from her overseas Physical Phones manufacturer.She thought about responding in the moment, but paused and realized it was the middle of the night for them anyway, so her reply could wait. That ends up being the case in most instances, she says.5. She understands smartphones are built to maximize engagement.Goetze says one of the hardest parts of reducing her reliance on her phone is giving herself grace and knowing that it can be a difficult habit to break.\"There's a natural tendency to take on a lot of responsibility and be like, 'This is my fault. My screen time sucks. I have ADHD. I'm stupid; I'm bad; I'm I can't pay attention to stuff,'\" she says.As someone who studied science, technology, media and communication at Stanford, Goetze says she reminds herself that her screen time habits are linked to how companies design their devices and social media apps to be engaging.Stanford psychiatrist Anna Lembke has done research showing that using social media apps can cause the release of dopamine among users, leading them to want to keep using the platforms — even more so when AI-powered algorithms learn what they want to see or respond to most.From Goetze's perspective, \"this is not about willpower,\" she says, but rather about \"putting external things in place that combat the forces that are already underway,\" like turning your phone screen to black and white, or physically leaving it out of your bedroom at night.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesShares of grocery delivery service Instacart dropped about 7% in extended trading on Wednesday, following a report that said the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has begun an investigation into the company's pricing practices.The FTC sent a civil investigative demand to Instacart, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people.\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" the FTC told CNBC in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practice.\"A study released last week showed that prices for the same products in the same supermarkets that work with Instacart can vary by around 7%, which can result in over $1,000 in extra annual costs for customers. Instacart responded by saying that retailers determine prices listed in the app.In 2022, Instacart spent $59 million to acquire Eversight, a company specializing in artificial intelligence-driven pricing and promotions for retailers and consumer packaged goods. Instacart sought to \"create compelling savings opportunities for customers in real-time\" with Eversight, according to a regulatory filing.Instacart declined to comment on the investigation but said reporting has mischaracterized its pricing system.\"Much of what's been reported has mischaracterized how pricing works on Instacart,\" a company spokesperson said in an email. \"First, our retail partners control their pricing strategies, and we work with them to align their online and in-store pricing wherever possible. Second, these tests are not dynamic pricing nor surveillance pricing – prices on Instacart do not change in real time nor are they based on supply or demand, and we never use personal, demographic, or user-level behavioral data to set item prices. \"These tests are a form of randomized A/B testing, similar to the way retailers have long run pricing tests between different stores.\"Earlier on Wednesday, Robert Garcia, a U.S. House Democrat from California, sent a letter to Instacart CEO Chris Rogers asking for a report on how the company sets prices.\"It is unconscionable that corporations are adding to Americans' financial strain with algorithmic — and potentially surveillance — pricing,\" wrote Garcia, who is ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.— CNBC's Annie Palmer contributed to this reportRead Reuters' full report here.",

    "body": "watch nowTrump Media and Technology Group on Thursday announced a merger agreement with TAE Technologies, a privately held fusion power company, valued at more than $6 billion.The all-stock deal, expected to close in mid-2026, will result in shareholders of each firm owning approximately half of the combined company.Trump Media shares — which have plummeted more than 75% since their January peak — rocketed 33% higher after the opening bell.The major pivot for Trump Media, which operates President Donald Trump's social media platform, Truth Social, comes as America's race against China for artificial intelligence superiority has fueled massive energy demand.There are currently no commercial plants producing electricity using fusion, a futuristic technology that carries the potential to generate abundant energy without the risks associated with nuclear power.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTrump Media ($DJT) Stock PriceThe merger would create \"one of the world's first publicly traded fusion companies,\" according to a press release.Trump Media \"has agreed to provide up to $200 million of cash to TAE at signing and an additional $100 million is available\" upon signing a regulatory filing known as a Form S-4.Trump Media Chairman Devin Nunes and TAE CEO Dr. Michl Binderbauer will serve as co-CEOs of the combined company, according to the release.In a conference call later Thursday morning, Nunes said that the merger aligns with Trump Media's \"America-first principles\" and its strategy of seeking \"combinations that bring transformative technology the potential for significant, long-term value creation and dramatic societal impact.\"Listeners were given no opportunity to ask questions during the call, which ended after about eight minutes.Nunes noted that Trump Media held more than $3 billion in assets as of November, much of which came from the hoard of bitcoin the company amassed this year as it branched out into the crypto and financial services sectors.But Trump Media has continued to generate meager revenue, while reporting net losses in its earnings statements. The company said it brought in less than $2.7 million in revenue in the first nine months of 2025.Most of that revenue came from advertising on Truth Social, which, despite being the president's preferred messaging platform, has struggled to compete against more established social media competitors such as Elon Musk's X.Thomas Fuller | Lightrocket | Getty Images\"Upon closing, Trump Media & Technology Group will be the holding company for Truth Social, Truth+, Truth.Fi, TAE, TAE Power Solutions and TAE Life Sciences, among others,\" the companies said.Trump indirectly owns more than 114 million shares of Trump Media. Before taking office in January, he transferred that majority stake to a revocable trust whose sole trustee is his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.After Trump Media merges with TAE, the combined company aims to build \"the world's first utility-scale fusion power plant ... subject to required approvals.\"\"Fusion power plants are expected to provide economic, abundant, and dependable electricity that would help America win the A.I. revolution and maintain its global economic dominance,\" the companies said.TAE says it holds 1,600 patents and has raised more than $1.3 billion from investors including Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs.This is breaking news.

    "body": "Polymarket banner outside the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7th, 2025.Kevin Stankiewicz | CNBCPrediction markets could reach a trillion dollars in annual trading volume by the end of this decade, according to a new report from Eilers & Krejcik, a research firm that specializes in sports and interactive gaming sectors.\"Numerous factors, most notably legal and regulatory challenges, could delay or derail the growth of prediction markets,\" Eilers & Krejcik partner emeritus and strategic advisor Chris Grove told CNBC. \"But the fundamental elements of consumer demand and an array of diverse brands looking to meet that demand are clearly in place.\"That growth will be fueled by sports, which E&K predicts will represent 44% of the long-run volume for prediction markets. The booming predictions space enables users to wager on events in culture, politics and sports, among other markets. A rise in popularity for platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi has inspired traditional sportsbooks to launch their own predictions platforms. Comparing prediction trading volume to sportsbooks handle, or amount wagered, is complicated, because in prediction markets both sides of the trade are counted as volume.  For instance, if someone buys a 40-cent contract and someone else takes the 60-cent position, that's a dollar in trading volume. In sports betting, a dollar bet is strictly a dollar in handle.E&K crafted a formula to translate predictions volume into handle and concluded that mature sports prediction markets could support sportsbook-style handle that's roughly 60% to 80% of today's licensed regulated online sports betting market.Of course, online sports betting is legal only in 31 states; prediction markets have launched in all 50.   Robinhood this week introduced additional prediction markets features that allow users to trade NFL parlay and prop bets.\"The sportsbooks definitely see the writing on the wall and how this could completely disrupt their business,\" CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC Wednesday. watch nowFanatics, in partnership with Crypto.com, launched Fanatics Markets at the beginning of December to offer predictions trades. DraftKings and FanDuel are expected to launch their own prediction platforms by the end of the month.Right now, platforms like Kalshi, Robinhood, Crypto.com, Polymarket and Fanatics are pulling in roughly $10 billion, according to an analysis this week from Citizens. But analysts note, \"Prediction markets are in the early innings of exponential scaling as the asset class transitions from speculation to a more mature component of capital markets, with institutions likely coming next.\"Tenev said it more plainly: \"We think we're in the early stages of a prediction market supercycle.\"As the markets mature, the cross-selling to prediction customers is likely to diverge. After all, the way FanDuel coaxes a prediction customer onto its online sportsbook or icasino will look very different from Robinhood working to persuade a predictions trader to try trading equities.  Still, a broader trend is emerging: the convergence of investing and gambling. \"There's always been some overlap between the two, but we appear to be living in a world where gambling is [becoming] more like investing just as investing is pushing further and further in the direction of gambling,\" Grove said. Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a business relationship. ",

    "body": "The Bank of England (BOE) in the City of London, UK, on Monday, Dec. 15, 2025. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bank of England voted narrowly to cut interest rates on Thursday, in its last monetary policy move of 2025.The central bank's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) on Thursday voted 5-4 to trim the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, marking the fourth cut of the year. Economists had widely expected the rate trim, which comes at a time of lackluster economic data, softening labor market and a recent decline in inflation that outpaced expectations.Nonetheless, the vote was a narrow one, with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey siding with more dovish members of the committee rather than the four policymakers who maintain that the inflation rate, at 3.2% in November, is still far from the central bank's 2% target. In a statement, the MPC said that while inflation remained above target, \"it is now expected to fall back towards target more quickly in the near term.\"However, it cautioned that \"the extent of further easing in monetary policy will depend on the evolution of the outlook for inflation.\" On the basis of current evidence, the MPC said the \"Bank Rate [the BOE's benchmark interest rate] is likely to continue on a gradual downward path. But judgements around further policy easing will become a closer call.\"Sterling was flat against the dollar after the announcement, as was the FTSE 100. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.K. gilt was up 3 basis points to 4.510%.For now, the cut in rates will be welcomed by hard-pressed consumers as it makes borrowing cheaper, but many lose out with lower returns on their savings.Chancellor Rachel Reeves cheered the central bank's trim, saying it would help with cost of living pressures.\"Today's interest rate cut is the sixth since the election [in July 2024], the fastest pace of cuts in 17 years and good news for families with mortgages and businesses with loans,\" she said in comments on X, while adding that \"there's more to do on the cost of living.\"Outlook for 2026Economists expect the central bank could next cut in early 2026 if macroeconomic data continue to allow for more room or manouver. The BOE said Thursday that it expected the economy to record no growth in the fourth quarter of 2025.There are caveats to just how many cuts we could see, however.\"We will see cuts but perhaps not many more from here,\" Jack Meaning, U.K. chief economist at Barclays, told CNBC Thursday after the release.\"[After] the downgrade in growth, the downgrade in inflation, they have to acknowledge that there are probably more cuts coming, but they're keeping their options open,\" he told CNBC's \"Decision Time.\"\"Further easing clearly looks likely beyond the December meeting,\" Allan Monks, chief U.K. economist at JPMorgan, said in analysis Wednesday. JP Morgan's current base case is for two more cuts in March and June, bringing the base rate down to 3.25%.\"One fly in the ointment, however, is the high-side wage expectations for 2026. That is keeping the BOE cautious, but if the picture there were to soften then it could tilt the BOE away from its gradual easing path and open the window up for another cut in February.\" he said.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey attends the central bank's Monetary Policy Report press conference at the Bank of England, in London, on May 9, 2024.Yui Mok | Afp | Getty ImagesMorgan Stanley's Chief U.K. Economist Bruna Skarica and strategist Fabio Bassanin said in a note that they expect another trim in February on the back of a decline in inflationary pressures and a pick-up in the jobless rate. But they anticipated \"conservative messaging\" around future cuts when that next rate cut comes. \"Thereafter, purely on the evolution of the inflation and pay data, as well as what looks to be a stubborn jobless rate in our forecasts, we still think that the BOE can deliver two more rate cuts in the first half of 2026, in April and June.\"",

    "body": "Four moderate House Republicans rebelled against House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday, joining Democrats to force a vote on extending key Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year.If approved by the House and Senate, the measure will extend enhanced tax credits for customers of Affordable Care Act health insurance plans for three years.If those subsidies expire as scheduled, the prices of Obamacare premiums that millions of Americans personally pay will skyrocket.The stunning defections by the quartet of Republicans came a day after Johnson, R-La., said that GOP leaders would not allow a vote under normal procedures on keeping the enhanced ACA tax credits alive into 2026. Johnson, earlier Wednesday morning, urged GOP caucus members not to join Democrats in the procedural end-run around him.Lacking sufficient Republican support to extend the credits, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in November created a so-called discharge petition, which would force a vote on an extension once it obtained signatures from 218 House members.Democrats only have 214 members, so they needed four Republicans for that measure to work.Johnson was asked about the discharge petition on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" about two hours after it obtained the required signatures.He said that \"doing an end-run around the majority party, the speaker or the regular process is not the best way to make law.\" Four moderate Republicans signed the petition: Brian Fitzpatrick, Rob Bresnahan and Ryan Mackenzie, all of Pennsylvania, and Mike Lawler of New York signed the petition.\"When leadership blocks action entirely, Congress has a responsibility to act,\" Lawler said in a statement.\"My priority is ensuring Hudson Valley families aren't caught in the gridlock.\"A vote to extend the ACA subsidies could help House Republicans who face tough reelection bids in 2026. The GOP holds a razor-thin majority in the chamber.Lawler on Tuesday said that not holding a vote on the subsidies would be \"political malpractice.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationIf the measure clears the House, it would still need to be approved by the Senate, which, like the lower chamber, is controlled by Republicans.Last week, the Senate rejected a similar measure that would have extended the subsidies for three years.\"Under this proposal, people making $500k+ per year would continue to be eligible for what were supposed to be temporary COVID-era subsidies,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune's spokesperson Ryan Wrasse wrote in a social media post on Wednesday. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is one of only a handful of GOP senators who joined Democrats in voting to preserve the credits. Hawley warned that Congress needs to act on the subsidies. \"I mean, the prices are way too high. I'm a father of three. I know small children. I know so many parents in Missouri who are scared to death they're not going to be able to take their kids to the doctor. I mean, that's a very valid concern,\" Hawley said. A bipartisan group in the Senate has formed and is working to craft compromise legislation to both extend the subsidies and reform Obamacare. Senators in the group on Wednesday said their talks are picking up steam, with some noting that the action in the House has given that effort support.\"We have some momentum to enact a bipartisan bill that includes reforms,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, one of the leaders of the group, and the chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee. \"We're now working on drafting a specific bill to incorporate those conversations that will include reforms as well as the two-year extension,\" she said. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, who is leading the group with Collins, said the talks are in \"field goal range.\"But Moreno ruled out approving the so-called clean three-year extension of the subsidies that the House will vote on. Precise details on the plan, however, are not clear. Moreno said the group is eyeing an extension to open enrollment to \"take that pressure point off.\"Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Louisiana Republican who chairs the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is pushing for his own plan, which would give people money directly to offset their health insurance costs.\"Well, the President has said that he won't sign something unless we give money to the enrollee, the patient, as opposed to the insurance company,\" Cassidy said. \"I am presuming that something like I'm proposing will be in the final mix.\" Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said that while the \"bipartisan, bicameral talks have been constructive,\" the group still needs critical assurances that what it produces will get a vote and the president's signature. \"We need to make sure the speaker will bring up a bill if the Senate passes something out, and we need to make sure that leadership in the Senate will bring up legislation if we reach an agreement,\" Shaheen said. \"What the president is going to do is a question.\" Johnson and GOP House leadership are pushing a separate health-care bill that would not extend the enhanced subsidies. The House will vote on that bill, which would provide cost-sharing aid for consumers, on Wednesday. Johnson told \"Squawk Box\" that GOP caucus members could tackle health insurance costs in early 2026.\"We're looking at another reconciliation package, for example, in the first quarter of next year, which will have a number of other revisions and reforms to the system, and all of it is geared, again, for reducing premiums, increasing access to care and quality of care,\" the speaker said. — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

It admitted that the Federal Aviation Administration's air traffic controllers failed to keep aircraft apart and issue alerts when planes were in proximity to one another.The FAA and the Army didn't immediately comment.American Airlines didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The airline is also named a defendant in the lawsuit brought by the family of one of the crash victims, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Washington.Read more CNBC airline newsFrontier Airlines replaces longtime CEO Barry Biffle with carrier's presidentSouthwest CEO says airline 'actively pursuing' network of airport loungesDelta says government shutdown cost it $200 million, but forecasts strong travel demand into 2026",

    "body": "The Lululemon logo can be seen on a store in Manhattan.Sven Hoppe | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesActivist investor Elliott Investment Management has built a stake of more than $1 billion in Lululemon Athletica and is bringing a potential CEO candidate to the table, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC.Lululemon's stock rose 6% in early trading Thursday. Last week, Lululemon announced CEO Calvin McDonald would step down effective Jan. 31, following a year-long performance slump for Lululemon. Elliott has been working with former Ralph Lauren CFO and COO Jane Nielsen as a potential candidate, according to the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity about confidential matters.In a news release announcing McDonald's departure, the company said its board of directors was working with a \"leading executive search firm\" to find its next CEO. The leadership change came as Lululemon's founder Chip Wilson has been calling on the company to make a change, saying earlier this year that the company's performance is \"in a nosedive.\"The athletic apparel company has been facing an increasingly crowded landscape, with athleisure entrants like Vuori and Alo Yoga. Nielsen served at Ralph Lauren from 2016 until April. Before that, she held roles at Coach and PepsiCo. Elliott has taken a stake in a slate of other companies as well this year, including a more than $2 billion stake in Workday and a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported Elliott's Lululemon stake. ",

    "body": "Chipotle will debut a High Protein Menu on Tuesday, December 23, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per item.Source: Chipotle Mexican GrillChipotle Mexican Grill is entering the snack business.The fast-casual giant announced Thursday it will roll out its first-ever \"High Protein Menu\" later this month, featuring grab-and-go protein cups. Starting Tuesday, customers in the U.S. and Canada can buy a 4-ounce portion filled with adobo chicken or steak.The move is designed to re-energize demand as the chain known for massive burritos and bowls is grappling with slowing sales growth and a fundamental shift in how Americans eat.\"For years, guests have used Chipotle's customizable offerings to build high protein and fiber-filled meals on their own,\" Chris Brandt, Chipotle's president and chief brand officer, said in a release.The company recently cut its full-year same-store sales forecast for the third consecutive quarter, triggering a nearly 20% single-day stock selloff. Multiple Wall Street firms lowered their price targets, citing weakening traffic, most sharply among customers ages 25 to 35, and fading visibility into a rebound.Chipotle stock is down around 38% year-to-date. Across the fast-casual sector, inflation-weary consumers have been pulling back on dining out, and analysts have told CNBC previously that Chipotle is battling a value perception problem, with some diners lumping the chain in with pricier fast-casual rivals despite average entree prices that are closer to $10.Beyond the protein cup, the High Protein Menu includes entrees such as the Double High Protein Bowl and the High Protein-High Fiber Bowl, with items ranging from 15 to 81 grams of protein per serving. \"This curated menu brings that fan behavior to the forefront with clean ingredients and flexible portions, making protein and other dietary goals easier to reach in just a few taps,\" Brandt said. watch nowSmaller, protein-dense portions allow Chipotle to compete not just with other restaurants, but with protein bars, shakes and convenience-store snacks, while potentially capturing visits outside of lunch and dinner.High-protein diets have ranked as the top diet pattern in the U.S. for three consecutive years, according to Chipotle. About 70% of Americans now say they prioritize protein, and more than one-third have increased their intake over the past year, according to the International Food Information Council.  The launch also comes against the backdrop of a dramatic shift in consumer behavior driven by GLP-1 weight-loss drugs and growing interest in macronutrient tracking. GLP-1 users, in particular, tend to eat smaller amounts while emphasizing protein to preserve muscle mass — a trend that is forcing restaurant chains to rethink portion sizes, menu structure and pricing.Chipotle isn't alone in pivoting toward protein-forward offerings. Fast-casual salad chain Sweetgreen recently introduced new menu items following the trend, headlined by a bowl with 106 grams of protein. ",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin shakes hands with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban during a meeting in Moscow, Russia, November 28, 2025.Alexander Nemenov | Via ReutersOne of Russia's last remaining allies in the European Union told CNBC he believes there is no way forward for proposals to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine via frozen Russian assets. The European Commission – the EU's executive arm – is considering using seized Russian assets held in Europe to provide further financial support to Ukraine. Speaking to CNBC as officials arrived at the European Council meeting, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said proposals to use the immobilized assets as a means to assist Ukraine had been \"killed.\"\"It's [a] dead end. It's over,\" he said. \"There is no sufficient level of support behind it.\"Orbán is widely seen as Russia's closest ally within the EU, and has been a vocal critic of plans to use potentially hundreds of billions of euros of frozen assets to fund reparations loans for Kyiv. Hungary isn't alone in having doubts over the measures, however. Belgium, whose support is critical given that huge amounts of frozen assets lie in the Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear, has expressed concern over possible legal and financial risks. Italy and Bulgaria have also supported Belgium's resistance to the proposals. watch nowFor its part, the Kremlin has said such a move would be tantamount to justification for war, and Russia's central bank announced last week it was suing Euroclear in a Moscow court \"for recovery of losses caused to the Bank of Russia.\"The European Council meeting, due to conclude on Friday, will have funding options for reparations loans to Ukraine high on the agenda. \"Without new additional financial support from the EU and other international donors, Ukraine is expected to run out of funds early in 2026,\" the European Parliament said in a briefing on Wednesday, adding that Hungary had already blocked the option to use the headroom in the EU budget to provide funding to Kyiv. Decisions on use of the EU's own finances require a unanimous vote from all 27 member states to be passed. \"If both options proposed by the Commission are blocked, a 'coalition of the willing' could be the option of last resort,\" the European Parliament said Wednesday.Asked ahead of Thursday's meetings if he was acting in Europe or Russia's interests by working to block the use of Russian assets by the EU, Orbán said he was \"just working for peace.\"\"I think what we have to do [is] to make some steps to peace, not to war,\" he said. watch nowRussian and Ukrainian forces are entering their fourth winter of fighting as peace talks drag on. Negotiations are expected to continue into this coming weekend, possibly in Miami, following weeks of talks between delegations from the U.S., Russia, Ukraine and Europe.  Despite Orbán's take on the subject, Kaja Kallas, EU high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, told reporters in Brussels on Thursday that the bloc was pushing for peace alongside Ukraine, but that it was \"one sided.\"\"We haven't seen any willingness from the Russian side to move or seriously talk about peace,\" she said. \"We need to put pressure on Russia, so that they go from pretending to negotiate to actually coming to the table to negotiate.\"Unlike Orbán, she struck an optimistic tone on pushing the proposals around the reparations loan and frozen assets through. \"The proposals we are working on are addressing Belgium's concerns,\" she said. \"The issues that Belgium has raised have been addressed, so I hope we get this over the finishing line. Putin is banking on us to fail, so we shouldn't give him that.\"A spokesperson for the Kremlin did not respond to CNBC's request for comment. ",

    "body": "When your kid is in the middle of a tantrum, logic and lectures don't work.I've studied over 200 kids and worked with hundreds of families, and one thing is clear: Tantrums aren't about defiance. Research shows that during emotional overwhelm, a child's prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain responsible for reasoning and language) essentially goes offline. It's why \"use your words\" falls flat when they're screaming.What they need in that moment is connection. These seven magic phrases work with your child's nervous system by calming the storm, restoring safety, and teaching emotional regulation — the real skill behind resilience.1. Say nothingWhen your child is mid-meltdown, your instinct is to make it stop... fast. You want the screaming to end, the tears to dry, the chaos to pass. So you start talking: \"Calm down,\" \"Use your words,\" \"Tell me what's wrong.\"But often, the fastest way to end a tantrum is silence. When your child's body is in full distress, every word you add is like oxygen to a fire. Their \"thinking brain\" has shut down. Words simply can't land. But your nervous system can reach them instantly.Sit close. Stay relaxed. Saying nothing essentially communicates an important phrase: \"You're safe, and I can handle this.\" Once their breathing slows and the peak has passed, that's when your spoken words can start to land.2. 'I'm right here.'This short phrase is a lifeline. You're not walking away, threatening consequences, or trying to reason. You're anchoring them back into connection.A tantrum often triggers a primal fear: Am I still loved when I'm out of control? Your calm presence answers that question instantly. Connection regulates the stress response faster than correction ever can. Emotional safety quiets the body's alarm system.3. 'This feeling is really big, huh?'Instead of minimizing their emotions or rushing them through it, this phrase acknowledges the size of the feeling. It helps kids see what's happening inside rather than being consumed by it.Validation activates the brain's calming pathways. When children feel seen, their bodies release tension. And that's the first step toward emotional awareness.4. 'It's okay to feel angry. It's not okay to hit.'Parents often swing between being too permissive or too harsh. This phrase strikes the balance. You're separating the feeling from the behavior, and validating the emotion while holding the boundary.Consistent limits paired with emotional acceptance build impulse control — the foundation of self-discipline.5. 'Let's take a break together.'Sometimes, a \"time-in\" works better than a \"time-out.\" This phrase teaches your child to regulate with you. Invite them to sit, breathe, or just be still until the storm passes. Proximity restores safety faster than isolation ever could.When children are dysregulated, they need your nervous system to co-regulate theirs. Your calm is contagious.6. 'I can see how much you wanted that.'This phrase helps acknowledge the emotion underneath your child's behavior: disappointment, frustration, or longing. When kids feel seen, they don't need to keep screaming to prove their feelings are real.Validation lowers the brain's threat response. Once a child feels understood, their nervous system begins to settle — and the tantrum ends naturally, without punishment or bribes.7. 'You can be mad, and I'll still love you.'Unconditional safety is what every child needs most. Tantrums often test an unspoken question: \"Will you still love me when I'm not lovable?\"This phrase answers it clearly and teaches emotional security for life. It also rewires the shame response. Children learn that love isn't withdrawn for imperfection, and that's the beginning of self-worth.Reem Raouda is a leading voice in conscious parenting and the creator of FOUNDATIONS, a step-by-step guide that helps parents heal and become emotionally safe. She is widely recognized for her expertise in children's emotional safety and for redefining what it means to raise emotionally healthy kids.

    "body": "Warren Buffett and Greg Abel walkthrough the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting in Omaha, Nebraska on May 3, 2025.David A. Grogen | CNBCWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a sharp rebound in operating profit on Saturday, while its cash pile swelled to a new high with no buybacks.Berkshire's operating profit generated from the conglomerate's wholly owned businesses including insurance and railroads jumped 34% year over year to $13.485 billion in the third quarter. The gains were driven by a more than 200% surge in insurance underwriting income, which rose to $2.37 billion.Buffett once again refrained from repurchasing shares despite a significant pullback in the stock. The company said there were no share buybacks during the first nine months of 2025. Class A and B shares of the conglomerate are up 5% each in 2025, while the S&P 500 is up 16.3%.Without any buybacks, Berkshire's cash hoard swelled to a record $381.6 billion, surpassing the previous high of $347.7 billion set in the first quarter of this year.Berkshire also didn't find other stocks attractive, net selling equities in the third quarter for a taxable gain of $10.4 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBerkshire Hathaway class A shares year to dateThe 95-year-old Buffett in May announced he's stepping down as CEO at the year-end after six legendary decades. Greg Abel, Berkshire's vice chairman of non-insurance operations, is set to take over as chief executive, while Buffett will remain chairman of the board. Abel will also start writing annual letters in 2026.The Omaha-based conglomerate's shares have tumbled double digits from all-time highs following the announcement. The sell-off partially reflects the so-called Buffett premium, or the extra price investors are willing to pay because of the billionaire's unmatched record and exceptional capital allocation skills.Last month, Berkshire announced a deal to buy Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for $9.7 billion in cash. The deal marks Berkshire's largest since 2022, when it paid $11.6 billion for insurer Alleghany.Overall earnings, which include gains from Berkshire's investments in other publicly traded companies, rose 17% to $30.8 billion year on year.

Ken Cedeno | ReutersSNAP food benefits could restart as early as Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday morning.Two federal judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled on Friday that the Trump administration must use emergency funds to pay SNAP benefits, which help feed 42 million Americans, during the government shutdown.  Judge Jack McConnell of Rhode Island also directed that these be paid out of emergency funds \"as soon as possible.\" Boston Judge Indira Talwani gave the administration until Monday to tell her if it will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November.The administration was originally set to cut off the aid on Nov. 1.In an interview on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" Bessent said that the administration would not appeal the court ruling, while adding that finding the funds to pay SNAP benefits by Wednesday \"could be\" done.\"There's a process that has to be followed. So, we've got to figure out what the process is,\" the Treasury secretary said.On Friday, President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post that the government was exploring its options to restart SNAP.\"I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT,\" the president wrote. \"Therefore, I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.\"",

    "body": "Jasondoiy | E+ | Getty ImagesA recent NBC News poll showed growing frustration among Americans regarding President Donald Trump's handling of the economy less than a year after entering office.In a poll of 1,000 voters taken between Oct. 25-28, 63% said Trump had fallen short of expectations regarding the economy. Separately, 65% said Trump had fallen short of looking out for the middle class, and 66% expressed the same sentiment for the handling of inflation and the cost of living.Trump's overall approval rating in the poll has fallen 4 points to 43% since March, while 55% disapprove of the president's job performance.The negativity appears to be bleeding into voters' feelings of dissatisfaction with Republican lawmakers. With just a year to go before the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats are favored to win control of Congress by an 8-point margin, 50% to 42%, among those polled. Democrats led by just one point, 48% to 47%, in the March survey.The results come as the government shutdown has stretched past a month, affecting critical government programs, including SNAP food benefits. The NBC News poll also indicated that voters are split on which party would have a better handle on the economy.According to the poll, 38% of voters found Republicans would do a better job, while 37% found Democrats would be more effective.This follows a recent CNBC All-America Economic Survey, which showed views on the U.S. economy turned more negative.See the complete NBC News poll here.",

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesWhile most Chinese electric vehicle makers have seen ups and downs, Xpeng has built a slow and steady momentum over the last 12 months without a single decline this year – a rare streak in China's competitive EV market.Xpeng in its all-year round winning streak, delivered 42,013 vehicles. This marks the second time the startup has topped over 40,000 vehicles this year.The latest 40,000 breakthrough comes after the release of the Mona series in late August which began deliveries in September. Xpeng reported its namesake brand and Mona-branded cars in its monthly total and did not break out global and China sales figures.The Mona series is Xpeng's mass-market brand that carries models such as the M03 sedan for as little as 119,800 yuan ($16,812) or 155,800 yuan for more advanced assistive features.Xpeng's steady rises puts growing pressure on Elon Musk's Tesla, which saw its deliveries fluctuate amid the crowded EV market.Chinese EV makers challenge TeslaIn the past 3 months alone, Tesla China posted a mixed performance with whole sale numbers hitting 67,886 in July, 83,192 in August, and 71,525 in September, according to data from Passenger Car Association.While October's wholesale record has not been released yet, the sales data highlights Tesla's vulnerability to a price war and China's overcrowded EV market.Among China's top performers, BYD maintained its lead with 436,856 units delivered in October, breaking past the 300,000 streak this year. While this marks a new 2025 record, it is a 12.7% decrease in sales from October last year.This comes amid the EV behemoth's steepest profit decline of 32.6% year-on-year, according to a statement on its third-quarter results published last week.Leapmotor delivered 70,289 units in October, up 5.5% after topping 60,000 sales for the first time in September.Meanwhile, Huawei-backed Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, which includes brands such as Aito, Chery, and Maextro, made 70,289 deliveries in October.Nio posted 40,397 deliveries in October, marking growth across all of its brands —the premium \"Nio\" brand and lower-priced Onvo and Firefly brands. Its flagship brand led the gains, rising from 13,728 to 17,143 units, nearly matching Onvo's record of 17,342.Xiaomi meanwhile, maintained its deliveries with over 40,000 units, with the exact numbers unspecified. Li Auto recorded 31,767 unit deliveries, approximately a 6.4% drop from the previous month. This decline comes after a slight rebound last month after a marketing blunder.Geely-owned Zeekr made the lowest deliveries with 21,423 units which is slightly above its 18,257 deliveries recorded in September.",

    "body": "An FBI police car is parked outside the Federal Bureau of Investigation Headquarters building Washington D.C, on October 18, 2021.Yasin Ozturk | Anadolu Agency | Getty ImagesBob Hartheimer, CEO of Tennessee's Evolve Bank & Trust, was fired after U.S. law enforcement officials caught him propositioning a law enforcement officer posing as a 15-year-old boy on gay dating app Grindr.On Oct. 19, an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation logged onto Grindr while pretending to be a teen boy, and a user called \"Tomm\" wrote a message to that person saying, \"Hey any chance u would hu with an older and chill guy,\" according to an affidavit from a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation that was unsealed on Tuesday.The two discussed getting together in person later in the week, according to the affidavit. On Snapchat, they talked about the sex acts they might perform. \"Tomm\" asked for a photo of the \"boy\" without shorts on, and he also sent the undercover agent a picture of himself naked. The FBI was able to obtain an IP address for \"Tomm\" from Snapchat, as well as an address from Comcast, the affidavit showed.Hartheimer was arrested in Memphis on Oct. 23 for attempted production of child pornography and transfer of obscene material to a minor, according to a warrant.An Evolve spokesperson and Blake Ballin, a lawyer representing Hartheimer, told CNBC on Saturday that Evolve has fired the CEO.\"Bob's family is aware of the charges,\" Ballin wrote in an email. \"His family loves and supports him and requests privacy during this difficult period in their lives. We have no further comment at this time.\"Evolve Bank CEO Bob Hartheimer booking photo.Source: Shelby County JailThe Wall Street Journal reported on Hartheimer's firing from Evolve Bank on Friday.Evolve said its finance chief, Mark Mosteller, and its general counsel, Joelle Weltzin, will be in charge of the bank's operations, as they were before the bank hired Hartheimer in August.\"We are in close contact with the U.S. Attorney's office and have been assured that this is a personal matter and does not relate to the Bank or its operations in any way,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email.Last year, Evolve was caught up in the bankruptcy of financial technology startup Synapse, which cut off access to a system for handling transactions and account details. Fintech apps such as Yotta worked with Evolve and other banks, with Synapse acting as a middleman.Synapse's method of keeping app users' money in various banks, including Evolve, created accounting problems, and up to $96 million in deposits went missing. Thousands of Americans lost money, CNBC reported.In 2024, Evolve also suffered a cyberattack, during which hackers obtained customer information and demanded a ransom. The bank said it did not pay any ransom and the data was eventually posted online.\"This is a structural change, demonstrating our continued commitment to doing the hard work to earn back the trust of our customers, employees, regulators, and investors,\" Evolve said in an August statement announcing the selection of Hartheimer to replace CEO Scott Stafford, who retired after joining in 2004.The bank touted Hartheimer's experience as director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's Division of Resolutions, as well as his years as a regulatory consultant for fintech companies.\"Over the past four decades, I've led, turned around, and advised institutions across the financial landscape,\" Hartheimer wrote on his LinkedIn profile. The 100-year-old bank reported net losses for each of the first three quarters of 2025 after being profitable since 2003, according to data on file with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.— CNBC's Dan Mangan and Hugh Son contributed reporting.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns CNBC. Versant would become the new parent company of CNBC upon Comcast's planned spinoff of Versant.",

Jim Watson | Afp | Getty ImagesDe-escalation in tensions between China and the U.S. after their leaders met in South Korea last Thursday stands in stark contrast to the chill in Washington-New Delhi relations, with India now subject to higher U.S. tariffs than Beijing.Experts said that the strategic relationship between India and U.S. built over two decades has substantially eroded.Atman Trivedi a partner and lead of the South Asia Practice at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group said trust between the two countries \"could take years rebuild.\"Steep tariffs, $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated claims of having brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan are among issues that have led to deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.\"President Trump evidently does not value India as a partner in balancing China as much as the previous presidents,\" said Raymond Vickery Jr., senior associate and chair on India and emerging Asia Economics at Center for Strategic and International Studies.The U.S. foreign policy from President Bill Clinton until recently, including Trump's first term as the president, had consistently valued \"democratic India over autocratic China,\" he said, adding that the approach toward India has now shifted from one of strategic altruism to \"transactionalism.\"Meanwhile, ties between the U.S. and China appear to be on the mend.In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said \"My G2 meeting President Xi of China was a great one for both of our countries\" adding that it would lead to \"everlasting peace and success.\"  Shortly after, Pete Hegseth, U.S. secretary of defense, said on X that China and the U.S. had agreed to set up \"miliary-to-military channels to deconflict and deescalate\" any problems.Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached a trade truce in a high-stakes meeting in South Korea on Thursday which saw Washington cutting tariffs on Beijing related to fentanyl to 10% from 20%, reducing the overall rate on Chinese goods to around 47%.China now pays a lower tariff than India.In August the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on India including secondary duties of 25% for its purchase of Russian oil. India has called the move \"unfair, unjustified and unreasonable,\" while has called U.S. trade ties with India \"a totally one-sided disaster!\"U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on Feb. 13, 2025.Jim Watson | Afp | Getty Images\"At the leader-level, the chemistry is missing for now, and the impact of this disconnect on the U.S.-India relationship probably cannot be overstated,\" Trivedi added.During his Asia trip last week, while addressing corporate leaders at Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea, Trump said he threatened India and Pakistan with 250% tariffs unless they stopped hostilities.An attack by militants in the Indian-controlled region of Kashmir in April killed 26 civilians. India accused Pakistan and launched a military strike, resulting in a four-day conflict that threatened to explode into a broader war fueled by decades of tensions between the two countries.\"The strategic relationship between India and the U.S. has been under strain this year not just because of tariffs, but also because of Washington's posture in the conflict with Pakistan and the apparent warming of [U.S.] ties with Pakistan's military,\" said Alexandra Hermann, head of Southeast Asia Research at Oxford Economics.Trump's claims are being picked up by Modi's political opponents including the leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi. Modi is \"scared\" of U.S. President Donald Trump, Gandhi reportedly said on Sunday in a political rally in Bihar.Hermann added that now the challenge for India would be to find its position between two economic superpowers.\"While New Delhi stands to benefit from greater access to U.S. demand, its dependence on China is unlikely to diminish in the near term given the still-extreme uncertainty around trade policy and the costs of relocating supply chains,\" she said.Keeping aside strained trade ties, U.S. and India on Friday signed a 10-year \"Framework for the US-India Major Defence Partnership.\"Hegseth said on X that the two countries were improving \"coordination, info sharing, and tech cooperation,\" while his Indian counter Rajnath Singh said the partnership between U.S. and India was \"critical for ensuring a free, open and rules-based Indo-Pacific region.\"Experts warn if U.S. sticks with its transactional approach toward India, it will drive the two further apart, compromising strategic interests of both.\"The Trump policy will push India further toward Russia, the Global South, and even China. This will not be in the interests of either India or the US,\" said Vickery Jr. from CSIS.",

    "body": "The Valero Energy refinery in Texas City, Texas.F. Carter Smith | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe focus on dividend stocks is growing, as the U.S. Federal Reserve announced another rate cut. Investors can consider stocks that offer dividends and also have the potential to drive capital appreciation, enhancing the total return.In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help us identify stocks that have solid upside and pay attractive dividends. The stock picks of these experts are backed by in-depth analysis of a company's growth opportunities and ability to pay dividends consistently.Here are three dividend-paying stocks, highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Valero EnergyWe start this week with Valero Energy (VLO), a manufacturer of petroleum-based and low-carbon liquid transportation fuels and petrochemical products. In Q3 2025, Valero returned $1.3 billion to stockholders via $351 million in dividends and $931 million in share repurchases. On Oct. 29, Valero declared a quarterly dividend of $1.13 per share. At an annualized dividend of $4.52, VLO stock offers a yield of 2.7%.Valero Energy recently reported upbeat Q3 results, backed by strong refining margins. Keeping in view the Q3 performance, strong refining outlook, and the company's attractive capital returns strategy, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reiterated a buy rating on VLO stock and raised his price target to $197 from $180.\"We continue to view VLO as a key beneficiary of our more constructive refining outlook, given the company's balance sheet strength, low-cost operations, and operational execution,\" said Mehta.The 5-star analyst noted that during the third-quarter earnings call, management discussed a constructive refining outlook, driven by limited net capacity additions and widening crude differentials. Mehta also highlighted that Valero's non-refining businesses performed better than Goldman Sachs' expectations. Looking ahead, Mehta believes that low inventories, resilient demand, and limited net refining capacity additions support tighter supply/demand expectations for 2026.In particular, Mehta noted management's continued focus on capital returns and commitment to allocating excess free cash flow to shareholders. The analyst expects a stronger refining backdrop to contribute to meaningful free cash flow generation, which could support about $4.6 billion of capital returns in 2026, implying a 9% capital return yield.Mehta ranks No. 812 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 58% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%.AlbertsonsWe move on to the next dividend-paying stock, Albertsons Companies (ACI). The food and drug retailer recently announced upbeat results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by strong pharmacy sales and digital business. On October 14, Albertsons announced a quarterly dividend of 15 cents per share, payable on November 7. At an annualized dividend of 60 cents per share, ACI stock offers a dividend yield of 3.3%.Following Albertsons' better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth reiterated a buy rating on ACI stock and modestly increased his price target to $29 from $28. The analyst is bullish on Albertsons as the company \"accelerates growth through AI-powered digital sales, expanding loyalty ecosystem, and high-margin retail media platform.\"Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is transforming from a traditional grocery operator into a data‑driven, digitally integrated food and wellness platform. This change is being fueled by the company's e-commerce expansion, loyalty integration, and rapidly expanding Albertsons Media Collective advertising network, which Feinseth believes is well-positioned to become one of its most profitable long-term growth engines.The top-rated analyst pointed out that ACI's For U loyalty program is driving both digital engagement and spending growth. In fact, For U membership increased more than 13% year-over-year in Q2 FY25, reaching over 48 million active participants. The growing member base boosts ACI's business as members transact more frequently, spend more, and are increasingly using cross-channel rewards, noted Feinseth.Additionally, Feinseth highlighted that Albertsons is enhancing shareholder returns through ongoing dividend increases and share repurchases, including the recently announced additional $750 million accelerated share repurchase authorization. He expects ACI stock to deliver a total return of close to 50%, including dividends.Feinseth ranks No. 296 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 14.2%.Williams CompaniesFinally, let's look at energy infrastructure provider Williams Companies (WMB). On October 28, Williams announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents per share, payable on December 29, 2025, and reflecting a 5.3% year-over-year increase. At an annualized dividend of $2 per share, WMB stock offers a 3.5% yield.Ahead of Williams' Q3 results scheduled after the market closes on November 3, RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto reiterated a buy rating on WMB stock with a price forecast of $75. In a preview on the Q3 results of the companies in the U.S. midstream space, Scotto stated that Williams and Targa Resources (TRGP) are her favored names into the earnings.Scotto noted that the secular tailwind for natural gas due to rising power demand for electrification and artificial intelligence (AI)/data center growth is driving the need for more energy infrastructure. The 5-star analyst believes that among the stocks within her coverage, \"WMB is best positioned to benefit given its gas transmission asset footprint and its Power Innovation projects.\"Furthermore, Scotto expects WMB to deliver a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of about 10% in its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) from 2025 through 2030. The analyst looks forward to additional information on WMB's recently announced Power Innovation projects and any new projects. Scotto expects an uptick in Q3 2025 numbers on a quarter-over-quarter basis across all business segments, with Transmission, Gulf, and Power driving the biggest absolute increase.Scotto views WMB's February analyst day as the next catalyst for the stock. The analyst expects WMB to increase its EBITDA growth target from the range of 5% to 7% to high single digits or more.Scotto ranks No. 270 among more than 10,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 13.7%.",

    "body": "A person walks down a street with shopping bags in New York City on Nov. 29, 2024.David Dee Delgado | Getty ImagesAmerican consumer wallets will be billions of dollars lighter this holiday season because of President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to LendingTree.Sunday marked six months since Trump announced his broad \"liberation day\" tariffs.Prices for select food and consumer goods rose in the wake of that announcement.And consumers are set to see more of the impact from those tariffs as holiday items that have been stored in warehouses for months are finally hitting store shelves.LendingTree, which operates on an online lending marketplace, used 2024 winter holiday spending data as a reference point for its analysis of the upcoming season.The company estimated that the new tariffs will increase total holiday costs for consumers and retailers by a total of $40.6 billion.Consumers will be on the hook for most of the extra costs from tariffs, an estimated $28.6 billion.That translates to around $132 per shopper.Retailers are expected to eat the remaining $12 billion in extra costs from the tariffs.\"For most Americans, spending an extra $132 at the holidays is significant,\" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree's chief consumer finance analyst.\"While it may not be earth-shattering, it can have a real impact on many families. It could prompt people to cut back on gift-giving this year or lead to them taking on extra debt,\" Schulz said.\"That's a choice no one wants to have to make.\"Retail analysts have told CNBC that retailers expect consumers to buy fewer items this holiday season due to higher costs from tariffs.Schultz agreed, calling it an \"unfortunate reality\" that many consumers will have to face.\"That might mean giving fewer of those items as gifts, or it could mean having to suck up the higher costs to give your loved ones what they want,\" Schulz said.\"I doubt that we'll see a huge drop-off in the amount of electronics and clothes that are gifted this year, simply because they're what so many people want,\" he said. \"However, for some, higher prices may leave them no choice.\"LendingTree estimated that buyers of holiday electronics will see the biggest hit from the tariffs, with an average extra cost of $186 per shopper.Clothing or accessories have the next highest added cost, at $82 per shopper, the company said.Buyers of personal care items, beauty products, and toys will pay $14 more per shopper, and food and candy will cost $12 more per buyer as a result of the tariffs.",

    "body": "Chinese tech company Baidu announced Monday it can sell some robotaxi rides without any human staff in the vehicles.BaiduBEIJING — As Baidu ramps up its robotaxi operations worldwide, fully driverless weekly rides as of Oct. 31 have now surpassed 250,000 orders, according to a spokesperson for the company's driverless car unit Apollo Go.That's on par with what Waymo reported in late April for its weekly paid U.S. rides. When contacted by CNBC, Waymo did not have a new specific figure to share. The Alphabet-backed robotaxi operator primarily operates in San Francisco and Los Angeles in California and Phoenix, Arizona. Waymo partners with Uber in Austin and Atlanta.The ramp up in Baidu's robotaxi capabilities comes as Chinese and U.S. companies have been competing for leadership in advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, electric cars and autonomous driving.It was not clear for how long Apollo Go has been operating 250,000 rides a week. For the quarter ended June 30, the company averaged about 169,000 rides a week based on CNBC calculations of the 2.2 million fully driverless robotaxi rides disclosed for the period.Baidu's Apollo Go primarily operates robotaxis in Wuhan and parts of Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in mainland China. The company is also expanding to Hong Kong, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and, most recently, Switzerland. Robotaxis typically must undergo phases of public testing before local regulators allow companies to charge fares.Apollo Go said it has received 17 million robotaxi ride orders to date, and that its cars have driven 240 million kilometers (149 million miles), with 140 million fully driverless rides.watch nowOn safety, Apollo Go disclosed on average there has been one airbag deployment incident for every 10.1 million kilometers driven, but so far there's has not been any major accident involving human injury or death.Baidu is scheduled to next release its quarterly results on Nov. 18 before U.S. market open. The company is set to hold its annual tech conference in Beijing on Nov. 13.Weekly robotaxi figures from Chinese rivals Pony.ai and WeRide were not immediately available. Waymo did not immediately respond to a request for an update to the figures shared in April.",

    "body": "In this photo illustration, the logo of semiconductor manufacturer Nexperia is displayed on a screen.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesShares of Europe's biggest carmakers rose on Monday as fears over an industry shortage of semiconductors appeared to recede.China on Saturday said it would consider some exemptions for Nexperia chip exports. It had previously blocked Nexperia semiconductors from leaving the country after the Dutch government seized control of Nexperia, owned by the Chinese company Wingtech.The standoff between the Netherlands and China had prompted automotive groups to raise the alarm over a worsening chip shortage.France's Renault, Germany's Mercedes-Benz Group and Milan-listed shares of Jeep-maker Stellantis were all trading up around 3% on Monday morning.Auto parts suppliers Valeo and Aumovio had advanced 3% and 1.6%, respectively, by around 11:30 a.m. London time (6:30 a.m. ET).Germany's Volkswagen, Porsche and BMW were also trading more than 1.3% higher.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Volkswagen over the last three months compared to other major European automakers.Analysts at Barclays said developments over the weekend appeared to be \"quite positive\" for the automotive sector, with fears of significant disruption likely to be avoided.\"While the Nexperia issue is not fully resolved, with ongoing negotiations between the Dutch and Chinese government to determine a path forward for Nexperia, we believe the potential near-term production headwind has been remediated, although we await more details,\" Dan Levy, senior autos analyst at Barclays, said in a research note published Monday.The situation involving Nexperia began in September, when the Dutch government took control of the company, in what was seen as a highly unusual move, reportedly after the U.S. raised security concerns.In making the decision, the Dutch government cited fears that tech from the company — which specializes in the high-volume production of chips used in automotive, consumer electronics and other industries — \"would become unavailable in an emergency.\"China responded by blocking exports of the firm's finished products.German automakers are thought to be especially sensitive to Nexperia-related disruptions because they rely heavily on large, domestic suppliers, known as \"Tier 1s,\" and local production facilities and companies, such as Nexperia, despite much of its manufacturing moving to China.Japan's Honda Motor became the first known automaker to reduce production due to the problem last week.",

    "body": "META CEO Mark Zuckerberg (L) and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.Getty ImagesAs tech giants increase their already breathtaking spending on artificial intelligence, their respective digital advertising businesses have also gained momentum.Quarterly earnings reports this week from Meta, Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all showed healthy revenue on the ads front.The rising online advertising sales have allayed concerns earlier this year that economic turbulence, amplified by President Donald Trump's trade policies, would negatively impact ad budgets.  \"I think the digital ad market is strong,\" said Jasmine Enberg, co-founder of Scalable, a creator economy media firm. \"I think this economic instability and volatility is kind of priced in for a lot of people at this point; sort of seems to be the status quo.\"Meta topped its rivals for the quarter with the fastest ad-related sales growth.The company's total third-quarter revenue, of which 98% is derived from online ads, jumped 26% year-over-year to $51.24 billion, the company's highest sales since the first quarter of 2024.Revenue in Amazon's online ad unit soared 24% year-over-year to $17.7 billion, representing a faster growth rate than the company's AWS cloud computing unit, which saw sales rise 20%.CEO Andy Jassy highlighted on Amazon's earnings call that the company is continuing to expand its ad-specific demand-side platform to more third-party apps and sites.\"You look at some of the partnerships that we've done, the Roku partnership gives us the largest connected TV footprint in the U.S.,\" Jassy said. \"And you layer on top of that what we've recently done in providing our DSP customers the opportunity to integrate with the ad inventory in Netflix and Spotify and SiriusXM, it's powerful.\"Andy Jassy, chief executive officer of Amazon.com Inc., speaks during an unveiling event in New York, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAlphabet's overall advertising sales for the third quarter came in at $74.18 billion, a 13% increase from $65.85 billion a year ago. Third-quarter online ad sales for YouTube rose 15% to $10.26 billion.Microsoft's search and news advertising unit brought in $3.7 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter, a 14% increase from the $3.2 billion it recorded the previous year.Even if there's been some pullback in ad budgets due to economic uncertainty, it's likely that companies shifted some of that spending from traditional businesses like newspapers to digital ad platforms, said Jeremy Goldman, senior director of content at Emarketer.  \"I think what could be happening is more of a no-brainer,\" Goldman said. \"To put your money in social, and to put your money in retail media and to put your money in search ad spending.\"It wasn't just the megacaps that showed hefty online ad growth this week. Reddit on Thursday reported a 68% jump in third-quarter sales, soaring past analyst estimates. The company said global daily active uniques grew 19% year-over-year to 116 million, surpassing estimates of 114 million.Snap and Pinterest are scheduled to report results next week. Going big on AIThe tech giants all made clear that they don't see any broader economic concerns that would warrant a reduction in their AI spending, and instead lifted their guidance for capital expenditures, despite concerns of a bubble.Alphabet, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft collectively expect capex spending above $380 billion this year, which is still a fraction of the $1 trillion worth of data center and cloud computing deals that OpenAI has recently announced with its partners like Nvidia, Oracle and Broadcom.But while investors cheered Amazon and Google, they were less thrilled with Microsoft, and especially Meta.The Facebook parent's stock tanked 11% on Thursday after the company said it would raise the low end of its capex guidance to between $70 billion and $72 billion from the prior range of $66 billion to $72 billion.Oppenheimer analysts downgraded Meta stock to the equivalent of a hold from buy, because they said it's less obvious how the social media company will benefit from its AI investments relative to its big tech rivals that also operate cloud computing services.\"Significant investment in Superintelligence despite unknown revenue opportunity mirrors 2021/2022 Metaverse spending,\" the Oppenheimer analysts wrote, contrasting the company's big AI spending related to its Superintelligence Labs to its money-losing Reality Labs division, which makes virtual reality and augmented reality technologies.watch nowSusan Li, Meta's finance chief, said Wednesday during a follow-up earnings call that it's important for the company to invest in AI-related data center and third-party cloud computing services or risk falling behind, echoing similar comments made by CEO Mark Zuckerberg. \"The highest priority for the company is investing our resources to position ourselves as a leader in AI,\" Li said. \"That means that I think for the immediate period of time ahead of us, we could see some financial pressure during which our operating profit could be lumpy.\"Meta has continued to point to how its AI investments are improving its online advertising business, but it's having a more difficult time showing how that spending will benefit the company in the future, Enberg said.\"I think part of that is that we've heard the story now quarter after quarter that it is able to integrate AI into its ad business and use that as a growth engine,\" Enberg said.  \"What comes next is harder to articulate, and far less tangible for investors and other people who follow the space.\"Still, Meta is experiencing some growth in new products like the Meta AI app that contains the Vibes AI-powered short video service, Goldman said.The company can also still expand more into subscriptions or even potentially offer enterprise AI services to sell to corporations, which is \"an area that they haven't played at all,\" he said.For now, Meta's digital advertising unit remains its core business, and just like previous quarters, it's unclear how the economy will impact ad budgets.With the holiday season approaching, all eyes will be focused on whether the lingering economic concerns or tariff-related price hikes lead to consumers curbing their spending, which could impact corporate marketing campaigns.  \"The next test will be when we get to the Black Friday numbers,\" Goldman said. \"Are those going to be below expectations?\"WATCH: Big tech earnings tell you \"these are the companies you want to own.\" watch now",

    "body": "A wheel loader takes ore to a crusher at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.Steve Marcus | ReutersThe emergence of critical minerals as a new arena of geopolitical competition has coincided with a dizzying rally in U.S.-listed rare earths mining stocks.Despite paring gains in recent weeks, shares of Critical Metals have advanced 241% over the last three months, while NioCorp Developments, Energy Fuels and Idaho Strategic Resources have all surged well above 100% over the same period.The eye-watering gains are even more remarkable year-to-date. Energy Fuels' stock price has quadrupled through the first 10 months of the year, while NioCorp Developments' shares have nearly quintupled.Rare earths have come to the fore as a key bargaining chip in the ongoing geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.Tony Sage, CEO of Critical Metals, which has one of the world's largest rare earths deposits in southern Greenland, described the rally of U.S.-listed rare earths miners as evidence of a major market boom.\"I talk of it like this, I mean, there have been four big booms. You had the gold boom in the 19th century, the oil boom in the 20th century, in the early 21st century you had the tech boom — and now you've got the rare earths boom,\" Sage told CNBC by telephone.\"But the rare earths boom is the future. It will power all of the above.\"We are going from a philosophy of 'fill the gap' through imports to 'mine the gap' domestically or regionally.Audun MartinsenHead of supply chain research at Rystad EnergyRare earths refer to 17 elements on the periodic table that have an atomic structure that gives them special magnetic properties. These materials are vital components to a vast array of modern technologies, from everyday electronics, such as smartphones, to electric vehicles and military equipment.China, which has a near-monopoly on rare earths, recently threatened to expand its export controls on the elements to further leverage its dominance of the supply chain. However, following an in-person meeting in South Korea on Thursday between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Beijing agreed to delay the Oct. 9 export controls by one year.U.S.-listed rare earths stocks rallied on the news, although analysts remain skeptical about whether the apparent trade truce can offer long-term relief.U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with Chinese President Xi Jinping as they hold a bilateral meeting at Gimhae International Airport, on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, in Busan, South Korea, October 30, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | Reuters\"As in all booms, there were a lot of oil companies that couldn't find oil and there were a lot of gold companies that couldn't find gold. And I'm sure there are going to be a lot of rare earths companies that won't make it either — because when there's a boom, there's hype. And when there's hype, there's overexuberance in investing,\" Critical Metals' Sage said.\"It's not a straight rise up. It's a jagged line, but the trend is in the right direction if you've got the right project in the right place, and you've got the right partners,\" he added.'A much bigger and longer supercycle'Kevin Das, senior technical consultant at New Frontier Minerals, an Australian-based rare earths explorer, agreed with Sage's description of a rare earths market boom, while acknowledging the likelihood of stock price pullbacks.\"People are saying we're in an uptrend on what is a bigger supercycle and some of the evidence behind that is there has been low commodity prices for some time, there's been underinvestment. And now, with the advent of AI ... we're going to see a much bigger and longer supercycle,\" Das told CNBC by telephone.Das drew parallels between the Biden administration's support of clean energy projects, which coincided with a rally in lithium-related stocks, and the Trump administration's backing of rare earths.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconShares of Critical Metals over the last three months.\"In the last nine to 10 months that Trump has been in power, he's talked about annexing Greenland, he's talked about doing a deal with Ukraine for rare earths and then the real clincher was this equity deal with MP Materials,\" Das said.\"So, I think the runway over the next two to three years is going to be very fruitful,\" he added.Not everyone is as bullish on the outlook for rare earths-related stocks, however.Audun Martinsen, head of supply chain research at Rystad Energy, said the recent surge in equity prices reflected a mix of geopolitical tension, strategic policy support and speculative momentum.\"Rare earths have clearly moved to the center of global industrial strategy, vital for defense, EVs and clean energy, but this looks more like the early stages of a structural shift than a mature 'fourth boom,'\" Martinsen told CNBC by email.Neodymium is displayed at the Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. factory in Baotou, Inner Mongolia, China, on Wednesday, May 5, 2010.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"We are going from a philosophy of 'fill the gap' through imports to 'mine the gap' domestically or regionally,\" he continued. \"It will be a lengthy, expensive and rocky path forward as adequate, cost-effective resources and element diversity are complex to get full control over.\"Clean energy transitionGernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia University, said there were two clear factors at work as global competition intensifies to secure the supply of critical minerals — one structural and the other political.\"The structural: Despite whatever political attempts there may be to stop or derail things, the clean-energy transition is happening — and it is accelerating — and yes, it depends on a number of critical minerals, whose prices are bound to jump,\" Wagner told CNBC by email.Read moreChina, for instance, is the low-cost supplier of many of these minerals, Wagner said, noting that the Asian giant's mineral dominance is by no means an accident.\"Beijing has invested heavily in green industrial policy for years, focusing on the full, integrated supply chain. That's where politics enters,\" Wagner said.\"Some attempts to onshore supply chains are eminently justified for national security and other reasons, and those attempts will increase prices and stocks of U.S. mining companies. Some of what we see, of course, is merely the current politics or erratic trade wars and the like,\" he added.",

    "body": "Robots manufacture auto parts at a factory in Ningde, China, on Oct. 17, 2024.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesChina's factory activity growth in October missed market expectations, dragged down by a sharper drop in new export orders, as trade tensions with the U.S. intensified during the month, according to a private survey released Monday.The RatingDog China General Manufacturing PMI, compiled by S&P Global, dropped to 50.6 in October from the six-month high of 51.2 in September, missing analysts' expectations of 50.9 in a Reuters poll.New export orders fell at the quickest pace since May, which the survey respondents attributed to \"rising trade uncertainty.\" New business and output both expanded at slower rates in October compared to the previous month, with business confidence slipping to its lowest level in six months, the survey showed. \"When assessing the one-year outlook for production, firms were the least upbeat in six months,\" it said.A gauge on employment at the factories, however, showed the first expansion since March, rising to the highest level since August 2023.Staying above the 50-benchmark that separates growth from contraction, the private survey numbers were better compared to the official survey released last Friday that showed manufacturing activity falling to 49.0, its worst contraction in six months. Private surveys, previously conducted by Caixin and S&P Global, have usually painted a better picture than official polls over the past years as they have focused more on export-oriented manufacturers.The RatingDog private survey covers 650 manufacturers and collects responses in the second half of each month while the official PMI surveys a larger sample of over 3,000 companies at month-end.With the extension of the U.S.-China trade truce and expected recovery in export orders, the manufacturing PMI is likely to rebound modestly in the coming months as business confidence stabilizes, said Dongming Xie, managing director and head of Asia macro research at OCBC Bank.China and the U.S. reached a trade truce last week following a meeting between American President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, in South Korea, stabilizing relations after an escalating trade battle that had sparked fears of a global economic downturn.Under the agreement, the U.S. will lower the fentanyl-linked tariffs on Chinese goods by half to 10%, taking the total rate on Chinese goods to around 47%, in response to China pausing its sweeping export controls on rare earth metals.The U.S. will suspend the implementation of the 50% ownership \"penetration rule\" under export controls and the Section 301 investigation into China's maritime, logistics and shipbuilding sectors.watch nowBeijing will also terminate antitrust and anti-dumping investigations targeting American chip companies, including those into Nvidia Corp and Qualcomm Inc, the White House said on Saturday. Beijing will also resume purchases of American soybeans and other agricultural and energy products.Goldman Sachs raised its forecast for China's GDP for 2025 last week, encouraged by the U.S. trade detente and Beijing's determination to advance manufacturing competitiveness and further boost exports. The Wall Street bank expects China's real GDP growth to reach 5% this year, 4.8% in 2026, up from 4.9% and 4.3%, respectively.Chinese manufacturers have sought to diversify their export markets since the start of the year to rely less on the U.S. and more on Southeast Asia and European markets. Chinese exports to the U.S. have declined by double digits year-over-year every month since April, falling  of this year compared to the same period last year.That decline was largely offset by increased exports to Southeast Asia, which have jumped 14.7% this year as of September, the European Union, which rose 8.2%, and Africa, which grew over 28%. China's overall exports grew 6.1% in the first three quarters this year, while imports fell 1.1%.Despite resilient exports, the world's second-largest economy has shown fresh signs of strain, with growth slowing to 4.8% in the third quarter, its slowest in a year. Fixed-asset investment, which includes real estate, unexpectedly contracted 0.5% in the first nine months of the year, the first such decline since pandemic-hit 2020.The high base in the fourth quarter last year — with a 5.4% GDP growth — on the back of a blitz of stimulus measures in September will weigh heavily on the growth rate for the current quarter, Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI, said in a note on Sunday.The fading effect of government consumption subsidies and the protracted housing downturn will also continue to suppress growth for next year, Wang added.",

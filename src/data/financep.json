    "body": "Issa Rae has a tried-and-true method to setting herself up for success, she says.The 41-year-old writer, actor, producer and entrepreneur categorically organizes her goals and ideas in a notebook at the beginning of the year, and revisits them six months later to check her progress, she tells CNBC Make It.Rae is often a busy woman. She co-created, co-wrote and starred in the HBO series \"Insecure,\" which premiered in 2016 and ended in 2021. She's acted in several movies, produced other films and TV shows, and launched several businesses, including production company Hoorae Media, Viarae Prosecco, haircare brand Sienna Naturals and Hilltop Coffee and Kitchen, a California-based coffee shop chain.New Year's Day is \"my superpower day,\" says Rae, who's set to additionally appear in a commercial for TurboTax during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. \"That's when everything feels possible. Everything will get done. I look at the [old] notebooks, compile the ideas that I wrote down and decide what's attainable and what's achievable, and I will set those goals.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsRae jots down her personal and career goals separately, she says, and then writes out her resolutions. \"The resolutions I keep to three or four, and they're really general, like, 'read more,' 'be better.' But the career and personal ones are actually very specific.\" (Rae declined to share examples of those specific goals.)If Rae gets an idea for a goal or resolution during other times of the year, she makes a point of writing it down before she forgets, she says. \"The best ideas show up when I'm just chilling,\" she says. \"I always have a notebook near me.\"Rae refers to herself as \"not a good long-term thinker,\" and says that \"having a routine and being really, really intentional about what my goals are\" helps her stay disciplined. The value of writing down your goalsBusiness luminaries ranging from FUBU founder and CEO Daymond John, a longtime investor judge on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" to billionaire Richard Branson have spoken about writing down their goals, too. The simple exercise can make achieving them easier, neuroscientists and psychologists say, helping you set a clear plan and better track your progress.You can even try replacing your bullet-point list of goals with writing a letter to yourself, neuroscientist and author Erin Clabough told CNBC Make It on Jan. 27. The exercise can help you instill a sense of motivation and self-belief that you might otherwise lack, she said.Writing yourself a letter is typically most effective when you set open-ended, big-picture goals, said Clabough. A statement like, \"I will embrace new, exciting experiences this year,\" might allow for more flexibility and satisfaction than something rigid and unadaptable like, \"I will travel to three countries this year.\"Then, once you've given yourself a directive, \"do the best that you can towards that intention, every day,\" Clabough said. \"You're going to make progress towards that, but sometimes it won't be in the way that you thought you were going to do it.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Playing for his fifth NFL team in eight years, 28-year-old quarterback Sam Darnold is preparing to lead the Seattle Seahawks to a potential championship title in Super Bowl 60 on Sunday — a moment that's required a high degree of mental resilience to reach, he told The Athletic on Friday.Darnold's career started with high expectations as the No. 3 draft pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. Instead, he lost more games than he won over his first three seasons, got traded and ultimately served as a backup quarterback for multiple teams over multiple years. He won a starting job with the Minnesota Vikings in 2024 after his primary competition for the role suffered a season-ending knee injury, and to many pundits' surprise, led the Vikings to a 14-3 record that season.His performance led to a three-year contract with Seattle worth $100.5 million in March. Now on the precipice of an NFL championship, Darnold says the resilient mindset he first learned from his parents helped him overcome his own mistakes and self-doubt to resurrect his career.\"My dad worked as a plumber, and my mom is a PE teacher, and it never mattered what kind of day they had. They were always consistent for me and my sister,\" Darnold told The Athletic. \"[It] didn't matter what had happened at work; my dad was always out there playing catch with me afterwards. So, you know, I feel like I just naturally kind of learned to be resilient.\"DON'T MISS: How to build custom GPTs and use AI agentsDarnold still relies on his family to help him maintain a balanced mental state today, he said. \"I would say my family is a huge part in just my ability to get over things when it's bad, and they do a good job of keeping me grounded when things are good,\" said Darnold.Resilience is a key ingredient of success, psychologists agree: It helps us move on from mistakes while maintaining enough confidence to keep taking calculated risks. Teaching kids how to recover from failure and learn important lessons they can apply later on should be the goal of every parent who wants to raise mentally tough and resilient children, psychotherapist Amy Morin wrote for CNBC Make It in March 2021.\"The most accomplished people reached their goals by failing along the way,\" Morin wrote. \"Kids who do well later in life focus their attention on what went wrong and how they could fix it. They have growth mindsets that help them turn failures into positive learning experiences.\"A three-sentence mantra for resilienceEarly in his career, Darnold dwelled too much on his mistakes, he told Fox Sports in an interview that aired on Jan. 30. He'd allow his on-field performance to disproportionately affect his mood and overall mental health, he said.Reflecting on his parents' longtime mindset helped inspire the mental shift that Darnold credits with helping turn his career around, he said. \"Sometimes, mistakes happen and you learn from it,\" he said. \"And you don't want to make the same mistakes again, but [if you have] a long career, those things are going to happen.\"Darnold also took inspiration from a quote from Jerry Rice, one of the greatest players in NFL history, he told The San Francisco Standard on Thursday.\"Jerry Rice said that he never had a perfect practice or a perfect game,\" said Darnold. \"That's the mindset I try to have. It's not always going to be perfect, [but] it's about how can you move on from mistakes to continue to better the team and better yourself.\"Now, rather than dwelling on mistakes — which are bound to happen, in some way — Darnold tries \"to flush bad plays, flush bad games\" from his memory and move on with his positive attitude intact, he told The Athletic.When things don't work out the way he'd planned, he turns to a mantra for resilience, he said: \"'That happens. It's football. We're not always going to be perfect.'\"Want to get ahead at work with AI? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, Beyond the Basics: How to Use AI to Supercharge Your Work.

    "body": "There are two ways to get back to the level of home affordability Americans had for much of the last decade, according to Realtor.com. Neither looks realistic anytime soon.In 2019, the mortgage payment for a median-priced home took up about 21% of median household income. Today, it accounts for more than 30%, reflecting sharply higher home prices and mortgage rates that have nearly doubled since January 2022, according to a recent analysis from the real estate listings platform.Barring a sharp drop in home prices, Realtor.com calculates that getting monthly payments back to 2019 levels would require one of two things:Household incomes rising 56% to a median of $132,171, up from $84,763 todayMortgage rates falling to 2.65%, down from 6.15% as of Feb. 6Neither option appears likely in the near term. Real median household income has risen only about 17% over the past 20 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Mortgage rates are more likely to ease from their current 30-year fixed rate, though most forecasts still have them hovering near 6% through 2026.Even at that level, affordability gains may be limited. The National Association of Realtors projects that home prices will rise about 4% in 2026 as renewed demand runs up against stubborn supply shortages.\"The U.S. housing market continues to grapple with a persistent mismatch between housing supply and buyer demand,\" Hannah Jones, senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, tells CNBC Make It. \"If buyer demand strengthens without a corresponding increase in supply, renewed price growth is likely.\"Limited housing supply remains a challengeA chronic shortage of homes continues to weigh on housing affordability. There is a nationwide housing shortfall of nearly 4 million homes, Realtor.com estimates, a gap that helps explain why lower mortgage rates or stronger wage growth alone may not be enough to deliver substantial affordability gains.\"You don't really solve an affordability crisis by subsidizing demand through artificially cheap financing,\" says Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel. For costs to go down, the supply of homes has to better meet demand, he says.Supply has been slow to catch up in part because zoning rules and lengthy permitting processes often limit how much new housing can be built or where it can go, according to a separate Realtor.com report from 2025.Expanding housing supply through additional construction and policy changes remains critical to easing affordability pressures, particularly in supply-constrained markets, according to NAR.At the federal level, lawmakers have introduced bipartisan proposals aimed at zoning, permitting and construction bottlenecks, though most remain in early stages.More change is happening at the state level. Texas and California have passed laws to loosen zoning rules and streamline permitting, but the impact has been mixed so far.The timeline for closing the housing supply gap also varies sharply by region, according to a 2025 Realtor.com report. At the current pace of construction and household formation, the report estimates the supply gap could close within three years in the South and six and a half years in the West. The Midwest would need roughly four decades. In the Northeast, the gap would not close at all under current trends.Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "A young woman wearing headphones browses vintage vinyl records in a store.Mihailomilovanovic | E+ | Getty ImagesAccount manager Matt Richards, 23, deleted all his social media apps from his phone last year, and was surprised to find that his life changed for the better. Richards had been using a smartphone since he was 11 years old and grew up with the device like most Gen Z and millennials. However, in the past few years, he noticed social media didn't feel as fun anymore with artificial-intelligence slop dominating his feed, influencers advertising brands, and constant lifestyle comparison.\"I think people back then used to take a break from the real world by going on their phone, but now people are taking a break from their phone to spend time in the real world,\" Richards told CNBC Make It. As many of his Gen Z friends also caught on, he noticed instant benefits, from connecting with people in real life to feeling more confident about himself. Going chronically offline is the latest trend to grip young people, and ironically it's going viral on social media. There's been a surge of TikTok videos of people vowing to delete social media apps in 2026 and engage more with in-person and analog hobbies. When I discovered the trend, I decided to post on LinkedIn to see if there were any young people willing to speak to me about going offline. To my surprise, I received nearly 100 responses from Gen Z and millennials sharing stories about social media detoxes and digital burnout. They talked about ditching their smartphones for flip phones, visiting record stores to buy vinyl, taking up analog hobbies like knitting, and most importantly, connecting with their friends in person. A 2025 Deloitte consumer trends survey of more than 4,000 Brits found that nearly a quarter of all consumers had deleted a social media app in the previous 12 months, rising to nearly a third for Gen Zers. Meanwhile, social media use has steadily declined since time spent on the platforms peaked in 2022, according to an analysis of the online habits of 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries by the Financial Times and digital audience insights firm GWI. Globally, adults 16 and over spent an average of two hours and 20 minutes per day on social platforms by the end of 2024, down almost 10% since 2022, the report found. The decline was particularly pronounced among teens and 20-somethings. Jason Dorsey, president of the Center for Generational Kinetics, said the increased \"nastiness and divisiveness\" online, including from leaders and politicians, is driving young people away from social media as they seek out greater control of their lives. \"We're seeing that a group of Gen Z [and millennials] is choosing to leave social media entirely, and probably a larger group that's choosing just to limit social media as they regain more of what they're trying to find: balance and security and safety in their life,\" Dorsey said. 'Pressure platform' Young people who are deleting their social media platforms cite the increasing pressures of being online as well as damage to their mental health as causes.Deloitte's consumer survey showed that almost a quarter of respondents who deleted social apps reported these apps had negatively impacted their mental health and consumed too much of their time. \"I feel like social media is now more like a pressure platform … you're being sold everything, everywhere,\" Richards said, adding that it influenced his own feelings of not having enough stuff or accomplishing enough in his career. We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them...this person doesn't need validation.Matt Richards 23-year-old account manager Similarly, 36-year-old entrepreneur Lucy Stace said she's limiting her social media use because it's \"diminishing\" her mental health despite it being essential to her business. \"We are just inundated all of the time with so much information … our brains aren't capable of handling that much information,\" she said. \"We're actually diminishing our brain's capacity to be able to look inward and listen to ourselves, and we're value tagging all of these things that aren't actually important to us.\" Tech giants face \"tremendous pressure\" to monetize everything and drive revenue and profit, said Dorsey, which can be off-putting to younger generations. \"The result of that is that Gen Z, who are already sensitive to being advertised to — they are the most advertised-to generation in the history of the world — now they're getting advertised to even more, and their feeds feel just [like] commercial after commercial,\" Dorsey said. Offline is the new 'cool' As the tide shifts against social media, account manager Richards noted that those who have gone offline have become more interesting. In the past, it was cooler to have lots of followers, but that appeal has faded, Richards noted. \"We're definitely seeing a trend where people that are offline, unreachable, have a sort of cool factor around them, in terms of this person doesn't need validation from how many likes or followers (they have) … and living life like they were in the 80s,\" he said. Social media manager Julianna Salguero, 31, said that social media stopped being cool when politicians and brands started using the platform.\"The more that we see brands and government officials and everybody being as online as you are, as a casual user, the more you're going to want to pull back and switch it,\" Salguero said. As the digital generation struggles to make friends and find partners, they're instead seeking out in-person events like speed dating and professional networking, citing high levels of loneliness and isolation as a key driver. The University of Sheffield's digital media lecturer, Ysabel Gerrard, said going offline is a way for young people to take back control of their lives. Social media forces users to go through an \"extremely exhausting process\" of having to create an identity and edit themselves, she said. \"There's an unbelievable wealth of literature now to tell us that the person we are on social media is not, and cannot be, the same person who we are in face-to-face settings,\" Gerrard said. \"It's so much more than a trend.\" GWI analyst Chris Beer said he believes this is a \"legitimate post-pandemic correction,\" since people are spending less time at home and therefore less time on social media. This shift is \"largely due to structural time allocation,\" he said, especially for younger users, rather than \"an attitude-driven wholesale rejection of digital media.\" Social media is still very integrated into people's lives in areas including shopping, news and education, Beer said.Analog is back In a Substack post in September that got 5,000 likes, Salguero expressed a yearning to have lived life in the '90s when dating apps and doom scrolling weren't a prerequisite of young adulthood. Her article, titled \"How to have an analog fall,\" wasn't about doing digital detoxes or setting timers to limit social media use. Instead, Salguero outlined all the hobbies one could have outside of social media — from going on lunch dates to writing physical letters and opting for tangible media like newspapers. Salguero said going analog is a \"quiet revolution\" against social media, streaming, and content overload. Lacy Stace and her boyfriend's record collection.\"When you spend too much time in that world, it's rewiring your brain to perceive things algorithmically, where I'd rather perceive things as I come across them,\" she said. \"So for me, the going analog of it all isn't necessarily throwing my phone into the ocean, it's more about, 'How do I reset my relationship with it?'\"Indeed, young people are increasingly turning towards physical media as they seek a break from digital life. Some are purchasing vinyl and record players, while others are getting flip phones, a relic of the 2000s. Stace and her boyfriend have started building a record collection and visit record stores when they can, she said.Richards, after deleting all the social media apps off his smartphone, said his conversation with CNBC Make It has motivated him to purchase a \"brick phone\" too, reverting back to the time when phones were primarily used to call people.

    "body": "Piotr Swat | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesHims & Hers on Saturday said that it will pull its copycat weight-loss pill off the market after sparking controversy and threats of legal action earlier this week.\"Since launching the compounded semaglutide pill on our platform, we've had constructive conversations with stakeholders across the industry,\" the telehealth provider posted on social media. \"As a result, we have decided to stop offering access to this treatment. We remain committed to the millions of Americans who depend on us for access to safe, affordable, and personalized care.\"Hims & Hers had previously said it planned to create a cheaper, copycat version of pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss pill. That treatment — featuring Wegovy's active ingredient, semaglutide — was set to launch for as little as $49 for the first month. Novo's pill sells for roughly $100 more.Novo on Thursday threatened legal action against Hims for what it called \"illegal mass compounding,\" adding that the company planned to take legal and regulatory action. \"This is another example of Hims & Hers' historic behaviour of duping the American public with knock-off GLP-1 products, and the FDA has previously warned them about their deceptive advertising of GLP-1 knock-offs,\" Novo said in a statement at the time.On Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration weighed in, announcing it planned to take legal action against Hims & Hers for the pill, including restricting access to the ingredients and referring the company to the Department of Justice.In response, Hims on Saturday said it \"has always operated with a deep commitment to the safety and best interests of consumers and in compliance with applicable law.\"The move comes as the company plans to run an advertisement during Super Bowl 60 on Sunday. The ad features rapper Common voicing the message that \"America's wealth gap has turned into a health gap.\" Hims previously said it expects the ad to \"ruffle some feathers.\"",

    "body": "Attendees during the Singapore Airshow in Singapore, on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2026. The show runs through Feb. 8. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith geopolitical uncertainty on the rise, defense buyers at the Singapore Airshow say they are prioritizing sovereignty, from local production and co‑development to owning the software and intellectual property that run their systems. Industry leaders say that control over hardware, software and supply chains is now a central factor in procurement decisions.Executives at the show, which closes on Sunday, pointed to shifting alliances and tougher rhetoric from major powers as a catalyst for the trend. \"There is a notion that is coming around very explicitly ... the notion of sovereignty,\" Pascale Sourisse, senior executive vice president for international development at French aerospace and defense firm Thales, told CNBC.Sourisse added that this mindset has helped drive defense spending higher as countries conclude they must look after their own security.Chua Jin Kiat, executive vice president and head of international defense business at Singapore engineering and defense firm ST Engineering, echoed the sentiment, and said that over the last 12 months, U.S. President Donald Trump's combative stance toward allies has pushed countries to realize that \"we may not be able to depend on others.\"Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has pushed its allies to spend more on defense, with NATO committing to spend 5% of their GDP on defense by 2035. Trump has threatened allies' such as Canada and most recently Denmark over its territory of Greenland. He has also reportedly said he would sell allies weaker versions of American weapons \"because someday, maybe they're not our allies.\"Chua added that countries are recognizing that old alliances and alignments may not be \"so enforceable or relevant\" anymore, even organizations such as NATO. \"So you can be a NATO member. But actually, at the end of the day today, what we are seeing is, first and foremost, if I'm Germany, I'm Germany. If I'm Finland, I'm Finland,\" he said. Supply chain resilienceA direct consequence of that shift is a renewed emphasis on boosting supply‑chain resilience. Companies told CNBC they are responding by localizing production, transferring know‑how, or partnering with domestic firms so customers can maintain and upgrade systems without long, fragile supply lines.Sourisse said Thales is not only marketing its solutions but also planning to localize activities and competencies. The company has set up joint labs in Singapore with local agencies to develop capabilities on the ground.ST Engineering's Chua said the company, constrained by Singapore's limited land area available for large factories, prefers co‑production arrangements overseas. For example, if ST Engineering can make advanced vehicles in a country with more space for production plants than Singapore, the company would collaborate and teach them how to build them in a co-production effort.\"For many of the big primes, they have to keep their factories at home running. They have got huge production plants, thousands of jobs, and the lights have to be kept on constantly.\"New kids on the blockSovereignty extends beyond factories to software and intellectual property. Newer firms in the defense tech space are becoming aware of those demands and are structuring deals accordingly.U.S.- based Shield AI, which develops autonomous warfare systems, signed a memorandum of understanding at the airshow to integrate its Hivemind autonomy software across selected ST Engineering platforms. Shield AI X-bat flight renderingShield AIThe company had earlier in 2025 partnered with the Republic of Singapore Air Force to use Hivemind to enhance the RSAF's autonomous capabilities.Brandon Tseng, co‑founder of Shield AI, told CNBC that Hivemind enables other companies and militaries to develop their own artificial-intelligence pilots locally, and Singapore would own that intellectual property. \"They can build AI pilots for whatever they want to do. We don't own [the IP],\" he told CNBC. Tseng added that while countries will continue to buy some foreign hardware, many want to indigenize critical capabilities such as AI and autonomy.",

    "body": "When Amanda DeRise's father sent her a listing for a 140-year-old six-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2024, her first thought was that it needed a lot of work. Her realtor even called it a \"money pit.\" But Amanda, 32, and her husband, Vincent, 34, saw potential in the home. Amanda and Vincent decided to start saving for their future home in 2021, but quickly realized a new build or freshly renovated property would be out of their budget, Vincent says. It's why the listing Amanda's father sent her seemed to be perfect for them, she says. The location would also allow Amanda to take the local ferry into New York City for work. The six-bedroom, two bathroom house was built in the 1800s.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItThe couple's realtor told them the house was for sale by an older man who had raised his family there and did not want to sell it to an investor. \"I wrote a nice letter to the older man stating that we want to take care of this house and bring it back to its former glory,\" Amanda says.The three decided on a sale price of $550,000 — $90,000 under the asking price. The DeRises closed on the house on Halloween night in 2024 with a 15% down payment of $82,500. They obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 7.125% rate and a monthly payment of just under $3,900, including taxes and insurance, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It.The next step: Renovating the property piece by piece. Modernizing the home, while preserving its charmAmanda and Vincent moved into the house in November 2024 and started renovations just a few weeks later, which included taking down the second floor to the studs, adding central air and modernizing the house while preserving its charm. They say the house was in pretty bad condition when they first bought it. The wallpaper was peeling off the walls, the windows needed to be redone and the siding needed updating.Amanda and Vincent DeRise slept in the living room while renovating the second floor of their 140-year-old New Jersey home.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItDuring the renovation, the couple wanted to make sure some of the original features of the house were restored. They had the original window trim replicated, kept what they think is an original light fixture in the dining room and used a lot of furniture left by the previous owners.They have made changes to the layout, though, such as combining two of the bedrooms to create a larger primary bedroom.Amanda and Vincent estimate they've spent about $172,000 on renovations, which they've funded through personal savings, a 401(k) loan and selling equity from a former employer, they say. So far, the most expensive parts of the renovation have been the siding and the windows, which totaled around $70,000. In addition to income from their 9-to-5 jobs — Amanda is an administrative assistant at a fintech company and Vincent is a director of revenue operations at a SaaS company — the couple earn money from TikTok's Creator Fund. They started sharing their renovation journey on TikTok in November 2024 and currently have 41,000 followers, with several of their videos getting over 600,000 views. Amanda says sharing their journey on TikTok helped them get a brand deal to get free paint for parts of the house.   Living through a renovationLiving in the house while renovating it was the hardest part of fixing it up, Amanda says. The couple slept in the living room while they renovated the second floor.\"We had moments where windows were being blown out as we're living in here. The home was always a construction zone because it was pretty major projects going on,\" Vincent says.Amanda and Vincent did a lot of things themselves in the house.Amanda and Vincent DeRiseThey could have rented an apartment during this period, but didn't want to spend additional money, Vincent says. To stretch their budget as far as possible, the couple not only lived in the home but also downgraded their car and canceled subscriptions such as YouTube TV.There's still a long way to goAlthough they are getting ready to welcome a their first child, the couple says the renovations are still not done and won't be for several years. In fact, Amanda says the joke is that they probably will never be done. \"There will always be something to do,\" she says. The couple has yet to renovate the house's third floor, which includes Vincent's office and the attic. The kitchen also still needs work, which Vincent and Amanda hope to complete in the next few years. \"I don't want to make it feel like a modern kitchen,\" Amanda says. \"I definitely want to keep the charm of an older home.\"However, the couple say they are enjoying the process, especially the items they've found inside the house. Their findings include a Stan Musial 1948 rookie baseball card, handwritten letters from the 1930s, a purse with old shopping receipts from 1925 and a vintage breast pump.The discoveries have the couple thinking about what they could put into the walls for future owners to find.\"We have just been collecting some random items, some of our own that we plan to put maybe in the floorboards in the attic or, while we're renovating more rooms, put them in the walls,\" Amanda says.Investing in the futureVincent says he was originally against buying the house because of the work it needed, but thought it would be a good investment given the town and its location. In 2025, Netflix closed on a deal to buy Fort Monmouth, a former Army base less than 10 miles from Atlantic Highlands. The company plans to build a $900 million campus that will include 12 soundstages, backlot areas and production facilities, NBC reports. \"One thing about the home is that we always knew it was going to be a good investment. It's an exciting place to be,\" Vincent says. \"There's a lot of renovations happening across the county and the town, so we always just thought that this home would be the right type of investment, especially because we believe we'll be here for a very long time.\"The couple knows they plan on staying in the house for a very long time.Tasia Jensen | CNBC Make ItGoing forward, \"We're excited to continue to make this home our own,\" Amanda says. \"Maybe someone in 100 years looks at some of the work that we've done around the home and sees our touch to it,\" Vincent adds.

    "body": "Jennifer Garner, co-founder of Once Upon a Farm, center, and Cassandra Curtis, co-founder of of Once Upon a Farm, center right, during the company's initial public offering (IPO) on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, US, on Friday, Feb. 6, 2026. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOnce Upon a Farm made its public market debut on Friday, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"OFRM.\"The stock opened at $21 per share, up 16% from its initial public offering price. The shares closed on Friday up 17%.The organic children's nutrition company priced its IPO at $18 per share on Thursday, in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. Once Upon a Farm and backers sold about 11 million shares, raising $197.9 million and valuing the company at $724 million.Founded in 2015 by Cassandra Curtis and Ari Raz, the Berkeley, California-based company sells a range of organic cold-processed, refrigerated baby foods and kid snacks. In 2017, actress Jennifer Garner and former Annie's Homegrown CEO John Foraker joined the company as co-founders. Garner sits on the company's board and holds the formal title \"Farmer Jen,\" while Foraker, whom she calls the \"Grand Poobah of organic,\" is CEO.\"We want to feed babies to big kids, as we're helping make parents lives easier,\" Garner told CNBC.Once Upon a Farm's market debut comes as shoppers and policymakers alike have pushed back on ultra-processed foods, particularly when consumed by children. For example, the \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, spearheaded by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr., has found evangelists in so-called MAHA moms, who agree with his opinions on everything from junk food to childhood vaccinations. The shift in behavior has hurt Big Food, while fueling growth for insurgent brands like Once Upon a Farm. In 2024, the company recorded net sales of $156.8 million, up 66% from the prior year, although its losses widened from $17.6 million to $23.8 million, according to a regulatory filing.\"With these tailwinds and consumer trends being in the right spot, we're really trying to take advantage of that and deliver more for consumers,\" Foraker said in an interview.Retailers have taken note of the shift and are allotting prime shelf space to organic foods, a far cry from Foraker's early days at Annie's, when its products were relegated to the undesirable \"organic\" corner in grocery stores, he said.Once Upon a Farm, which is officially designated as a public benefit corporation, aims to \"drive systemic change in childhood nutrition,\" according to its mission statement. Foraker said its commitment to that goal is why it chose to go public rather than seek a sale, a much more common ambition for upstart consumer goods businesses. While Foraker said he had a good experience with General Mills after it bought Annie's in 2014, he noted that across the food and beverage industry, many companies do not stick to the promises that they make to brands they are buying and honor their mission. (Look no further than the yearslong dust-up between Ben & Jerry's and its former owner Unilever and current parent Magnum Ice Cream Co., which spun out from the Dove owner last year.)Once Upon a Farm was planning to go public last year, before the longest-ever government shutdown disrupted those plans. The company plans to spend the IPO proceeds to pay down its debt, purchase new equipment and fund general corporate purposes, according to a regulatory filing.Broadly, more IPOs are expected this year, thanks to interest rate cuts and a large backlog of companies that have been scared off by market volatility and recession fears. This week alone saw seven companies go public through IPOs that raised at least $150 million each, including Bob's Discount Furniture, according to Renaissance Capital data.",

    "body": "Thomas Fuller | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesCompany: Appian Corp. (APPN) Business: Appian provides business process management (BPM) solutions. Its products include BPM software, case management, mobile application development and platform-as-a-service. The company was founded by Matthew Calkins, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson and Michael Beckley in 1999 and is headquartered in McLean, Va.Stock Market Value: $1.86B ($25.21 per share)Activist: Fivespan PartnersOwnership: 7.91%Average Cost: $29.73 Activist Commentary: Fivespan Partners, LP is a San Francisco-based investment firm founded in October 2023 by Dylan Haggart and Sarah Coyne. Prior to Fivespan, Haggart and Coyne were partners at ValueAct Capital and 80% of the investment team is from ValueAct. Fivespan, named after the unique five-stone arched bridge in Haggart's hometown, views itself as a bridge between the market and companies. The firm prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism, but it would resort to a proxy fight if there were no other choice. We expect that Fivespan will look for board seats in situations where it believes it could add real value, but we do not expect the firm to pursue board representation as often as ValueAct does (i.e, in roughly 50% of core portfolio positions). Haggart has experience as a public company director. He served as a director of Seagate (2018-present) and Fiserv (2022-2024), where he delivered stellar returns over his tenures of 205.25% and 64.68%, respectively, versus 46.12% and 4.98% for the Russell 2000. Fivespan looks for high quality, idiosyncratic businesses with good, strategic assets. The firm does not advocate for selling its portfolio companies as a primary activist strategy, but it likes companies that people want to own. Accordingly, many of its activist campaigns could end with a sale of the company, providing two paths to shareholder value. The fund is a drawdown structure that holds investments for at least three to five years, aims to have six to eight investments at a time and averages $100 million to $300 million in each investment.What's happeningOn Jan. 27, Fivespan announced that it will continue meeting with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board.Behind the scenesAppian provides mission critical business process and management software solutions to some of the largest, most complex enterprises in the world. Its customer base consists primarily of legacy businesses that operate outdated backend technology stacks, including large banks, telecom companies and even the Department of Defense. Appian's software is deeply embedded into these companies' systems, resulting in extremely high switching costs. As a result, customers hardly ever leave, with gross retention at approximately 99%. Moreover, Appian and its peers have penetrated only about 10% of what could be a $90 billion market. As a result, the company benefits from consistent mid-teens revenue growth, mostly from new business with current clients. Despite this compelling backdrop, Appian shares trade at roughly 2-times sales and 3-times gross profit – more than a 50% discount to similarly situated peers.With Appian's stock down 89% over the past five years, Fivespan Partners has entered the picture filing a 13D disclosing a 6.16% position in Appian and announced that it will continue to have meetings with management regarding the company's operations, strategy and governance, including whether it makes sense for a Fivespan employee to join the company's board. Any changes made or board representation would have to come at the invitation of the current board as Appian is effectively a controlled company. Appian co-founder CEO, chairman, and president Matthew Calkins controls about 39% of the voting power, two of the other three founders are on the nine-person board with many other directors being former employees of Appian or having relationships with Calkins. But that is OK. Going back to his ValueAct days, Dylan Haggart has had a lot of experience and success working with controlled companies like KKR and The New York Times, the latter of which is also a current Fivespan portfolio position.There are at least three solvable issues that have driven Appian's discount. First is that the market has a fundamental misconception around Appian's artificial intelligence risk. As is the problem with many software companies, Appian has been broadly categorized as an \"automation\" company, leading it to be lumped in with businesses genuinely exposed to AI disruption, such as customer service or chatbot-driven automation. Appian's automation, however, is entirely different, as it is focused on creating and implementing complex backend processes. Nevertheless, this branding has forced it to be painted with the same brush, and in today's market, anything associated with automation is being sold off indiscriminately. Anyone who looks at Appian's financials' can recognize the fallacy of this bear case, as the company's growth and retention metrics look nothing like those of companies with actual AI risk. The problem here is that Appian has thus far failed to communicate this to the market. The company's four founders – Matthew Calkins, Michael Beckley, Robert Kramer, Marc Wilson – are tech guys, mostly college buddies who started this company out of a garage. These are not guys who want to talk to the market, and the company's lack of an investor relations professional further underscores that. Thus, communicating this narrative to the market and perhaps even finding someone to fill this role for the company are both areas where Fivespan could add immediate value.Second is a lack of focus on margins. Historically, management, like many other growth companies, has prioritized top-line growth with limited attention to the company's profitability, leaving Appian's free cash flow margins in the low single digits, while comparable businesses like Pega generate margins north of 30%. With Fivespan now involved, this is likely to begin to change. Appian's recurring and sticky revenue model should allow them to pursue both revenue growth while expanding margins, by ensuring that incremental growth generates incremental profitability. While margins won't jump overnight, they should improve steadily each quarter as costs continue to grow more slowly than revenue, something we have observed from larger peers like Pega and ServiceNow. It is important to note that this is not a situation where layoffs and cost-cutting will lead to margin improvement, just being conscious of incremental costs as revenue increases should significantly benefit the bottom line.Lastly is capital allocation. As margins expand, Appian should become a cash cow, making disciplined capital allocation increasingly important for a company that hasn't had the strongest track record of doing so. This is where we see Haggart adding the most value. Some of the best activism occurs when a good activist gets on the board of a good company and management continues to do what they do best – run the business generating significant free cash flow, and an activist like Haggart does what he does best – help advise the board the best way to spend the cash flow to maximize shareholder value. This is one thing ValueAct is known for and that Haggart did extremely well at companies like Seagate. And this is an even more important skill to have on Appian's board, as the company is on the verge of coming into an at least $500 million windfall from a corporate espionage lawsuit filed against Pega. Appian sued Pega in 2020 and won a $2.036 billion verdict in 2022. The Virginia Court of Appeals overturned the verdict in 2024 and remanded it back to the lower court for a new trial. However, Appian had partly insured the verdict in the amount of $500 million, meaning that if it's ultimately awarded less than $500 million, the insurance company will make up the difference. If it's awarded more than $500 million, it is theirs to keep and the insurance company is off the hook. So, it is just a matter of time before Appian receives at least $500 million, which is more than 25% of the company's entire market cap.In the firm's other three campaigns, Fivespan has demonstrated that it prefers \"behind the scenes,\" collaborative and amicable activism — and that's a good thing as it doesn't have any other choice here. However, while any strategic, operational, or governance changes are ultimately in the company's discretion, we think Appian and Fivespan are rowing in the same direction. Moreover, we think the company would benefit greatly from the addition of a minority shareholder representative on the board, like Haggart or another Fivespan executive. One of the benefits of having a hedge fund representative on the board is that the board not only gets the director's advice and counsel, but the resources of the entire firm and its team of analysts. This is particularly important when there are crucial capital allocation decisions to be made. Ultimately, this will be an activist-lite campaign and Haggart knows that he can only be effective here with the blessing and invitation of the founder. We expect he will proceed with that in mind.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "watch nowLow oil prices give President Donald Trump more leverage over Iran, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Friday, speaking as the two adversaries teeter on the brink of another conflict. \"The world is very well supplied with oil right now, and I think it gives President Trump more leverage in his geopolitical actions to not worry about a crazy spike in oil prices,\" Wright told CNBC in an interview when asked about the risk of a supply disruption due to tensions with Iran. The oil market is closing monitoring tensions in the Middle East for any sign that crude supplies could be disrupted. U.S. crude oil rose 26 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $63.55 per barrel Friday. Prices are up more than 10% since the start of the year, after losing 20% in 2025. Oil market analysts are generally expecting a surplus this year after OPEC+ increased output and as U.S. production remains strong. Trump has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East as he threatens Iran with military action if it does not negotiate over its nuclear program. The president threatened Iran with strikes in January during a mass uprising against the regime, but ultimately refrained. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held negotiations over the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in Muscat, Oman earlier on Friday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\" Iran is an OPEC member and produces more than 3 million barrels per day. Wright expects production in Venezuela to grow by several hundred thousand barrels per day this year, after the U.S. captured former President Nicolas Maduro early in January. The U.S. has seized control of Venezuela's oil sales and President Trump is pressuring U.S. companies to rebuild its energy sector.\"It will be a substantial percent of global demand growth this year,\" Wright said of output growth in the South American nation. \"Venezuela is going to be another helpful stabilizer of energy markets.\"",

    "body": "The logo for Google LLC is seen at the Google Store Chelsea in Manhattan, New York, Nov. 17, 2021.Andrew Kelly | ReutersMore than 900 Google workers have signed an open letter condemning recent actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP), urging the tech giant to disclose its dealings with the agencies and divest from them.The letter, citing recent ICE killings of Keith Porter, Renee Good, and Alex Pretti, said that the employees are \"appalled by the violence\" and \"horrified\" by Google's part in it.\"Google is powering this campaign of surveillance, violence, and repression,\" the letter reads. It goes on to cite that Google Cloud is aiding CBP surveillance and powering Palantir's ImmigrationOS system, which is used by ICE. The letter states that Google's generative artificial intelligence is used by CBP and that the Google Play Store has blocked ICE tracking apps.The letter also quotes a social media post by Google Chief Scientist Jeff Dean from early January, who wrote, \"We all bear a collective responsibility to speak up and not be silent when we see things like the events of the last week.\"\"We are vehemently opposed to Google's partnerships with DHS, CBP, and ICE,\" the employees wrote. \"We consider it our leadership's ethical and policy-bound responsibility to disclose all contracts and collaboration with CBP and ICE, and to divest from these partnerships.\"The letter calls on Google to acknowledge the danger that workers face from ICE, host an emergency internal Q&A on the company's DHS and military contracts, implement safety measures to protect workers — such as flexible work-from-home policies and immigration support — and reveal its ties with the government agencies to help all involved determine where the company will draw a line.\"As workers of conscience, we demand that our leadership end our backslide into contracting for governments enacting violence against civilians,\" the letter reads. \"Google is now a prominent node in a shameful lineage of private companies profiting from violent state repression. We must use this moment to come together as a Googler community and demand an end to this disgraceful use of our labor.\"Google did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.The letter comes as employees place mounting pressure on tech CEOs to speak out against ICE. Just two weeks prior, employees representing Amazon, Spotify, Meta and more wrote a similar letter demanding ICE \"out of our cities.\"",

    "body": "A snow removal machine is seen working while a Boeing 737 American Airlines passenger aircraft is parked at gate on the tarmac of LaGuardia airport in New York on January 25, 2026. Charly Triballeau | Afp | Getty ImagesAmerican Airlines' promised turnaround is off to a rocky start this year.Pilot and flight attendant unions have called CEO Robert Isom's leadership into question as the airline's performance has trailed its rivals by a wide margin, a trend that has translated to lower profit-sharing for American's more than 130,000 employees. Adding to employee frustration, the airline struggled to recover from major winter storms in recent weeks and crews were left stranded — some without a place to sleep beside the airport.Late Friday, the pilots' union wrote to the airline's board, seeking a meeting to discuss the carrier's financial and operational challenges.\"Our airline is on an underperforming path and has failed to define an identity or a strategy to correct course,\" the board of directors of the Allied Pilots Association wrote. The union called for \"leaders who are willing, equipped, and empowered to get the house in order.\"Isom replied on Saturday that as board member and chief executive it is \"most appropriate\" to meet as soon as possible. \"The Board and I are aligned with you in the desire to make American the strongest airline possible in every respect,\" he wrote.American made $111 million last year, an amount eclipsed by profits from Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, which brought in $5 billion and more than $3.3 billion, respectively, even though American flew similar capacity in 2025.\"I know that it is a meager profit-sharing, a very small profit-sharing pool this year. Again, when you break even, that's the kind of profit-sharing you have,\" Isom told employees after releasing earnings results on Jan. 27, according to a recording of the event that was reviewed by CNBC. \"I'm disappointed in that.\"'2026 can't just feel different'American is trying to catch up to rivals with premium products that bring in higher fares, a bright spot in the industry as coach cabin revenue growth has been elusive. It has also worked to reverse the damage from a failed direct-to-traveler business-travel strategy, whose architect American ousted in May 2024. 2026 is crucial for the carrier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based airline issued an upbeat outlook for the year on Jan. 27, and Isom told crews that he was optimistic about improvement this year. He also noted that many staff, like flight attendants, make more than their counterparts at United, where cabin crews and other employees are in contract negotiations.Isom is leading what he has pitched as a major transformation of American. The strategy includes improving customer service, the network and revenue management.This week, he took his message to about 6,000 leaders at a conference the airline held at Globe Life Field in Arlington, Texas.\"We've had conversations as a senior leadership team about how we can't pass up any opportunity ... how we need to hold ourselves accountable,\" Isom said at the event, according to a transcript which was seen by CNBC. \"It starts with us at the top, but it's all of us here today and how you lead your teams. 2026 can't just feel different. It has to be different.\"American issued its 2026 outlook as it was juggling the aftermath of a late January winter storm that walloped much of the U.S. with snow, ice and sleet and preparing for another storm that ended up hitting its major hub of Charlotte, North Carolina, while competitors dug out faster.The financial results, coupled with the slow storm recovery, drew anger from both pilot and flight attendant union leaders, which together represent about 40,000 crew members. This week, two American Airlines flight operations leaders met with the union to discuss recent problems, and the union told members, \"Our pilots will not accept platitudes, empty words, and the absence of decisive action any longer.\" Association of Professional Flight Attendants President Julie Hedrick said on Jan. 27 that Isom, who became CEO in 2022, \"is missing the human factor\" and that \"many of us have been here for a very long time, and we don't see an ending that puts us in a better place.\"Isom acknowledged the trouble American's crew members faced during the late January storm that paralyzed a large swath of the United States and called the weather \"probably the most impactful\" during his decades-long tenure at the airline.Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines Group Inc., speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2025. Christian Monterrosa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTale of two Texas airlinesAmerican had an especially difficult 2025, which started with the collision of an Army Black Hawk helicopter into one of the carrier's regional jets that was arriving at Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, killing all 67 people on both flights. The airline and its rivals were also hit by the U.S. government shutdown late last year.\"We're off to a fast start based on the booking trends we've observed in January, all-time records for the first three weeks of the year,\" Isom told analysts on the Jan. 27 earnings call.But investors also want to the airline to prove its progress.American's stock is roughly flat this year. Its competitor, 20 miles away in Dallas, Southwest Airlines, is also trying to remake itself, and its stock is up more than 30% in 2026. Shares of United and Delta are up more than 3% and more than 8%, respectively, for the year.Southwest's forecast that it could quadruple earnings this year has had investors in a bullish frenzy. That carrier recently sealed the biggest transformation in its nearly 55 years of flying (to some travelers' chagrin): assigning seats for the first time, adding its first-ever bag fees, and rolling out basic economy tickets and other changes. Investors' confidence boosted Southwest's stock to a nearly four-year high last month after it reported results.All U.S. carriers are investing heavily in higher-end travel over standard coach, and even Southwest is considering opening its first airport lounge, its CEO told CNBC last year.American is likewise revamping its wide-body planes with larger, single business-class cabins, putting in a three-class cabin on new Airbus narrow-bodies and expanding its airport lounges. The airline has also refreshed its food and beverage options, including offering Lavazza coffee and Champagne Bollinger. For its 100th anniversary this spring, it's also adding caviar and beef Wellington for long-haul premium cabins.Isom has said he expects half of American's revenue to come from \"premium offerings\" toward the end of the decade. Fight over ChicagoSeveral planes wait in line to taxi down a runway after a winter snow storm affected the area at O'Hare International airport on Nov. 30, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois.Jim Vondruska | Getty ImagesOne major battle for American is at Chicago O'Hare International Airport, where United CEO Scott Kirby, whom American fired in 2016, has vowed to keep his old employer at bay.Both carriers are ramping up their schedules there next summer. Deutsche Bank estimated in a note Monday that United generates about $10 billion in revenue at O'Hare and that American generates more than $5 billion. Around the time American reported earnings, United posted a digital billboard in Chicago that read \"More on time, less canceled flights. Aadvantage, United,\" using the same spelling as American's AAdvantage loyalty program. Bankrupt Spirit Airlines is also seeking to transfer two gates at Chicago O'Hare to United for $30 million, which would give United more ground at the airport.But from Chicago to Charlotte, questions still remain for American.\"It's unclear if the current strategy will close the margin gap to its peers,\" Melius Research airline analyst Conor Cunningham said about American. \"It will take a lot of time to execute. You can't just turn premium revenue on.\"Cunningham added, \"It took Delta over a decade to cultivate a premium image,\" pointing to the U.S. profit leaders' transformation.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing outsold Airbus last year for first time since 2018, deliveries rise to 600Allegiant to buy rival budget airline Sun Country in $1.5 billion cash and stock dealWhy airline class wars will intensify in 2026American Airlines no longer lets basic economy flyers earn miles",

    "body": "watch nowAmazon shares sunk more than 5% on Friday after the company's hefty spending forecast surprised investors who were already wary that the artificial intelligence boom is at risk of becoming a bubble. The e-commerce company on Thursday was the latest tech giant to announce plans for a massive increase in capital expenditures, after Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta all signaled they expect their spending sprees to continue. Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta reported about $120 billion in capital expenditures in the fourth quarter alone. That figure could exceed more than $660 billion this year, the Financial Times reported, which is higher than the gross domestic product of countries like the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Israel.Wall Street has responded differently to the companies' spending plans, cheering Meta and Alphabet's forecasts, while punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Google and Oracle collectively lost more than $1 trillion from their valuations over the past week, according to FactSet data. Amazon shed just over $300 billion from its market cap, the most out of the group. Shares of companies developing hardware for the AI build-out will likely face continued volatility as \"sentiment contagion takes hold,\" Paul Markham, investment director at GAM Investments, told CNBC.\"Questions over the extent of capex as a result of LLM build-outs, the eventual return on that, and the fear of eventual over-expansion of capacity will be persistent,\" he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconAmazon shares over the past month'Investors questioning every angle in AI race'Amazon announced in its fourth-quarter earnings report that its capital expenditures are expected to reach $200 billion in 2026, which was more than $50 billion above analysts' expectations. While management is confident of long-term returns on investment, the lack of visibility is not sitting well with investors, Mamta Valechha, consumer discretionary analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said Friday morning.\"We have suddenly gone from the fear that you cannot be last, to investors questioning every single angle in this AI race.\"Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded Amazon's stock on Friday to neutral from a buy rating over concerns around its spending plans, risks to its cloud dominance and the potential for AI to erode its retail business. \"With the context of results from Microsoft and Google, we see AWS continuing to lose its lead and now scrambling to catch up through escalating investment,\" the analysts wrote in a research note. \"We are also increasingly concerned about Amazon retail's transition to a new chat-driven internet dominated by Gemini and ChatGPT.\"Apple, on the other hand, which has faced pressure from Wall Street over its AI strategy and has previously committed far less on capex than other Big Tech firms, has seen its stock jump 7% since Monday on the back of what CEO Tim Cook described as \"staggering\" demand for the iPhone. \"The bet is becoming binary,\" Michael Field, chief equity strategist at Morningstar, told CNBC, referring to the huge investments in so-called Magnificent Seven companies. \"Either a big pay off if these investments come good, or a huge waste of shareholder's cash if it goes wrong.\"— CNBC's Annie Palmer and Elsa Ohlen also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowThe tech industry's surging capital expenditures for AI infrastructure are justified, appropriate and sustainable, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\"\"The reason for that is because all of these companies' cash flows are going to start rising,\" Huang said. Nvidia shares closed up nearly 8% on Friday. Huang's comments come after key Nvidia customers Meta, Amazon, Google and Microsoft reported their latest earnings over the past two weeks. These companies told their investors that they plan to dramatically increase spending on AI infrastructure. In total, these hyperscalers could spend $660 billion on capital expenditures this year, with much of that spending going toward buying Nvidia's chips. Wall Street had a mixed response to the surging spending, sending Meta's and Alphabet's stocks up, but punishing Amazon and Microsoft. Huang said that the \"largest infrastructure buildout in human history\" is being driven by \"sky high\" demand for computing power, which AI companies and hyperscalers can use to make more money. He cited specific examples of what Nvidia customers are doing with AI. Meta is using AI to move from a recommendation system that ran on CPUs to a system that uses generative AI and agents, Huang said. He said Amazon Web Services' usage of Nvidia chips and AI will affect how the retail giant recommends products, and that Microsoft will use Nvidia-powered AI to improve its enterprise software. He also praised OpenAI and Anthropic, the two leading artificial intelligence labs, which both use Nvidia chips through cloud providers. Nvidia invested $10 billion in Anthropic last year, and Huang said earlier this week that the chipmaker will invest heavily in OpenAI's next fundraising round. \"Anthropic is making great money. Open AI is making great money,\" Huang said. \"If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues would go up four times as much.\"He said that all the graphics processing units that Nvidia has sold in the past — even six-year old chips such as the A100 — are currently being rented, reflecting sustained demand for AI computing power. \"To the extent that people continue to pay for the AI and the AI companies are able to generate a profit from that, they're going to keep on doubling, doubling, doubling, doubling,\" Huang said.

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's journey to becoming the world's first trillionaire will likely be powered by rockets rather than cars, as SpaceX now accounts for nearly two-thirds of the Tesla CEO's wealth.Musk became the first person ever to top the $800 billion mark this week, with his net worth now around $845 billion, according to Forbes. He's worth more than the next three richest people – Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg – combined.The tech magnate's unprecedented wealth surged after his aerospace and defense company, SpaceX, acquired his artificial intelligence and social media company, xAI, this week in a deal that valued the merged entity at $1.25 trillion, according to financial documents reviewed by CNBC. With Musk's ownership estimated at around 43% in the combined company, his stake would be valued at over $530 billion, marking a rapid shift in his fortunes. Musk's priorities are also likely shifting his focus more to SpaceX than Tesla, a reality that the EV company acknowledged in its latest proxy filing, where it noted that \"a majority of Mr. Musk's wealth is now derived from other business ventures.\"Last year, Musk confirmed he wants to take SpaceX public in 2026, which would make Tesla a less prevalent component of his liquid wealth. But he still has to get buy-in from public market investors, who may be reluctant to pay up for a company that combines a defense contractor and satellite business with a cash-burning AI model developer that's trying to take on Google, OpenAI and Anthropic. SpaceX has received more than $20 billion from contracts with the federal government, according to research from FedScout, with more lucrative contracts on the way, and Musk has framed the acquisition as the next step towards \"orbital data centers.\"\"You've muddied up your story a little bit as a pure-play SpaceX shareholder, but the opportunity has gotten a lot bigger,\" said Greg Martin, managing director at Rainmaker Securities, which works on transactions for pre-IPO companies. \"It makes sense for them to access a much larger capital market, especially with xAI, which does have insatiable need for capital.\" XAI is currently being investigated by authorities in Europe, Asia, Australia and California, after the company's Grok image generator let users create and share \"deepfake\" explicit images of children and women.It's not clear whether Musk's merger will require any regulatory review. Democratic senators this week called for the Pentagon to investigate SpaceX over undisclosed Chinese investors in the company.watch nowMusk still has a major incentive to stay focused on Tesla. Late last year, shareholders voted to approve a new pay package that could be worth $1 trillion, paid out in 12 tranches, if Tesla hits certain milestones, including market cap gains and operational achievements, over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market cap of $2 trillion, about $460 billion more than the current valuation.Tesla said in the proxy filing detailing the plan that the structure aims to \"prevent him from prioritizing those other ventures.\"However, Columbia Law professor Dorothy Lund, a corporate and securities law expert, told CNBC in an email that the strategy may not work. Musk is now \"negotiating comp packages at each company, with each board trying to induce him to pay attention via comp,\" Lund wrote. \"If SpaceX/xAI gives him more money and a bigger share, that Tesla package may look less appealing.\" Before the xAI acquisition, Musk owned about 42% of SpaceX and controlled 80% of the votes, according to FCC reports. His current ownership in Tesla is between 11% and 15% of shares outstanding, depending on what's included in his stake, according to public filings.With Tesla's brand value and core auto sales in decline, and its long-promised robotaxis and humanoid robots still in development, the company's stock price is down about 9% this year.Based on Musk's ownership in SpaceX, and assuming Tesla shares are flat, the rocket and AI company would have to reach a valuation of about $1.6 trillion for the world's richest person to reach trillionaire status.Ross Gerber, CEO of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki, is betting that Musk won't ever want to take SpaceX public as a standalone entity. Rather, he expects to see a merger of SpaceX and Tesla, and he speculated this week it would list on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol X, which formerly belonged to U.S. Steel. Gerber is a long-time Tesla investor and now holds shares in SpaceX after his firm previously backed Musk's leveraged buyout of Twitter in 2022. Musk rebranded Twitter as X, and merged the social network with xAI last year. Consolidating his empire makes sense, Gerber said, because it would allow Musk to fulfill his dream of running one big company under the brand name X. Following Alphabet's announcement this week that it will spend up to $185 billion on capex this year, Gerber said Musk is going to have to be able to bring in massive sums of cash. \"This huge entity would make it easier for them to raise money and borrow,\" he said. \"How else is Musk supposed to compete and become a major AI player?\"Musk didn't respond to a request for comment.

    "body": "The cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people has declined for the third straight year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.The \"classic\" meal — a 16-pound turkey and sides like stuffing, rolls, sweet potatoes, peas, cranberries and pumpkin pie ingredients — costs an average of $55.18 nationwide, new data from AFBF finds. The estimates come from the farm advocacy group's annual price survey, conducted in the first week of November and based on volunteer shoppers in all 50 states checking grocery store prices for the same Thanksgiving staples each year.The biggest cost is the turkey at an average of $21.50. Other items include 30-ounce pumpkin pie mix at an average cost of $4.16, three pounds of sweet potatoes at $4, one gallon of whole milk at $3.73 and 14 ounces of stuffing mix at $3.71, according to the data.Prices also vary by region, with the classic meal averaging a high of $61.75 in the West and a low of $50.01 in the South.The cost of the classic dinner is down 5% from 2024 and well below the record high of $64.05 reached in 2022. But it's still higher than its 2020 level, when the same meal averaged $46.90. However, with inflation factored in, 2025's price is roughly in line with what the 2020 dinner would cost today.Here's a look at the average price for the last 10 years, according to AFBF's annual survey. Figures are not adjusted for inflation.2015: $50.112016: $49.872017: $49.122018: $48.902019: $48.912020: $46.902021: $53.312022: $64.052023: $61.17 2024: $58.08 Retailers may help keep turkey prices downAt an average price of $21.50, turkey makes up nearly half the cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner, according to AFBF data. But even though wholesale turkey prices are up about 75% from last year due to avian flu and higher production costs, shoppers aren't necessarily seeing that increase at the register, according to researchers at Purdue University.That's because grocers often mark down whole frozen turkeys in November, treating the bird as a \"loss leader\" to draw customers into stores for other, higher-margin items, reports industry trade publication Grocery Dive.And those discounts can be steep. Purdue's analysis shows retailers are selling birds well below typical seasonal prices. Walmart, for example, is offering whole turkeys for $0.98 per pound, less than half of Purdue's estimated average retail price for November.Prices for sides are more mixed. Wheat-based items like dinner rolls and stuffing are cheaper, on average, in 2025, while fresh vegetables and sweet potatoes rose sharply due to weather issues and regional supply disruptions, according to AFBF.Earn more and get ahead with CNBC's online courses.

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a news conference following a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2025.Al Drago | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOdds of a December rate cut remained low following the release of delayed jobs data. Markets were last pricing about a 35% chance of a quarter-point cut from the Federal Reserve next month, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That is higher than the 30% likelihood priced in during the prior session, but remains weak. The tool used fed funds futures trading to calculate the odds.The target rate is currently at 3.75% to 4.00%.   Those expectations held steady after the release of the September jobs data, the first nonfarm payrolls report investors have seen since the government shutdown. The  report gave an uneven picture of the U.S. labor market. The U.S. economy added 119,000 jobs in September, a headline number that blew away expectations for 50,000 jobs added, according to economists polled by Dow Jones. However, the unemployment rate showed unexpected weakness, rising to 4.4% from 4.3%. The new level is the highest level it's been since October 2021. \"All those numbers suggest an economy that's still hanging in there. Not a dramatic move one way or the other,\" Former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Roger Ferguson told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"People should take note of the slight uptick in the unemployment rate, but labor force participation still looks pretty strong, average hourly earnings certainly looks strong, or strong enough. And so, I don't think this sort of tilts the cut decision much one way or the other.\" To be sure, some investors are hopeful that weakness in the unemployment rate means a December rate cut remains on the table. The level is closely watched by Fed policymakers, more so than the headline number, and is additionally troubling given that a shrinking labor pool, given the rise in immigration crackdowns, theoretically would keep the job market tight. \"A December cut remains possible given continued labor market softness as expressed by the unemployment rate,\" wrote Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"Weak hard data and close-to-target inflation look set to drive policy going forward, despite recent hawkish noises.\" \"The setup is in place for Powell to continue his risk-management approach to the labor market before his term as Chair expires in May,\" Haigh continued.

    "body": "Customers check out vegetables and other groceries at a supermarket in Tokyo on June 20, 2025.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's core inflation in October rose at its sharpest rate since July, in line with market estimates on Friday, supporting the case for interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan.Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, came in at 3% as expected by economists polled by Reuters. The headline inflation rate rose to 3%, staying above the BOJ's 2% target for 43 straight months.  The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate, which strips out prices of fresh food and energy, crept up to at 3.1%, compared to 3% in September. Rice inflation continued to ease for a fifth month in a row, dipping to 40.2% from 49.2% in the previous month. Japan's Nikkei 225 was 1.58% lower, while the yen strengthened 0.1% to trade at 157.5 against the dollar as senior Japanese officials voiced concerns on yen moves.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda told the country's parliament on Friday that the central bank should be mindful that a weak yen could affect underlying inflation by pushing up import costs and broader prices.Signaling urgency over yen weakness, Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama reportedly hinted at a possible intervention in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.According to LSEG data, the dollar has appreciated 2.19% against the yen over the course of November so far, while over the last six months, it has gained 9.52%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconUeda also had his first bilateral meeting with newly elected Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi earlier this week.During the meeting, Ueda told Takaichi the central bank was \"gradually raising interest rates to guide inflation smoothly towards its 2% target and ensure the economy achieves sustainable growth,\" Reuters reported. Takaichi has been an advocate of a loose monetary policy, and earlier this month told the country's parliament that she hoped that the BOJ \"conducts policy appropriately\" so that the 2% inflation target is achieved by wage gains instead of cost-push factors.\"The type of inflation we're seeing now is not good,\" Takaichi reportedly said. The BOJ governor also said that Takaichi did not make any request related to monetary policy.The central bank is currently caught between a rock and a hard place, with inflation running above target and GDP growth figures weakening as Japan takes a hit from U.S. tariffs.Japan's GDP in the three months to September contracted for the first time in six quarters, falling 0.4% sequentially, and dipping 1.8% on an annualized basis.",

    "body": "Sale signs inside the Bath and Body Works store in Edmonton. On Thursday, January 6, 2022, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Artur Widak | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesBath & Body Works Inc. stock plunged Thursday after the company reported \"disappointing\" third-quarter earnings and slashed its full-year outlook, citing \"macro consumer pressures.\"Shares sank nearly 25% on Thursday and hit a new 52-week low. The stock has plunged more than 50% this year.CEO Daniel Heaf announced a turnaround plan for the company, with expectations of $250 million in cost savings by 2027, aimed at attracting younger consumers and recentering the company's focus to its core products.\"Our third quarter results were below expectations, and we are lowering our outlook for the remainder of the year reflecting current business trends and continuation of recent macro consumer pressures,\" Heaf said in a statement. \"While this is disappointing, we are acting swiftly and decisively to position the business for sustainable, long-term growth.\"Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with Wall Street's estimates, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 35 cents adjusted vs. 39 cents expectedRevenue: $1.59 billion vs. $1.63 billion expectedBath & Body reported net income of $77 million, or 37 cents per share, for the quarter ended Nov. 1 compared with $106 million, or 49 cents a share, last year. Adjusting for one-time items including pretax gains, the company reported earnings of 35 cents a share.The company also slashed its yearly guidance due to \"current business trends.\" It also expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down in the high single digits compared with Wall Street estimates of an increase of 1.5%. The guidance, pulling on \"recent negative macro consumer sentiment\" and tariff impacts, also revised net sales guidance for the full year to low single digits.Heaf said the company is reorienting its strategy to focus once again on core products like body care, fragrances and soaps. The plan, called the \"Consumer First Formula,\" includes four strategic priorities: creating disruptive and innovative products, reigniting the brand, winning in the marketplace and operating with speed and efficiency.The company had previously toyed with introducing other products like laundry detergent and shampoo, but Heaf said on a call with analysts Thursday that its efforts have not delivered promising results or attracted younger consumers.Heaf said the company will be exiting certain categories like haircare and men's grooming as it refocuses its priorities.\"Over the years, consumers have evolved. They seek greater efficacy, ingredient-led products, modern packaging, emotive storytelling and elevated multi-channel experiences,\" Heaf said. \"Our competitors have risen to meet those needs. We have not.\"Heaf said on the call that the company is also recruiting influencers to \"ignite social buzz\" around the company's products in an attempt to garner attention from new consumers. Bath & Body Works also plans to revamp its app and website to increase engagement and aid in product discovery. The company will also lower its free shipping threshold in early 2026.",

    "body": "Shipping container loads dock at Tokyo Bay.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesJapan's exports in October massively beat expectations, government data on Friday showed, as shipments to Europe and Asia saw robust growth. Exports rose 3.6% year on year compared with Reuters-polled economists' estimates of a 1.1% growth. But it was lower than the 4.2% gain seen in September. Shipments to Asia and Western Europe climbed 4.2% and 8.8% year on year, respectively, helping offset the 2.7% decline in exports to North America as goods shipped to the U.S. fell 3.1%.Automobile shipments, the largest Japanese exports to the U.S. by value, fell 7.5% from a year earlier, but it was much softer drop than the 24.2% decline seen in the prior month. Norihiro Yamaguchi, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said that October data \"paints a mixed picture of current export momentum.\"Yamaguchi noted that while capital goods exports remained sluggish due to subdued machinery investment momentum globally, the worst time for auto exports seems to be behind, and semiconductor exports have improved. Overall, Japan's auto exports rose 0.4% in October, while semiconductor shipments climbed 15.8% year on year.\"While we continue to believe that the lagged impact of higher global tariffs will drag on exports in the near term, recent upgrades to our global outlook point to a more modest adjustment than we had previously expected,\" Yamaguchi said.Diplomatic frictionThe data comes at a time when Japan is locked in a diplomatic spat with its largest trading partner, China, over Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's comments related to Taiwan. The impact on trade from this spat could show up in next month's data. The Asia Group said in a note on Wednesday that mainland China had suspended imports of seafood from Japan. It also pointed to Chinese social media showing some Japanese brand stores in Shanghai and Beijing \"voluntarily\" closing for several days citing \"reasons that everyone know.\"Meanwhile, imports to the world's fourth largest economy unexpectedly rose 0.7%, defying expectations of a 0.7% fall from the Reuters poll. Stronger-than-expected exports data would come as a welcome relief for Japan's economy that struggled in the third quarter. The country's GDP contracted 0.4% quarter on quarter, with net exports dragging the quarterly figure down by 0.2 percentage point. Japan also released its consumer inflation data on Friday, with headline inflation now running above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 43 months in a row. The Nikkei 225 was 2.38% down after the data release, while the Japanese yen rose marginally to trade at 157.39 against the dollar. Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama signaled the possibility of intervening in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.According to LSEG data, the dollar has appreciated 2.19% against the yen over the course of November so far, while over the last six months, it has gained 9.52%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMitul Kotecha, head of FX & EM macro strategy for Asia at Barclays, however, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" that intervention does not seem to be imminent. \"The problem that the Japanese officials face is that we're still in a broadly positive dollar environment. And as we know, intervention does not work as well when you have the broader market move going against you. It works much better when the move is going with you,\" Kotecha said. He did not entirely disregard chances of an intervention though: \"There's going to be focus on volatility that's going to be important. We hear that from Japanese officials. So may not just be levels, it could also be the pace of the move that could trigger intervention.\"",

The Japanese tech conglomerate recently offloaded its Nvidia shares but still controls British semiconductor company Arm, which supplies Nvidia with chip architecture and designs.SoftBank is also involved in a number of AI ventures that use Nvidia's technology, including the $500 billion Stargate project for data centers in the U.S.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSouth Korea's SK Hynix fell nearly 10%. The memory chip maker is Nvidia's top supplier of high-bandwidth memory used in AI applications. Samsung Electronics, a rival that also supplies Nvidia with memory, fell over 5%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker and manufacturer of Nvidia's chip designs, was down over 4% in Taipei. Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn, which manufactures server racks designed for AI workloads, dipped 4.86%.The retreat in major Asian semiconductor giants comes after Nvidia fell over 3% in the U.S. on Thursday, despite beating Wall Street expectations in its third-quarter earnings the night before. The company also provided stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales guidance, which analysts said could lift earnings expectations across the sector. Billy Toh, regional head of retail research at CGS International Securities Singapore, said Nvidia was a victim of a combination of a Bitcoin selloff, the possibility of a delayed Fed rate cut and generally tighter financial conditions.\"Add in the ongoing talk of an AI bubble, which triggers a broader risk-off rotation, and naturally Nvidia becomes one of the first pressure points,\" he told CNBC. Smaller chip players in Asia were not spared either. In Tokyo, Renesas Electronics, a key Nvidia supplier, fell 3%. Tokyo Electron, which provides essential chipmaking equipment to foundries that manufacture Nvidia's chips, was down 6.6%. Another Japanese chip equipment maker, Lasertec, was down 5.2%.",

(Photo by Kazuhiro NOGI / AFP) (Photo by KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP via Getty Images)          Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's cabinet approved a stimulus package totaling 21.3 trillion yen ($135.5 billion) on Friday, as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi seeks to boost the country's slowing economy and offer support to inflation-hit consumers. Public broadcaster NHK reported that the package was based on three pillars: addressing rising prices, achieving a strong economy, and strengthening defense and diplomatic capabilities, according to a Google translation. This stimulus package is the largest since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to local media. The cabinet also said it would expand local government grants, as well as provide subsidies for electricity and gas bills. The support measures will kick in January, amounting to about 7,000 yen for a standard household over a three-month period, according to the NHK report. Taxes on gasoline will be eliminated. Japan also plans to establish a 10-year fund to enhance its shipbuilding capabilities, and enact measures to raise defense spending to 2% of its gross domestic product by fiscal year 2027.The government said it will \"swiftly compile\" a supplementary budget bill to fund these measures, and plans to pass it by year-end with help from opposition parties. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party currently is a minority government, but is now allied with the Japan Innovation Party. Together they hold 231 seats, two short of a majority in Japan's 465-seat Lower House. Takaichi told reporters that the government will use its revenue to fund the package, and any shortfall would be covered via issuing government bonds.She said that the amount of government bonds would likely be lower than last year's 42.1 trillion yen issued after the supplementary budget, emphasizing that full consideration had been given to fiscal sustainability.Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group, told CNBC that Takaichi's move will spook Japanese government bond markets.Japanese bonds have been seeing a sell-off, with yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs hitting its highest since 2008 on Thursday, at 1.817%. It was down 3 basis points at 1.785% on Friday.   Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKoll said while Takaichi had delivered on her election promise with a larger-than-expected budget, the focus seems to be on short-term and one-off populism, rather than on incentives for positive structural change.Economic worriesThe stimulus package from Takaichi's government comes as Japan has seen inflation consistently run above the central bank's target, with statements from senior officials on price growth stoking fresh worries.  \"Income and price-support measures offer a one-off short term boost to the purchasing power of the people, but will do nothing to solve the fundamental inflation pressures,\" Koll said, adding that to overcome inflation, the economy needs supply-side reform, not demand-side stimulus.  The headline inflation figure for October rose to 3% from 2.9%, staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 43 straight months, while core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, came in at 3%.BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda told the country's parliament on Friday that the central bank should be mindful that a weak yen could affect underlying inflation by pushing up import costs and broader prices.Japan's Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama also warned of yen volatility and reportedly hinted at a possible intervention in the market, saying that she was \"alarmed by recent one-sided, sharp moves in the currency market,\" Reuters reported.Inflation worries have been compounded by Japan's weakening economic growth, with GDP in the three months to September contracting for the first time in six quarters. The economy shrank 0.4% compared with the prior quarter, while it contracted 1.8% on an annualized basis, government data released Monday showed.October trade data, released Friday, however, offered some welcome relief to the country, with exports rising 3.6% year on year and beating expectations as shipments to Asia and Europe offset declines in goods sent to the U.S.",

    "body": "Oil drilling rigs and support equipment stand on the tundra in Deadhorse, Alaska, on Friday, Sept. 5, 2025. Nathaniel Wilder | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration unveiled plans Thursday for a huge oil drilling expansion off the coasts of Alaska, California and in the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of Interior proposed 34 lease sales to drill in those waters through 2031, a big expansion compared to the Biden administration program that allowed just three lease sales and only in the Gulf. The Trump program would include lease sales in 21 areas off Alaska's coast, six off the Pacific coast and seven in the Gulf of Mexico. It would mark the first time since 1984 that Interior has allowed a new lease in the Pacific, according to the Congressional Research Service.  Interior's proposal is not a final program. It still must undergo further review. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum accused the Biden administration \"crippling the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production\" by slamming the brakes on oil and gas leasing. More than 100 Democratic lawmakers expressed their opposition to the plan in an Oct. 30 letter addressed to President Donald Trump and Burgum. \"Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines,\" the lawmakers wrote. The Natural Resources Defense Council condemned the Trump plan as egregious and reckless in a post Thursday. \"The proposal would open up untouched waters of Alaska to drilling, attempt to resurrect the offshore oil and gas industry in California, and offer up waters off the coast of Florida that haven't been put up for leasing in decades — in addition to adding even more leasing in the Gulf of Mexico,\" the NRDC said. \"This plan would damage these places, and the people who rely on them, for generations,\" the environmental group said.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump delivers remarks on artificial intelligence at the \"Winning the AI Race\" Summit in Washington D.C., U.S., July 23, 2025. Kent Nishimura | ReutersAn executive order that could soon be signed by President Donald Trump would thwart states' artificial intelligence laws by launching legal challenges and withholding federal funding, according to a draft of the order obtained by CNBC on Wednesday.The draft surfaced shortly after Trump publicly called for a single federal standard on AI \"instead of a patchwork of 50 State Regulatory Regimes.\"The draft order would give Attorney General Pam Bondi 30 days to establish an \"AI Litigation Task Force\" whose sole task is to challenge state AI laws.Those challenges would be issued \"on grounds that such laws unconstitutionally regulate interstate commerce, are preempted by existing Federal regulations, or are otherwise unlawful in the Attorney General's judgment,\" the draft says.The order also directs Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to notify states with contested AI laws that they are ineligible for funds under the federal Broadband Equity Access and Deployment program. BEAD is a more than $42 billion program that has allocated funding to all U.S. states and territories.The order, which was first reported by The Information, is not yet finalized. A White House official told CNBC that any discussion around it is just speculation until it is officially announced.As written, the EO would be a major win for the burgeoning AI industry, whose leaders — including Sam Altman's OpenAI, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz and other Silicon Valley titans — oppose an inconsistent state-by-state policy approach.It would be just as big a blow to state lawmakers across the country who have sought to pass bills that would place guardrails on the nascent technology.New York State Assemblymember Alex Bores, who co-sponsored a state AI safety bill, in a statement to CNBC called the draft EO \"a blank check to Donald Trump's tech billionaire backers who've already made a fortune on — and now stand to profit exponentially more from — allowing unconstrained AI to wipe out jobs, destroy our kids' brains, and drive electricity bills through the roof.\"Bores, a Democrat who is running for Congress, this week became the first target of a well-funded super PAC backed by AI industry leaders.GOP mulls AI moratorium The White House is also working with a group of Republican lawmakers to see if a moratorium on certain state AI laws could be included in one of the major must-pass bills that Congress is working on. That language is still being drafted, but it would likely block states' abilities to regulate on issues like how AI is developed, according to four sources familiar with the discussions. States would likely still be able to craft policy on other AI-related matters such as fraud, consumer protections and images depicting the sexual abuse of children, the sources said.A proposed 10-year ban on states regulating AI was initially included in Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill,\" but cut out before Trump signed it in July.The current draft proposal could have no expiration date, including to one source familiar with the discussions. \"You're seeing China move very aggressively,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"AI is the wave of the future, but we want America to be dominant in it and we want our policies to reflect that.\"There is bipartisan support for new federal AI policy — even from those supporting state-level action.\"Let's be clear: we need a federal solution. But we need one that's crafted by experts and doesn't sell you out to the highest bidder. Until then, states must act,\" Bores said in an X post Thursday.But there is also bipartisan opposition to boxing out the states.\"There should not be a moratorium on states rights for AI,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, R-Ga., wrote on X. \"States must retain the right to regulate and make laws on AI and anything else for the benefit of their state.\"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also shot down the idea of a state-level AI moratorium. \"That provision doesn't appear to have a lot of support amongst Democrats and Republicans in the Congress,\" he told CNBC in a brief hallway interview. \"So I don't know why Donald Trump is bringing it back up at this time.\"Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday morning that he is open to a single national pre-emption.  but it would be a mistake to block states for acting until one is ready. \"If we take away the pressure from the states, Congress will never act,\" Warner said. \"Let's look at the fact we never did anything on social media. If we make that same response on AI and don't put guardrails, I think we'll come [to] rue it.\"— CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. economy added substantially more jobs than expected in September, according to a long-awaited report Thursday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 119,000 in the month, up from the 4,000 jobs lost in August following a downward revision. The Dow Jones consensus estimate for September was 50,000. The July total also was revised down to 72,000, a decrease of 7,000 from the prior release.In addition to the headline jobs number, the BLS said the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.4%, the highest it's been since October 2021. A broader measure that includes those not looking for jobs or working part-time for economic reasons edged lower to 8%.Average hourly earnings increased 0.2% for the month and 3.8% from a year ago, compared to respective forecasts for 0.3% and 3.7%.The report ends a data drought on the labor market that began in early September and continued through the record 44-day government shutdown. Agencies including the BLS, the Bureau of Economic Analysis and others were prohibited from collecting or releasing data during the period.This was the first BLS jobs report since the count for August that was released Sept. 5. It also was the second since Trump fired then-BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1, following a July jobs report that contained massive revisions for prior months.\"September's jobs report shows the labor market still had resilience before the shutdown, beating payroll expectations, but the picture remains muddy with August jobs revised to a job loss and the unemployment rate increasing,\" said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at jobs site Glassdoor. \"These numbers are a snapshot from two months ago and they don't reflect where we stand now in November.\"A 'Now Hiring' sign sits outside the entrance to a Burlington department store on Nov. 19, 2025 in Miami, Florida.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesStock market futures nevertheless added to gains following the report while Treasury yields were mostly lower. Traders also continued to bet that the Federal Reserve will not lower rates further at its Dec. 9-10 meeting. This is the last jobs report Fed policymakers will get before then. Hawkish talk out of the October Fed meeting, as reflected in minutes released Wednesday, contributed to a general feeling that the central bank will be on hold into the end of the year.\"Despite the fact that today's jobs report is very backward looking, it's making markets move,\" said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. \"Equities like the fact that payrolls were stronger than expected, suggesting the economy is still on a firm footing, while the bond market likes the rise in unemployment and slowdown in wage growth which may keep the case for a December Fed cut just about alive.\"Overall, the report shows the labor market entered the autumn months on much the same footing it has been all year – a slow but steady pace, with firms reluctant both to hire many new workers or lay off existing workforce during a time of unusual economic volatility spurred by aggressive policy actions in President Donald Trump's White House.A separate Labor Department release Thursday showed that initial jobless claims totaled 220,000 for the week ending Nov. 15, down 8,000 from the prior period and lower than the consensus forecast for 227,000.Job gains in September came from familiar sources, with health care leading at 43,000, about right on target with its pace over the past year. Bars and restaurants contributed 37,000 while social assistance added 14,000. On the downside, transportation and warehousing lost 25,000 and federal government, which had been a large contributor to employment growth, was off 3,000, part of a loss of 97,000 on the calendar year. Professional and business services also reported a decline of 20,000, fueled by a drop of 16,000 in temporary help. The household survey, used to calculate the unemployment rate, painted an even brighter picture of the labor market.The total level of those employed rose by 251,000 while the labor force increased by 470,000 to a fresh record of 171.2 million. The participation rate, which measures the share of the working-age population either working or seeking employment, edged higher to 62.4, the highest since May.The rolls of full-time employment swelled by 673,000 while part-times fell by 573,000.The lack of comprehensive indicators has presented a challenge for Fed officials, who cut their benchmark interest rate in both September and October but face a tougher decision in December. Officials at the October meeting noted the difficulty in navigating policy without the usual array of economic metrics to rely on, and there was a significant inclination to forgo a December cut, according to meeting minutes released Wednesday.With September's payrolls count released, the BLS is preparing the first influx of other data in coming months. The bureau on Wednesday announced it will release jobs data for October and November simultaneously on Dec. 16. October's numbers will not include the customary unemployment rate calculation as that comes from a survey of households that will not be able to be completed because of the shutdown.",

John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesApparel retailer Gap said Thursday its comparable sales rose 5% during the fiscal third quarter, driven by strong revenue at its namesake brand after its viral \"Better in Denim\" campaign with girl group Katseye. Putting aside pandemic-related spikes, the rise in comparable sales is the strongest growth for Gap since its fiscal 2017 holiday quarter and is well ahead of Wall Street expectations of 3.1%, according to StreetAccount. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Richard Dickson said the company hasn't needed to discount as often to sell products, it's winning customers from all income cohorts and it's seeing a \"great start\" to the holiday shopping season. \"While external data points to macro pressure, particularly on the low-income consumer, our customers are finding our price value, [and] our styles are breaking through the competitive landscape,\" said Dickson. \"Our product is resonating. So we're very confident as we head into the holiday season.\" Shares of Gap rose 5% in extended trading Thursday. Here's how the largest specialty apparel company in the U.S. performed during the quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 62 cents vs. 59 cents expectedRevenue: $3.94 billion vs. $3.91 billion expectedThe company's net income during the three months ended Nov. 1 declined nearly 14% to $236 million, or 62 cents per share, compared with $274 million, or 72 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $3.94 billion, up 3% from $3.83 billion a year earlier. For Gap's fiscal year, which is slated to end around early February, the company is now guiding to the high end of its previously released sales forecast, expecting sales to rise between 1.7% and 2%, in line with analyst expectations. It previously expected sales to rise between 1% and 2%.The company is now expecting its full-year operating margin to be around 7.2%, compared to its previous range of between 6.7% and 7%. The forecast includes the impact of tariffs, estimated to be between 1 and 1.1 percentage points. Comparable sales across Gap, which owns its namesake banner, Old Navy, Athleta and Banana Republic, have been positive now for seven straight quarters. Under Dickson, the company has been as focused on boosting profitability and fixing operations as it has been on reigniting cultural relevance, which has led to sustained sales growth across the portfolio. Gap's profitability had been growing, too, as a result, but now that it's facing tariffs, the retailer's gross margin and net income are both taking a hit. During the quarter, Gap's gross margin fell 0.3 percentage points to 42.4% but still came in higher than expectations of 41.2%, according to StreetAccount. The 14% decline in Gap's net income was primarily related to tariffs, finance chief Katrina O'Connell said in an interview. Gap's better-than-expected results come as apparel sales remain generally soft across the industry and consumers pull back on nice-to-have items like new clothes in favor of necessities. Aside from clear value players like Walmart and TJX Companies, earnings so far this season have been muted, with some companies blaming macroeconomic conditions and expressing caution about the holiday season. Dickson said Gap's varied portfolio gives it a hedge in uncertain economic times because it can capture shoppers in a variety of different places. \"Our portfolio appeals to a wide range of consumers, which is giving us great flexibility in today's environment,\" said Dickson. Here's a closer look at how each of the company's brands performed: Gap Gap's namesake brand has been the focus of Dickson's turnaround strategy since he took the helm as CEO just over two years ago. During the quarter, comparable sales rose a staggering 7% – more than double the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Revenue rose 6% to $951 million. During the quarter, Gap released its viral \"Milkshake\" campaign, featuring the early-aughts Kelis song and members of the Katseye pop group. The campaign helped sales, but Dickson said Gap brand's growth is \"a story about consistency\" and a mix of better product, marketing and partnerships. Old Navy Sales at Old Navy, Gap's largest brand by revenue, rose 5% to $2.3 billion with comparable sales up 6%, far better than the 3.8% that analysts surveyed by StreetAccount expected. The company said it saw growth in key categories like denim, activewear, kids and baby. Banana Republic The elevated, work-friendly brand is still in turnaround mode but saw sales grow 1% to $464 million during the quarter with comparable sales up 4%, better than the 3.2% gain analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. This was the second quarter in a row Banana reported positive comparable sales, which the company attributed to better marketing and product. Athleta Both revenue and comparable sales at Athleta were down a whopping 11% to $257 million, an eyesore on Gap's otherwise better-than-expected results. Dickson has repeatedly said Athleta is in a reset year, but how long that reset will take remains unclear. \"We have been disappointed in the trend. We understand there's a lot of work to do, but I really do believe in the brand,\" said Dickson. \"I believe in the leadership and we will continue to build this brand for the long term. It does deserve it.\"",

    "body": "watch nowImprovement in mortgage rates at the end of the summer boosted home sales, but that gain may be short-lived.Sales of previously owned homes in October rose 1.2% from September to 4.1 million units on a seasonally adjusted, annualized basis, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were up 1.7% year over year. This count is based on home closings, so contracts likely signed in August and September. While contract signings would not be impacted by the government shutdown that started in October, closings, especially those requiring flood insurance or government-backed rural home loans, could be.During that contract-signing period, the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage came down for a bit but then moved up again. The popular 30-year rate started August at 6.63%, fell steadily to 6.13% by mid-September, and then came back up to 6.37% by the end of the month, according to Mortgage News Daily. It now stands at 6.36%.The inventory of homes for sale has also come down. After gaining for much of this year, supply fell to 1.52 million units, down 0.7% from September, although still nearly 11% higher than a year earlier. At the current sales pace, there is a 4.4-month supply, still considered lean.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.And that's why prices are still gaining. The median price of a home sold in October was $415,200, an increase of 2.1% from October 2024 and the 28th consecutive month of annual gains. \"Looking ahead, home shoppers in today's market face some advantages from falling mortgage rates and seasonally slower competition,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist at Realtor.com, in a release. \"At the same time, a lack of housing affordability continues to be a challenge keeping home sales in their historically low level.\"Homes are staying on the market longer, at an average of 34 days last month compared with 29 days last October. First-time buyers made a comeback in the market, representing 32% of sales, up from 27% a year ago — but not all regions are equal. \"First-time homebuyers are facing headwinds in the Northeast due to a lack of supply and in the West because of high home prices,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"First-time buyers fared better in the Midwest because of the plentiful supply of affordable houses and in the South because there is sufficient inventory.\"Sales growth continues to be strongest on the high end of the market. Homes priced above $1 million saw sales up more than 16% from a year ago, and those priced between $750,000 and $1 million saw a gain of 10%. Meanwhile sales of homes priced between $100,000 and $250,000 were up just about 1%, and homes priced below $100,000 saw a drop in sales of nearly 3%. ",

    "body": "An electric air taxi by Joby Aviation flies near the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 12, 2023.Roselle Chen | ReutersAir taxi maker Joby Aviation in a new lawsuit accused competitor Archer Aviation of using stolen information by a former employee to \"one-up\" a partnership deal with a real estate developer.\"This is corporate espionage, planned and premeditated,\" Joby said in the lawsuit filed Wednesday in a  California Superior Court in Santa Cruz, where the company is based.The lawsuit alleges that Joby's then-U.S. state and local policy lead, George Kivork, downloaded dozens of files and sent some content to his personal email two days before he resigned in July to take a job at Archer, which had recruited him. By August, Joby said a partner that worked with Kivork said it had been approached by Archer with a \"more lucrative deal.\" Joby alleges that the eVTOL rival's understanding of \"highly confidential\" details helped it leverage negotiations. Joby also said the developer attempted to terminate the agreement, citing a breach of confidentiality.Archer called the suit \"baseless litigation\" meant to slow its leading competitor in a statement to CNBC.\"Joby's case is entirely without merit,\" said Eric Lentell, Archer's chief legal & strategy officer. \"The complaint, regarding a non-technical employee who recently joined Archer in a business development role, does not identify a single specific trade secret let alone any evidence of misappropriation.\"Archer said it has rigorous employee onboarding procedures that are meant to prevent the kinds of actions Joby has accused it of.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia earnings takeaways: Bubble talk, 'half a trillion' forecast and China ordersNvidia says there's 'no assurance' of final agreement with OpenAI despite $100 billion pactMeta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to create his own startupBlock's stock pops 9% on gross profit forecast, 3-year financial outlookA hearing is scheduled for March 20, 2026. Joby said Kivork refused to return the files when approached by the company after an investigation, according to the suit. The company also claims Archer denied wrongdoing, and would not disclose how it learned about the terms of the agreement or provide results from an internal investigation it allegedly undertook.Prior to joining Joby, Kivork worked as senior public policy manager at Lyft. He also served as an attorney within the U.S. Commerce Department's Office of the General Counsel. In that role, Kivork worked on rules to \"protect U.S. manufacturers and exporters against unfair trade practices,\" according to his LinkedIn.The lawsuit comes during a busy period for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) technology as companies race to gain Federal Aviation Administration certification to start flying commercially. 'The sector has also benefitted from President Donald Trump's newly minted eVTOL pilot program.Joby argued in the complaint that it's \"imperative\" to protect Joby's work \"from this type of espionage\" to promote the sector's success and ensure fair competition.Last week, Joby said it completed its first test flight for a hybrid aircraft it's working on with defense contractor L3Harris. This month, Amazon-backed Beta Technologies, another electric flight company, also went public on the New York Stock Exchange.Joby shares have more than doubled over the last year, while Archer is up about 36%.In August 2023, Archer settled a previous legal dispute with Boeing-owned Wisk Aero over the alleged theft of trade secrets. As part of the deal, Archer agreed to use Wisk as its autonomous tech partner.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJoby and Archer year-to-date stock chart.",

    "body": "Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesGoogle on Thursday rolled out Nano Banana Pro, its latest image editing and generation tool, continuing the company's momentum after launching its new Gemini artificial intelligence model earlier this week.The product is built on Gemini 3 Pro, which was announced on Tuesday and contributed to record-breaking stock highs.Alphabet's stock was up 4% Thursday.Josh Woodward, vice president of Google Labs and Gemini, told CNBC's Deirdre Bosa that the Nano Banana Pro's capabilities expand beyond its original iteration, which launched in late August. \"It's incredible at infographics. It can make slide decks. It can take up to 14 different images, or five different characters, and sort of keep that character consistency,\" he said.He added that internal users have experimented with the feature by inputting code snippets and even LinkedIn resumes to create infographics.\"I think this ability to visualize things that were previously maybe not something you would think of as a visual medium that tends to be one of the magic things people are finding with it,\" Woodward said. The original Nano Banana went viral on social media as users turned photos of themselves or their pets into hyperrealistic 3D figurines. Woodward wrote in an X post in September that the product helped add 13 million new users to the Gemini app in the span of four days.Nano Banana Pro is currently available in the Gemini app, with limited free quotas, Google's writing assistant, NotebookLM, as well as the company's developer, enterprise and advertising products. Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers will have access to the product in Google's search features AI Mode.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia earnings takeaways: Bubble talk, 'half a trillion' forecast and China ordersNvidia says there's 'no assurance' of final agreement with OpenAI despite $100 billion pactMeta chief AI scientist Yann LeCun is leaving to create his own startupBlock's stock pops 9% on gross profit forecast, 3-year financial outlookThe feature will later also roll out to Ultra subscribers first in Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool.Google introduced another feature in the Gemini app that allows users to upload any image to find out if it was generated by Google AI. Images generated on free Nano Banana accounts will have a watermark, but it will be removed for Google AI Ultra tier subscribers.Google has been working to gain ground on OpenAI in the generative AI race, which ignited after the release of ChatGPT in 2022. Last week, OpenAI announced two updates to its GPT-5 model to make it \"warmer by default and more conversational\" as well as \" more efficient and easier to understand in everyday use,\" the company said. ChatGPT currently tops the list of free apps on Apple's App Store, with Gemini in the second spot.The Gemini app currently has over 650 million monthly active users per month, and Gemini-powered AI Overviews has 2 billion monthly users, Google said in a release. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in October that ChatGPT had reached 800 million weekly active users.Woodward said Google AI products have had growing demand, with many users signing up for Gemini's subscription plan to have \"higher limits with some of these advanced models.\"\"We're seeing high numbers of people coming to lots of these products,\" he said. \"That's really the best problem to have, is there's a lot of demand, and we're trying to figure out actually how to serve it.\"The company is looking to continue scaling its AI offerings, Woodward said, highlighting Flow, Google's AI filmmaking tool, and Genie, a \"world building\" model that is currently available as a limited research preview.watch now",

    "body": "A Venezuelan living in Colombia waves a Venezuelan flag and a U.S. flag at Plaza de Bolivar to celebrate after U.S. President Donald Trump said the U.S. has struck Venezuela and captured its President Nicolás Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores, in Bogota, Colombia, Jan. 3, 2026. Andres Galeano | ReutersVenezuela's stock market has not only shrugged off the capture of former President Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces, it has surged to a record high as investors bet that the battered economy could finally see a turnaround.The country's benchmark Indice Bursatil de Capitalizacion, or IBC, has gained more than 130% since the U.S. operation on Jan. 3. The rally reflects optimism that Venezuela's economy could stabilize after years of mismanagement, sanctions and defaults, with expectations growing that a reconfigured government may attract capital, revive oil output and normalize relations with the United States, analysts said.And investors are trying to get in on the action. U.S. ETF issuer Teucrium on Friday applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to create what would reportedly be the first exchange-traded fund focused on companies with exposure to Venezuela. \"In what is a fluid environment, we currently believe that Venezuela is more likely to experience regime continuity with behavioral realignment, rather than an outright democratic transition or system collapse,\" BMI said in a note. \"A pliant Venezuela would allow the U.S. to reinforce its regional hegemony, secure access to the oil sector on very favorable terms.\"\"Investors began to price in Maduro's removal from power as a precondition for sanctions relief and eventually a restructuring deal,\" said Anthony Simond, investment director at UK-based wealth and investments firm Aberdeen.Simond said demand is coming from a broad mix of investors, including mainstream emerging-market asset managers, as well as hedge funds and distressed-debt specialists seeking asymmetric upside. However, it is important to note that Venezuela's stock exchange is small, illiquid and not easily accessible to global investors, meaning price swings can be extreme, strategists said. Venezuela's IBC soared 1,644% in 2025.\"Because Venezuela's markets are thinly traded, even small shifts in expectations can cause large price moves,\" Alice Blue, an integrated brokerage of financial charting platform TradingView wrote in a note. \"The rally reflects hope and speculation, not confirmed outcomes.\"Investors have also rushed into the country's sovereign and state oil company bonds since Maduro was captured. Renewed interest in Venezuelan bonds is primarily driven by optimism around potential debt restructuring, a development investors see as a way to unlock value frozen since Venezuela's 2017 default, said Jeff Grills, head of U.S. cross markets and emerging markets debt at Aegon Asset Management. Grills cautioned though that much of the stock rally is headline-driven. \"At this stage, the rally appears to be largely tactical, rather than the start of a structural re-rating,\" he said, noting that leadership changes alone do not yet amount to a full regime transition. Venezuela's external liabilities, including arbitration claims and bilateral debts — estimated at $150 billion to $170 billion, according to Reuters — complicates any recovery timeline, said Eric Fine, a portfolio manager from VanEck.\"Everything depends on that not being derailed. [However] if that materializes, this is a complete re-rating situation,\" he said.",

    "body": "A visitor takes a picture of a model of SK hynix's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technology during the 2025 World IT Show in Seoul on April 24, 2025.Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korea-based memory maker SK Hynix announced Tuesday it will invest 19 trillion Korean won ($12.9 billion) to build a new advanced packaging plant, as it expands production to meet rising demands tied to artificial intelligence. The new facility will be located in the Korean city of Cheongju, building on the company's existing footprint there. Construction is set to begin in April, with completion targeted for the end of 2027, the firm said in a statement.The plant will focus on advanced packaging, which involves combining multiple memory chips into a single, high-density unit to improve performance and energy efficiency while reducing overall size.SK Hynix is among the world's largest producers of memory chips and leads in so-called high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which is used in artificial intelligence processors, including those designed by U.S. chipmaker Nvidia. The investment comes as SK Hynix seeks to meet growing demand for HBM as global AI competition intensifies, a trend that has pushed up prices and made it lucrative for memory giants.SK Hynix rival Samsung Electronics has also announced plans to ramp up HBM production in recent months.According to industry projections cited by SK Hynix, the HBM market is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 33% between 2025 and 2030.However, the process of producing HBM memory is much more demanding than that for memory used in most consumer electronics. As chipmakers shift to meet AI-driven demand, supplies of conventional memory have tightened, contributing to price hikes and raising concerns about higher costs across the broader electronics industry.TrendForce, a Taipei-based tech research firm, said last week that it expects average dynamic random access memory prices, including HBM, to rise by 50% to 55% this quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2025. Dynamic Random Access Memory, or DRAM, generally refers to the primary, volatile memory found in most computers for temporary data storage.While higher memory prices have created challenges for electronics manufacturers, they have boosted earnings for memory producers. Samsung said last week it expects operating profit for the December quarter to nearly triple from the same period last year. Meanwhile, SK Hynix is weighing a potential U.S. listing following a blockbuster 2025 for its shares in South Korea. The stock is up about 12% since the start of this year, though it fell roughly 2.5% in Tuesday trading.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump takes questions from reporters, as he attends a meeting with oil industry executives, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Jan. 9, 2026. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday said any country doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff \"on any and all business being done with the United States of America.\"That new tariff on imports from Iran's trading partners is \"effective immediately,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post.\"This Order is final and conclusive. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" he wrote.Further details about the tariff announcement were not immediately clear. A White House official declined to answer CNBC's questions about the president's social media post.The apparent effort by Trump to economically isolate Iran comes as the oil-rich Middle Eastern country struggles to suppress an ongoing swell of massive anti-government protests.Dozens of those protesters have reportedly been killed in recent weeks; Trump has threatened to take military action against Iran if the killings continue.The president has also explicitly encouraged the demonstrations against the Iranian regime. \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\" he wrote on social media on Saturday.The announcement of new tariffs on Iran's business partners also comes ahead of a much-anticipated Supreme Court ruling on whether many of Trump's most expansive tariffs are legal.Those tariffs — including his controversial \"reciprocal\" duties from early April and others related to purported fentanyl trafficking — were invoked using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. It was unclear if Trump's newly unveiled Iran-related tariffs also rest on that law. This is breaking news. Please refresh for updates.",

    "body": "Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke speaks after he was named among three U.S. economists awarded the 2022 Nobel Economics Prize, during a news conference at the Brookings Institution in Washington, October 10, 2022.Ken Cedeno | ReutersA chorus of previous Federal Reserve chairs, Treasury secretaries and prominent economists came together Monday to support Jerome Powell as the central bank leader faces potential perjury allegations from the Justice Department.\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" a statement backed by more than a dozen signatories said. \"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly,\" it continued. \"It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success.\"watch nowAmong the signers of the statement were former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen and Alan Greenspan among with former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson, Timothy Geithner, Robert Rubin and Jacob Lew. Economists such as Glenn Hubbard, Kenneth Rogoff and Jared Bernstein also signed on.Powell on Sunday confirmed that he'd been notified from the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., that he is the subject of a probe into statements he made to Congress last June. In testimony on Capitol Hill, Powell answered questions regarding the massive renovation project at the central bank's headquarters in the nation's capital.At the time, President Donald Trump and other officials used cost overruns to intensify their criticism of Powell. Trump threatened to fire the Fed chair but backed off. It's not clear that the president would have the authority to remove Powell, with an unrelated case against Fed Governor Lisa Cook set for a hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court next week that also addresses the president's power over the central bank.\"The Federal Reserve's independence and the public's perception of that independence are critical for economic performance, including achieving the goals Congress has set for the Federal Reserve of stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates,\" the statement said.Jonathan Kantner, former assistant U.S. attorney general, told CNBC on Monday that the bar for convicting someone in cases like these is \"very high\" particularly if there's a sense that the prosecution is politically motivated. Trump has been a longtime critic of Powell as he has pushed the Fed to lower interest rates. The central bank approved three reductions in 2025.In a statement Sunday, Powell alleged that the accusations are a pretext to remove him from office. If that is established, it would \"set into motion a whole bunch of other legal disputes,\" Kantner said. \"This could get quite messy.\"CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.Correction: Jonathan Kantner is a former assistant U.S. attorney general. An earlier version misspelled his name.",

    "body": "ReutersSen. Mark Kelly on Monday sued the Pentagon and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, alleging the Trump administration's efforts to punish the Arizona Democrat for his participation in a video to U.S. troops violate the Constitution.The federal civil lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington was filed one week after Hegseth said his department would cut Kelly's military retirement pay in response to the video.The government's actions \"trample on protections the Constitution singles out as essential to legislative independence,\" Kelly's lawyers wrote in the lawsuit, which was also filed against the U.S. Navy Department and its secretary, John Phelan.\"It appears that never in our nation's history has the Executive Branch imposed military sanctions on a Member of Congress for engaging in disfavored political speech,\" the lawyers wrote.The legal complaint alleges that the defendants violated Kelly's right to freedom of speech, as well as his protection under the Constitution's \"speech or debate clause,\" which prevents executive action against members of Congress for their legislative conduct. The suit also alleges infringements of Kelly's due process rights and the separation of powers, among other violations.A Pentagon official told CNBC in a statement that the department is aware of the lawsuit, but that its policy is not to comment on ongoing litigation.The video at the center of the fight featured Kelly and five other congressional Democrats delivering a message addressed to U.S. troops and members of the intelligence community.\"Our laws are clear: You can refuse illegal orders,\" Kelly said in the 90-second video, which was first posted on social media on Nov. 18.It was shared as the U.S. military carried out a succession of airstrikes in the Caribbean targeting boats purported to be smuggling drugs.Members of Congress, including some Republicans, had questioned the legality of those deadly strikes, which were made without congressional authorization. The attacks have continued, killing 123 people since early September, according to The New York Times.The other lawmakers in the video, who all served in the military or in U.S. intelligence, each made a similar statement about troops being allowed to refuse unlawful orders.But Kelly, a former U.S. Navy captain and NASA astronaut, is the only one who formally retired from service, and therefore remains subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.Days later, Hegseth slammed the video as \"despicable, reckless, and false,\" while labeling its participants the \"Seditious Six.\" Read more CNBC politics coverageSen.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump will face an important obstacle — from within his own party — as he seeks to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said Sunday he will block any Trump appointees to the central bank, including for the new chair, in light of revelations over the weekend that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential perjury charges.\"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,\" Tillis said in a statement.\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" he added.That position substantially complicates the road to replacing Powell, whose term as chair expires in May. The banking committee, of which Tillis is a member, has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so even one defection sets up a stalemate.Tillis usually supports Trump but occasionally has broken with the president. For instance, he was one of just two GOP senators to vote against the \"one big beautiful bill\" spending package last year. Tillis is retiring from the Senate when his term ends.Powell's position isn't the only one at stake.Stephen Miran's term as governor ends in January, and there has been chatter about potential retirements, particularly Vice Chair Philip Jefferson.However, news that the office of U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro, a Trump confidant and former Fox News host, is investigating Powell for perjury clouds the situation. Powell on Sunday released a statement acknowledging the investigation and alleging it is a pretext for giving Trump power over the Fed.\"No one, certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve, is above the law, but this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure,\" Powell said.Tillis isn't the only banking panel member to criticize Trump over the move.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who once called Powell \"a dangerous man\" and opposed his reappointment, accused Trump of wanting a \"sock puppet\" to lead the Fed and do his bidding by lowering interest rates.\"Trump is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair,\" Warren said in a statement.While Powell's term as chair ends in May, he can stay on as governor until 2028. He has not indicated yet whether he will do so.The White House has been conducting an extensive search for the new chair, with the candidate field whittled down to five. Trump has indicated he will put forth a nominee this month.CNBC has reached out to the White House and DOJ for comment.",

She went on to serve under former President Joe Biden as the head of the Treasury, the first woman to hold either position.During her time at the Treasury, critics charged Yellen used the levers of debt issuance to underwrite a ballooning national debt. Trump has badgered the Fed to lower rates, in part to ease financing costs for a debt burden currently at $38.4 trillion.Yellen said using the Fed's key overnight borrowing rate to manage the debt is irresponsible.\"You have a president that says the Fed should be cutting rates to lower rate payments on the federal debt,\" Yellen said, adding she \"completely [disagrees] with that. It is the road to a banana republic.\"Other former Fed and Treasury officials joined the chorus against the Powell investigation.\"The reported criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell is an unprecedented attempt to use prosecutorial attacks to undermine that independence,\" the officials said in a statement. Signatories included former Fed Chairs Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan, former Treasury Secretaries Timothy Geithner and Henry Paulson, and a number of prominent economists.\"This is how monetary policy is made in emerging markets with weak institutions, with highly negative consequences for inflation and the functioning of their economies more broadly. It has no place in the United States whose greatest strength is the rule of law, which is at the foundation of our economic success,\" the statement said.",

Trump said there will be \"serious retaliation\" after two US Army soldiers and an interpreter were killed in Syria on Saturday, and three other Americans were wounded.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said in a social media post on Monday that Microsoft will announce changes to ensure that Americans won't see rising utility bills as the company builds more data centers to meet rising artificial intelligence demand.\"I never want Americans to pay higher Electricity bills because of Data Centers,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Therefore, my Administration is working with major American Technology Companies to secure their commitment to the American People, and we will have much to announce in the coming weeks.\"Ahead of this year's midterm elections, President Trump is trying to find ways to lower prices for consumers, as the effects of tariffs he imposed last year on goods imported to the U.S. ripple across the economy. In December, Trump announced a $1,776 \"warrior dividend\" for U.S soldiers. Earlier this month he demanded the purchase of $200 billion in mortgage bonds with the hope of reducing mortgage rates.Meanwhile, the biggest tech companies are rapidly constructing power-hungry data centers and telling Wall Street that they'll be bolstering their capital expenditures as the AI boom continues. Last week Meta announced agreements with three nuclear power companies for a data center in Ohio.Trump congratulated Microsoft on its efforts to keep prices in check, suggesting that other companies will make similar commitments.\"First up is Microsoft, who my team has been working with, and which will make major changes beginning this week to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills,\" Trump wrote on Monday.Microsoft didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Utilities charged U.S. consumers 6% more for electricity in August from a year earlier, including in states with many data centers, CNBC reported in November. Microsoft is paying close to attention to the impact of its data centers on local residents. \"I just want you to know we are doing everything we can, and I believe we're succeeding, in managing this issue well, so that you all don't have to pay more for electricity because of our presence,\" Brad Smith, the company's president and vice chair, said at a September town hall meeting in Wisconsin, where Microsoft is building an AI data center. While Microsoft is moving forward with some facilities, the company withdrew plans for a data center in Caledonia, Wisconsin, amid loud opposition to its efforts there. The project would would have been located 20 miles away from a data center in the village of Mount Pleasant.WATCH: Meta signs nuclear energy deals with Oklo, Vistra, and TerraPower to support its AI ambitionswatch now",

    "body": "Tech investors are sounding out how the U.S. taking Greenland would affect the viability of critical and rare earth minerals mining there, CNBC has learned, as Washington ramps up its pursuit of the Arctic island.Greenland has found itself at the center of a geopolitical firestorm over the past week as the U.S. has threatened to annex the self-governing Danish territory, citing national security concerns. Commercial opportunities have also come into the spotlight.In the past week, Critical Metals Corp, a company with a mining project in development on the Arctic island, has fielded questions from tech investors about how the U.S. acquiring Greenland would impact that asset and its development strategy, CEO Tony Sage told CNBC. The NASDAQ-listed company's stock is up 116% since the start of 2026.The project is in the early stages of building a plant to extract heavy rare earth elements (HREE), which can be used to provide heat resistance and magnetic stability in advanced technology ranging from EVs to AI data center infrastructure.Sage said U.S. President Donald Trump's rhetoric about Greenland had generated additional \"buzz\" for the project from investors. Without naming specific shareholders, he said Critical Metals Corp backers included those who invest in Magnificent Seven U.S. tech companies.Last week, the CEO of Amaroq, a mining company with projects in Greenland, told CNBC it was having discussions with U.S. government bodies about potential investment opportunities in the territory.The White House has said it's \"actively\" discussing a potential offer to buy Greenland, though it hasn't ruled out military action to acquire the territory, ahead of planned talks this week between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Danish officials. Mining in GreenlandInterest in critical minerals and rare earth mining in Greenland from tech investors has picked up in the past year. In January 2025, Trump reasserted his desire to acquire the territory — a massive, strategically-placed island with a population of just 57,000 — ahead of taking office.Amaroq chief Eldur Ólafsson said the company had seen an increase in attention from investors, including tech investors, over the last 12 months, in an interview with CNBC last week, as geopolitical tensions brought supply chains for critical minerals into focus.In November, the company said that \"commercial levels\" of germanium and gallium, critical minerals that are crucial for building advanced AI chips, were present in a mining project it owns in Greenland. \"When Trump put tariffs on China, the first two metals China stopped exporting were germanium and gallium,\" Ólafsson told CNBC. \"Why? Because you need it in AI, you need it in defense, you need it in tech, it's absolutely critical.\"watch nowChina's export ban on several rare earth minerals in 2025 highlighted to tech investors the challenge of the country's dominance in the space, said Critical Metals Corp's Sage. \"The heavy rare earths, which include Yttrium, Gadolinium, Terbium, Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium, Ytterbium, Lutetium, and Gallium are the minerals that generate the most interest,\" he told CNBC. \"These are the materials that are essential for defence technologies, robotics, semiconductors and aerospace applications. We can't fly rockets into space, build nuclear submarines or next-generation fighter jets without these materials.\"Sage added that Critical Metals Corp had \"strong relationships\" with the governments of both Greenland and the U.S. and did not expect its plans to change.The company's stock surged 62% in a day in October after Reuters reported the U.S. Government was considering buying a stake. It shed the gains to finish 2025 up 2% for the year.Others are more skeptical about whether Greenland's critical and rare earth minerals can significantly reduce the West's dependence on China, which produced 70% of rare earths in 2024, according to Statista. \"Getting rare earths from exploration to the mighty magnet involves five to six distinct stages — and right now, what's in Greenland is still only in the exploration stage,\" Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director at industry group the Critical Minerals Institute, told CNBC.\"Rare earths in Greenland won't materially move markets in the next decade,\" she added.",

    "body": "watch nowParamount Skydance is suing Warner Bros. Discovery and CEO David Zaslav as its latest step in a hostile pursuit to acquire WBD, CEO David Ellison outlined in a letter to WBD shareholders on Monday. The lawsuit asks a Delaware court to direct Warner Bros. Discovery to provide information about its sale process and pending deal with Netflix. \"WBD has failed to include any disclosure about how it valued the Global Networks stub equity, how it valued the overall Netflix transaction, how the purchase price reduction for debt works in the Netflix transaction, or even what the basis is for its 'risk adjustment' of our $30 per share all-cash offer,\" Ellison said in the letter on Monday. \"We filed suit this morning in Delaware Chancery Court to ask the court to simply direct WBD to provide this information so that WBD shareholders have what they need to be able to make an informed decision as to whether to tender their shares into our offer,\" Ellison said. Ellison also informed WBD shareholders on Monday that Paramount intends to nominate directors for election to WBD's board at the company's 2026 annual meeting, in a move that would add a proxy fight to the equation. Paramount's latest escalation comes days after WBD's board once again recommended that shareholders reject Paramount's amended offer, which was made in late December. The company has repeatedly said its offer is superior to the company's deal with Netflix and has previously argued that the sale process was unfairly skewed. \"Despite six weeks and just as many press releases from Paramount Skydance, it has yet to raise the price or address the numerous and obvious deficiencies of its offer,\" Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement on Monday.  \"Instead, Paramount Skydance is seeking to distract with a meritless lawsuit and attacks on a board that has delivered an unprecedented amount of shareholder value. In spite of its multiple opportunities, Paramount Skydance continues to propose a transaction that our board unanimously concluded is not superior to the merger agreement with Netflix.\"Warner Bros. Discovery last month agreed to sell its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. The proposed deal was the result of a sale process in which Paramount was bidding for all of WBD's assets, including its portfolio of cable TV channels, known as Discovery Global. As part of the Netflix deal, Warner Bros. Discovery plans to separate Discovery Global into its own publicly traded entity. Soon after WBD reached a deal with Netflix, Paramount went public with its hostile bid. Paramount has offered $30 per share, all cash for all of Warner Bros. Discovery's assets. WBD's board told shareholders in December to reject the initial offer in favor of the Netflix deal, citing concerns about the backing of Ellison's father, billionaire Larry Ellison. Paramount responded with an amended offer in which the Oracle co-founder agreed not to revoke the family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. Paramount has stopped short of increasing the size of its bid, however. The newly merged Paramount Skydance first took interest in Warner Bros. Discovery in the fall, making three unsolicited offers that were each rejected. Warner Bros. Discovery then opened up a sale process seeking offers for some or all of its company. At the same time, Warner Bros. Discovery said it would carry on with a plan that was announced earlier in the year to split its company into two publicly traded entities — Warner Bros., consisting of the streaming platform HBO Max and film studio, and Discovery Global, comprised of the pay TV networks like TNT and CNN.

On Instagram, it removed around 330,000 accounts, around 173,500 on Facebook, and nearly 40,000 on Threads. \"As we've stated previously, Meta is committed to meeting its compliance obligations and is taking the necessary steps to remain compliant with the law,\" Meta said in the post. \"That said, we call on the Australian government to engage with industry constructively to find a better way forward, such as incentivising all of industry to raise the standard in providing safe, privacy-preserving, age appropriate experiences online, instead of blanket bans.\" The company said it worked with OpenAge Initiative, a non profit organization, to launch age verification tolls called Age Keys — users can then verify their age via government-issued ID, financial information, face estimation, or national digital wallets. However, it highlighted that age verification and parental approval needs to extend to the app store level, as teens use over 40 apps a week and many of these don't use age verification tools or prioritize safety, or be in the scope of the Australian law. \"This is the only way to guarantee consistent, industry-wide protections for young people, no matter which apps they use, and to avoid the whack-a-mole effect of catching up with new apps that teens will migrate to in order to circumvent the social media ban law,\" it added. Australia's Online Safety Amendment Act 2024 came into effect on Dec. 11.Xavier Lorenzo | Moment | Getty ImagesMeta previously shared its disapproval of the new law saying \"cutting teens off from their friends and communities isn't the answer,\" and emphasized that some will will find other ways to access social media sites \"without the safeguards provided to registered users.\"Since the ban, many Australian teens have found ways to circumvent the law including turning to alternative social media platforms that are not yet banned including Snapchat-alternative Yope, Bytedance's video and photo-sharing app Lemon8, and messaging platform Discord. Additionally, other under 16s told Sky News that they're using VPNs or their parent's social media account. Meta is not the only platform to question the ban. Reddit has gone as far as to launch a legal challenge against Australia saying the new law is ineffective and limits political discussion. It can isolate teens \"from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions),\" Reddit said in prior comments to CNBC. It added in its application that \"the political views of children inform the electoral choices of many current electors, including their parents and their teachers, as well as others interested in the views of those soon to reach the age of maturity.\"In a video on X, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese explained that the ban would give back power to parents and families from big tech firms, and would allow \"kids to be kids.\" The ban decreases the likelihood of teens being exposed to stressful or harmful content, said Australia's eSafety Commissionerm, adding that it also shifts the responsibility on teen social media usage from parents to tech companies.Mental health harms Australia's social media ban for under 16s may influence other countries to follow suit, as lawmakers and parents continue to grapple with the negative mental health impact that such platforms are having on younger users. In 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy warned of a teen mental health crisis due to social media, in a report that linked social media use with increase depression, anxiety, as well as for perpetuating eating disorders, body dysmorphia and low self-esteem. The concerns have sparked the rise of parent-led organizations worldwide that aim to restrict their children from using smartphones. Such movements include the Smartphone Free Childhood group in the U.K., Austin-based Wait Until 8th, Unplugged in Canada, No Es Momento in Mexico, and the Heads Up Alliance in Australia.Read moreJonathan Haidt, NYU professor and the author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" is a major figure in the movement to protect children from smartphones and social media. Haidt advises that teenagers shouldn't have smartphones before the age of 14, and shouldn't have access to social media before 16-years-old. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is hoping for a long-term mental health shift as a result of the ban, but in the immediate aftermath, results have been mixed. A BBC report that involved interviews with Australian teens found that while some have changed their habits for the better, other teens felt more isolated and disconnected without social media, or were finding workarounds.

    "body": "watch nowApple is joining forces with Google to power its artificial intelligence features, including a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. The multiyear partnership will lean on Google's Gemini and cloud technology for future Apple foundational models, according to a joint statement obtained by CNBC's Jim Cramer.\"After careful evaluation, we determined that Google's technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and we're excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for our users,\" Apple said in a statement Monday.The models will continue to run on Apple devices and the company's private cloud compute, the companies added. Apple declined to comment on the terms of the deal. Google referred CNBC to the joint statement. In August, Bloomberg reported that Apple was in early talks with Google to use a custom Gemini model to power a new iteration of Siri. The news outlet later reported that Apple was planning to pay about $1 billion a year to utilize Google AI.The deal is another major indicator of growing trust in Google's accelerating AI agenda and comeback against OpenAI. In 2025, the search giant logged its best year since 2009 and surpassed Apple in market capitalization last week for the first time since 2019. Google already pays Apple billions each year to be the default search engine on iPhones. But that lucrative partnership briefly came into question after Google was found to hold an illegal internet search monopoly. In September, a judge ruled against a worst-case scenario outcome that could have forced Google to divest its Chrome browser business. The decision also allowed Google to continue to make deals such as the one with Apple.Read more CNBC tech newsAlphabet hits $4 trillion market capitalizationMalaysia and Indonesia block Elon Musk's Grok due to nonconsensual sexual contentGoogle bolsters bet on AI-powered commerce with new platform for shopping agentsAre we in an AI bubble?

Google briefly touched above a $4 trillion market value.Apple has mostly stood on the sidelines of the AI frenzy that's swept up Wall Street since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the end of 2022. Hyperscalers Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft have shelled out billions on AI products, tools and infrastructure for their customers.That's amped up the pressure on the iPhone maker to deliver an impressive Siri AI voice upgrade, which it delayed last year until 2026, despite running ads for the product.\"It's going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year,\" the company said in a statement at the time.Apple currently partners with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into Siri and Apple Intelligence, specifically for complicated queries that can tap into the AI model's world knowledge. It's unclear what the Google partnership means for the ChatGPT integration in the future.The iPhone maker told CNBC that it isn't making any changes to the agreement. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, Google has made steady progress on its AI agenda, introducing its upgraded Gemini 3 model late last year. In October, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company's cloud segment signed more deals worth over $1 billion through the third quarter of 2025 than the previous two years combined.

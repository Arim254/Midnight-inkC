    "body": "John Giannandrea.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple's AI chief is stepping down, the company announced Monday in the most visible shake up yet to the iPhone maker's artificial intelligence group since launching its Apple Intelligence suite in 2024.John Giannandrea, who held the position since joining the company in 2018, will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft and was previously part of Google's DeepMind AI unit, according to his LinkedIn profile. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. He will continue to serve as an advisor until retiring next spring, Apple said.The change comes as experts this year have said Apple has fallen behind its tech peers in artificial intelligence, a tech field that has been reinvigorated since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2022.Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026, signaling development challenges. Subramanya will serve as Apple's vice president of AI, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi, the company said.In a statement, Cook said Federighi has already been playing a key role in Apple's AI efforts.\"In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar's joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,\" Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams working on Apple's foundation models, research and AI safety. Other teams previously under Giannandrea will move under COO Sabih Khan and services chief Eddy Cue, Apple said.Although Apple shares are up 16% in 2025, they have lagged many other big tech companies as investors say the iPhone maker has fallen behind its peers that are investing billions into AI data centers, chips and frontier models.Apple said in August that it was \"significantly increasing\" the amount it spends on AI, and Cook has said it's a \"profound\" technology. Apple has struck a deal with leader OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into some of its products, like Siri.But Apple is playing a different game than companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta. It's spending much less on infrastructure for the technology. Apple also prefers its AI to run on its devices, instead of communicating back to more powerful computers in the cloud.Apple this year also saw Jony Ive, its legendary hardware designer who helped late co-founder Steve Jobs invent the iPhone, sell his startup io for $6.4 billion to OpenAI, with the intention of helping the AI lab release its own hardware.Analysts say that Apple has built a loyalty moat among its customers since the iPhone launched in 2007, but AI-driven hardware is on its way, with Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman last month saying that they've already completed their first prototypes and could reveal them in two years or less.WATCH: Apple will gain more AI functionality over time, says D.A.

    "body": "A shopper exits a Costco store in Centerville, Ohio, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCostco sued the Trump administration to get a full refund of new tariffs it paid so far this year, and to block those import duties from continuing to be collected from the retail warehouse club giant as a Supreme Court case plays out.In the suit filed Friday, Costco said that it risks losing the money it has already paid to satisfy the tariffs even if the Supreme Court eventually upholds earlier lower court rulings that found President Donald Trump did not have the legal power to impose those duties.The company noted a looming Dec. 15 deadline that could prevent the tariffs that it has already paid on an estimated basis from being refunded. Costco did not say how much money it believes should be refunded to the company.Costco's suit, filed in the U.S Court of International Trade, said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection denied the company's request to extend the Dec. 15 date of so-called liquidation, the final computation of tariffs assessed on imported items. While an importer has six months to file a protest contesting liquidation, \"not all liquidations are protestable,\" the suit said.Dozens of other companies have filed similar lawsuits to protect their right to potential refunds in case the Supreme Court rules against the so-called reciprocal tariffs that Trump imposed on imports from many U.S. trading partners and his so-called fentanyl tariffs on products from Canada, China, and Mexico.Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose those often high tariffs. In August, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a 7-4 ruling, upheld a prior decision by the Court of International Trade that found Trump did not have that power.\"The core Congressional power to impose taxes such as tariffs is vested  exclusively in the legislative branch by the Constitution,\" the Federal Circuit said in its ruling. \"Tariffs are a core Congressional power.\"During oral arguments on Nov. 5, a majority of the Supreme Court's nine justices appeared skeptical of arguments by a lawyer for the Trump administration that the president did have the power to impose the tariffs.The Supreme Court took the administration's appeal of the lower court rulings on an expedited basis, but it is not clear when or how the court will decide the dispute.Costco, in its lawsuit, said, \"This separate action is necessary, however, because even if the IEEPA duties and underlying executive orders are held unlawful by the Supreme Court, importers that have paid IEEPA duties, including Plaintiff, are not guaranteed a refund for those unlawfully collected tariffs in the absence of their own judgment and judicial relief.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

    "body": "Masayoshi Son, chairman and chief executive officer of SoftBank Group Corp., speaks at the SoftBank World event in Tokyo, Japan, on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. Speaking via teleconference, Son and OpenAI chief Sam Altman argued that advancing artificial intelligence would lead to new jobs that are not yet imagined, and the advancement of robotics will help kickstart a \"self-improvement\" loop. Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSoftBank Group founder Masayoshi Son on Monday downplayed the decision to offload the conglomerate's entire Nvidia stake, saying he \"was crying\" over parting with the shares. Speaking at a forum in Tokyo Monday, Son addressed SoftBank's November disclosure that the firm had sold its holding in the American chip darling for $5.83 billion. According to Son, SoftBank wouldn't have made the move if it didn't need to bankroll its next artificial intelligence investments, including a big bet on OpenAI and data center projects. \"I don't want to sell a single share. I just had more need for money to invest in OpenAI and other projects, Son said during the FII Priority Asia forum. \"I was crying to sell Nvidia shares.\"Son's comments are consistent with what analysts and other Softbank executives said in November, describing the sale as part of broader efforts to bolster SoftBank Vision Fund's AI war chest. SoftBank has doubled down on its AI plans this year with a series of projects, including work on Stargate Project data centers and the acquisition of U.S. chip designer Ampere Computing.The Japanese giant could also \"potentially\" increase its investment in OpenAI depending on the performance of the ChatGPT maker and the valuation of further rounds, a person familiar with the matter previously told CNBC.Earlier this year, Son said that SoftBank was \"all in\" on OpenAI and predicted the AI startup would one day become the most valuable company in the world. So far, that bet has reaped some dividends, with SoftBank reporting last month that its second-quarter net profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen ($16.6 billion), driven by valuation gains in its OpenAI holdings.However, SoftBank's massive AI bets come amid growing fears and jitters in markets about a potential AI bubble. In his Monday talk, Son also pushed back against these concerns, arguing that those who talk about an AI bubble are \"not smart enough.\"He predicted that \"super [artificial] intelligence\" and AI robots will generate at least 10% of global gross domestic product over the long term, which he said would outweigh trillions of dollars of investment into the technology.",

The startup previously received backing from Nvidia. Luma is building \"world models,\" a class of AI models that are able to learn from video, audio and images, alongside text, and which large language models (LLMs) like those powering OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini use. The startup is currently targeting marketing, advertising, media and entertainment sectors with its video models, which it sells via an application programming interface (API) and as part of a content creation suite.\"With this Series C raise and the upcoming build-out of global compute infrastructure, we have the capital and capacity to bring world-scale AI to creatives everywhere,\" said Amit Jain, CEO and co-founder of Luma AI. \"Launching across Europe and the Middle East is the logical next step in putting this power directly in the hands of storytellers, agencies and brands globally.\"The U.K. is the starting point of the expansion because of its access to talent, Jain told CNBC.\"London has some of the best people when it comes to research, given the universities here and institutions like DeepMind,\" he said. \"We also consider London to be the entry point to the European market.\"AI generated image created by Luma's Ray3 model (Luma AI)Luma AILuma is the latest in a wave of North American AI labs doubling down on the U.K. and Europe as they look to take advantage of talent pools and revenue opportunities.In November, San Francisco-based Anthropic announced plans to open offices in Paris and Munich, months on from kicking off a hiring spree in London and Dublin. Canadian AI startup Cohere said it would open a Paris office to become its EMEA headquarters in September and OpenAI announced a new office in Munich in February.While world models may not yet be as developed as LLMs, some researchers say they are as, if not more, crucial in the pursuit of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).\"These kinds of visual models are about a year to a year-and-a-half behind language models right now,\" said Jain. But world models will become the \"natural interface\" for AI for most day-to-day use in time, he predicted, pointing to the amount of time people spend watching video content each day. Tech giants including Google, Meta and Nvidia are all developing world models for a range of use cases.Luma released its latest model, Ray3, in September, which Jain told CNBC benchmarks higher than OpenAI's Sora and at similar levels to Google's Veo 3.",

Anna Rose Layden | ReutersPresident Donald Trump underwent an MRI in October to evaluate his cardiovascular and abdominal health, and the resulting images were \"perfectly normal,\" the White House physician said Monday.The results of Trump's magnetic resonance imaging were released a day after the 79-year-old president told reporters that he had \"no idea\" which part of his body was scanned, and three days after Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz responded to Trump calling him \"seriously r-----ed\" by saying, \"release the MRI results.\"\"Has anyone in the history of the world ever had an MRI assigned to them and have no idea what it was for, as he says?\" Walz said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"Trump's physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, said Monday that the advanced imaging at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was part of a \"comprehensive executive physical, and was ordered because men in his age group \"benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.\" Barbabella described the imaging as routine and preventative, meant to identify potential issues early and confirm overall function. Barbabella also said the cardiovascular imaging showed no signs of arterial narrowing, impaired blood flow, or abnormalities in the heart or major vessels.Barbabella found that the heart chambers were normal in size, the vessel walls appeared smooth and healthy, and there was no indication of inflammation or clotting. The doctor also reported that all major organs appeared healthy and well-perfused, with no acute or chronic concerns detected.Barbabella described the president's cardiovascular system as being in \"excellent health.\" The White House did not release images of the tests.Until Monday, the White House had only described Trump's Walter Reed visit as a \"follow-up evaluation\" that included \"advanced imaging,\" without saying why the procedure was done.",

Trump last month appeared to soften his stance on H1-B visas, saying in an interview to Fox News that foreign labor was needed at times because U.S. did not have \"certain talents.\" \"I'm certainly not in the school of thought that we should shut down the H-1B program,\" Musk said, adding that it would be \"very bad.\" watch nowMusk, whose relationship with the U.S. president appears to be on the mend having soured in May over Trump's spending bill, also raised concerns over the U.S. administration's tariff policy. Once a close aid of Trump, Musk said he tried to dissuade the president from taking the tariff route, but was unsuccessful.\"I think generally free trade is better\" Musk said, adding that tariffs create distortions in markets. If tariffs at an individual level, or within each state of U.S. would be disastrous for the economy, \"then why do you want tariffs between countries?\" he said.The Tesla CEO, who spearheaded the formation of the Department of Government Efficiency that was recently disbanded with eight months left to its mandate, according to Reuters, said \"the president has made it clear he loves tariffs.\"Trump has levied \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries, with several managing to strike a deal with the U.S. to lower levies.In the podcast with Kamath covering a wide range of topics, Musk also laid out his vision for the future, forecasting that working will be optional in less than 20 years and money as a concept would \"disappear.\"Energy is the true currency, Musk said. \"This is why I said bitcoin is based on energy. You can't legislate energy.\" Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen a sharp sell-off over the past two months as investor mood sours on digital assets.",

Michael Fisher wrote in the appellate ruling. The unusual series of legal moves taken by the Department of Justice to install Habba, one of Trump's former personal lawyers, as an acting U.S. attorney demonstrates \"the difficulties it has faced,\" Fisher wrote.\"Yet the citizens of New Jersey and the loyal employees in the U.S. Attorney's Office deserve some clarity and stability,\" the judge wrote.Fisher and another judge on the panel, D. Brooks Smith, were nominated to the Third Circuit by Republican former President George W. Bush. The other judge, L. Felipe Restrepo, was nominated by Democratic ex-President Barack Obama.Abbe Lowell and Gerald Krovatin, lawyers for one of the parties in the case challenging Habba's appointment, noted in a statement with Norm Eisen that Monday's ruling marks \"the first time an appellate court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.\"\"We will continue to challenge President Trump's unlawful appointments of purported U.S. Attorneys wherever appropriate,\" the lawyers said in a joint statement.Read more CNBC politics coverageJudge dismisses James Comey and Letitia James cases over 'unlawful' prosecutor appointmentSen.

Trump nominated her in June, but she never underwent the Senate confirmation process, a Constitutionally-mandated step that can be lengthy and contentious.Habba could only legally serve as an interim prosecutor for a limited time under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. As that deadline neared, the Trump administration took a number of steps to keep Habba in the role.The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, who was set to become interim U.S. attorney for the district after Habba's scheduled departure. Trump then withdrew Habba's nomination, and Bondi appointed her as both \"Special Attorney\" to the attorney general and the First Assistant U.S. attorney, aiming to elevate her automatically to acting U.S. attorney.But the appeals court panel ruled Monday that those actions failed to comply with the provisions of the FVRA.\"Therefore, we will affirm the District Court's disqualification order,\" Fisher concluded.The ruling came one week after another Trump-picked prosecutor, Lindsey Halligan, was deemed invalidly appointed.That ruling, which disqualified Halligan as interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, also threw out the cases she brought against two major Trump foes: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.Monday's appellate ruling on Habba did not dismiss the underlying criminal charges against the two people who had challenged her appointment.",

    "body": "The logo of an Apple Store is seen reflected on the glass exterior of a Samsung flagship store in Shanghai, China Monday, Oct. 20, 2025.Wang Gang | Feature China | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesThe cost of your smartphone might rise, analysts are warning, as the AI boom clogs up supply chains and a recent change by Nvidia to its products could make it worse.AI data centers, on which tech giants globally are spending hundreds of billions of dollars, require chips from suppliers, like Nvidia, which relies on many different components and companies to create its coveted graphics processing units.But other companies like AMD, the hyperscalers like Google and Microsoft, and other component suppliers all rely on this supply chain.Many parts of the supply chain can't keep up with demand, and it's slowing down components that are critical for some of the world's most popular consumer electronics. Those components are seeing huge spikes in prices, threatening price rises for the end product and could even lead to shortages of some devices. \"We see the rapid increase in demand for AI in data centers driving bottlenecks in many areas,\" Peter Hanbury, partner in the technology practice at Bain & Company, told CNBC.Where is the supply chain clogged?One of the starkest assessments came from Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu, CEO of Chinese tech giant Alibaba.Wu, whose company is building its own AI infrastructure and designs its own chips, said last week that there are shortages across semiconductor manufacturers, memory chips and storage devices like hard drives. \"There is a situation of undersupply,\" Wu said, adding that the \"supply side is going to be a relatively large bottleneck.\" He added this could last two to three years.Bain and Co.'s Hanbury said there are shortages of hard disk drives, or HDDs, which store data. HDDs are used in the data center. These are preferred by hyperscalers,: big companies like Microsoft and Google. But, with HDDs at capacity, these firms have shifted to using solid-state drives, or SSDs, another type of storage device. However, these SSDs are key components for consumer electronics. The other big focus is on a type of chip under the umbrella of memory called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM. Nvidia's chips use high-bandwidth memory which is a type of chip that stacks multiple DRAM semiconductors.watch nowMemory prices have surged as a result of the huge demand and lack of supply. Counterpoint Research said it expects memory prices to rise 30% in the fourth quarter of this year and another 20% in early 2026. Even small imbalances in supply and demand can have major knock on effects on memory pricing. And because of the demand for HBM and GPUs, chipmakers are prioritizing these over other types of semiconductors.\"DRAM is certainly a bottleneck as AI investments continue to feed the imbalance between demand and supply with HBM for AI being prioritized by chipmakers,\" MS Hwang,  research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\"Imbalances of 1-2% can trigger sharp price increases and we're seeing that figure hitting 3% levels at the moment – this is very significant.\"Why are there issues?Building up capacity in various areas of the semiconductor supply chain can be capital-intensive. And it's an industry that's known to be risk-averse and did not add the capacity necessary to meet the projections provided by key industry players, Bain & Co.'s Hanbur said. \"The direct cause of the shortage is the rapid increase in demand for data center chips,\" Hanbury said.\"Basically, the suppliers worried the market was too optimistic and they did not want to overbuild very expensive capacity so they did not build to the estimates provided by their customers.  Now, the suppliers need to add capacity quickly but as we know, it takes 2-3 years to add semiconductor manufacturing fabs.\" Nvidia at the centerA lot of attention is on Nvidia given it dominates when it comes to the chips that are being put into AI data centers. It is a huge customer of high bandwidth memory, for example. And its products are manufactured by TSMC which also has other major customers like Apple. But analysts are focused on a change Nvidia has made to its products that has the potential to add major pressure to consumer electronics supply chains. The U.S. giant is increasingly shifting toward using a type of memory in its products called Low-Power Double Data Rate (LPDDR). This is seen as more power efficient than the previous Double Data Rate, or DDR memory. The problem is, Nvidia is increasingly using the latest generation of LPDDR memory, which is also used by high-end consumer electronics makers such as Samsung and Apple. Typically, the industry would just be dealing with demand for this product from a handful of big electronics players. But now Nvidia, which has huge scale, is entering the mix.\"We also see a bigger risk on the horizon is with advanced memory as Nvidia's recent pivot to LPDDR means they're a customer on the scale of a major smartphone maker — a seismic shift for the supply chain which can't easily absorb this scale of demand,\" Hwang from Counterpoint Research said.How AI boom is impacting consumer electronicsHere's the link between all of this. From chip manufacturers like TSMC, Intel and Samsung, there is only so much capacity. If there is huge demand for certain types of chips, then these companies will prioritize those, especially from their larger customers. That can lead to shortages of other types of semiconductors elsewhere. Memory chips, in particular DRAM which has seen prices shoot up, is of particular concern because it's used in so many devices from smartphones to laptops. And this could lead to price rises in the world's favorite electronics.DRAM and storage represent around 10% to 25% of the bill of materials for a typical PC or smartphone, according to Hanbury of Bain & Co. A price increase of 20% to 30% in these components would increase the total bill of materials costs by 5% to 10%. \"In terms of timing, the impact will likely start shortly as component costs are already increasing and likely accelerate into next year,\" Hanbury said.watch nowOn top of this, there is now demand from players involved in AI data centers like Nvidia, for components that would have typically been used for consumer devices such as LPDDR which adds more demand to a supply constrained market.If electronics firms can't get their hands on the components needed for their devices because they're in short supply or going toward AI data centers, then there could be shortages of the world's most popular gadgets.\"Beyond the rise in cost there's a second issue and that's the inability to secure enough components, which constrains the production of electronic devices,\" Counterpoint Research's Hwang said.What are tech firms saying?A number of electronics companies have warned about the impact they are seeing from all of this. Xiaomi, the third-biggest smartphone vendor globally, said it expects that consumers will see \"a sizeable rise in product retail prices,\" according to a Reuters reported this month. Jeff Clark, chief operating officer at Dell, this month said the price rises of components is \"unprecedented.\" \"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen,\" Clark said on an earnings call, adding that the pressure is seen across various types of memory chips and storage hard drives. The unintended consequencesThe AI infrastructure players are using similar chips to those being used in consumer electronics. These are often some of the more advanced semiconductors on the market.But there are legacy chips which are manufactured by the same companies that the AI market is relying on. As these manufacturers shift attention to serving their AI customers, there could be unintended consequences for other industries.\"For example, many other markets depend on the same underlying semiconductor manufacturing capabilities as the data center market\" including automobiles, industrials and aerospace and defense, which \"will likely see some impact from these price increases as well,\" Hanbury said.

Ether dropped 8.4% to hit $2,776.39.Solana had fallen more than 9%, and was last seen below $125, while other closely watched tokens were also in the red.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBTC.In Asia, a statement by the People's Bank of China on Saturday warning of illegal activities relating to digital currencies heaped pressure on Hong Kong-listed shares of digital assets-related companies, which retreated during Monday's session.The fresh slide in digital assets chimes with a broader risk-off sentiment at the start of a new month. Ben Emons, founder and CIO of Fedwatch Advisors, said that people remain \"nervous\" following the recent bitcoin sell-off, adding that Monday's reversal has broadly been attributed to a $400 million exchange liquidation.Speaking with CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday, he highlighted the sizable leverage across bitcoin exchanges, which is up to 200x in some instances. With an estimated $787 billion outstanding leverage in perpetual crypto futures, against some $135 billion outstanding in ETFs, \"you can do the math,\" Emons said. \"There is still a lot of leverage in bitcoin out there. We can expect to some more of these liquidations if bitcoin prices don't get off the lows from here,\" he added.watch nowMonday's dip came on the back of a sharp sell-off in October, which also moved the stock market, Emons said, with bitcoin showing greater correlation with certain indexes including the Nasdaq. \"It's predominantly retail driven, that's the worrying part of it, because retail reacts very differently than institutional [investors],\" he said, noting the decentralized nature of crypto exchanges and opaque nature of the asset class.\"That is something to reckon with going forward from here, as more and more leverage is used in this space.\"Macroeconomic concerns — including uncertainty over a possible U.S. rate cut — continue to weigh on investors' minds, while nagging doubts over overheated valuations in artificial intelligence-related names contributed to November's bumpy markets as crypto volatility heightened.And in crypto markets, several data points suggest more short-term weakness for digital assets is ahead. Perpetual futures open interest has fallen, a sign of reduced speculative positioning and leverage in the market, according to Zach Pandl, head of research at crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale. He also pointed to relatively weak trading volumes on centralized and decentralized exchange, which could suggest \"subdued trading activity and risk appetite.\"watch now",

    "body": "Beata Zawrzel | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesA YouTube tool that uses creators' biometrics to help them remove AI-generated videos that exploit their likeness also allows Google to train its AI models on that sensitive data, experts told CNBC.In response to concern from intellectual property experts, YouTube told CNBC that Google has never used creators' biometric data to train AI models and it is reviewing the language used in the tool's sign-up form to avoid confusion. But YouTube told CNBC it will not be changing its underlying policy. The discrepancy highlights a broader divide inside Alphabet, where Google is aggressively expanding its AI efforts while YouTube works to maintain trust with creators and rightsholders who depend on the platform for their businesses.YouTube is expanding its \"likeness detection,\" a tool the company introduced in October that flags when a creator's face is used without their permission in deepfakes, the term used to describe fake videos created using AI. The feature is being expanded to millions of creators in the YouTube Partner Program as AI-manipulated content becomes more prevalent throughout social media.The tool scans videos uploaded across YouTube to identify where a creator's face may have been altered or generated by artificial intelligence. Creators can then decide whether to request the video's removal, but to use the tool, YouTube requires that creators upload a government ID and a biometric video of their face. Biometrics are the measurement of physical characteristics to verify a person's identity.Experts say that by tying the tool to Google's Privacy Policy, YouTube has left the door for future misuse of creators' biometrics. The policy states that public content, including biometric information, can be used \"to help train Google's AI models and build products and features.\"\"Likeness detection is a completely optional feature, but does require a visual reference to work,\" YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon said in a statement to CNBC. \"Our approach to that data is not changing. As our Help Center has stated since the launch, the data provided for the likeness detection tool is only used for identity verification purposes and to power this specific safety feature.\"YouTube told CNBC it is \"considering ways to make the in-product language clearer.\" The company has not said what specific changes to the wording will be made or when they will take effect. Experts remain cautious, saying they raised concerns about the policy to YouTube months ago.\"As Google races to compete in AI and training data becomes strategic gold, creators need to think carefully about whether they want their face controlled by a platform rather than owned by themselves,\" said Dan Neely, CEO of Vermillio, which helps individuals protect their likeness from being misused and also facilitates secure licensing of authorized content. \"Your likeness will be one of the most valuable assets in the AI era, and once you give that control away, you may never get it back.\"Vermillio and Loti are third-party companies working with creators, celebrities and media companies to monitor and enforce likeness rights across the internet. With advancements in AI video generation, their usefulness has ramped up for IP rightsholders.Loti CEO Luke Arrigoni said the risks of YouTube's current biometric policy \"are enormous.\"  \"Because the release currently allows someone to be able to attach that name to the actual biometrics of the face, they could create something more synthetic that looks like that person,\" Arrigoni said.Neely and Arrigoni both said they would not currently recommend that any of their clients sign up for likeness detection on YouTube.YouTube Head of Creator Product Amjad Hanif said YouTube built its likeness detection tool to operate \"at the scale of YouTube,\" where hundreds of hours of new footage are posted every minute. The tool is set to be made available to the more than 3 million creators in the YouTube Partner Program by the end of January, Hanif said. \"We do well when creators do well,\" Hanif told CNBC. \"We're here as stewards and supporters of the creator ecosystem, and so we are investing in tools to support them on that journey.\"The rollout comes as AI-generated video tools rapidly improve in quality and accessibility, raising new concerns for creators whose likeness and voice are central to their business.YouTuber Doctor Mike, whose real name is Mikhail Varshavski, makes videos reacting to TV medical dramas, answering questions on health fads and debunking myths that have flooded the internet for nearly a decade.Doctor MikeYouTube creator Mikhail Varshavski, a physician who goes by Doctor Mike on the video platform, said he uses the service's likeness detection tool to review dozens of AI-manipulated videos a week.Varshavski has been on YouTube for nearly a decade and has amassed over 14 million subscribers on the platform. He makes videos reacting to TV medical dramas, answering questions on health fads and debunking myths. He relies on his credibility as a board-certified physician to inform his viewers.Rapid advances in AI have made it easier for bad actors to copy his face and voice in deepfake videos that could give his viewers misleading medical advice, Varshavski said. He first encountered a deepfake of himself on TikTok, where an AI-generated doppelgänger promoted a \"miracle\" supplement Varshavski had never even heard of.\"It obviously freaked me out, because I've spent over a decade investing in garnering the audience's trust and telling them the truth and helping them make good health care decisions,\" he said. \"To see someone use my likeness in order to trick someone into buying something they don't need or that can potentially hurt them, scared everything about me in that situation.\"AI video generation tools like Google's Veo 3 and OpenAI's Sora have made it significantly easier to create deepfakes of celebrities and creators like Varshavski. That's because their likeness is frequently featured in the data sets used by tech companies to train their AI models. Veo 3 is trained on a subset of the more than 20 billion videos uploaded to YouTube, CNBC reported in July. That could include several hundred hours of video from Varshavski.Deepfakes have \"become more widespread and proliferative,\" Varshavski said. \"I've seen full-on channels created weaponizing these types of AI deep fakes, whether it was for tricking people to buy a product or strictly to bully someone.\"At the moment, creators have no way to monetize unauthorized use of their likeness, unlike the revenue-sharing options available through YouTube's Content ID system for copyrighted material, which is typically used by companies that hold large copyright catalogs. YouTube's Hanif said the company is exploring how a similar model could work for AI-generated likeness use in the future.Earlier this year, YouTube gave creators the option to permit third-party AI companies to train on their videos. Hanif said that millions of creators have opted into that program, with no promise of compensation.Hanif said his team is still working to improve the accuracy of the product but early testing has been successful, though he did not provide accuracy metrics.As for takedown activity across the platform, Hanif said that remains low largely because many creators choose not to delete flagged videos.\"They'll be happy to know that it's there, but not really feel like it merits taking down,\" Hanif said. \"By and far the most common action is to say, 'I've looked at it, but I'm okay with it.'\"Agents and rights advocates told CNBC that low takedown numbers are more likely due to confusion and lack of awareness rather than comfort with AI content.WATCH: AI narrative is shifting towards Google with its complete stack, says Plexo Capital's Lo Toneywatch now",

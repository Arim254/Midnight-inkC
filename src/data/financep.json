    "body": "Chinese consumers are experiencing \"luxury shame\" similar to what happened in the U.S. during the 2008-09 financial crisis, according to a June Bain and Company report.Jade Gao | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's consumer inflation rose less than expected in January while the deflation in producer prices persisted, in a sign of continued deflationary pressure in the absence of stronger stimulus.The consumer price index rose 0.2% in January from a year earlier, China's National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Wednesday, below economists' forecast of 0.4% increase in a Reuters poll. That followed a 0.8% growth in December, its highest level in nearly three years.Prices rose 0.2% month-on-month, below economists' forecast of a 0.3% increase.Core CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, jumped 0.8% from a year earlier, easing from the 1.2% in December. China's producer price index declined 1.4% from a year ago, better than economists' expectations of a 1.5% drop, official data showed, moderating from a 1.9% drop in December. On a month-on-month basis, producer inflation rose 0.4%, improving for a fourth straight month, partly driven by the surge in global gold prices in recent months. Zhiwei Zhang, president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, said the data was distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which falls in mid-February this year after taking place in January last year. \"This mismatch makes interpretation of macro data difficult,\" Zhang said. Zavier Wong, market analyst at eToro, echoed the view on holiday-related distortions, noting that \"last January had more holiday-related price strength baked in, whereas this January does not.\" \"It makes far more sense to treat January and February as a combined read rather than dissecting them individually,\" Wong noted.     The deflation in factory-gate prices has persisted for more than three years, weighing on the profitability of manufacturers who have weathered tepid consumer confidence and production disruptions stemming from U.S. trade policies for much of last year.The world's second-largest economy grew 5% last year, in line with Beijing's official target, thanks to resilient export growth to non-U.S. markets. China has struggled to shake deflationary pressure since the end of the pandemic, weighed down by a prolonged property downturn and uncertain job-market prospects. Authorities have sought to curb price wars across industries, where overcapacity has fueled a glut of goods and forced companies to cut prices.Policymakers prefer investments to be the key growth driver while considering stimulus measures to support consumption as a \"one-time boost\" that adds to their debt burden, Chetan Ahya, chief Asia economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note Wednesday. The deflationary pressure and property slump have led China's fiscal revenue-to-GDP ratio to decline by 4.8 percentage points since 2021, to 17.2%. Meanwhile, the public debt-to-GDP ratio has expanded by 40 percentage points since 2019, to 116% in 2025, according to the Wall Street bank.That is still lower than the U.S. federal debt-to-GDP ratio of 124% in 2025, according to official data. Top policymakers are expected to unveil economic targets for the year at a parliamentary meeting next month. In a policy report on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China reiterated its determination to implement \"appropriately loose\" monetary policies to shore up the economy and guide prices towards \"a reasonable recovery.\" ",

    "body": "Elon Musk announced his new company xAI which he says has the goal to understand the true nature of the universe. Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI has lost its second co-founder in two days.Influential researcher Jimmy Ba on Tuesday announced his departure in a post on X, thanking Musk and writing that he was, \"Grateful to have helped cofound at the start.\"Ba's departure comes just one day after fellow co-founder Tony Wu announced his own exit from xAI, which merged with Musk's aerospace company SpaceX earlier this month. The xAI co-founder exodus comes as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year. A University of Toronto professor, Ba was credited for critical research that influenced the company's Grok version 4 AI models. Besides Ba and Wu, other co-founders including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy, have also departed Musk's artificial intelligence venture. Greg Yang announced last month that he would be stepping back from his role to focus on his battle with Lyme disease.The record-setting, all-stock deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire his social network X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The departures also come as xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S. The probes were initiated after the company's Grok AI chatbot and image generator allowed mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.WATCH: SpaceX deal to aquire xAI 'adresses critical bottlenecks around AI', says Baillie Gifford Tim Garrat",

    "body": "Kraft Heinz in September 2025 announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesKraft Heinz on Wednesday said it is pausing work on its previously announced plans to split the company. CEO Steve Cahillane, who joined Kraft Heinz in January, said in a statement that many of the company's issues are \"fixable and within our control.\"\"My number one priority is returning the business to profitable growth, which will require ensuring all resources are fully focused on the execution of our operating plan,\" he said. \"As a result, we believe it is prudent to pause work related to the separation and we will no longer incur related dis-synergies this year.\"Shares of the company fell roughly 7% in premarket trading.Kraft Heinz also plans to invest $600 million to fuel a turnaround of its U.S. business. The company plans to spend the money on its marketing, sales, and research and development. The investment will also go toward \"product superiority and select pricing,\" according to Cahillane.In September, the company announced plans to break up, reversing much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world. While investors originally cheered the merger, the luster faded as the combined company's U.S. sales slipped, and it wrote down many of its iconic brands, like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House. For at least six years, Kraft Heinz has been in turnaround mode, trying to revive its U.S. business.Warren Buffett, who helped mastermind the deal, said that he was disappointed in the decision to split. Berkshire Hathaway has since taken a formal step toward unwinding its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz.In December, Kraft Heinz announced Cahillane's hiring. He previously led Kellogg through its own breakup and then headed Kellanova, itself a spinoff, until its sale to Mars. The announcement Wednesday came alongside Kraft Heinz's quarterly earnings release. The company's earnings topped Wall Street's estimates, but its revenue fell short of analysts' projections.",

    "body": "A researcher works in the lab at the Moderna Inc. headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, on Tuesday, March 26, 2024.Adam Glanzman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Food and Drug Administration has refused to start a review of Moderna's application for its experimental flu shot, the company announced Tuesday, in another sign of the Trump administration's influence on tightening vaccine regulations in the U.S. The company's stock fell roughly 7% in after-hours trading Tuesday.Moderna said the move is inconsistent with previous feedback from the agency from before it submitted the application and started phase three trials on the shot, called mRNA-1010. The drugmaker said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to \"understand the path forward.\" Moderna noted that the agency did not identify any specific safety or efficacy issues with the vaccine, but instead objected to the study design, despite previously approving it. The company added that the move won't impact its 2026 financial guidance.Moderna's jab showed positive phase three data last year, meeting all of the trial goals. At the time, Moderna said the stand-alone flu shot was key to its efforts to advance a combination vaccine targeting both influenza and Covid-19.The announcement follows sweeping changes to U.S. immunization policy over the past year under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic. Moderna on Tuesday specifically pointed to the FDA's top vaccine regulator, Vinay Prasad, who returned to the agency in August after being ousted. Prasad, who heads the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, has been vocal about tightening regulations for vaccines and recently linked child deaths to Covid shots. In a letter signed by Prasad on Feb. 3, he said the sole reason why the FDA refused to review the application was because of how the clinical trial on the shot was designed.The agency specifically took issue with Moderna's decision to compare its product to a standard, approved flu shot, arguing that it \"does not reflect the best-available standard of care.\" As a result, the FDA said the study did not meet its definition of an \"adequate and well-controlled\" trial.Moderna disputes that reasoning, noting that FDA rules and guidance do not actually require trials to use the most advanced or highest-dose vaccine as a comparator in clinical studies. \"This decision by CBER, which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America's leadership in developing innovative medicines,\" Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a release. \"It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.\"Moderna said it expects the earliest approval for its flu shot to be in late 2026 or late 2027, pending regulatory reviews in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia. The FDA said it does not comment on regulatory communications to individual sponsors.",

The company quit Venezuela in 2022 but the Trump administration has urged oil majors to return since the U.S. military operation to seize the country's president, Nicolás Maduro, on Jan. 3.Speaking on Wednesday, TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné told reporters the company quit the country \"because it clashed with our strategy. It was too expensive and too polluting and that is still the case.\" The comments were reported by Reuters.A spokesperson for TotalEnergies was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.The Trump administration has called on U.S. energy giants to invest $100 billion to rebuild Venezuela's oil industry.Trump has pledged to support American oil companies that invest in Venezuela with government security assistance, saying last month that energy firms previously had problems \"because they didn't have Trump as a president.\"Venezuela boasts the world's largest oil reserves but some U.S. oil firms have expressed caution about rushing to re-enter — including Exxon Mobil.Read moreExxon CEO Darren Woods recently made headlines for saying at a White House meeting with Trump that the Venezuelan market is \"uninvestable\" in its current state.Trump subsequently lashed out at Woods, threatening to sideline the oil giant and accusing the company of \"playing too cute.\" 'Infrastructure constraints'TotalEnergies started operating in Venezuela in the 1990s. Its departure followed a strategic shift away from heavy and high-sulfur crude and amid safety concerns. Pouyanné has previously said that Venezuela is not high on the firm's agenda.  \"There are infrastructure constraints, a lot of them,\" Amar Singh, global crude oil markets analyst at Barclays, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Wednesday, when asked about Venezuela's investment case. This view shows electrical towers on one of the streets in Maracaibo, Venezuela on February 1, 2026.Maryorin Mendez | Afp | Getty Images\"But even before we get to that point of the conversation, we first need to see what is going on with the regime change. How quickly can we transition to a democratic system?\" Singh said.\"We have seen some reforms already, but this is a long process and, in our view, even if everything goes smooth, the most optimistic scenario we only see Venezuelan output growing by 200,000 to 300,000 barrels per day by the end of this year,\" he added.TotalEnergies on Wednesday reported a slight drop in fourth-quarter profit and reduced share buybacks amid a weaker crude price environment.Shares of the Paris-listed company rose nearly 2% during morning deals, notching a new 52-week high.

Lisa McClain (R-MI) and House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN), speaks at a press conference following a House Republican Conference meeting at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 10, 2026 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesHouse Republican leaders suffered a loss on a procedural vote Tuesday as fellow GOP lawmakers balked at voting to block challenges to President Donald Trump's tariffs through the summer. The GOP rebellion on the vote, which failed 214-217, highlights divisions among House Republicans, a dynamic that could make it even harder for Speaker Mike Johnson,, R-La., to advance his and Trump's agenda through a narrowly divided Congress. Dissatisfied factions within the House GOP have revolted several times this Congress, forcing the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and supporting a failed Democratic effort to extend Obamacare subsidies.Johnson could only afford to lose one Republican on the measure, which would also have set the rules for debate on a bill to boost domestic production of critical minerals. Three Republicans joined every Democrat to defeat the rule.If they choose to continue pursuing the tariff language, GOP leaders will now need to go back to the House Rules Committee and attach it to a new rule.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., a perennial thorn in the side of GOP leadership, was one of the Republicans to oppose the rule, along with Reps. Kevin Kiley of California and Don Bacon of Nebraska, as frustration over Trump's tariffs and leadership's maneuvering percolates within the Republican ranks.Kiley told CNBC earlier on Tuesday that he objects to \"this idea that everyone needs to stick together to bring a particular bill on the floor\" because it makes the House \"less of a democratic body.\" \"Article I of the Constitution places authority over taxes and tariffs with Congress for a reason, but for too long, we have handed that authority to the executive branch. It's time for Congress to reclaim that responsibility,\" Bacon posted to X after the vote. The vote was originally slated for early afternoon, but House Republicans rescheduled it for Tuesday night.Johnson earlier on Tuesday said he expected the measure to pass and that the rationale for the vote this week was \"to allow the Supreme Court to rule on the pending case.\" The Supreme Court is considering a legal challenge to Trump's tariffs with a ruling pending following oral arguments last November.\"That process has been playing out. I think it's logical to allow that to continue. The president's trade policies have been a great benefit to the country,\" Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday morning.The House Rules Committee on Monday approved language that would block any House votes disapproving of Trump's tariffs through July 31. House Democrats had already planned to force a vote disapproving of Trump's tariffs this week.\"It is no secret that in private many Republican members of Congress have concerns with President Trump's tariff policies. Now some are even voicing their concerns in public,\" the House Rules Committee's top Democrat, Rep. Jim McGovern, of Massachusetts, said at Monday's hearing.\"They were just about to have the chance to vote this week to end them. So what's this all about? The White House is scared. They know that the Republican House finally, after months of blocking itself from doing what the Senate has already done, is poised to vote to end these unpopular, unwise, downright dumb tariffs,\" McGovern continued.The Senate has on multiple occasions voted to strike down tariffs issued by Trump, while the House has blocked votes on tariff-related resolutions. The latest prohibition on tariff votes expired at the end of January.For Tuesday's vote, some other Republicans expressed their discomfort with tariffs, but ultimately voted in favor of the rule.\"The Supreme Court is going to be deciding this issue by June. So there is an argument to be made to maintain the status quo until then,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, R-Calif., told CNBC on Tuesday. \"I believe in free trade. And tariffs are a big mistake. But given that the Supreme Court's about to weigh in, maybe we ought to just keep our powder dry and see what they say,\" said McClintock, who supported the rule.— CNBC's Karen Sloan contributed to this report.",

Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday it approved Amazon's request to deploy 4,500 satellites, expanding the company's planned constellation as it vies to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX.The FCC's approval brings the size of Amazon's planned constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to roughly 7,700 satellites. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April using a variety of rocket launch providers. Amazon has said its goal is to begin providing satellite internet through its service called Leo later this year. The project was announced in 2019.  Amazon's next set of satellites are its second generation of the orbital systems and they will operate at altitudes of up to about 400 miles, according to the notice. The additional satellites would add support for more frequency bands and extend Leo's geographic regions.  The FCC said Amazon must launch 50% of the approved satellites by Feb. 10, 2032 and the remaining half by Feb. 10, 2035. Amazon is working to meet a separate deadline imposed by the FCC to deploy 1,600 of its first generation satellites before July 2026. Late last month, the company asked the agency to extend the cutoff to July 2028 or to waive the deadline altogether. The FCC hasn't ruled yet on the request. The company blamed delays beyond its control, including a near-term shortage of rockets to lift the satellites into orbit, on its likely inability to meet the deadline. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company has invested $10 billion to stand up its internet-from-space service. Leo is poised to rival SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Amazon expects to spend $1 billion more on its Leo constellation this year as it deploys more satellites, the company said last week in its latest quarterly report. Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky said the company has more than 20 launches planned in 2026 and more than 30 in 2027. The next Leo mission is set for Thursday, when an Arianespace rocket will fling another 32 satellites into orbit. Amazon has booked 17 other missions with the French company.

(Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images)Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesShares of French software giant Dassault Systèmes plummeted as much as 21% in early trade on Wednesday, putting the stock on track for its worst trading day ever. By 9:30 a.m. in London, the Paris-listed shares pared deeper losses to trade around 18% lower, after trading of the stock was briefly suspended at the open. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconDassault Systemes share priceIt came after the company published its fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday morning, which showed revenues from software dropped 5% in the final three months of last year. For the full year, total revenue was flat at a weaker-than-expected 6.24 billion euros ($7.43 billion), and software revenue also showed little growth at 5.64 billion euros. Analysts had been expecting total revenues to hit 6.3 billion euros, according to LSEG data. The company also set guidance of revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% for 2026. Dassault Systèmes \"will lead the Industrial AI transformation\" through its industrial AI offering 3D UNIV+RSES,\" CEO Pascal Daloz said in a statement alongside the results. \"This is not a short-term goal. It is a long-term commitment to redefine how industries innovate, operate, and compete,\" he said. \"In 2025 and 2026, we are focused on disciplined execution, aligning resources around our strategic priorities to deliver measurable, industry-defining impact.\"'SaaS apocalypse'Software companies were at the center of markets' AI fears last week, as new artificial intelligence tools from Anthropic triggered a sell-off of software-as-a-service and data provider stocks. Over the course of the week, Dassault Systèmes shares shed more than 4% of their value. Aoifinn Devitt, senior investment advisor at Moneta, said that Dassault Systèmes' sharp fall on Wednesday is just the latest example of the so-called \"SaaS apocalypse\" trade. \"There is really a concern right now around some of those winners that led the charge last year,\" Devitt told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe.\"The earnings report was \"a weak finish and a weak guide,\" for the company, analysts at UBS said in a Wednesday note.\"[Dassault] talks of 'aligning the organisation to focus' on execution,\" they said. \"Having set a goal to grow at least 7% pa from 2024-29, the guidance means [the company] now needs to grow 8.2-8.9% in 2027-29.\"— CNBC's Hugh Leask contributed to this article.

    "body": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard speaks on the phone while standing at the edge of a truck loading bay after the FBI executed a search warrant for the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in relation to the 2020 election, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the matter, in Union City, Georgia, Jan. 28, 2026.Elijah Nouvelage | ReutersA referral by former Trump campaign lawyer Kurt Olsen led to the recent FBI raid that seized 2020 election ballots from a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center, a newly unsealed federal court document revealed Tuesday.The document, an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Hugh Raymond Evans, said that the FBI is conducting a \"criminal investigation into whether any of the improprieties\" alleged to have occurred in voting processes and ballot counting in Fulton County in 2020 \"were intentional acts that violated federal criminal laws.\"\"The FBI criminal investigation originated from a referral sent by Kurt Olsen, Presidentially appointed Director of Election Security and Integrity,\" the affidavit document in U.S. District Court in Atlanta says.Olsen worked on efforts after the 2020 election to overturn President Donald Trump's loss in that contest to former President Joe Biden.Evans' affidavit was submitted by federal prosecutors as part of an application asking a federal magistrate judge to sign a search warrant for the election center. Olsen reportedly was hired last fall to investigate election issues.The affidavit was ordered unsealed by Atlanta federal court Judge J.P. Boulee, who was nominated by Trump, after the chairman of the Fulton County Board of Commissioners and county Board of Registration and Elections sued the federal government over the seizure of the ballots and sought their return.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard was present at the election center on Jan. 28 when FBI agents raided the site and seized ballots.Gabbard's presence and the raid itself have been strongly criticized by Democratic lawmakers and others concerned that President Donald Trump is undercutting confidence in the upcoming midterm elections while resurrecting long-discredited claims that he actually won the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.Gabbard has said was at the election center at the direction of Trump. The president, in turn, has said that Gabbard was there at the \"insistence\" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.On Tuesday, two Democratic senators, Alex Padilla of California and Virginia's Mark Warner, called on Gabbard to immediately schedule an intelligence community briefing for senators on election security concerns ahead of the midterm elections.\"The request comes amid unprecedented investigations by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), purportedly to address 'evidence' of election vulnerabilities and manipulation of election results, which have not been substantiated,\" the senators' offices said in a statement.The warrant signed by the magistrate judge in Georgia authorized the FBI to seize all physical ballots from the 2020 general election in Fulton County, including absentee ballots; tabulator tapes for every voting machine; and the vote rolls from the county.The affidavit signed by Evans, the FBI agent, says, \"Following the November 3, 2020, presidential election, there were many allegations of electoral impropriety relating to the voting process and ballot counting in Fulton County, Georgia.\"\"Some of those allegations have been disproven while some of those allegations have been substantiated, including through admissions by Fulton County,\" Evans wrote.The agent said the investigation is focused on several \"deficiencies or defects with the\" 2020 election and tabulation of votes.\"The tabulator machines used by Fulton County are designed to create and save a scanned image of each ballot,\" Evans wrote. \"Fulton County has admitted that it does not have scanned images of all the 528,777 ballots counted during the Original Count or the 527,925 ballots counted during the Recount.\"\"Fulton County has confirmed that during the Recount of votes, some ballots were scanned multiple times,\" the agent wrote. \"Ballot images made available in response to public record requests show ballots with unique markings duplicated within the ballot images.\"Evans also said that auditors who counted votes by hand reported vote tallies that were inconsistent with the actual number of votes within a batch, and that Fulton County reported two different vote tallies on the deadline to report recount results and on the subsequent day.\"If these deficiencies were the result of intentional action, it would be a violation of federal law regardless of whether the failure to retain records or the deprivation of a fair tabulation of a vote was outcome determinative for any particular election or race,\" the affidavit said.",

    "body": "A 'now hiring' sign is displayed in a business's window in Manhattan on Jan. 9, 2026, in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe jobs report Wednesday will give markets a lot to consider, as investors parse through fresh data and a batch of revisions. Economists expect that January's nonfarm payrolls report will show growth that was nil or not much better during the month. On top of that, annual revisions also could reveal that the U.S. economy going back to early 2024 had generated few if any net jobs, casting further doubt on the health of the labor market.\"I think zero would be the forecast,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. \"The consensus is probably around 50,000. Anything around zero just shows you how fragile things are, just very weak. This is all happening with no layoffs, but layoffs are going to pick up. I think we could get job losses here pretty soon.\"The payrolls report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET. It was delayed five days due to the brief government shutdown.watch nowOfficially, the Dow Jones consensus forecast is calling for payroll gains of 55,000, a number that has been trending lower and would come after a December increase of 50,000. That is expected to be good enough to keep the unemployment rate at a still-low 4.4%, with annual wage gains of 3.7%.However, a number of Wall Street economists are predicting a below-forecast number. Goldman Sachs, for instance, expects an increase of just 45,000. On the other side, Citigroup is projecting a gain of 135,000, but one that it attributes to seasonal distortions, with \"appropriately adjusted payroll growth ... closer to zero.\"Wiping out previous gainsThen there are the revisions, a nettlesome problem for the Bureau of Labor Statistics as it struggles to get timely and relevant data. Last September, the BLS estimated in its preliminary adjustment that benchmark revisions for the year prior to March 2025 would show 911,000 fewer jobs than previously reported, or about half the total. The bureau will report the final number Wednesday, with expectations that the final count will be less than that but still significant. Goldman, for instance, estimated the number to be between 750,000-900,000, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a few weeks ago that it could be closer to 600,000. Every month of 2025 reported so far has seen downward revisions, taking initially reported estimates down by 624,000 and leaving average monthly payroll gains of less than 40,000. Wednesday's report will feature the first revision for December's count. The BLS also is adjusting the model it uses to estimate jobs created by businesses opening and closing during the month, which also could play with the numbers.In any event, the revisions will show a stumbling labor market that likely will get further attention from Powell and his colleagues as they plot their next policy move.Lowering expectationsEven White House officials have been spending time this week trying to tamp down expectations.Kevin Hassett, the National Economic Council director who was a finalist to become the next Federal Reserve chair, told CNBC that several factors are converging to keep payroll growth low, at least for the time being.Primary among them is the administration's efforts to tackle illegal immigration. Hassett also cited rising productivity stemming from artificial intelligence improvements that is restraining businesses' need to hire.\"I think that you should expect slightly smaller job numbers that are consistent with high GDP growth right now. ... One shouldn't panic if you see a sequence of numbers that are lower than you're used to,\" he said Monday. \"Because, again, population growth is going down and productivity growth is skyrocketing. It's an unusual set of circumstances.\"Hassett added that there could be a scenario where \"job creation lags, productivity skyrockets, profits skyrocket, GDP skyrockets.\" watch nowThere have been other signs of labor market deterioration lately.Job openings plunged in December to their lowest level since September 2020, according to the BLS. At the same time, planned layoffs and hires both had their worst January since the global financial crisis in 2009, Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported. Also, ADP reported private hiring of just 22,000 in January. On the bright side, Homebase reported that small businesses added jobs at a 3.3% rate last month, better than the 3.1% level in January 2025 and well above the 1.3% for the same month in 2024.From the Fed's perspective, policymakers look at employment trends over a period and not a month at a time. Most officials are expecting slowing hiring coupled with a low level of layoffs that, rather than suggesting a material weakening, point more to stabilization. In speeches Tuesday, regional Presidents Lorie Logan of Dallas and Beth Hammack of Cleveland both said they think the economy is progressing well but are more worried about inflation than unemployment. They also cast doubt on the need for further interest rate cuts.\"Rather than trying to fine-tune the funds rate, I'd prefer to err on the side of patience as we assess the impact of recent rate reductions and monitor how the economy performs,\" Hammack said. \"Based on my forecast, we could be on hold for quite some time.\"",

    "body": "Homes in Crockett, California, US, on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates for conventional loans didn't budge last week, and neither did overall demand, but borrowers are actively seeking other loan products that offer bigger savings. Total mortgage application volume increased 0.3% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, remained unchanged at 6.21%, with points remaining unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. Applications to refinance a home loan rose 1% for the week and were 101% higher than the same week one year ago. Mortgage rates were 74 basis points higher a year ago. Most lenders say if a borrower can save 75 basis points, then the cost of the refinance is worthwhile.

Home buyers are still facing a pricey market, and supply is starting to fall again after rising for much of last year. \"FHA purchase and refinance applications increased, helped partially by the FHA rate declining and remaining 20 basis points lower than the conforming 30-year fixed rate,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist. \"Borrowers are increasingly utilizing FHA loans as affordability challenges remain, despite recent improvements.\"In addition, the adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) share of total applications increased to 8%, a seven-week high. ARM rates last week were almost a full percentage point lower than fixed rates. Mortgage rates dropped slightly on Tuesday, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. That followed a weaker-than-expected retail sales report. All eyes are now on the monthly employment report set for release Wednesday. \"Several recent rate rallies have been slightly larger than they otherwise might have been because the market may be positioning for a downbeat jobs number,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"If it is weaker than expected, there's certainly room for the rate rally to continue, but if the report shows resilience, rates would likely bounce back higher.\"",

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesUber Eats is bringing artificial intelligence to your next grocery shopping list.The ride-hailing company said on Wednesday that its food delivery platform is debuting a new AI assistant that lets customers build a shopping cart using text or images, like handwritten grocery lists. Uber is offering the feature through dozens of large retailers, including Safeway, Albertsons and Kroger. The tool accounts for item preferences and store availability and allows users to edit selections, the company said.  \"Cart Assistant reflects how we think about AI at Uber: starting with real customer needs and building practical solutions within the app,\" said Praveen Neppalli Naga, Uber's technology, said in a release. \"By grounding these features in real user behavior, we can build tools that feel helpful and intuitive.\"Uber Eats AI assistant.Courtesy: UberUber and its rivals in food delivery and ride-hailing have been adding more AI features to enhance their platforms for customers and businesses. In July, Uber launched new tools for restaurants, including AI-powered menu descriptions and customer review summaries.Uber and DoorDash have launched aggressive expansions into grocery delivery, in a direct challenge to Instacart. Both companies started offering the service in 2020 during the height of the Covid pandemic. In recent months, Uber has been introducing more partners, including Aldi and FreshDirect. Last week, the company said it added five new stores.Gross bookings in the delivery business grew 26% from a year earlier to $25.4 billion in the fourth quarter.

    "body": "2026 Ford Mustang Dark Horse SC on display during the Media Preview of the 2026 Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place on February 6, 2026, in Chicago, Illinois.Jacek Boczarski | Anadolu | Getty ImagesDETROIT – Ford Motor reported its largest quarterly earnings miss in four years in its fourth-quarter results released Tuesday, while guiding for 2026 to be a rebound year for the automaker.Ford's 2026 guidance includes adjusted EBIT of between $8 billion and $10 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year; adjusted free cash flow of between $5 billion and $6 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2025; and capital expenditures of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion, up from $8.8 billion.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 13 cents adjusted vs. 19 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $41.83 billion expectedThe EPS coming in 32% below consensus was the company's first quarterly miss since 2024 and its worst since a 42% difference when reporting its 2021 fourth-quarter results, according to LSEG.The earnings miss was largely due to unexpected tariff costs of roughly $900 million related to credits for auto parts not taking effect as early as expected, the company said. Ford, as of Dec. 15, had confirmed $7.7 billion in earnings before interest and taxes for the fourth quarter, but the additional costs dropped that to $6.8 billion.Ford CFO Sherry House said the lower-than-expected earnings were also related to additional impacts from fires at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant last year in New York, which now isn't expected to be fully operational until the middle of this year. The plant supplies Ford's lucrative F-Series pickup trucks.\"We will see a billion-dollar benefit roughly in 2026; however, this year, due to the Novelis impact, we're going to have tariffs increasing in order to secure aluminum that is roughly the same amount of that savings,\" House told reporters.Ford's net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year at $2 billion in 2026, she said. The Novelis fire had an impact of $2 billion during the second half of the year for Ford, she added.House and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's 2025 results continue to demonstrate the company's underlying business is improving despite the special items impacting results.The company's 2025 revenue was a record $187.3 billion, up 1% from $185 billion a year earlier. That includes $45.9 billion during the fourth quarter, down 5% from a year before.On a business unit level, the automaker's traditional and fleet operations are expected to offset an expected $4 billion to $4.5 billion in losses this year for its \"Model e\" electric vehicle unit. Pre-tax earnings from its \"Ford Pro\" fleet business are expected to be between $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, followed by $4 billion to $4.5 billion for its traditional \"Blue\" business.On an unadjusted basis, the company's net loss of $8.2 billion last year was its largest since the Great Recession in 2008, according to FactSet. That included $15.5 billion in special charges during the fourth quarter largely related to a pre-announced pullback in its all-electric vehicle plans.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $11.1 billion, or a loss of $2.77 per share, compared with net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the same period in 2024. Adjusted for the one-time charges, the company reported earnings of 13 cents per share.",

Bookings grew 19% year over year to $5.07 billion, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. Net income totaled about $2.76 billion, or $6.72 per share. The company said it expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of profitability, to range between $120 million and $140 million in the current quarter. Analysts expected $139.8 million for the current period.Lyft said that recent legislation, which cut insurance costs in California, contributed to lower rideshare prices.\"While we expect this to drive increased demand over time, broad-based consumer adoption will take time to materialize and we now anticipate this being back-half weighted,\" the company said in a release. Lyft posted lackluster ride metrics for the fourth quarter. Active riders totaled 29.2 million during the period and came up short of a StreetAccount estimate of 29.5 million. Rides totaled 243.5 million, versus a FactSet estimate of 256.6 million.The company's board also approved up to $1 billion in additional share buybacks.Read more CNBC tech news'Impossible': Taiwan pushes back against Washington's 40% chip supply relocation goalAlphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-outTesla exec Raj Jegannathan leaves automaker after 13 yearsShort seller CapitalWatch apologizes, retracts report on AppLovin shareholder",

    "body": "Habits shape how we work, how we manage stress, and how we relate to others. They determine whether we move closer to our goals, or repeat the same mistakes.The same is true in our romantic relationships. Our satisfaction, stability and sense of connection are directly related to the behaviors we default to every day. As a psychologist who studies couples — and as a husband — I've seen how some of the most powerful relationship rituals also happen to be the simplest. Here are five habits that reliably show up in the happiest, most resilient relationships.1. Actively celebrating each other's good newsHumans are biologically wired to focus on the negative. This bias helped our ancestors survive by scanning for threats. But in modern relationships, it often leads to pessimism, criticism or chronic dissatisfaction.Over time, a glass-half-empty mindset trains partners to look for problems rather than moments worth appreciating. That's why what researchers call \"capitalization,\" or how partners respond when the other shares good news, is so important.Studies show that when people respond with enthusiasm (i.e., asking questions, expressing interest, celebrating wins), couples report higher relationship satisfaction and stronger emotional bonds.2. Maintaining relationships outside the partnershipFeeling like your partner is \"your person\" matters a lot, but no one can realistically meet all of another person's emotional, social and psychological needs.Happy couples invest in friendships, family relationships and community connections, both together and independently. It prevents the relationship from becoming overburdened by unrealistic expectations.When partners feel socially supported beyond the relationship, they're less likely to feel resentful, trapped or emotionally depleted. The relationship becomes a place of choice, not obligation.3. Creating 'third spaces' togetherVariety is called the spice of life for a reason. Even strong relationships can begin to feel stale when the novelty disappears. This is especially true for couples who live together and work demanding jobs; the cycle of work, home, sleep and repeat can become monotonous over time.This is why happy couples actively seek out what researchers call “third spaces,\" or environments that exist outside of home (the first place) and work (the second place). It could be a favorite café, a climbing gym, a walking trail, a trivia night, or a class they take together.The primary purpose of the third space is intentional exploration. When you regularly introduce new third spaces into your routine, you inject a sense of novelty and adventure without needing to travel or make any major life changes.4. Practicing independence alongside togethernessConsistency and support are foundational in healthy relationships. But over time, some couples begin to over-rely on one another — for emotional regulation, decision-making or daily logistics. This can slowly lead to codependence.Happy couples counteract this by practicing independence. They maintain solo hobbies, spend time alone, or handle some responsibilities individually.This independence is vital for maintaining a sense of self. More importantly, it enables something many couples underestimate the value of: the chance to miss one another.5. Staying emotionally up to dateWaking up next to the same person every day can create the illusion of deep familiarity. Many couples assume that physical closeness naturally begets emotional closeness, but this is not the case. People grow and change in little ways more often than we realize.Happy couples always remain curious. They remind themselves that they’re both constantly evolving. By making time to ask questions, they also begin to notice all the new dreams, wants and needs in their partner. This protects them from one of the most common relationship pitfalls: distance despite proximity.Mark Travers, PhD, is a psychologist who specializes in relationships.

    "body": "Dating is full of tiny money moments: choosing a restaurant, talking about travel, splitting a check, and deciding whether a gift is \"too much.\" You don't need to ask someone how much they make, what their net worth is, or how much student loan debt they carry to learn how they approach money and what kind of financial partner they might be.Talking about money with a potential partner is never just about money. It's about values, habits, and expectations around how someone thinks a \"team\" should work. What not to ask early onOn your first few dates with someone, can you imagine actually asking, \"How much do you make?\" Or, \"What's your net worth?\" I wouldn't be surprised if they excused themselves to the restroom and didn't come back. The irony is, those questions aren't even the best way to get at what you're trying to learn. Someone can earn a lot and still feel financially unstable. Someone can earn less but have excellent systems, habits, and boundaries. The goal is to understand how they think about money and what their values are. 7 money questions to ask on a dateStart with these questions that invite real answers, stories, preferences, and patterns — and reveal their financial mindset more organically.\"Where did you grow up and what was it like?\" It's a basic getting-to-know-you question, but you'll learn a lot about the environment they were raised in, their family norms, and the lifestyle they consider \"normal,\" without forcing them into specifics.\"Tell me about your family. What were they like when you were a kid?\" People will tell you what shaped them if you give them an opening. Pay attention to themes like stability, ambition, generosity, privacy, education, status, faith, and community. These are the things that drive financial decisions.\"What was your first job?\" This is an easy way into someone's relationship with work, motivation, and independence. Did they feel proud, pressured, supported, or alone? Did they work well with other people? Those early experiences tend to show up in adulthood, including how someone thinks about earning and financial stability. A first job often reveals what money represents to them: freedom, security, responsibility, or survival. It can also hint at their default habits, like whether they saved their first paychecks, spent them immediately, or used them to help their family.\"Are you more of a planner or a wing-it person?\" This is a window into how someone handles uncertainty, and money is full of uncertainty. Two people can be completely different here and still work, but it helps to know what you might be signing up for early on — before life gets busy and important financial decisions have to be made.\"What's something you'll happily spend on and something you refuse to overpay for?\" Most people have \"yes\" categories and \"no\" categories that reflect their values. You can learn how they perceive things like convenience, health, quality, experiences, style, generosity, and savings. It's also a great way to talk about spending without getting into budgets.\"What's your ideal vacation?\" Vacation preferences are just as much about money expectations as they are about travel. A \"camping in national parks\" person and a \"boutique hotel and tasting menu\" person can find common ground, but it's helpful to learn early what someone assumes about cost and how they handle it when planning trips with other people. Do they openly talk about a budget before booking, or hope it all just works out?\"When you get stressed, what do you like to do?\" You're not fishing for a perfect answer. You're learning how someone copes with stress, because stress changes how people spend, save, and communicate about money. Some people plan. Some distract. Some shut down. Some spend. The key is whether they recognize their patterns, because self-awareness is what allows us to better manage our behaviors.When to get more directWhen money stops being theoretical and starts showing up in decisions that affect both of you — moving in, splitting regular expenses, building a shared life — it's time to have more direct and specific conversations.Money doesn't have to be a third wheel on your early dates with someone new. Start with questions that reveal how they think and live, and save the hard numbers for when you're building something together. That's how you avoid surprises and set the relationship up to last.Douglas A.

    "body": "It's a sunny, 70-degree February afternoon in Los Angeles, and crowds have been pouring into Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters' home nonstop.A stereo system filters music into their kitchen, dining area and through the open doors to their backyard, where dozens of people sip coffees, chat in groups or type away on their laptops.The couple isn't just entertaining friends and family. Wayser, 39, and Watters, 42, are the creators behind LA's hottest new coffee shop, Granada, which the married couple runs out of their own home in Echo Park's Angelino Heights.Just over a month into their venture, they say they're having their busiest day yet.Like usual, they opened their doors at 9 a.m. Within hours they sold out of their pastry selection, had to DoorDash additional milk and called on a neighbor to go for an ice run. It's 2:30 p.m. by the time I arrive, 30 minutes to close, and there's still a line to order.The fact that the home-based cafe has been such a hit in a town with \"so many phenomenal coffee shops\" is still a shock to Wayser, who says they \"didn't expect this at all.\"\"I think that people really want community,\" she says. \"My guess is the part that feels so special is just the private intimacy of being in a house.\"Granada is one of the latest small businesses to open through California's Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operation, or MEHKO, program, which allows residents to make and sell food from their home. Given the cafe's instant success, more Angelenos could be opening their own micro-restaurants soon, meaning the new hottest place to hang out could literally be in your own backyard.A home-based coffee shop takes shapeWayser and Watters first heard about the MEHKO program last summer thanks to reporting from KCRW and The New York Times. The program was introduced in California in 2019 and authorized in LA County in 2024.Wayser says she didn't think much of it at first. Then, she became fixated.The couple had regularly attended a neighbor's family-style dinner hosted from their garage during the pandemic, which Wayser says felt like a home-based pop-up restaurant. They'd also specifically designed their own home, which they bought in 2019, for entertaining.Sydney Wayser and Isaac Watters opened Granada, a coffee shop they run from their home, in January.Talitha BullockAs a new mom, Wayser says she was figuring out how to spend her days with her 3-year-old daughter heading to preschool. As a musician, artist and designer, she was eager to find a new way to put her skills to use, especially with her work in film and TV up in the air as the industry struggles.Wayser says she's spent her career producing shows, planning events, managing business finances and running an LLC for her creative work. When she thinks about it, \"I have been an entrepreneur my whole life,\" she says. \"I just didn't really put it together, because it's always been my art.\"She and her husband, a fellow musician and visual artist, have collaborated on design projects throughout their relationship, including their home. Running a coffee shop together sounded like a fun new experiment.The couple spent months going through the process of getting a MEHKO permit, which includes food safety certification, business licensing and inspection from LA County's Department of Public Health. They say the $597 application review fee was waived because they were among the first 1,000 businesses in the program. The annual health permit for MEHKO businesses, which covers annual inspections and enforcement, costs $347.The MEHKO program sets a cap on gross annual sales of $100,000; businesses are limited to 30 meals per day or 90 per week. MEHKO operators can also be approved to serve as a commissary for up to two food carts, which would expand the amount of meals they can serve per week and also bump their gross annual sales max to $150,000 per year.I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works.Sydney Wayserco-founder of GranadaThroughout the fall, Wayser and Watters got to work outfitting their home kitchen with espresso machines, additional dining and seating areas, custom ceramics from local artist Amy Louise Johnson and new artwork fit for a modern cafe. They asked a friend to refer them to a \"coffee wizard\" and teamed up Chad Aaron to create their coffee menu; they also tapped local baker Sasha Piligian for their pastry selection.Granada officially opened its doors in January 2026.An emerging neighborhood hot spotBecause of the limitations around MEHKO, skyrocketing sales isn't the goal for Granada. Wayser says they'll consider shortening their hours or limiting days of service in order to stay in operation for a longer stretch throughout the year.Other than potentially launching a coffee cart or two to raise their MEHKO sales cap, Wayser says they don't expect to open a commercial coffee shop. \"As soon as you're in a commercial space and your rent is so high, it's not about community anymore,\" she says. \"The reason this works is that you can buy something or not. You can hang out in the yard as long as you want. We will be paying our mortgage no matter what.\"Granada offers a menu of classic espresso drinks, teas, and pastries sourced from local baker Sasha Piligian.Oscar Mendoza, Talitha Bullock, Amber CanterburyWayser says Granada's visibility could bring new business opportunities, like courting clients to host private events, concerts and art shows from their home.She also hopes the coffee shop's success inspires other people to strike out on their own. There are currently about 265 MEHKO-permitted operations throughout LA County.Wayser says that while the program wasn't necessarily designed to encourage new parents, specifically new moms, to start a business, it's had that effect on her. \"There aren't very many things where you're able to start a new business in such short time period\" or around a condensed schedule, like the typical school day, she says.\"I can imagine there are a lot of really qualified people that feel unqualified, and it's cool that this lets you just try something [and] see how it works,\" she says, adding that the stakes are lower without having to rent out commercial space.She's already heard from one inspired friend.\"Our neighbor just today said that maybe he'll apply for MEHKO and start making sandwiches and serve [them] out his window, which would be really fun,\" Wayser says. \"This would become MEHKO Alley.\"Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

Discovery's board is considering reopening sales talks with Paramount Skydance after recently receiving an amended offer with sweetened deal terms, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.Warner Bros. in December agreed to sell both its film studio and HBO Max streaming service to Netflix for $27.75 per share. Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV, in December launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros., promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Last week, Paramount upped the ante, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share to its offer for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal. The ticking fee would be approximately $650 million in cash value per quarter for every quarter the deal has not closed by Dec. 31, 2026, CNBC.com previously reported.Paramount also said it will cover a $2.8 billion termination fee paid to Netflix if the Warner Bros. deal is terminated. Paramount also said it will eliminate $1.5 billion in possible debt refinancing costs. Both Paramount and Netflix have said they would be willing to raise their bids to secure the Warner Bros. deal, Bloomberg reported. However, this is the first time Warner Bros. has considered whether Paramount's offer could either result in a better deal or prompt Netflix to offer better deal terms, according to the report.Read the complete Bloomberg report here.WATCH: Chadwick: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramountwatch now",

    "body": "ConocoPhillips Co. signage is displayed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAs stock markets continue to be volatile, investors looking for a stable income stream can bolster their portfolios with the addition of attractive dividend stocks. Selecting good dividend stocks from a vast universe of companies can be challenging. In this regard, recommendations of top Wall Street analysts can help investors make the right choice, as these experts assign buy ratings after a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals and its ability to consistently pay dividends. Here are three dividend-paying stocks that are highlighted by Wall Street's top pros, as tracked by TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.Ares Capital This week's first dividend pick is Ares Capital (ARCC), a business development company that offers comprehensive financing solutions to the middle-market. Recently, the company announced better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and declared a dividend of 48 cents per share for the first quarter, payable on March 31. ARCC stock offers a dividend yield of 9.64%. Following the print, RBC Capital analyst Kenneth Lee reiterated a buy rating on Ares Capital and slightly lowered the price target to $22 from $23 as he adjusted his estimates. \"We favor ARCC's strong track record of managing risks through the cycle, and scale advantages,\" said Lee. The 5-star analyst highlighted that ARCC's credit performance remains strong despite recent concerns about software lending due to potential artificial intelligence-related disruption. Lee contends that investors are not fully valuing the resiliency of Ares Capital's software-lending business. The company is focused on lending to companies in foundational/infrastructure software, proprietary data, and regulated end markets.  Lee finds ARCC's credit performance encouraging, with non-accruals unchanged quarter-over-quarter at 1.8% of the portfolio. Furthermore, the company's internal risk grade remained unchanged at 3.1 compared with the prior quarter, and investments in the bottom 2 risk grades remained low at about 4% of the portfolio. Lee noted that management sees minimal AI risk over the near term and manageable risk over the medium and long term. Overall, Lee is bullish on Ares Capital, given that it is a market-leading BDC with its scale being a competitive advantage. He added that ARCC's dividends are well supported by the company's core earnings per share and potential net realized gains.Lee ranks No. 689 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 8.7%. See Ares Capital Financials on TipRanks. ConocoPhillipsOil and gas exploration and production company ConocoPhillips (COP) recently reported its fourth-quarter results and announced a dividend of 84 cents per share for the first quarter. The company distributed $9 billion, or 45% of its cash flow operations, to shareholders, including $5 billion through share repurchases and $4 billion in dividends. COP offers a dividend yield of 2.91%. In reaction to fourth-quarter results, Goldman Sachs analyst Neil Mehta reaffirmed a buy rating on COP stock and raised the price target to $120 from $115. Despite concerns about weaker-than-expected U.S. natural gas realizations and outlook for Lower 48 volumes amid the current commodity prices backdrop, Mehta remains bullish on ConocoPhillips due to its high-quality, low-cost inventory, solid free cash flow, and attractive capital returns. Mehta highlighted that COP's management continues to target $7 billion of incremental free cash flow by 2029 compared with 2025, at a WTI price of $70/barrel. About $1 billion of this target is expected in 2026, backed by the North Field East project.\"We see long-term value in shares as major projects come online, capital rolls off, and oil supply/demand fundamentals improve,\" said Mehta. The analyst is positive about ConocoPhillips achieving its 2029 free cash flow target, supported by its four major growth projects (NFE, North Field South, Port Arthur, and Willow) and $1 billion in cost reductions and margin enhancements. Mehta expects COP to return about 45% of cash from operations, in line with the company's long-term track record. Mehta ranks No. 559 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 62% of the time, delivering an average return of 10.7%. See ConocoPhillips Ownership Structure on TipRanks. Devon EnergyAnother dividend-paying stock in this week's list is Devon Energy (DVN), a leading oil and gas producer with a diversified multi-basin portfolio. Earlier this month, Devon announced an all-stock merger with Coterra Energy (CTRA) to become a large-cap producer with a dominant position in the Permian Basin.Interestingly, upon closing of the deal, Devon plans to offer a quarterly dividend of 31.5 cents per share (up from DVN's current fixed dividend of 24 cents per share) and a new share repurchase authorization exceeding $5 billion, both subject to board approval. Currently, at an annualized dividend of 96 cents per share, DVN offers a dividend yield of 2.14%. In response to the deal news, Siebert Williams Shank analyst Gabriele Sorbara reiterated a buy rating on Devon Energy stock and raised his price target to $55 from $50. Based on early assumptions, Sorbara expects the Coterra acquisition to be accretive to discounted cash flow per share, enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), and free cash flow yield, with net debt to EBITDA leverage reducing slightly. Sorbara expects the Devon-Coterra combination to be viewed positively, as it boosts DVN's size and scale, helping it to compete with the likes of EOG Resources, Diamondback Energy, and Occidental Petroleum. The 5-star analyst expects Devon's improved competitive position to \"ultimately drive a re-rating as the Company executes on the financial and operational front.\"Regarding Devon's upcoming fourth-quarter 2025 results, Sorbara expects the company to report another quarter of strong operational and financial execution. He expects investors to focus on early commentary on the Coterra deal, especially insights into assets under strategic review and the company's target of achieving $1.0 billion in annual pretax deal synergies by the end of 2027. Sorbara ranks No. 313 among more than 12,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 63% of the time, delivering an average return of 15.1%. See Devon Energy Stock Buybacks on TipRanks.",

    "body": "New York City shoppers lined up in Greenwich Village on Thursday for the grand opening of The Polymarket, a free grocery store. The market — perhaps a nod to New York mayor Zohran Mamdani's proposed city-run grocery stores — is only operating through 7 p.m. on Sunday. But its namesake sponsor, a prediction market that allows users to trade binary \"yes\" or \"no\" contracts on the outcome of real-world events, from the Super Bowl coin flip to Federal Reserve rate cuts, appears to be here to stay. That didn't always appear to be the case. In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Polymarket $1.4 million for operating as an unregistered derivatives market and forced the firm to block U.S. users. The company continued to operate offshore, and in July 2025 spent $112 million to acquire QCEX, the holding company for a regulated and licensed options trading platform. The move paved the way for U.S. federal regulatory approval, which the firm received in November. The firm has relaunched a beta version of its app in the U.S., which is gradually being rolled out to users who sign up to be on a waitlist. Polymarket is not disclosing how many users it currently has. Polymarket and rival prediction market Kalshi are currently embroiled in legal battles at the state level, where regulators in states including Nevada, New York and New Jersey say that trading event contracts on sports amounts to gambling that falls under state jurisdiction and is taxed differently than financial markets. State regulators in Massachusetts recently won an injunction against Kalshi in court, which temporarily banned the firm from offering sports-related contracts in the state.In response to the lawsuit, a Kalshi spokesperson told CNBC, \"Massachusetts is trying to block Kalshi's innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.\" The company said it is \"ready to defend [its technology] once again in a court of law.\"This week Polymarket filed a lawsuit against the state, in which the company's representatives say Polymarket hopes to avoid \"imminent and irreparable harm arising from Massachusetts's enforcement of state gambling laws against federally regulated derivatives exchanges.\"In the meantime, customer money continues to pour in. Kalshi's CEO estimated the firm saw more than $1 billion in trades on the Super Bowl. That includes $100 million in trades coming on which song halftime performer Bad Bunny would perform first alone.The mechanics of prediction marketsSo how does this all work? Prediction markets run on event contracts, financial instruments that essentially let you buy a share in the outcome of an event. The price of those shares ranges between $0 and $1, with the value reflecting the likelihood of your chosen outcome coming to fruition.Ahead of the Super Bowl, contracts predicting that the Seattle Seahawks would win on both Polymarket and Kalshi cost $0.68, per Barron's, implying a 68% chance of a Seattle victory according to these markets. At the game's final whistle, all Seattle contracts bought at any price went to $1 per share. All New England Patriots contracts went to $0.Unlike a traditional casino, those buying events contracts aren't playing against the \"house.\" Rather, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi allow traders to buy and sell contracts among themselves, with the companies collecting a small fee on each trade. The more money piles in on the \"yes\" or \"no\" side of a particular event, the more expensive that contract gets. For example, shares predicting a Seahawks victory in the Super Bowl, increased closer and closer to $1 the more it became apparent that Seattle was going to win. Importantly, investors can buy or sell their options at any time before the event is over. Say you picked \"yes\" on a fringe political candidate to win an election at $0.05. Then, a month later, that candidate made a landmark speech that boosted popularity. After more money comes in on your candidate, the price is now $0.10. You could hang onto your shares if you think they may go higher (or actually win) or you could sell them for double what you paid. Essentially, these markets provide real-time odds on future events, according to a crowdsourced pool of people who have skin in the game. On some level this has always been the case, says Stephane Ouellette, co-founder and CEO of digital asset investment bank FRNT Financial. Some who understood the intricacies of oil futures, for instance, could suss out whether political tensions in the Middle East might boil over, he says. \"There's been a huge innovation where now we're turning these markets into more digestible information that a retail trader can now understand,\" Ouellette says. \"Whereas before you needed like a Ph.D. in market analysis to be able to figure this out.\"Tread carefully putting money behind your predictions, experts sayWhether buying contracts on prediction markets constitutes gambling akin to making a bet with a sportsbook is up for legal debate. But the distinction is moot when it comes to investing and managing your money, says Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management. \"It's that old adage, you've got to know how much you're willing to lose,\" he says. \"It's no different than if you go to Vegas with your friends.\"  Of course, no matter how convicted you may feel on the future outcome of a particular event, you'd be wise to not make prediction contracts a major part of your investing strategy, financial pros say. At most, they belong in an \"opportunity portfolio,\" says Doug Boneparth, a CFP and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. This sleeve of your portfolio, which might constitute 5% to 10% of your investable assets, is reserved for riskier plays such as individual stocks, cryptocurrencies, niche exchange-traded funds and maybe a prediction or two, Boneparth says. The rest of it generally belongs in a broadly diversified portfolio of investments you plan to buy and hold for the long term, he says. The thinking here is that, even if your predictions end up going to zero, the loss won't be enough to derail your financial plans. \"Most retail investors should be approaching investing as a long-term consistency and discipline game. That's how you quietly compound your returns over time,\" Boneparth says. \"So while [prediction markets] may be a piece of the puzzle, and I think it's a little bit of a stretch, it definitely would go into that more speculatory opportunity bucket.\"Johnson recommends thinking of prediction markets as part of your entertainment budget, the same way you might think about what you spend each month on a hobby like golf. That way, you're doing it for fun, and whether you turn a profit on your predictions is incidental, he says.\"If I make money, great,\" he says. \"But when you start getting into, 'I'm going to do this because I'm smarter than everybody else, and I'm going to pay my mortgage with it,' that's when you that's you have a problem.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a minority investment.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "watch nowLast spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide-reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most affected agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, it helps former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has grown from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor who grew up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the Bill de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the nonprofit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. More than 12,800 job seekers have signed up for Civic Match since Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers — cities and state governments across the country — that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then became a contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to give it a shot as well ... and to encourage everyone to keep their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including candidate match scores powered by artificial intelligence, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden administration who left her role as the Trump administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

Photo: Sven Hoppe/dpa (Photo by Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images)Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesMany European policymakers appear to still be smarting from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's tough words about the region at last year's Munich Security Conference.So, it's perhaps not too surprising that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments on Saturday at this year's event underscoring the U.S. and Europe's common heritage, goals and challenges have come as something of a relief in European capitals.\"[Rubio] delivered a speech which still assured us that we stand together in this partnership between Europe and the United States,\" German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. \"Of course, there are some questions which we will have to discuss, but in the end of the day, his message was clear that we were so successful in the past, and we should do the job once again with new threats, with new tests in the 21st century.\"On Saturday, Rubio said the U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed.\"We want Europe to be strong,\" he told the gathering of defense and security officials in the German city. \"We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"Contrast that to Vance's message to the same crowd last year, when he spoke of the \"retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.\" He lambasted his audience about the health of their democracies, their migration policies and freedom of speech.While Rubio's tone might have been more conciliatory than Vance's, the underlying issues remained the same, as some conference attendees acknowledged.watch now\"Of course, there were some issues he raised. We would answer differently when it comes to the migration problem, when it comes, of course, to question how we organize our legal framework here in Europe with regard to the digital services. And of course, also with the question of freedom of speech and so,\" Wadephul said.U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for its open migration policies, for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.\"The message we heard (from Rubio) is that America and Europe are intertwined, they have been in the past and will be in the future,\" the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said at a panel discussion on Sunday. \"I think this is important. It is also clear that we don't see eye-to-eye in all the issues and that this will remain the case. But I think we can work from there.\"'Europe bashing'A recurring theme at this year's event has been an earnest investigation into how Europe can stand on its own two feet, militarily and economically, in the face of challenges from Russia and China while the U.S. seeks to rework the global post-war order it created.While European leaders acknowledge they must become less dependent on the U.S.'s security umbrella and markets, some bristle at the Trump administration's more confrontational approach compared to its predecessors.\"I think there were messages for us, and there were messages for the public in America, especially their constituents,\" Kallas said. \"For me, every time I hear this European bashing, it's very in fashion right now, I'm thinking of what is the alternative?\"Kaja Kallas, vice president of the European Commission, at the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, on Sunday, Feb. 15, 2026. Nuclear deterrence is set to be a hot topic at the conference. Photographer: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOthers were even more critical of Rubio's comments.\"To be frank, I think the fact that we have, for Europeans, [been] asked to comment on the speech by the Americans, is already part of the problem,\" Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for Europe, said at the same panel.\"We should not either be relieved or shocked by this or that speech. And I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say 'I can cling to some love words I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button.'\" He said Europe should \"just focus on ourselves, focus on what we can control. Focus on our rearmaments, on the support for Ukraine, and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies. Focus on competitiveness.\"Wadephul told CNBC that work to become more independent is underway.\"But this is what we are doing on our own, and Europe has also learned that, of course, if you ask for more European sovereignty, you will receive it,\" he said.\"And that also means that, of course, we are more independent than we were in the past. And of course, we are looking for new global partners in the world which are willing to work together with Europe, for instance, Japan, India, Brazil and so on. So this is, I would say, if you are looking to a new global order, this means we keep our alliances, but additionally, we have new global partners, and this is a good future for Europe.\"",

Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.Trump has since effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil, called its government \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the move and said: \"Surrender is not an option.\" He's since said the government is prepared to hold talks with Washington, albeit \"without pressure or preconditions.\"The country has warned that international airlines would no longer be able refuel in the country due to fuel shortages. Gripped by a worsening economic crisis, Cuba's government recently adopted rationing measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a shorter working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. \"The current situation in Cuba is as serious as it has been since the 1990s, when Cuba suddenly had to survive without the support of the Eastern Bloc,\" Par Kumaraswami, professor of Latin American Studies at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, told CNBC by email.The odds are shortening that President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be forced from power in the weeks or months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition.Robert MunksHead of Americas research at Verisk MaplecroftTrump's tariff threats have created a deterrent for many nations, Kumaraswami said.Mexico has sent humanitarian aid but suspended oil shipments, as it sought to preserve its relationship with Havana while avoiding Trump's tariffs.Kumaraswami said there was \"of course frustration with the difficulties of daily life,\" but that \"many Cubans are resolved to resist threats to their national sovereignty and a new wave of patriotism has emerged.\"'An accelerating collapse' Air Canada subsequently has canceled all flights to Cuba amid the fuel shortage, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country home over the coming days. Tourism is a significant source of revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped government and the country is a popular winter vacation destination for Canadian tourists.  A Turkish Airlines plane takes off at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on February 9, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesUnlike in previous crises, Cuba's regime lacks foreign partners that can step in to help, according to Robert Munks, head of Americas research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \"Raising the stakes, the US has also limited Cuba's access to hard currency and pressured Nicaragua to end visa-free travel for Cubans,\" Munks told CNBC by email.The government's pledge to increase the use of limited renewable energy sources is likely \"too little, too late,\" Munks said. He added that outbreaks of civil unrest were possible, given that the island's domestic energy production is far short of what it needs to keep the lights on. \"An accelerating collapse of basic services will put the regime under extreme pressure to find a negotiated solution,\" Munks said.He added that \"the odds are shortening\" on Díaz-Canel being forced from power in the months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition, but Munks said it was more likely that \"the regime will try to muddle through\" until the U.S. midterm elections in November.Read moreCuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" last week.\"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.A big test for BRICS Cuba's emergency measures should be seen as crucial test for the BRICS bloc of developing nations, according to Helen Yaffe, a Cuba expert and professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\"This is probably the most important test now for BRICS … If BRICS cannot protect, defend and rally around a member, then what is it worth?\" Yaffe told CNBC by telephone.  Cuba acquired \"partner country\" status of the BRICS group in January last year, bolstering its ties with the likes of Brazil, Russia and China. Indeed, each of these three countries have sought to offer support to Cuba in recent days.The Mexican government has dispatched humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba aboard two ships of the Mexican Navy. More than 800 tons of supplies were transported by sea from Asipona, in Veracruz, Mexico, on February 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\" They added that China would, \"as always,\" seek to provide assistance to Cuba.Russia, meanwhile, has described Havana's fuel situation as \"truly critical\" and said U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The Cuban government is not going to submit,\" Yaffe said. \"The fact is, [the U.S. is] going to keep squeezing and the Cubans are going to keep resisting and there's going to be a lot of unnecessary suffering.\" She added: \"I'm a historian and it's very vainglorious for historians to try and predict the future but we can look at trends — and I can guarantee you that we were here before in the early 1990s where nobody thought Cuba would pull together and pull through — and they did.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he will  issue an executive order \"shortly\" laying out the \"legal reasons\" for national voter-identification requirements.Trump, in posts late Friday to Truth Social, said he wants voter-ID laws implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.\"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.  \"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.In a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"Under pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers.President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday advanced, 218-213, a Trump-backed elections bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. All but one Democrat voted against the proposal, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions and make it harder for people including women whose birth certificates would not show a married name to register. It now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold just 53 seats in the chamber — and one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has come out against the proposal. More than a handful of Democrats would have to support the legislation for it to succeed. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has supported national voter-ID requirements, though he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that he doesn't support other voting restrictions such as limiting mail-in ballots.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that Democrats will block the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\"The SAVE Act is not a mainstream bill whatsoever. It's a fringe piece of legislation that has now taken over the Republican Party, masquerading as election security when it's really about laying the groundwork to meddle in the midterm elections and make it much harder for people to vote,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor this week.Trump has recently said he wants to nationalize federal elections and revived election conspiracies, launching an FBI investigation into the election results in Fulton County, Georgia, a state the president has repeatedly and without evidence said he won in 2020. States are granted control of most aspects of U.S. elections under the Constitution.In his second post on Friday, Trump cast the midterms in existential terms. \"(T)hese Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT with a total of 21 Supreme Court Justices, THEIR DREAM, which they will submit easily and rapidly when they immediately move to terminate the Filibuster, probably in their first week, or sooner,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it. Thank you for your attention to this matter — SAVE AMERICA!,\" he continued.",

    "body": "White House trade advisor Peter Navarro speaks to members of the media near the West Wing of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 21, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's trade and manufacturing adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Sunday that the White House may force data center builders to absorb their costs as voters continue to sour on the economy and utility prices soar. \"All of these data center builders, Meta on down, need to pay for all, all of the costs,\" Navarro said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"They need to pay, not only pay for the electricity that they're using on the grid, but they have to pay for the resiliency that they're affecting as well. They need to pay for the water. So there's activity, action here going forward, where we force them to internalize the cost.\" Navarro did not detail what the White House's plan to force data center builders to internalize costs would look like. CNBC has reached out to the White House for clarification.When asked about Navarro's remarks, a Meta spokesperson said the company already pays for all of its energy usage. \"Meta pays the full costs for energy used by our data centers so they aren't passed onto consumers — and we go beyond that by paying for new and upgraded local infrastructure as well as adding new power to the grid,\" the spokesperson said.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinData centers and their drag on utilities are part of the affordability problem. Electricity prices spiked 6.9% year over year in 2025 and show little sign of easing. Navarro sought to pin the blame for soaring costs on former President Joe Biden, who left office over a year ago. \"I just want to assure people that we're on it, we also feel your pain,\" Navarro said. \"We understand the ravages that inflation took on you because of Joe Biden's irresponsibility, but we are addressing that with economic policy that ultimately will make wages rise faster than the inflation rate, and that's the key to affordability.\" But Americans increasingly blame the Trump administration for rising costs. As the November 2026 midterms approach, polls consistently find Trump underwater on the economy. Democrats are pounding Trump and the Republicans on affordability, arguing that everyday goods and services have grown too expensive. Democrats have taken a 5.2 point lead in the generic ballot ahead of the November midterm elections that could loosen Trump's grip on Washington, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics.While Navarro sought to blame the former president's administration for Americans' struggle with affordability, Trump himself has said he's \"very proud\" of the state of the economy. In an interview with \"NBC Nightly News\" that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday, the president was asked, \"At what point are we in the Trump economy?\" \"I'd say we're there now,\" he replied.The Trump administration has recently taken steps to address the strain on data center electricity and rising utility costs. Several states and the White House signed a pact in January urging the nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to make big technology companies pay for new power plants on the system. PJM operates the grid in some of the most data center-heavy areas in the U.S., including northern Virginia and New Jersey. Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey both romped to victories in their states in 2025 after campaigning to lower electricity costs. The pact called for $15 billion in new generation capacity within PJM, to be financed by tech companies, and urged the operator to hold an emergency auction to procure the power. The move comes as the administration simultaneously fights offshore wind projects in the Northeast, some of which are fully permitted or under construction. \"Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM,\" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said after the announcement. \"That's why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.\"POLITICO last week reported on a draft compact that the White House wants tech companies to sign to ensure data centers don't affect consumers' utility bills.Trump said last month on Truth Social that he had struck a deal with Microsoft \"to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills.\" The president added that his administration was negotiating with other tech giants and that there would be \"More to come soon!\" Microsoft pledged last month not to raise utility costs near its data centers, and to replenish water used by the centers.WATCH: 'Alarm bells are ringing' on AI power demand, says EQT's Toby Ricewatch now",

    "body": "Pedestrians stand in front of an electronic quotation board displaying the numbers of the Nikkei Stock Average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo on Feb. 3, 2026.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.While it was a reversal of the 0.7% contraction in the third quarter, the gross domestic product missed expectations of a 0.4% expansion by economists polled by Reuters.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. On an annualized basis, output rose 0.2%, compared with forecasts of 1.6%, following a 2.3% decline in the previous quarter.Compared with a year earlier, fourth-quarter GDP expanded 0.1%, slowing from 0.6% in the third quarter. Private consumption drove the modest expansion, offsetting weakness in exports and public spending, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office.Following the data release, the Nikkei 225 opened up 0.12%, but the yen weakened 0.25% to 153.06 against the dollar.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Bank of Japan in January raised its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to 0.9% from 0.7%. It also lifted its fiscal 2026 outlook to 1% from 0.7%.The central bank said it expects moderate expansion as other countries return to growth. The BOJ also said it sees a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages, supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions.The data also comes as Japan works with the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, on a $550 billion investment pledge under its trade deal with Washington.Public broadcaster NHK reported last Friday that Tokyo and Washington have yet to agree on the first projects tied to the pledge. Japan Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi meets U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.After her victory, Takaichi said last Monday that she would support economic growth by boosting investment through \"proactive\" fiscal policy, although she did not elaborate. She had earlier pledged to suspend food taxes for two years and boost defence spending to 2% of the country's GDP.Defense will be the next major catalyst driving Japanese equities higher, said Bruce Kirk, Chief Japan Equity Strategist and managing director at Goldman Sachs. Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" Kirk pointed to Takaichi's upcoming meeting with Trump, saying he expects a \"flurry of announcements\" involving Japanese and U.S. companies across areas such as industrialization, factory automation, and shipbuilding. Kirk also highlighted a document released by the Trump administration over the weekend that called for the restoration of U.S. maritime dominance and touted cooperation with Japan and South Korea in revitalizing shipbuilding.Before the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending and vowing to support households with cost-of-living pressures. Japan's inflation had slowed sharply to 2.1% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. Still, prices have remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 45 consecutive months.— CNBC's Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

Veronique Tournier | Afp | Getty ImagesThe recent release by the Department of Justice of millions of pages of emails and other documents related to the notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein has led to a wave of resignations and other uncomfortable fallout for high-profile people around the world whose dealings with him have been exposed.Those individuals include the top lawyer at the major investment bank Goldman Sachs, the CEO of Dubai's largest port, a former president of Harvard University, a former U.S. president and ex-secretary of State, and the chairman of a leading American corporate law firm.The fallout from the Epstein files and people mentioned in them has even imperiled the government of United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer, even though the Labour Party leader never knew the convicted sex offender.Epstein, who cultivated relationships with many rich and powerful men and women, pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to state criminal charges related to soliciting prostitution, with one charge related to a girl under the age of 18. He ended up serving 13 months in prison in that case, but was allowed to go to his office many days for work.In August 2019, Epstein killed himself in a jail in New York City, weeks after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.A number of the people who have resigned their jobs in recent weeks had friendly dealings with Epstein after his 2008 conviction, which was widely publicized at the time.Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not mean that someone was implicated in any of the crimes that he previously pleaded guilty to, or was later charged with. No one on the list of names compiled by CNBC of those affected by their association with Epstein has been charged for such conduct.Here are some high-profile figures who have been burned by their appearances in the Epstein files:Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem (L), Kathryn Ruemmler (C), Brad Karp (R)Reuters | Getty Images | Getty ImagesSultan Ahmed bin Sulayem: CEO of DP WorldSulayem resigned as CEO of Dubai's largest port operator on Feb. 13, after leading the company for 10 years. Documents showed Epstein once referring to Sulayem as one of his \"most trusted friends.\" CNBC has reached out to the government of Dubai Media Office and DP World, seeking comment from Sulayem, who to date has not issued a statement on the situation.Kathryn Ruemmler: Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel at Goldman SachsRuemmler, a former White House counsel under then-President Barack Obama, announced her resignation from Goldman Sachs on Feb. 12, effective at the end of June. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ruemmler was one of three people Epstein called when he was arrested in July 2019. She once thanked Epstein after receiving luxury gifts from him, calling him \"Uncle Jeffrey.\" Ruemmler told the Journal in January: \"As I have said, I regret ever knowing him, and I have enormous sympathy for the victims of Epstein's crimes.\" Brad Karp: Chairman of Paul WeissKarp resigned as chairman of Paul Weiss on Feb. 4, after leading the major corporate law firm since 2008. Files show Karp thanking Epstein for a \"once in a lifetime\" evening in 2015, and asking if he could help his son land a job on a Woody Allen film in 2016. Days before he resigned, Paul Weiss issued a statement to The New York Times saying, \"Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in  New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets.\"David Gelernter (L), Bill and Hillary Clinton (C-R)AP (L) | Getty Images (R)David Gelernter: Yale University computer science professorGelernter was barred from teaching classes at Yale on Feb. 11 as the university conducts a review of his relationship with Epstein. Gelernter had extensive email communications with Epstein, which included one 2011 missive in which the professor recommended a Yale student for a project, referring to her as a \"small goodlooking blonde.\" Gelernter has not responded to CNBC's requests for comment after Yale took action.Bill Clinton: Former U.S. presidentClinton flew on Epstein's private plane multiple times in 2002 and 2003, and was photographed in casual social settings with Epstein and the sex offender's now-convicted procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell. Clinton initially resisted a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee to testify about Epstein, but agreed to appear after it threatened to hold him in contempt of Congress. Clinton is due to testify on Feb. 27. Clinton's spokesman in 2019 issued a statement saying, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York.\" Clinton on Feb. 7 retweeted a post on X from his spokesman that said, \"What DOJ has released thus far, and the manner in which it has done so, makes one thing clear: someone or something is being protected. We don't know who, what, or why. We do know this: we need no such protection. It's why only the Clintons have called for a public hearing.\"Hillary Clinton: Former secretary of StateHillary Clinton, who is married to the former president, has said she does not recall ever speaking to Epstein. Despite that, the House Oversight Committee subpoenaed her to testify for its inquiry into the predator. Like former President Clinton, the former secretary of State initially refused to appear, but then agreed to testify on Feb. 26 after being threatened with a contempt finding. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Clinton again called for the release of all of the Epstein files, saying, \"It is something that needs to be totally transparent,\" The Independent reported. \"I've called for many, many years for everything to be put out there so  people can not only see what's in them but also, if appropriate, hold people accountable. We'll see what happens,\" she said.Lord Peter Mandelson (L), Morgan McSweeney (C), Larry Summers (R)Getty ImagesPeter Mandelson: UK ambassador to the U.S.Mandelson was fired by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Sep. 12 and resigned from the Labour Party on Feb. 2 over his ties to Epstein. Mandelson wrote a note in Epstein's 50th Birthday Book, addressing him as \"my best pal,\" and has been accused of sending Epstein market-sensitive government information following the 2008 financial crisis. Mandelson, in comments to the Financial Times in February 2025, said, \"I regret ever meeting him or being introduced to him by his partner Ghislaine Maxwell.\" He also said, \"I regret even more the hurt he caused to many young women. I'm not going to go into this. It's an FT obsession and frankly you can all f--- off. OK?\"Morgan McSweeney: Chief of Staff to the U.K. prime ministerMcSweeney resigned Feb. 11, taking responsibility for Starmer's appointment of Mandelson as ambassador. McSweeney told reporters, \"The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong,\" adding that the former ambassador \"damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself.\"Larry Summers: OpenAI board member and former Harvard University presidentSummers announced in November that he would step back from public commitments, including serving as a board member at the artificial intelligence company OpenAI and teaching classes as a professor at Harvard. The former Treasury secretary was named as a backup executor in a 2014 version of Epstein's will. Summers, in a statement in November, said, \"I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused. I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein.\"Andrew Mountbatten Windsor (L), Sarah Ferguson (C), Jack Lang (R)Getty ImagesAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor: Former prince, Duke of YorkAndrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, was stripped of his titles and mansion in a statement from Buckingham Palace on Oct. 30. Mountbatten-Windsor settled a lawsuit filed by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre in 2022 without admitting wrongdoing, and is being investigated by authorities in London for claims that he sent Epstein confidential trade documents. In a 2019 statement, Mountbatten-Windsor said, \"I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\"Sarah Ferguson: Former Duchess of YorkFerguson's charity, Sarah's Trust, which focused on improving the lives of women and children, announced on Feb. 2 that it would be shutting down. The ex-wife of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor described Epstein as \"a legend\" and \"the brother I have always wished for\" in emails long after his first conviction in 2008. In a statement to the Guardian last September, a spokesperson for Ferguson said, \"The duchess spoke of her regret about her association with Epstein many years ago, and as they have always been, her first thoughts are with his victims.\"Jack Lang: President of the Arab World Institute and former Culture minister of FranceLang, the highest-profile figure in France affected by the files, resigned as president of the Arab World Institute on Feb. 7 after leading the cultural center since 2013. Lang was mentioned more than 600 times in newly released files dating back to 2012 when he was introduced to Epstein by their mutual friend Woody Allen, according to The New York Times. French authorities have said they are investigating reports of financial connections between Lang and Epstein, with the financial prosecutor's office probing Lang and his daughter, Caroline, on suspicion of \"aggravated tax fraud laundering.\" Lang has called the allegations against him \"baseless,\" and said the investigation \"will bring much light on to the accusations that are questioning my probity and my honour.\" His daughter denies any wrongdoing.Mona Juul (L) Miroslav Lajčák (R)Getty ImagesMona Juul: Norwegian ambassadorJuul resigned on Feb. 8 after Norway's foreign ministry suspended her earlier in the week. She resigned after reports that her children and husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, were left $10 million in a will written by Epstein two days before his suicide. Juul said in early February that she had contact with Epstein through Rød-Larsen, but also said that she \"should have been much more careful.\"Miroslav Lajčák: National security advisor to the prime minister of Slovakia and former president of the UN General AssemblyLajčák resigned Jan. 31 after serving four Slavic governments. Messages from 2018 show Lajčák discussing women with Epstein, writing, \"Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl.\" Lajčák reportedly told Radio Slovakia, \"When I read those messages today, I feel like a fool.\" He said in the same interview that he had shown \"poor judgment and inappropriate communication ... Those messages were nothing more than foolish male egos in action, self-satisfied male banter.\" He added, \"There were no girls … the fact  that someone is communicating with a sexual predator does not make him a sexual predator.\"David Ross: Chair of New York's School of Visual ArtsRoss, formerly the director of the Whitney Museum, resigned as the chair of the Master of Fine Arts in art practice at SVA on Feb. 3. Ross called Epstein \"incredible\" after he suggested an exhibit featuring girls and boys aged 14-25 titled \"Statutory.\" Ross told The New York Times that he regretted being \"taken in\" by Epstein's claim that he had been the victim of a political frame-up because of his connection to Bill Clinton. \"I continue to be appalled by his crimes and remain deeply concerned for its many victims,\" he told the Times.Joanna Rubenstein (L), Steve Tisch (R)Getty ImagesJoanna Rubinstein: Chair of Sweden for the UN Refugee AgencyRubinstein announced her resignation on Feb. 2 from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees after documents unveiled a 2012 family visit to Epstein's private island. In an email, Rubinstein thanked Epstein for \"an afternoon in paradise\" on behalf of her children and herself. \"I was aware of the verdict at the time of the visit. What has subsequently emerged about the extent of the abuse is appalling and something I strongly distance myself from,\" Rubinstein told the Swedish newspaper Expressen.Casey Wasserman: Founder, Chairman and CEO of Wasserman talent agency; Chairman of the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic GamesWasserman, owner of a high-profile talent and marketing agency and the chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic and Paralympic Games, began the process of selling his company after emails between him and Maxwell from over 20 years ago were made public. Following the revelations, several clients, including Grammy winner Chappell Roan, announced they were leaving the agency. Wasserman said he \"never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein\" and that he'd \"become a distraction\" in a memo to his staff, which was reported by The Wall Street Journal. The Journal also reported, citing people familiar with the situation, that the committee organizing the LA Olympic Games had voted unanimously to keep Wasserman as chairman.Steve Tisch: Chairman and co-owner of the New York Giants The National Football League announced Feb. 2 that it will look into Tisch, a former film producer who has been the Giants' executive vice president since 2005. Tisch was named over 400 times in the files, with one document showing that he asked Epstein whether women were \"pro or civilian.\" In a January statement to ESPN, Tisch said, \"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult  women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments.\" Tisch added, \"I did not  take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.\"Thorbjorn Jagland, Jes Staley, and Alex Acosta.Stian Lysberg Solum | AFP | Tayfun Salci | Anadolu | Getty Images | Alex Brandon | APThorbjørn Jagland: Former prime minister of NorwayJagland was charged with \"aggravated corruption\" on Feb. 12 after a police probe into his ties with Epstein. Jagland, who served as Norway's prime minister from 1996 to 1997, is being investigated to see whether \"gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position,\" according to investigators. A 2014 email shows a planned visit for Jagland and his family to Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Jagland's lawyers have said he \"denies all the charges.\"Jes Staley: CEO of BarclaysStaley served as CEO of Barclays from October 2015 until his resignation in late 2021. Staley's departure followed a probe by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority into his relationship with Epstein. The regulator fined him more than $2 million and permanently banned him from holding a management role in the sector in 2023. In 2020, Staley said, \"Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey.\"Alex Acosta: U.S. Labor secretaryAcosta announced his resignation in a letter to President Donald Trump on July 12, 2019, following controversy over his striking a federal non-prosecution deal with Epstein in 2008 when he was the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Acosta defended that deal — which had required Epstein to plead guilty to Florida state charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution — in six hours of testimony in September to the House Oversight Committee. \"I testified for six hours. I'll let the record speak for itself,\" Acosta said after the hearing.— CNBC's Garrett Downs contributed to this report.WATCH: Commerce Sec.

    "body": "Seattle Seahawks Sam Darnold (14) in action, under center vs New England Patriots at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, CA on Feb. 8, 2026.Jamie Schwaberow | Sports Illustrated | Getty ImagesThe Super Bowl is ended last week, but plans for the 2026 NFL season are already in place.In the days leading up to the game on Feb. 8, the NFL announced that Paris, Melbourne and Rio de Janeiro will host regular-season games for the first time as part of a record nine overseas games next season — two more than in 2025.\"Over the last three or four years, as we've started to expand the number of games that we've had the opportunity to play outside the U.S., the last three years we've really zeroed in, and 2025 was the year we marked,\" said Peter O'Reilly, the NFL's executive vice president for international and league events.The NFL International SeriesThe NFL's International Series began in its current form in 2007 with the first London game at Wembley Stadium. For the next five years, only one game per season was played in London, with many owners skeptical about sacrificing revenue from home games in a market dominated by the Premier League.Now, nearly 20 years later, there is talk of the league extending the season to allow for even more overseas games.\"The possibility of an 18-game schedule requires more work — it requires alignment and negotiation with the players union — but that opportunity to bring more regular-season football, and in turn the opportunity to play beyond this current number of international games, is something that we're certainly considering,\" O'Reilly said.Every one of the NFL's 32 teams has played a regular-season game outside the United States and is signed up to the league's Global Markets Program.Launched in January 2022, the program awards clubs international marketing rights to help them build brand awareness and explore partnerships and commercial opportunities.Teams with geographical, cultural or historical ties to a country are often granted rights in those territories. For instance, the Arizona Cardinals have rights in neighboring Mexico; the Miami Dolphins, supported by a large Hispanic and Latino community, have rights in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Spain; and the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose owners have ancestral ties to Ireland, were awarded rights there in 2023.Ireland, the Steelers and the Rooney connectionThe Rooney family, the Steelers' majority owners, trace their roots to Ireland, where their ancestors emigrated from in the 1840s before eventually settling in Pittsburgh. Art Rooney founded the team in 1933, and those ties have remained strong through charity, cultural connections and politics — including Art's son, Dan Rooney, serving as U.S. ambassador to Ireland in 2009.\"The Rooneys and the Pittsburgh Steelers are coming home, literally, and that's a lovely thing,\" said Patrick O'Donovan, Ireland's minister for culture, tourism and sport.\"One of the first things I did after becoming minister for cultural, communications and sport was to agree to the government's involvement with bringing the NFL to Dublin for the first time. So it's a collaboration between the NFL and the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Gaelic Athletic Association and the government of Ireland,\" he said.Xavier Worthy #1 of the Kansas City Chiefs stiff arms Alex Highsmith #56 of the Pittsburgh Steelers during the third quarter at Acrisure Stadium on December 25, 2024 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Joe Sargent | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesThe Irish government sees the country's connection to the Rooney family and the Steelers as an opportunity worth capitalizing on. As part of the agreement to host the game, officials committed 10 million euros ($11.9 million) in public funding — half as a license fee paid to the NFL and the other half for transportation, security and venue arrangements.But according to Fáilte Ireland, the country's tourism development authority, the event generated an estimated 64 million euros in additional economic activity.A major TV winThe Dublin game was also a major success for television viewership. It ranked as the second most-watched NFL Network international game on record, drawing 7.9 million viewers in the U.S. — a 68% increase from the 2024 international-game average.\"It's really less about the financials around the game itself. Obviously, these games are profitable, but we see them as a pebble drop — you drop a pebble, it ripples out well beyond the game itself,\" O'Reilly said.As the NFL's international ambitions grow, so do those of other major sports leagues. The NBA has played multiple regular-season games outside the United States, and several competitive soccer matches were played outside their local markets in 2025. If financial returns remain strong, more are likely to follow.",

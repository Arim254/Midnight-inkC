It also comes soon after Microsoft announced plans to invest $17.5 billion in India's AI infrastructure as Big Tech players accelerate their push into the market. \"We are humbled to have been a part of India's digital transformation journey over the past 15 years,\" said Amit Agarwal, senior vice president for emerging markets at Amazon. \"Looking ahead, we're excited to continue being a catalyst for India's growth, as we democratize access to AI for millions of Indians.\"",

    "body": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at an event with tech CEOs and senior officials, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in the East Room of the White House in Washington on June 22, 2023.Chris Kleponis | CNP | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft on Tuesday announced it would invest $17.5 billion in India's cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure, making it the U.S. tech giant's largest investment in Asia. The company said that the investments, aimed at expanding hyperscale infrastructure, embedding AI into national platforms, and advancing workforce readiness, will be spread over 4 years, building on its  $3 billion pledge made in January. The announcement follows a meeting between Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which the two discussed India's AI ambitions. Modi met with other tech CEOs on Tuesday too including Intel's Lip-Bu Tan. In a post on social media, Nadella thanked Modi and said that Microsoft's investments would \"help build the infrastructure, skills, and sovereign capabilities needed for India's AI first future.\" The move comes as India attempts to catch up on AI, with Modi emphasizing building a comprehensive tech ecosystem and AI sovereignty. The country has also recently attracted data center investment pledges of $15 billion from Google and $8 billion from Amazon Web Services. \"The youth of India will harness this opportunity to innovate and leverage the power of AI for a better planet,\" Modi said in a post on X, referring to Microsoft's investment.Microsoft's investments give it a \"first‑mover advantage in GPU‑rich data centers while making Azure the preferred platform for India's AI workloads,\" said Tarun Pathak, research director at Counterpoint Research. This aligns with New Delhi's AI public infrastructure push, he added.Microsoft plans to use the funds to scale up its existing cloud and AI infrastructure to serve customers across regions in India. It now provides \"Sovereign Public Cloud\" and \"Sovereign Private Cloud\" services in several regions.The company added that it was doubling its January commitment to train 20 million Indians in AI by 2030, with hopes to grow and skill its more than 22,000 employees in the country. Microsoft also announced on Tuesday that it would be integrating its Azure AI capabilities into two key digital public platforms of India's Ministry of Labour and Employment and the National Career Service. India's Union Minister of Electronics & Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw called the investment a signal of India's rise as a reliable global technology partner, accelerating the shift from digital to AI public infrastructure.While India lags far behind global leaders in advanced technologies like chips and AI, the country's massive consumer market and public funding have attracted major tech players. Under its \"India Semiconductor Mission,\" the country has approved 10 chip projects with total investments of over $18 billion.On Monday, American chip designer Intel signed a deal with Mumbai-based Tata Electronics aimed at collaborating on chip offerings in the country, including on products for AI applications.",

    "body": "Indonesia and United States flags together realtions textile cloth fabric textureOleksii Liskonih | Istock | Getty ImagesThe trade deal between Indonesia and the U.S. is at risk of unravelling as Washington officials view that Jakarta is going back on the terms of the agreement, according to The Financial Times. The report, citing people familiar with matter, said on Tuesday that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer believes Indonesia was \"backtracking\" on several commitments it had made.Indonesian officials reportedly are averse to agreeing to some binding commitments made in the deal and have communicated that to the USTR. Washington believes Indonesia is \"backsliding\" on removing non-tariff barriers to U.S. industrial and agricultural exports as well as its pledges on taking action on digital trade issues. Reuters reported on Wednesday that an Indonesian official told the agency that tariff negotiations were ongoing, with no specific issues have arisen during the talks.U.S. President Donald Trump U.S. had announced a deal with Indonesia in mid-July, slashing so-called \"reciprocal\" tariff rate on the Southeast Asian country to 19% from the 32% he had threatened in his \"tariff letter\" to the country earlier that month. Trump had said that Indonesia had \"committed\" to purchasing $15 billion of U.S. Energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing jets as part of the deal.The U.S. president also said at the time that \"U.S. Exports to Indonesia are to be Tariff and Non Tariff Barrier FREE.\"The USTR and Indonesia's trade ministry did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments. Deal frictionsA person familiar with the matter told the FT that Indonesia was \"outright saying they cannot implement what they agreed to and need to renegotiate the initial commitments to be nonbinding,\" adding that the stance was \"extremely problematic and is not being well-received from the United States. Indonesia may be at risk of losing its deal.\"This is not the first time that Washington and Jakarta are seeing some friction over a trade deal. In November, the FT reported that Indonesia had rejected a \"poison pill\" clause in its deal that other Southeast Asian economies such as Malaysia had agreed.The \"poison pill\" clause threatens to revoke a trade agreement if the country signs any rival deal that the U.S. considers will compromise its key interests. Trump's trade deals with Asian countries have seen other economies in the region also push back, after these initial agreements were announced. For example, Trump had said that South Korea would invest $350 billion in the country, but Seoul said that it could not simply hand over the amount in cash. South Korea eventually committed to investing $200 billion in cash over 10 years and a $150 billion fund to be spent on investments in shipbuilding.Trump had also announced that Japan would invest $550 billion in the country, with the U.S. taking 90% of the profit from these investments. However, Tokyo later said that the profits would be split between Japan and the U.S., according to the degree of contributions by each side.",

    "body": "US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testifies during a US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on 2026 funding priorities, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, Dec. 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday that the deadline for China to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from American farmers was not the end of December as the White House has said, but the end of the \"growing season.\"Greer's comment at the hearing came on the heels of a report by NBC News showing that the pace of China's purchase of soybeans in recent weeks was well short of reaching the agreed amount by the end of the calendar year.China, which in October agreed to end its monthslong boycott of American soybeans amid a trade war, to date has bought only about 3 million metric tons, the trade representative told members of the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies subcommittee.Greer said there was a \"discrepancy\" in what the White House has described as the deadline and the actual deadline for the purchases to be completed.The most recent growing season for soybeans ended in November, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.CNBC has asked Greer's office whether there is a hard or rough deadline for China to reach 12 million metric tons of purchases, as agreed to as part of a trade agreement with President Donald Trump in October.Greer's disclosure came in response to a question by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.\"There remains anxiety about if and when China will fully follow through on those purchase commitments that were made,\" Fischer said.She noted that the White House fact sheet on the trade deal said China would purchase 12 million metric tons by the end of the calendar year -- contradicting recent comments from Greer.The fact sheet says, \"China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025 and also purchase at least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028.\"Greer told Fischer, \"It is for this growing season, so, thank you for highlighting that.\"'\"We've heard from a couple farmers, they wanted to know about that discrepancy, and it is a discrepancy, it's through the growing season,\" he said.Joe Glauber, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture chief economist during the Obama administration, told CNBC in an interview he doesn't know what the administration means when it refers to the growing season.\"It's not a term that USDA means by any chance,\" Glauber said. \"Does that mean at harvests or does that mean actually the end of the marketing year, which is the more common way?\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said that he expected China to reach the 12 million metric ton mark by \"the end of the season.\"\"So I think that'll be February 28th,\" Bessent said, during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times \"Deal Book Summit\" in New York. \"They are in a perfect cadence to complete that goal,\" Bessent said, after Ross Sorkin said data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as of Nov. 14 showed that China had only purchased 330,000 metric tons.Bessent called the figure Ross Sorkin cited \"bad information.\"Glauber said the marketing year for soybeans is September, when the soybeans are harvested and ready to sell, through August of the next year. China would be more likely to hit buying targets from the U.S. by next August, since Brazil dominates the soybean market in the early months of the new year that coincides with their harvest season and cheap prices. The U.S. typically exports more to China later in the year, when its soybeans are cheaper.But that's a far longer time than the initial two-month window the White House pitched when it announced the China framework.\"That's a long time,\" he said. \"This is not any sort of immediate relief.\"CNBC has asked USDA for comment on Greer's remarks.

Loans from the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which require mortgage insurance, however, are providing an outlet.Total applications to refinance a home loan rose 14% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. Volume was 88% higher than the same week one year ago. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 58.2% of total applications from 53.0% the previous week. Demand for FHA refinances was up 24% for the week, as the FHA interest rate for 30-year fixed rate loans fell to 6.08% the lowest level since September 2024.

Markets are now waiting for commentary from the Federal Reserve Chairman at Wednesday's meeting. It is widely expected the Fed will cut its rate, but the last two times it did that mortgage rates rose sharply. \"The cut itself is not the news the market is waiting for. Rather, traders are interested to see each Fed member's rate outlook via the quarterly release of the Fed's economic projections,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"In addition, every Fed meeting includes a press conference with the Fed Chair, and bonds have often made the biggest moves in response.\"",

Criticizing the region's response to immigration and the war in Ukraine, Trump said: \"I think they don't know what to do.\"That comment will be jarring for Europe after its efforts in recent days, weeks and months to support Ukraine, be it militarily, diplomatically or financially — efforts which Trump has frequently downplayed.Instead, Europe has had to watch on as U.S. officials have held talks with their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts on a draft peace plan for Ukraine, without a seat at the table. That's despite the fact that the resolution of the almost four-year war — and what shape that takes — is seen by analysts, and European leaders, as critical for the region's future security.Indeed, Trump's comments came just a day after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was in London to meet European leaders to discuss joint efforts to end the war. The leaders stressed the need for security guarantees for Ukraine in any peace deal, and expressed their opposition to Ukraine having to cede territory to Russia as part of an agreement, as has been demanded by Russia. watch nowTrump has vacillated on the issue, previously suggesting Ukraine would have to give up land and then suggesting Kyiv could win back lost territory.European leaders this week also discussed the thorny issue of future funding for the country, which is a bugbear for Trump. The leaders said \"positive progress\" had been made on using frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine's post-war reconstruction, although such a move faces hurdles and opposition from some countries in the EU.Trump appeared unmoved by Europe's diplomatic efforts, of late. When Politico asked him whether Europe could help end the war, he said: \"They talk but they don't produce. And the war just keeps going on and on.\"Seismic shift in an old allianceThere's no doubt that Trump has a checkered relationship with Europe and its leaders, appearing to get on well with some — such as the U.K. and Italy's Prime Ministers Keir Starmer and Giorgia Meloni, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte— but not so much with others.Trump has had something of an awkward \"frenemy\" relationship with French President Emmanuel Macron who he has both praised and criticized, and he has no natural rapport with the serious German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. Trump also appears to have a strained relationship with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron speak during a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (not pictured) and European leaders amid negotiations to end the Russian war in Ukraine, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 18, 2025. Alexander Drago | ReutersBelittling his political foes is nothing new for Trump, but what's shocking for Europe is that he appears willing to relinquish longstanding friends and tested alliances that have been in place since World War II. Europe was already put on notice last week when Trump's new national security strategy stated that Europe risked \"civilizational erasure\" within the next 20 years and questioned whether European countries can \"remain reliable allies.\" In turn, it said Washington should reestablish strategic stability with Russia. The Kremlin praised the new strategy, saying it largely accorded with Russia's \"vision.\"The security strategy signals a seismic shift in U.S.-European relations, analysts say, and should be a wake-up call for Europe.\"Trump's worldview is clear\" in the new U.S. national security document, Ian Bremmer, founder and president of Eurasia Group, commented Tuesday: \"A strong united Europe is a threat, not an asset. The Kremlin calls the document \"aligned\" with Russian interests. That should make every NATO capital sit up straight,\" he said in comments on social media platform X.Bremmer said the transatlantic relationship had been the world's strongest up to this point, but that had changed under the Trump administration.\"President Trump believes a strong Europe is not in the U.S.' interests, particularly a strong, coordinated Europe. He does not like the European Union ... His issue is that the EU, together, has the ability to tell Trump things that he doesn't like to hear,\" Bremmer added.",

    "body": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talks during a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine at the factory of U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer in Puurs, Belgium April 23, 2021. John Thys | ReutersPfizer on Tuesday said it has struck an up to $2.1 billion licensing deal with YaoPharma to develop and commercialize its obesity pill, furthering the pharmaceutical company's push into the weight loss space. Pfizer will pay YaoPharma, a subsidiary of Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, an up-front payment of $150 million. YaoPharma could also receive up to $1.94 billion in milestone payments, along with tiered royalties on sales if the drug is approved. YaoPharma's drug works by targeting the same gut hormone, GLP-1, as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. But the pill is still in early-stage development, which means it will take several years to reach patients. The deal will help Pfizer beef up and diversify its obesity drug pipeline after a string of setbacks, including its decisions to scrap two different pills over the past two years. The drugmaker boosted its prospects in the competitive space with its up to $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last month, following a fierce bidding war with Novo Nordisk. \"We look forward to contributing our expertise and resources to continue the development of this investigational GLP-1 small molecule which complements and strengthens our growing portfolio of novel candidates for treating obesity and its adjacent diseases,\" said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, in a statement. Under the terms of the agreement, YaoPharma will conduct a phase one trial on its drug, while Pfizer will take control of later development. Pfizer also plans to conduct studies combining YaoPharma's treatment with its own drug targeting another gut hormone receptor called GIP, which is currently in mid-stage development.That combination isn't new in the space: Eli Lilly's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro use a dual approach targeting both GLP-1 and GIP. In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said limited information is available on YaoPharma's drug, called YP05002. But Seigerman said he views \"obesity diversification as promising in the short term\" for Pfizer. He added that Pfizer's $150 million up-front payment reflects \"prudent capital conservation in light of the recent Metsera bidding war.\"The opportunity to enter the booming weight loss drug market could be huge for Pfizer. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s.It's unclear exactly how many people are using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity in particular. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.",

    "body": "President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed to have \"just heard\" that all four of former President Joe Biden's appointments to the Federal Reserve were approved by \"autopen,\" suggesting they are not authorized to serve in those roles.Trump provided no evidence for the claim, which piggybacks on his repeated assertion that all of his predecessor's documents that were signed using an autopen are invalid.But he said he thinks it is \"something we have to look into.\" And the president suggested that the list of autopen-signed appointees could include Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced near-constant criticism from Trump over his handling of the central bank and U.S. interest rate levels.Trump's comments came on the eve of a meeting by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. After reentering the White House for his second term in January, Trump for months had repeatedly pressed Powell and the Fed, without success, to cut interest rates, and lambasted them when they failed to do his bidding.The FOMC in September made its first rate cut of Trump's current term, and then cut them again in October. The FOMC is expected to reduce rates for a third time on Wednesday. Trump, in his first term, appointed Powell as Fed chair. Biden reappointed Powell in 2021. The chairman's term is set to expire in May.Three other current members of the Fed's Board of Governors — Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, Michael Barr,  Lisa Cook — are Biden appointees. With Powell, they comprise a majority of the Fed's board.The autopen comments came during a campaign-style speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, where Trump had traveled to speak about the economy and counter Democrats' messaging about an affordability crisis in the U.S.\"By the way, it looks — you're gonna have to check this, please — I just heard, it could be that all four commissioners in the Fed signed by Biden ... I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions,\" Trump said.Trump interspersed his accusation with criticism for Powell, derisively calling him \"Too Late\" and claiming JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon had urged the central bank chief to lower rates.\"But I hear that the autopen may have signed those commissions. If they signed those commissions — now maybe I'm wrong, but we're going to check,\" Trump said.He then appeared to address a member of his administration, asking, \"Have you checked that? Are you hearing it? Who signed it? Did he sign it, or did the autopen sign it?\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

    "body": "watch nowThe Federal Reserve is poised to deliver its third straight interest rate cut Wednesday, while simultaneously firing a warning shot about what's ahead.Following a period of remarkable indecision about which way central bank policymakers would lean, markets have settled on a quarter percentage point reduction. If that's the case, it will take the Fed's key interest rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.However, there are complications.The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is split between members who favor cuts as a way to head off further weakness in the labor market against those who think easing has gone far enough and threatens to aggravate inflation.That's why the term \"hawkish cut\" has become the buzzy term for this meeting. In market parlance, it refers to a Fed that will reduce, but deliver a message that no one should be holding their breath for the next one.\"The likeliest outcome is a kind of hawkish cut where they cut, but the statement and the press conference suggesting that they may be done cutting for now,\" said Bill English, the Fed's former director of monetary affairs and now a Yale professor. English expects the message to be \"that they've made an adjustment and they're comfortable where they are, and they don't see a need to do anything more in the near term, as long as things play out more or less as they expect.\"Where the full committee falls will be expressed in the post-meeting statement and Chair Jerome Powell's news conference. Wall Street economic commentary anticipates a tweak in the statement to harken back to a year ago with language regarding \"the extent and timing of additional adjustments\" that Goldman Sachs expects to reflect \"the bar for any further cuts will be somewhat higher.\"In addition to the rate decision and the statement, investors will be watching an update to the \"dot plot\" of individual officials' rate expectations; expectations for gross domestic product, unemployment and inflation, and a possible update of the Fed's asset purchase intentions, with some expecting the committee to pivot from ceasing the runoff of maturing bond proceeds back to purchases.Many moving partsAs for Powell, his tone \"will also likely get across that the bar has risen in his press conference and will likely again make a point of explaining the views of participants who opposed a cut,\" Goldman economist David Mericle said in a note.About that dissent: The October meeting saw two \"no\" votes on the final statement, one from each side of the rate debate. Mericle said that is likely to happen again, accompanied by multiple other \"soft dissents\" who will represent divergent views on the \"dot plot\" that indicates, anonymously, the rate outlook for each of 19 individual meeting participants, a group that includes 12 voters.While Mericle added that there is a \"solid case\" for a third cut, there are arguments to be made for both sides.\"It's a tough meeting, and so they'll presumably be a few dissents,\" English said. \"It's often hard to get the committee together. You have people who just have very different views about how the economy works and how policy works and so on. But this moment for the economy is particularly fraught.\"Even with the dearth of official government data due to the since-settled shutdown, hiring has shown signs of flattening, with sporadic signals that layoffs are accelerating. A Bureau of Labor Statistics report Tuesday showed job openings little changed in October but hiring down by 218,000 and layoffs rising by 73,000.On the inflation side, the most recent reading of the Fed's preferred gauge showed the annual rate at 2.8% in September, slightly below the Wall Street forecast but still well above the central bank's 2% goal.Inflation worriesDespite President Donald Trump's protestations that inflation has disappeared, it has at best stabilized and at worst is holding above the Fed's target in part due to the tariffs implemented under his watch. While Fed officials mostly have said they expect the duties to provide a temporary boost to prices,  the gap between the current level and the central bank goal is enough to give some economists and policymakers pause.\"Inflation is not back to 2% so they're going to need to keep policy somewhat restrictive if they are going to put downward pressure on inflation,\" former Cleveland President Loretta Mester said Tuesday on CNBC. \"Right now, inflation is pretty well above the goal, and it's not just all tariff-driven.\"Still, Mester thinks the FOMC will approve one more cut Wednesday. Like market participants, Mester saw a Nov. 21 speech from New York Fed President John Williams as the pivotal sign \"quite clearly\" that another reduction was coming. Prior to that, markets had been betting against a cut, particularly after Powell said explicitly at his October news conference that a December move was not a \"foregone conclusion. Far from it.\"\"I think they're going to follow through with that last cut,\" Mester said. \"I do hope that they signal that they think the economy has gotten to a place where policy is in a good place and they are going to slow down the cuts, because I am more concerned about the inflation risk, the stickiness.\"Aside from rate questions and the dot plot update, the committee may signal its next step regarding management of its balance sheet.The committee in October signaled that it would halt the process of \"quantitative tightening,\" or allowing maturing bond proceeds to roll off. With pressures ongoing in the overnight funding markets, some market participants expect the Fed will announce it will resume bond purchases, though not a pace that would suggest the \"quantitative easing,\" or QT's opposite.",

    "body": "Unmanned trucks transport containers at Dapukou Container Terminal in Zhoushan Port, Ningbo, Zhejiang, China, on December 9, 2025. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Supply chain diversification away from China is about to move from just talk to action.That's what Jens Eskelund, president, European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, told reporters on Tuesday ahead of the launch of a report on supply chain risks, and as businesses look ahead to the new year after a tumultuous 2025.\"Dependencies are being discussed in much more detail than they were before ... Are we even sure Europe can manufacture toothpaste without ingredients sourced in China?\" Eskelund said.Reflecting continued global demand, China's trade surplus for the year through November reached a record $1 trillion, according to official figures released Monday. That means the country exported far more than it imported, despite U.S. tariffs.\"The higher that production goes up, the higher the risk that countries will begin to react,\" Eskelund said. He pointed out China faced a record high of 198 World Trade Organization trade investigations last year, well over half of which were from developing countries. Other figures cited by the EU Chamber in its report Wednesday showed that China's share in containers shipped globally was creeping up — at 37% for the first three quarters of this year, up from 36% at the end of 2024 and 31.7% before the pandemic in 2019.A weak Chinese currency and domestic overproduction contributed to that growth, the chamber said. It recommended members \"eliminate single-source dependencies\" on the U.S. and China, and called on EU policymakers to \"accelerate plans to identify and eliminate critical dependencies.\" watch nowInvestors have heard this conversation before. During Covid-19, businesses started to realize how reliant they were on products and parts from China,  when stringent lockdowns to control the virus disrupted production. The stakes for businesses and their home base governments are far higher now compared to the pandemic, Eskelund said.\"That's actually a big shift, from you're concerned primarily about whether you have a supply chain that can physically deliver the product, and then whether your supply chain is dependent on a certain government position,\" he said. As tensions between the U.S. and Beijing rose over tariffs and trade barriers this year, Beijing ramped up export controls, including on critical rare earths, bringing into light the global dependency on Chinese production.  A survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai earlier this year found that a record share of respondents — 47% — had diverted investments planned for China.At the start of the year, the EU Chamber's member survey found that business sentiment was at a record low, with a record 73% of respondents saying doing business in the Asian country had become more difficult.Still, more than a quarter of the respondents said they were increasing onshoring in China, largely to meet Beijing's localization requirements, with just 10% looking at supply chains outside China — that is changing now.In November, the chamber conducted a brief survey of 131 members about the impact of China's export controls and found that about a third of the respondents planned to look outside China for supplies or developing capacity outside the country.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tIt's less clear whether diversification means reshoring.\"The reality is nobody is reshoring it's all friendshoring,\" said Cameron Johnson, Shanghai-based senior partner at consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions. \"They're going to Mexico, they're going to Southeast Asia.\"\"You should expect Chinese supply chains to become more dominant,\" he said, adding that companies will try to better map out their entire supply chain, rather than just focusing on specific parts. Chinese firms might be the ones partnering with those overseas factories, or setting them up. The EU trade body said that about half of its members reported their China-based suppliers were now shifting production to other markets. Eskelund pointed out that car companies from different countries, increasingly including China, have taken this approach. \"Here Chinese companies might be a little ahead of their own government,\" he said.

    "body": "Park Dae-jun, CEO of South Korean online retail giant Coupang has resigned, three weeks after the company became aware of a massive data breach that affected nearly 34 million customers.CoupangThe CEO of South Korean online retail giant Coupang Corp. resigned Wednesday, three weeks after the company became aware of a massive data breach that affected nearly 34 million customers.Coupang said CEO Park Dae-jun resigned due to the data breach incident — which was revealed on Nov. 18 —  according to a Google translation of the statement in Korean.\"I am deeply sorry for disappointing the public with the recent personal information incident,\" Park said, adding, \"I feel a deep sense of responsibility for the outbreak and the subsequent recovery process, and I have decided to step down from all positions.\"Following his resignation, parent company Coupang Inc. appointed Harold Rogers, the Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel, as interim CEO. Coupang said that Rogers plans to \"focus on alleviating customer anxiety caused by the personal information leak\" and to stabilize the organisation. Park, who joined the company in 2012, became Coupang's sole CEO in May, after the company transitioned away from a dual-CEO system.According to Coupang, he was responsible for the company's innovative new business and regional infrastructure development, and led projects to expand sales channels for small and medium enterprises, among others. South Korean companies are known for being \"very, very cost-efficient,\" which may have led to neglecting areas like cybersecurity, Peter Kim, managing director at KB Securities, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday.\"I think the core issue here is that we've had a number of other breaches, not just Coupang, but previously, telecom companies in Korea,\" Kim added. \"I understand some data companies consider Korea to be [the] top three or four most breached on a data, on an IT security basis in the world.\"watch nowSouth Korean companies have been hit by cybersecurity breaches before, including an April incident at mobile carrier SK Telecom that affected 23.24 million people. The country previously saw one of its largest cybersecurity incidents in 2011, when attackers stole over 35 million user details from internet platforms Nate and Cyworld.Nate is one of the most popular search engines in South Korea, while Cyworld was one of the country's largest social networking sites in the early 2000s. Prime Minister Kim Min-seok reportedly said Wednesday that strict action would be taken against the company if violations of the law were found, according to South Korean media outlet Yonhap. Police also raided the Coupang headquarters for a second day on Wednesday, continuing their investigation into the data breach. Yonhap also reported, citing sources, that the police search warrant \"specifies a Chinese national who formerly worked for Coupang as a suspect on charges of breaching the information and communications network and leaking confidential data.\"Last week, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung called for increased penalties on data breaches, saying that the Coupang data breach had served as a wake-up call.— CNBC's Chery Kang contributed to this report.watch now",

Pedro Pardo | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — China needs to \"accelerate\" support for domestic consumption and reduce its reliance on exports for growth, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva has said.\"As the second-largest economy in the world, China is simply too big to generate much growth in exports and continuing to depend on export-like growth risks [and] furthering global trade tensions,\" Georgieva told reporters Wednesday.She said the country has to \"accelerate\" its decades-long plan to shift away from relying on exports for growth, adding it would be \"beneficial for China, it is beneficial for the world economy.\"She said this change was \"so as not to provoke other countries to take measures to curb down Chinese exports.\"Her comments came as trade tensions between China and the U.S. have escalated, while Europe and countries like Mexico are increasingly wary of the volume of cars and other goods coming from China. China's trade surplus reached a record of more than $1 trillion for the year as of November.Its consumer spending has remained tepid since the pandemic, partly as the ongoing real estate slump has weighed on household sentiment.Georgieva said the IMF estimates China would have to spend about 5% of its GDP over the next three years to \"resolutely\" resolve property sector problems. She said this could be achieved with tighter management of fiscal and industrial policy.She added that policymakers should be more proactive on finishing construction on pre-sold apartments — and be more decisive on allowing \"unviable\" Chinese developers to exit.\"We call them zombie firms. Well, let the zombies go away,\" she said.watch nowGeorgieva also said IMF analysis found that raising spending on social support, especially in rural areas, could help boost consumption by up to 3 percentage points of GDP in the medium term.She noted the need for specific policy measures, but emphasized the need for market forces to play a greater role, especially for China's tech development and the yuan.\"What we want to see is a market-based RMB exchange rate that reflects fundamentals,\" she added.The IMF said in a release Wednesday that China's low inflation, relative to trading partners, \"has led to real exchange rate depreciation, contributing to strong exports and rising current account surplus.\"China's GDP upgradeThe IMF on Wednesday also raised its forecast for China's economic growth next year to 4.5%, based on domestic stimulus and lower-than-expected tariffs.That's a 0.3 percentage point increase from the IMF's forecast in October. The organization also raised its forecast for 2025 growth by 0.2 percentage points to 5%.The IMF said it expects inflation in China to rise to an average of 0.8% next year, up from 0% this year.China earlier on Wednesday reported the consumer price index hit its highest in nearly two years at 0.7% growth in November from a year ago.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tThe IMF said Beijing's transition to a more consumption-led growth model \"requires more urgent and forceful\" stimulus.Chinese leaders in October announced development goals for the next five years would include greater efforts to boost consumption in addition to tech self-sufficiency. Top leaders are expected to hold an annual meeting later this week to discuss economic plans for next year.IMF trip to ChinaThe IMF representatives were speaking at the end of a 10-day visit of Beijing and Shanghai for the fund's annual China economy review, known as the Article IV Consultation.Georgieva joined the discussions with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng, Minister of Finance Lan Fo'an and Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. Li met with Georgieva and the heads of nine other major international economic organizations on Tuesday in Beijing. The Chinese premier called for more cooperation and said China would be able to achieve its economic targets for this year, according to  Sonali Jain-Chandra, Mission Chief for China, led the visit. IMF First Deputy Managing Director Dan Katz joined part of the mission and met senior Chinese officials.",

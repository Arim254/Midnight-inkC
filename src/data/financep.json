    "body": "Neal Mohan, the CEO of YouTube speaks during a panel for the Summit for Democracy on March 30, 2023 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesYouTube's CEO Neal Mohan is the latest in a line of tech bosses who have admitted to limiting their children's social media use, as the harms of being online for young people have become more evident. Mohan, who took the helm of YouTube's leadership in 2023, was just named Time's 2025 CEO of the Year. He said in an interview with the magazine that his children's use of media platforms is controlled and restricted. \"We do limit their time on YouTube and other platforms and other forms of media. On weekdays we tend to be more strict, on weekends we tend to be less so. We're not perfect by any stretch,\" Mohan said in one TikTok video posted by Time Magazine on Thursday. He stressed \"everything in moderation\" is what works best for him and his wife, and that extends to other online services and platforms. Mohan has three children: two sons and one daughter. Experts have continued to sound the alarm on how excessive smartphones and social media use has harmed children and teenagers. Jonathan Haidt, NYU professor and author of \"The Anxious Generation,\" has advocated for children to not have smartphones before the age of 14 and no access to social media before the age of 16.\"Let them have a flip phone, but remember, a smartphone isn't really a phone. They could make phone calls on it, but it's a multi-purpose device by which the world can get to your children,\" Haidt said in an interview with CNBC's Tania Bryer earlier this year.This week, Australia became the first country to formally bar users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Ahead of the legislation's passage last year, a YouGov survey found that 77% of Australians backed the under-16 social media ban. Still, the rollout has faced some resistance since becoming law.Mohan said in a more extensive interview with Time on Wednesday that he feels a \"paramount responsibility\" to young people and giving parents greater control over how their kids use the platform. YouTube Kids was launched in 2015 as a child-friendly version of the Google-owned platform. He said his goal is  \"to make it easy for all parents\" to manage their children's YouTube use \"in a way that is suitable to their household,\" especially as every parent has a different approach. Bill Gates, Mark Cuban Several tech bosses have taken a similar approach. YouTube's former CEO Susan Wojcicki, also barred her children from browsing videos on the app, unless they were using YouTube Kids. She also limited the amount of time they spent on the platform. \"I allow my younger kids to use YouTube Kids, but I limit the amount of time that they're on it,\" Wojcicki told CNBC in 2019. \"I think too much of anything is not a good thing.\"Bill Gates, Microsoft's co-founder, is amongst the tech titans who are against allowing young people too much screen time. With three children, now adults, Gates openly talked about not giving them cell phones until they were in their teens. \"We don't have cell phones at the table when we are having a meal, we didn't give our kids cell phones until they were 14 and they complained other kids got them earlier,\" Gates said years ago. Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban would even resort to installing Cisco routers and using management software to monitor which apps his children were on and shut off their phone activity.",

    "body": "Kevin Warsh, former governor of the US Federal Reserve, speaks with CNBC on July 17, 2025.CNBCPresident Donald Trump said Friday that Kevin Warsh has moved to the top of his list as the next Federal Reserve chair, though others remain in contention, according to the Wall Street Journal.Previously considered on Trump's short list but not the favorite, Warsh, a former Fed governor himself, apparently ingratiated himself further following an interview Wednesday with the president.\"Yes, I think he is,\" Trump told the paper when asked if Warsh was at the top, according to an account posted Friday afternoon.Referring to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, whom prediction markets previously had projected as the favorite, Trump said, \"I think you have Kevin and Kevin. They're both — I think the two Kevins are great.\"\"I think there are a couple of other people that are great,\" the president added.Hassett emerged as the lead candidate following a Bloomberg News report. Publicly, he has been demure when asked about the prospect of taking the job, saying only he would serve if asked. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), said Thursday on CNBC that she worried Trump would appoint a \"sock puppet\" as Fed chair to do his bidding.In addition to putting heavier weight on Warsh getting the job, Trump repeated an assertion he has made in the past that the Fed chair ought to consult the president about interest rate decisions.\"Typically, that's not done anymore. It used to be done routinely. It should be done,\" he said. \"I'm a smart voice and should be listened to.\"Trump has been at odds with the current chair, Jerome Powell, almost from the moment he nominated him for the position in 2017. Often resorting to name-calling and personal insults, Trump has badgered the Fed to lower interest rates, dissatisfied even with the current pace of cuts that has seen the central bank lop off three-quarters of a percentage point from its key rate since September. The Fed most recently cut Wednesday, taking the benchmark federal funds rate down to a range of 3.5%-3.75%, which Trump thinks should be even lower.Trump noted that Warsh largely agrees with his stance on monetary policy.\"He thinks you have to lower interest rates,\" Trump said. \"And so does everybody else that I've talked to.\"Prediction markets moved following the Journal report. Previously giving Hassett about a 71% chance of the nomination, that slipped to 62%, with Warsh at 36%, according to Kalshi.Trump did leave enough space to change his mind, noting that he has several good candidates in front of him.\"I think I have somebody that I like the best,\" he said. \"I like all of them, but I want to be careful because I was given a bad recommendation\" when he named Powell to the spot.Over the year, Trump repeatedly has blamed former Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin for recommending Powell. Current Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has led the current search. Trump has made no secret that he'd prefer Bessent to take on the role, but the Treasury chief has said repeatedly he is not interested.Other candidates considered included current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman along with Rick Rieder, who runs the fixed income operation at money management giant BlackRock. They were the last of a group of 11 candidates considered for the post.Powell's term expires in May, having been reappointed to the position by former President Joe Biden.Asked at his Wednesday news conference about his legacy, Powell said, \"I really want to turn this job over to whoever replaces me ... with the economy in really good shape. That's what I want to do.\"",

    "description": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you do",
    "body": "After 41 draws without a winner, the Powerball lottery jackpot has climbed to $1 billion — the seventh largest in the lottery's history.Even if you don't match all six numbers, smaller prizes of $1 million and $50,000 are still in play.If you somehow beat the odds and win a large cash prize, what happens next can be just as important as the win itself. That's because decisions you make in the first few days can leave you vulnerable to losing or mismanaging the prize.Here are five common mistakes experts say to avoid, starting the moment the ticket is in your hands.1. Handing an unsigned ticket to the store clerkUntil a lottery ticket is signed, \"the person who physically holds a winning ticket\" can claim the prize, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery, one of the state lotteries that administers Powerball.Participating state lotteries generally direct players to use validation tools — self-check terminals, mobile app scanners or official lottery websites — rather than relying on store staff. That guidance exists in part because store clerks have been caught stealing winning tickets.To prevent fraud, you'll want to sign the ticket in ink right away, state lotteries advise. It also can't hurt to have a photocopy or photo of the signed ticket, since it can help if your ticket is lost or misplaced, according to the South Carolina Education Lottery.2. Not keeping the ticket in a safe placeYou signed the ticket, but where do you put it? Because a winning ticket functions much like cash, you don't want to keep it in your pocket, wallet or lying on a desk in your home, says George Gagliardi, a certified financial planner in Lexington, Massachusetts.\"Holding the winning ticket before claiming it is akin to walking around town with $100 million in your wallet,\" he says.The official ticket needs a secure location. A common recommendation is to lock it in a bank safe deposit box or a personal fireproof safe or lockbox as soon as possible.3. Telling everyone about winningAnnouncing a big lottery win can invite financial requests, scams and unwanted attention, says Gagliardi. It's often safer to keep the news within a very small circle of trusted family members.Some state lotteries require winners to go public when they claim the prize, which is why it can help to consult a financial advisor, a lawyer and an accountant before coming forward, State Farm advises.They can walk you through payout options and, in some states, help set up a trust that allows you to claim the prize anonymously.4. Rushing to claim your prizeWinners are often given between 90 days and a year to claim a prize, depending on the state.Rushing to claim it can prevent you from building the advisory team you'll need to manage immense wealth. Without a lawyer, accountant and financial advisor experienced in large windfalls, you risk making costly decisions about taxes, investments and spending, State Farm reports.5. Deciding on the payout too quicklyPowerball winners must choose between two payout options: a 30-year annuity worth the full listed jackpot amount or a lump-sum cash payout that is roughly half the advertised prize. For a $1 billion jackpot, the annuity would pay about $33.3 million per year, according to USAMega.com.Each option comes with tradeoffs. The annuity provides guaranteed installments with a larger total payout over time, while the cash option gives you immediate access to a sizable sum that can be invested right away. Your age, estate planning needs and comfort with investment risk can all shape which payout structure makes the most sense. Consult a trusted financial professional who can help you make decisions based on your individual financial situation.It can also help to slow down before making a choice, since \"you will be in an emotional state for a while, and one wants to make decisions logically, not emotionally,\" says John Loyd, a certified financial planner in Texas.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A tract of new tightly packed homes are viewed along the Boulder City Parkway on January 11, 2022 in Henderson, Nevada.George Rose | Getty ImagesHome values have been losing ground for much of this year, with previously huge annual gains shrinking to nothing. The result is that homeowners are losing equity.Borrower equity fell 2.1% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, or a collective $373.8 billion, according to a report from Cotality. This comes after years of steep gains in home prices and record equity. Even after the drop, homeowners still have an overall collective net equity of $17.1 trillion for homes with a mortgage. For the average homeowner, the third-quarter equity declines translate to a loss of $13,400. In addition, the number of homes in a negative equity position, meaning they are worth less than the mortgage on them, increased by 21% from a year ago to 1.2 million. \"As the pace of home price growth slows and markets recalibrate from pandemic peaks, we're seeing a clear shift in equity trends,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"Negative equity is on the rise, driven in part by affordability challenges that have led many first-time and lower-income buyers to over-leverage through piggyback loans or minimal down payments.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Those in a negative equity position likely purchased their homes more recently, when mortgage rates were higher and prices had peaked. Homeowners have also been pulling more equity out of their homes, thanks to huge gains in the past five years. Home values are now roughly 52% higher than they were in January 2020, according to the S&P Cotality Case-Shiller national home price index. Even after mortgage rates increased in 2023, the average equity gain per homeowner was $25,000. In 2024, it was $4,900. Not every market, however, is seeing the same dynamic. Boston, Chicago and New York are all still in the positive, according to the Cotality report. The biggest losses were in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, Miami and Houston, Texas.\"The future performance of highly leveraged loans will hinge on the strength of the U.S. economy and labor market,\" Hepp said. \"Even as expectations for continued price appreciation and economic resilience persist, it remains critical to closely monitor these loans in the months ahead.\"",

    "body": "Oracle CEO Clay Magouyrk appears on a media tour of the Stargate AI data center in Abilene, Texas, on Sept. 23, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOracle on Friday pushed back against a report that said the company will complete data centers for OpenAI, one of its major customers, in 2028, rather than 2027.The delay is due to a shortage of labor and materials, according to the Friday report from Bloomberg, which cited unnamed people. Oracle shares closed down more than 4% on Friday. \"Site selection and delivery timelines were established in close coordination with OpenAI following execution of the agreement and were jointly agreed,\" an Oracle spokesperson said in an email to CNBC. \"There have been no delays to any sites required to meet our contractual commitments, and all milestones remain on track.\"The Oracle spokesperson did not specify a timeline for turning on cloud computing infrastructure for OpenAI. In September, OpenAI said it had a partnership with Oracle worth more than $300 billion over the next five years. \"We have a good relationship with OpenAI,\" Clay Magouyrk, one of Oracle's two newly appointed CEOs, said at an October analyst meeting.Doing business with OpenAI is relatively new to 48-year-old Oracle. Historically, Oracle grew through sales of its database software and business applications. Its cloud infrastructure business now contributes over one-fourth of revenue, although Oracle remains a smaller hyperscaler than Amazon, Microsoft and Google. OpenAI has also made commitments to other companies as it looks to meet expected capacity needs. In September, Nvidia said it had signed a letter of intent with OpenAI to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia equipment for the San Francisco artificial intelligence startup. The first phase of that project is expected in the second half of 2026.Nvidia and OpenAI said in a September statement that they \"look forward to finalizing the details of this new phase of strategic partnership in the coming weeks.\"But no announcement has come yet.In a November filing, Nvidia said \"there is no assurance that we will enter into definitive agreements with respect to the OpenAI opportunity.\"OpenAI has historically relied on Nvidia graphics processing units to operate ChatGPT and other products, and now it's also looking at designing custom chips in a collaboration with Broadcom. On Thursday, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan laid out a timeline for the OpenAI work, which was announced in October. Broadcom and OpenAI said they had signed a term sheet.\"It's more like 2027, 2028, 2029, 10 gigawatts, that was the OpenAI discussion,\" Tan said on Broadcom's earnings call. \"And that's, I call it, an agreement, an alignment of where we're headed with respect to a very respected and valued customer, OpenAI. But we do not expect much in 2026.\"OpenAI declined to comment.WATCH: Oracle says there have been 'no delays' in OpenAI arrangement after stock slidewatch now",

    "body": "Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee on Friday explained why he voted against this week's interest rate cut, telling CNBC that policymakers should have waited until they had more information before easing further.\"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today,\" the central banker said during a \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"But I've just been uncomfortable front-loading too many rate cuts and assuming that what we've seen in inflation will be transitory.\"Goolsbee was one of three Federal Open Market Committee members to vote against the quarter percentage point reduction, the third consecutive easing measure. He was joined by Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, as well as Governor Stephen Miran, who preferred a steeper cut.While he has said in the past he sees room for rates to come down further, Goolsbee said a lack of progress on inflation argued against moving now.Recent readings show the annual inflation rate around 2.8%, well above the Fed's 2% target.\"There's no way around we've been four and a half years above the inflation target, and the last six months have shown no progress,\" Goolsbee said. \"Right before the lights went out [for the government shutdown], you saw a couple of relatively disturbing readings on services inflation. I just want to make sure that if we believe that this is transitory, let's not just put all our eggs in.\"\"While I voted to lower rates at the September and October meetings, I believe we should have waited to get more data, especially about inflation, before lowering rates further,\" the policymaker said in a post on the Chicago Fed's website.Goolsbee will not be a voter on the FOMC in 2026 but will still participate in meetings.\"Given that inflation has been above our target for four and a half years, further progress on it has been stalled for several months, and almost all the businesspeople and consumers we have spoken to in the district lately identify prices as a main concern, I felt the more prudent course would have been to wait for more information.\" he wrote in a post on the Chicago Fed website. In the CNBC interview, he elaborated on his misgivings about cutting. While other Fed officials have expressed concern about the weakening labor market, Goolsbee said data has shown conditions to be \"pretty stable.\"\"I'm pretty optimistic that for 2026 rates will will be able to be a fair bit lower than they are today. But I've just been uncomfortable front loading too many rate cuts,\" he said in the interview. \"We don't take a lot of extra risk, in my view, to just wait to Q1 2026, and make sure that we're back on path at 2% inflation.\"The FOMC on Wednesday voted to lower its benchmark rate to a range between 3.5%-3.75%. In his post-meeting news conference, Chair Jerome Powell expressed worry that the labor market looks weaker than the headline numbers suggest, saying he expects official nonfarm payroll counts to be lowered and show losses in recent months.For his part, Goolsbee said he is \"one of the most optimistic people\" that rates will be lower in the year ahead.Schmid also released a statement Friday explaining his dissent. He also voted against a rate cut in October.\"Inflation remains too high, the economy shows continued momentum, and the labor market—though cooling—remains largely in balance,\" Schmid said. \"I view the current stance of monetary policy as being only modestly, if at all, restrictive. With this assessment, my preference was to leave the target range for the policy rate unchanged at this week's meeting.\"Earlier Friday morning, Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson, who will vote in 2026, said she views policy as \"somewhat restrictive\" and is more worried about unemployment than inflation.Also, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said she would prefer policy \"on a slightly more restrictive stance\" to guard against higher inflation, according to Reuters.In total, six of the 19 participants at the Fed meeting indicated they opposed the cut, though only two were voters.",

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersBroadcom's quarterly results and guidance sailed past Wall Street estimates. It didn't matter. The chipmaker's shares plummeted 11% on Friday, their worst day since January, as investors ran for the exits on the artificial intelligence trade. Oracle dropped 4.5% a day after plunging 10% following its earnings report. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, the two leading makers of graphics processing units for AI workloads, slid about 3% and 5%, respectively. AI has been the driver for the stock market and the broader economy this year, so any negative sentiment has potentially far-reaching consequences. The Nasdaq on Friday fell about 1.69%, and the S&P 500 declined by 1%. The companies getting hit the hardest are the ones most closely tied to AI infrastructure, which has been booming as hyperscalers build out their data centers to try and meet what they describe as insatiable demand for compute-intensive AI services. Broadcom makes custom chips for many of the the largest tech companies, and saw its market cap about double each of the past two years before rallying again in 2025.\"This stock is up 75-80% year to date. You're seeing a little bit of a pullback,\" Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at Mizuho, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Friday. \"We would be buyers on this pullback.\"Mizuho raised its price target on the stock to $450 from $435. It closed on Friday just below $360. \"This is still where the growth is,\" Rakesh said. \"They are still the big supplier to Google on their entire hardware stack, to Meta, to Anthropic and even OpenAI coming down the road.\" Broadcom reported revenue growth of 28% during the quarter, largely due to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, to a total of $18.02 billion, topping the $17.49 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.95 adjusted topped the $1.86 average estimate.watch nowCEO Hock Tan said Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.One concern among investors is that margins are coming down, at least in the short term, due to higher up-front costs. CFO Kirsten Spears said on the earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of Broadcom's AI chip systems because the company will have to buy more parts to produce the server racks. Broadcom also said it had a $73 billion backlog of AI orders over the next 18 months. Part of that is from $21 billion of orders from Anthropic, which the company revealed as a key customer on Thursday.While OpenAI has been a highly touted customer following a multibillion-dollar agreement announced in October, Tan doused some hope for the deal, telling investors late Thursday that, \"We do not expect much in '26.\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note on Friday that \"AI angst\" was driving Broadcom's shares lower.\"Frankly we aren't sure what else one could desire as the company's AI story continues to not only overdeliver but is doing it at an accelerating rate,\" Rasgon, who recommends buying the stock and raised his price target, wrote in the note. Oracle has been facing more extreme skepticism. The stock is now down more than 40% from its record reached in September. The company beat on earnings but missed on revenue in its report on Wednesday, and investors were disappointed they didn't get more detail on how Oracle will finance its massive buildout that so far has required mounds of debt. CoreWeave, which is investing in data centers to offer cloud-based AI services, sank 10% on Friday and has lost more than half its value since peaking in June.

    "body": "Open AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session with SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son at  an event titled \"Transforming Business through AI\" in Tokyo, Japan, on February 03, 2025. Tomohiro Ohsumi | Getty ImagesOn Dec. 11, 2015, OpenAI launched as a nonprofit research lab after Elon Musk and a group of prominent techies, including Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman, pledged $1 billion to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity. The idea was for the project to be be free of commercial pressures and the pursuit of money. A decade later, that founding mission is all but forgotten. Musk, now the world's richest person, is long gone, having created rival startup xAI. And he's been engaged in a heated legal and public relations fight with OpenAI CEO and co-founder Sam Altman. Far from the nonprofit realm, OpenAI has emerged as one of the fastest-growing commercial entities on the planet, zooming to a $500 billion private market valuation, with almost all of that value accruing since the company's launch of ChatGPT three years ago. More than 800 million people now use the chatbot every week. Musk's xAI, meanwhile, is expected to close a $15 billion round at a $230 billion pre-money valuation this month, sources familiar with the matter told CNBC's David Faber in late November.OpenAI and xAI are two of the main companies, along with Google, Anthropic and Meta, pouring money into AI models, as the market rapidly evolves from text-based chatbots to AI-generated videos and more advanced compute-intensive forms of content, as well as into agentic AI, with large enterprises customizing tools to enhance productivity. For OpenAI, the price tag is almost incomprehensible: $1.4 trillion and growing. That's primarily for the mammoth data centers and high-powered chips required to meet what the company sees as insatiable demand for its technology. For now, OpenAI is a cash-burning machine going up against tech's megacaps and their chip suppliers, drawing comparisons to earlier waves of high-growth tech firms that spent heavily for years to challenge behemoth incumbents, but to mixed results.\"OpenAI has a very big role in the in the history of the development of artificial intelligence, and will forever have that role,\" said Gil Luria, an equity analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview. \"Now, will that role be Netscape, or will it be Google? We've yet to find out.\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks at an event ahead of the COMPUTEX forum, in Taipei, Taiwan, June 2, 2024.Ann Wang | ReutersIt's a position that would've been hard to imagine in 2016, when Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hauled a black DGX-1 supercomputer up to OpenAI's offices in San Francisco's Mission District. The $300,000 machine had cost Nvidia \"a few billion dollars\" to develop, and there were no other buyers, Huang recalled recently on Joe Rogan's podcast.  Musk, at OpenAI, was the only one who wanted it.When Musk told him it was for \"a nonprofit company,\" Huang said all the blood drained from his face at the thought of parking such a costly box inside an organization that wasn't meant to make money.Behind the scenes, though, the nonprofit ideal was already under intense strain, and Musk didn't like what he saw. \"Guys, I've had enough. This is the final straw,\" Musk wrote in an email to his co-founders in 2017. He warned that he would \"no longer fund OpenAI\" if it turned into a tech startup instead of a nonprofit. Altman wrote back the next morning: \"i remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!\"Altman vs. MuskIn February of the following year, Musk left the OpenAI board, and said at the time the move was to avoid a potential conflict of interest as his car company, Tesla, dove deeper into AI. The story was more complicated.Musk sued OpenAI and Altman in early 2024, alleging they abandoned the company's founding mission to develop AI \"for the benefit of humanity broadly,\" and he's regularly criticized OpenAI's close ties to Microsoft, its principal backer. He also went to court to try and keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit entity and, earlier this year, went so far as to try and acquire the AI lab for $97.4 billion. In October, OpenAI announced it had completed a recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business, which is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.watch nowMusk isn't the only early OpenAI team member who's turned into a bitter rival. Siblings Dario and Daniela Amodei left OpenAI in late 2020 to form Anthropic, which said last month that Microsoft and Nvidia would invest in the company. The valuation from the funding round could reach as high as $350 billion.Anthropic's Claude family of large language models is one of the biggest competitors to OpenAI's GPT models. Altman is wagering that he can win the race by outspending the competition. While his company has sketched out plans for a trillion-dollar-plus AI infrastructure outlay, Anthropic has made roughly $100 billion in recent compute commitments, spaced out at various intervals over the next few years.It all amounts to a giant bet that demand for AI services will continue apace. \"We've got all the various AI vendors making these huge capital investments,\" said David Menninger, executive director of software research at ISG. \"There's a question as to how long those capital investments continue and whether or not they all pan out.\"Luria says Anthropic and others are making reasonable commitments based on their current growth trajectory and the funding they've already secured. But he said OpenAI's approach has been based on a \"fantastical set of commitments\" with a \"faint belief that those numbers are even possible.\" 'Pretty extreme'Altman told CNBC in an interview on Thursday that OpenAI is already seeing enough demand to justify its spending plans, which \"makes us confident that we will be able to significantly ramp revenue.\"\"It's obviously unusual to be growing this fast at this kind of scale, but it is what we see in our current data,\" Altman said, adding that \"the demand in the market is pretty extreme.\" Altman said last month that he expects annualized revenue to hit $20 billion by the end of this year and to reach hundreds of billions by 2030. Its historic pace of growth has been a big boon for major tech companies. Oracle signed a roughly $500 billion deal to sell infrastructure services to OpenAI over five years. Chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom have woven OpenAI-linked demand into multi-year forecasts. But Oracle's shares plunged 11% on Thursday after the software vendor reported weaker-than-expected revenue, a miss that dragged down Nvidia, CoreWeave and other AI-related stocks. Despite a surge in long-term contract commitments from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia, investors are growing concerned about Oracle's debt load that's fueling its buildout. watch nowStill, venture capitalist Matt Murphy of Menlo Ventures, said that in his 25 years in the venture business, \"this is the mother of all waves.\"Murphy, an early investor in Anthropic, said the combination of AI models, custom chips and hyperscale data centers adds up to the potential for trillion-dollar outcomes. That explains the eye-popping level of capital expenditures and the astronomical valuations, he said.Altman recently declared a \"code red\" inside his company, and shuffled resources to focus on making ChatGPT faster, more reliable and more personal, while delaying work on ads, health and shopping agents and a personal assistant called Pulse. His declaration came after Google released its Gemini 3 model last month, further accelerating the search giant's ascent in the market. On Thursday, OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT-5.2, a faster, more capable reasoning model that the company says is its best system yet for everyday professional use. It also struck a three-year, $1 billion content and equity deal with Disney around the Sora AI video generator.Altman downplayed the threat from Google, telling CNBC that Gemini had less of an impact on the company's metrics than OpenAI initially feared. \"I believe that when a competitive threat happens, you want to focus on it, deal with it quickly,\" Altman said.He said he expects the company to exit code red by January.— CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed to this report.watch now",

The order is a win for tech companies such as OpenAI and Google and the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, which have all lobbied against state regulations they view as burdensome. Read more CNBC politics coverageTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Mark Kelly faces Pentagon probe for video on refusing 'unlawful orders'Trump spoke with Chinese President XiBessent says no recession in 2026 but notes some sectors are challengedU.S. lawmakers say Rubio told Trump's Ukraine peace plan is Russia's 'wish list'It follows a push by some Republicans in Congress to impose a moratorium on state AI laws. A recent plan to tack on that moratorium to the National Defense Authorization Act was scuttled.Collin McCune, head of government affairs at Andreessen Horowitz, celebrated Trump's order, calling it \"an important first step\" to boost American competition and innovation. But McCune urged Congress to  codify a national AI framework.\"States have an important role in addressing harms and protecting people, but they can't provide the long-term clarity or national direction that only Congress can deliver,\" McCune said in a statement.Sriram Krishnan, a White House AI advisor and former general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, during an interview Friday on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" said that Trump was looking to partner with Congress to pass such legislation.\"The White House is now taking a firm stance where we want to push back on 'doomer' laws that exist in a bunch of states around the country,\" Krishnan said.He also said that the goal of the executive order is to give the White House tools to go after state laws that it believes make America less competitive, such as recently passed legislation in Democratic-led states like California and Colorado. The White House will not use the executive order to target state laws that protect the safety of children, Krishnan said.Robert Weissman, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, called Trump's order \"mostly bluster\" and said the president \"cannot unilaterally preempt state law.\"\"We expect the EO to be challenged in court and defeated,\" Weissman said in a statement. \"In the meantime, states should continue their efforts to protect their residents from the mounting dangers of unregulated AI.\"Weissman said about the order, \"This reward to Big Tech is a disgraceful invitation to reckless behavior by the world's largest corporations and a complete override of the federalist principles that Trump and MAGA claim to venerate.\"In the short term, the order could affect a handful of states that have already passed legislation targeting AI. The order says that states whose laws are considered onerous could lose federal funding.One Colorado law, set to take effect in June, will require AI developers to protect consumers from reasonably foreseeable risks of algorithmic discrimination.Some say Trump's order will have no real impact on that law or on other state regulations.\"I'm pretty much ignoring it, because an executive order cannot tell a state what to do,\" said Colorado state Rep. Brianna Titone, a Democrat who co-sponsored the anti-discrimination law.In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed a law that, starting in January, will require major AI companies to publicly disclose their safety protocols.  That law's author, state Sen. Scott Wiener, said that Trump's stated goal of having the United States dominate the AI sector is undercut by his recent moves. \"Of course, he just authorized chip sales to China & Saudi Arabia: the exact opposite of ensuring U.S. dominance,\" Wiener wrote in an X post on Thursday night. The Bay Area Democrat is seeking to succeed  Speaker-emerita Nancy Pelosi in the U.S. House of Representatives. Trump on Monday said he will Nvidia to sell its advanced H200 chips to \"approved customers\" in China, provided that the U.S. gets a 25% cut of revenues.",

    "body": "Workers are suspended on a Pepsi sign on a building outside of Allegiant Stadium ahead of LVIII in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., February 9, 2024.Brian Snyder | ReutersOne of this year's top food trends is facing some tough competition.Protein captivated consumers and food companies in 2025, but fiber is increasingly stealing the scene as people place an increasing emphasis on promoting gut health.It's taken hold on social media, where \"fibermaxxing\" — or the concept of increasing fiber intake through whole foods like fruits and legumes — has seen thousands of posts.\"Fiber is finally getting a spotlight, which is a great thing because it's a nutrient that people need,\" said Stephanie Mattucci, principal strategist at food research company Mintel.Currently, 90% of women and 97% of men in the U.S. are not meeting their daily fiber requirements, Mattucci said. For most Americans, that recommended range usually falls somewhere between 25 grams and 38 grams of fiber per day, she added.But more people are beginning to take notice of those gaps.According to Mattucci, 22% of consumers in the U.S. said high fiber content was one of their top three important factors when shopping for food — up from just 17% in 2021.Wall Street's companies are taking note, too. On an earnings call with analysts in October, PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said fiber was emerging at the forefront of the company's product goals as it looked ahead to 2026.\"I think fiber will be the next protein,\" Laguarta said. \"Consumers are starting to understand that fiber is the benefit that they need. It's actually a deficiency in U.S. consumers' diets, and that will be elevated.\"In February, the company is going a step farther and plans to launch Smartfood Fiber Pop, featuring six grams of fiber per serving, and SunChips Fiber, incorporating fiber variants like whole grains and black beans, Pepsi's chief science officer, Tara Glasgow, told CNBC exclusively.Smartfood Fiber Pop and Sun Chips Fiber snacks.Source: PepsicoAnd there's a reason companies are broadening their offerings. Research firm Datassential found that fiber is on track to be the \"next big health trend following on the heels of protein\" in its 2026 trends report.Of the consumers the firm surveyed, 54% said they are interested in foods and beverages that are high in fiber. That number is even higher — reaching 60% — among members of Generation Z, who are pioneering the \"fibermaxxing\" trend on social media.And 42% of consumers said they believe the attribute of \"high fiber\" on a nutrition label of any food or beverage product is important to defining that product as \"healthy,\" according to Datassential.It's that momentum that landed fiber as one of Whole Foods Market's top trends for 2026.The gut health crazeWatching fiber intake isn't new, experts note, but it's often been associated with older people who require it for health reasons as they age.\"When I think of fiber, I immediately think of my grandfather. Every day, he had his little baggie of All-Bran, and he brought it everywhere he went, probably out of necessity,\" Mintel's Mattucci said, citing the slowing of digestive tracts as people age.Still, something has shifted as consumers of all ages have started placing more emphasis on promoting gut health and digestive wellness — and fiber entered the spotlight.The emphasis on diversity of fiber intake and finding it in everyday whole foods rather than through supplements or powders is part of what's allowing it to find popularity and align with current culture, according to Angela Salas, a senior dietitian at the University of California, Davis.watch nowThe two types of fiber — soluble and insoluble — work together to keep people fuller for longer, improve digestion, and lower blood pressure and cholesterol, Salas said. In some ways, fiber could mimic the effects of weight-loss drugs because it takes longer to break down food and therefore sits in the stomach for longer, she said, which could be a factor for its recent popularity.\"These nutrients have always been around and always kind of shifts, I think, from the food industry saying, 'What can we highlight? What do people want to be focusing on so that we can continue to sell the same product, just slightly altered?'\" Salas said.Still, Kate Pelletier, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the University of Michigan Health, said it's important to note that fiber is not sufficient as an alternative to GLP-1 drugs, and a balanced plate is the best way to stay healthy.Pelletier said fiber's use as a \"street sweeper\" for the body is likely one of the reasons it's been thrust back into the spotlight.\"There's been a really big shift into more natural plants instead of popping a supplement or using a protein powder,\" Pelletier said. \"We can get the benefit of fiber from thinking about adding more wholesome foods into our diet, versus typical diet culture [which] focuses on taking out X, Y or Z.\" Promoting high-fiber productsFood and beverage companies are jumping on the momentum, too.Earlier this year, Coca-Cola launched its prebiotic soda, Simply Pop, with six grams of prebiotic fiber in five flavors to encourage gut health. Nestlé unveiled a new protein shake in June with four grams of prebiotic fiber designed specifically to support the digestive health of adults on GLP-1 medications.Other companies like Olipop have also entered the prebiotic soda market, boasting recipes that promote gut health, while smaller businesses, like Floura fiber bars and Sola Bagels, have also begun selling fiber-rich products.Olipop soda at a store in San Francisco, California, US, on Monday, March 17, 2025. Olipop Inc., the high-fiber, lower-sugar soda startup, raised $50 million in a Series C funding round at a valuation of $1.85 billion. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPepsi's Glasgow told CNBC the company is taking every opportunity to explore consumers' newfound interest in fiber. Glasgow said the research and development team's work starts in science and follows trends to keep up with their audience's evolving tastes.Pepsi already has products on the market that specifically boast high fiber content, like its prebiotic cola and Quaker oatmeal. As consumers start to explore the previously \"sleepy little nutrient,\" Glasgow said, Pepsi is innovating new products across its beverages and food brands.\"We hear it from consumers as well that they're becoming more knowledgeable about nutrition and their nutrition needs,\" Glasgow said. \"And I think that's where the excitement is coming from. I feel it growing.\"Glasgow said the company, which already launched successful protein-packed products this year, is moving toward products that incorporate multiple sources of gut-healthy ingredients.\"We saw protein grow in a big way in the last couple years,\" Glasgow said. \"I think [consumers] are then expanding their view, and they realize there's not one ingredient alone that is the silver bullet. It's about getting the right ingredients all together.\"For some, fiber isn't just a trend.Naomi Aganekwu, a 27-year-old content creator, said she started incorporating fiber more intentionally into her diet last year. Now, she makes sure each meal she eats has at least five to 10 grams of fiber through foods like beans, lentils and chia seed puddings.Aganekwu said she's seeing results from incorporating fiber into her diet, like being satiated after meals and seeing her hormonal acne reduce. And as she's championing fiber, she's seeing the people around her do the same, especially among her generation.It's become personal for Aganekwu, too, whose father died earlier this year of colon cancer. Some research has shown fiber could prevent colorectal cancer in addition to promoting overall health, according to the National Institutes of Health.\"You don't want to wait until you're 60 or 70 and you're dealing with more diagnoses,\" she said. \"There's a lot that you can do, even just in your everyday choices, down to what you're putting on your plate, that can directly impact your chances or decrease your chances of developing critical diseases.\"Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the level of fiber in Smartfood Fiber Pop.",

    "body": "watch nowCNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday told investors what to look out for next week on Wall Street, including new economic data and earnings from FedEx and manufacturer Jabil.He also remarked on this week's big decline in tech stocks. He said he still believes in the power of artificial intelligence and suggested some of these names might be worth buying once their valuations come down.\"We need every piece of data to keep up on what's really happening as the money rotates from the Magnificent Seven to all these other different other areas, kind of like a fire hose,\" he said.Tuesday brings the Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report. Cramer noted that Wall Street has largely been in the dark about macroeconomic data for the past few months thanks to the lengthy government shutdown. A strong jobs report could call into question the need for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, Cramer said, while weaker figures mean the central bank can keep easing. Retail sales data is also set to be released on Tuesday, and Cramer added that this report needs to be weak to justify more cuts.Jabil and General Mills are set to report Wednesday. Cramer noted that Jabil is a major manufacturer of infrastructure and hardware for data centers. He said the company's earnings could reverse the declines in AI stocks. Cramer indicated he'll be waiting to hear from industry giant General Mills, noting that a number of food stocks have struggled recently due to the popularity of GLP-1 weight loss drugs and a growing emphasis on healthier eating habits.On Thursday, Darden, Cintas, Nike and FedEx will report. While the rising price of beef has hurt some restaurants, Cramer suggested restaurant giant Darden has been protected by its Olive Garden chain, which he said has \"minimal beef exposure.\" He said uniform and safety equipment supplier Cintas will be a solid measure of how small businesses are faring. It may be too soon to expect a turnaround at Nike, Cramer continued, but FedEx could be the \"star of the week.\" He praised the shipping company's management, adding that the e-commerce boom seems set to to continue. Friday brings earnings from Carnival, Conagra and Paychex, and Cramer suggested all three reports will provide valuable insight. Carnival can speak to the state of discretionary spending, Conagra can show whether consumers are cooking more meals at home, and payroll processer Paychex can give a read on small and medium-sized businesses.watch nowSign up now for the CNBC Investing Club to follow Jim Cramer's every move in the market.Disclaimer The CNBC Investing Club holds shares of Nike.Questions for Cramer?

    "body": "Photo released from the Jeffrey Epstein files shows Donald Trump with multiple women. Redactions were done by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee. Date and context is unclear.Source: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee.Nearly 100,000 photos obtained by House Democrats from the estate of notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein include images of President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, film director Woody Allen, and former Trump White House advisor Steve Bannon and others in social settings.Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, as they made 19 of those photos public, urged the Department of Justice to release investigative files it has related to Epstein ahead of the Dec. 19 deadline to do so to comply with a newly passed law.One image among a batch of photos released Friday morning shows Trump standing in the middle of a row of six women, whose faces were covered over by the Democrats before release. Some of the women are wearing Hawaiian leis around their necks. Trump is shown in another photo standing behind Epstein at what appears to be a social event. A third photo shows Trump sitting next to a woman, whose face is blacked out, on what appears to be a plane.Trump was a longtime friend of Epstein before the two men had a falling out sometime in the early 2000s. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and has denied knowledge of Epstein's abuse of girls and women while they were friends.\"Well, I haven't seen it, but I mean, everybody knew this man,\" Trump said at the White House on Friday evening when asked about the photos of him and others being released.\"He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him,\" Trump said.\"So that's no big deal. I know nothing about it.\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, in a statement to CNBC, accused House Democrats of \"selectively releasing cherry-picked photos with random redactions to try and create a false narrative.\"Jackson called the Democrats' focus on the president's connection to Epstein a \"hoax,\" and argued that the Trump administration \"has done more for Epstein's victims than Democrats ever have\" by releasing documents and calling for transparency.Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee showing Bill Clinton, Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein with two unknown people.

CNBC is reaching out to the people identified in the photos, all of whom have denied wrongdoing.

    "body": "watch nowEverything is bigger in Texas. That's also true for data center demand in the Lone Star State, where project developers are rushing to cash in on the artificial intelligence boom.  Cheap land and cheap energy are combining to attract a flood of data center developers to the state. The potential demand is so vast that it will be impossible to meet by the end of the decade, energy experts say. Speculative projects are clogging up the pipeline to connect to the electric grid, making it difficult to see how much demand will actually materialize, they say. But investors will be left on the hook if inflated demand forecasts lead to more infrastructure being built than is actually needed. \"It definitely looks, smells, feels — is acting like a bubble,\" said Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a founder of energy consulting firm IdeaSmiths.  \"The top line numbers are almost laughable,\" Rhodes said. More than 220 gigawatts of big projects have asked to connect to the Texas electric grid by 2030, according to December data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. More than 70% of those projects are data centers, according to ERCOT, which manages the Texas power grid. That's more than twice the Lone Star State's record peak summer demand this year of around 85 gigawatts, and its total available power generation for the season of around 103 gigawatts. Those figures are \"crazy big,\" said Beth Garza, a former ERCOT watchdog.\"There's not enough stuff to serve that much load on the equipment side or the consumption side,\" said Garza, director of ERCOT's independent market monitor from 2014 to 2019. Rhodes agreed. \"There's just no way we can physically put this much steel in the ground to match those numbers. I don't even know if China could do it that fast,\" he said.  'Not all real'Data center requests have exploded in Texas since state legislation in 2023 required projects that have not signed electric connection agreements to be considered in power demand forecasts. The number of big projects requesting an electric connection has nearly quadrupled this year. But more than half of them, representing about 128 gigawatts of increased potential demand, have not submitted studies for ERCOT to review yet. About another 90 gigawatts are either under review or have had planning studies approved. \"We know it's not all real. The question is how much is real,\" said Michael Hogan, a senior advisor at the Regulatory Assistance Project, which advises governments and regulators on energy policy.The huge numbers in Texas reflect a broader data center bubble in the U.S., said Hogan, who has worked in the electric industry for more than four decades, starting at General Electric in 1980.  \"As with everything else in Texas, it's an outsized example of it,\" he said. The number of projects that have actually connected to the grid or have been approved by ERCOT is much smaller, at only around 7.5 gigawatts. It is still a large number, equivalent to nearly eight large nuclear plants. But Texas can meet that level of demand, Rhodes said. \"We could comfortably grow 8 gigawatts of data centers,\" Rhodes said. Texas might be able to meet 20 gigawatts or 30 gigawatts of data center demand by 2030, he said. Texas has acted to separate serious data center projects from those that are merely speculative. A law passed in May requires developers to pay $100,000 for the initial study of their project and show that a site is secured through an ownership interest or lease. And they have to disclose whether they have outlined the same project anywhere else in Texas. The Texas Public Utility Commission has proposed a rule that would require data centers to pay $50,000 security per megawatt of peak power. The cost to a developer would total at least $50 million for a gigawatt-scale data center. \"The serious developers with long-term contracts signed with anchor tenants, they're going to be willing to put that money down,\" Rhodes said. More speculative developers will likely drop out of the line for an electric connection, which will help authorities get a more accurate forecast, he said. Risk to investorsThe risk is that electric infrastructure such as power plants, transmission lines and transformers will be built for speculative data centers that either do not materialize or use less electricity than anticipated, Rhodes said. And overbuilding would come at time when the cost of that infrastructure has soared as data centers and other industries all compete for the same scarce equipment, he said.\"When the bubble bursts, who pays is going to depend on how much steel has been moved,\" Rhodes said. The cost of a natural gas plant, for example, has more than doubled over the past five years, he said. \"It's kind of like buying your house at the top of the market,\" the analyst said. \"If the house price goes down in five years, you're out of luck.\" watch nowThe cost of building new power plants to serve the Texas electric market is generally borne by investors, Rhodes and Hogan said, providing some protection to households from higher electricity prices if too much capacity is built.  By contrast, electric prices have spiked in some Midwestern and mid-Atlantic states from data center demand because the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, buys power generation years in advance — with the burden falling on consumers.  In Illinois, where the northern part of the state is served by PJM, residential electricity prices rose about 20% in September compared to the same month last year. But prices in Texas increased just 5% year over year, below the average national increase of more than 7%, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.  Texas has less risk of building too much generation compared to PJM states because of the way the market is structured, Hogan said. But \"whatever [new] build we do end up seeing in Texas, the people who ended up investing in the excess capacity are the ones that are going to suffer,\" he said.  ",

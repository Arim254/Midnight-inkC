    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "description": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people ",
    "body": "It's important to build resilience, but how do we actually do it? I've spent 15 years researching happiness, and I've interviewed thousands of people about what makes it possible for them to thrive. I've learned that resilience isn't something you're born with. It's not even about bouncing back, a concept that often does more harm than good. Real resilience is about building specific habits that train your brain to weather difficulty without breaking. Here are 9 habits that actually work:1. Reframing stress as a signal, not a threatIf your heart is racing before your big meeting, your instinct might be to panic. Before you do, pause and tell yourself: \"I'm excited about this.\"I know it sounds like toxic positivity. It's not. Research shows that this simple reframing, shifting from a threat to a challenge, can change your physiological response. Your body doesn't easily distinguish between anxiety and excitement. The only difference is your interpretation. 2. Making one micro-decision daily with confidenceWhen you constantly second-guess yourself, your brain learns that you can't be trusted to handle outcomes. Confident micro-decisions can help rewire your brain and boost your trust in yourself.So pick your lunch without researching five options. Commit to a movie in two minutes flat. Send the email without editing it 10 times. This teaches your brain: \"I can decide and handle what comes next, even if it's not perfect.\" That's the exact skill you need in a crisis. 3. Building your support system with intentionIt's extremely difficult to maintain deep relationships with hundreds of people. Research has found we can manage about 150 stable relationships, but only about five truly intimate ones. The most emotionally resilient people don't spread their emotional energy thin or try to handle everything alone. They invest in these core relationships. And when things do get hard, they have people in their corner who can help them carry the weight. 4. Creating a 'done' list instead of a to-do listMost of us focus on what's left undone. It's a perpetual sense of failure. I want you to flip this.Every day, write down what you actually accomplished, even the small stuff. Over time, your brain stops noticing gaps and starts noticing progress. That shift is where resilience lives.5. Noticing and savoring one good moment every dayWhen you deliberately pay attention to positive moments, you rewire neural pathways for happiness. Pick one moment a day worth savoring. A good conversation. A small win. Really good coffee. Spend 30 seconds actually noticing it. This practice counteracts your brain's obsession with what's wrong and builds psychological resilience, one moment at a time.6. Practicing honesty in your closest relationshipsBe vulnerable with the people who matter to you. Tell someone about a real challenge. Ask for honest feedback, not just agreement. Have conversations where things might get uncomfortable.The most resilient people feel safe to be themselves without fear of judgement. Being open with people who you trust can help build that muscle. 7. Helping someone else, before you need helpThis sounds counterintuitive until you realize that helping others is a powerful recharge practice. Plus, you're building your support system for the future. You're reinforcing your identity as capable and resourceful.Most importantly, you remember that resilience is also about contributing and mattering to other people.8. Asking yourself, 'What's the worst that could happen?'Most people avoid this question because they are afraid of the answer. But research shows that actually imagining the worst-case scenario can reduce anxiety, not increase it.So after you ask yourself, \"What's the worst that could happen?\" actually sit with the question. Then ask yourself, \"Could I handle that?\" The answer is usually yes. Maybe not easily, but yes.The most resilient people understand that bad things can happen, but the most important thing is to be confident that you can handle them when they do.9. Practicing these habits in low-stakes momentsEmotional resilience is a skill you can hone. It doesn't require therapy, meditation retreats, or years of work. Start with just one or two of these habits. Reframe stress when the stakes are low. Build your support relationships now, not when you're desperate. Make confident decisions about small things, so you're ready for big things.Jessica Weiss is a keynote speaker and executive coach who teaches people and businesses how to find more happiness, fulfillment and satisfaction at work.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during an event in the Roosevelt Room of the White House December 19, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump delivered remarks on lowering prescription drug prices during the event. Alex Wong | Getty ImagesSeveral of the largest U.S. and European-based drugmakers inked deals with President Donald Trump on Friday to voluntarily sell their medications for less, as his administration pushes to link the nation's drug prices to cheaper ones abroad.That includes Merck, Bristol Myers Squibb, Amgen, Gilead, GSK, Sanofi, Roche's Genentech, privately-held Boehringer Ingelheim and Novartis. In exchange, the companies agreed to a three-year grace period during which their products won't face Trump's planned pharmaceutical-specific tariffs — as long as the drugmakers further invest in U.S. manufacturing. Among the most notable pledges on Friday is that Bristol Myers Squibb will offer Eliquis, its blockbuster blood thinner and top-prescribed product, for free to Medicaid.The companies make up the majority of the 17 drugmakers Trump sent letters to in July, calling on them to lower prices as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive that policy, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"\"As of today, 14 out of the 17 largest pharmaceutical companies ... have now agreed to drastically lower drug prices for … the American people and the American patients,\" Trump said at an event on Friday. \"This represents the greatest victory for patient affordability in the history of American health care, by far, and every single American will benefit.\"Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie and Regeneron are the remaining companies among the largest that haven't signed drug pricing deals. But Trump noted that Johnson & Johnson \"will be here next week.\" How the drug pricing deals will workThe full terms of the deals were not immediately released, which makes it unclear how broad their impact will be.The nine drugmakers agreed to take measures to reduce U.S. drug prices, including selling their existing treatments to Medicaid patients at the lowest \"most favored nation\" prices, and guaranteeing that pricing for new medicines. Trump said the drugmakers also agreed to list their most popular drugs on his upcoming direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, which is launching in January. Some companies also launched new or expanded existing direct-to-consumer offerings for certain drugs. For example, Gilead said in a release that it will launch a program that will enable patients to access its hepatitis C treatment and cure, Epclusa, at a discounted price. Sanofi said it will offer discounts of nearly 70% on certain medicines to treat infections and cardiovascular and diabetic conditions on TrumpRx and other direct-to-consumer platforms. Merck said it will offer three diabetes medications, Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR, at a roughly 70% discount to cash-paying patients through a direct-to-patient program. That program will be extended to the company's experimental daily cholesterol pill if it gets approved in the U.S., according to the company. \"I reflect on your goal of driving affordability and access to Americans, but equally, getting prices up outside the United States,\" Merck CEO Robert Davis said during the press conference. \"And we're 100% supportive of your actions.\" Meanwhile, Amgen will expand its existing direct-to-patient program to include preventative migraine medication Aimovig and autoimmune treatment Amjevita, at 60% and 80% discounted monthly prices, respectively. Earlier this year, Trump announced agreements with Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and EMD Serono to sell certain drugs directly to patients at a discount, in exchange for exemptions from his planned pharmaceutical tariffs and other benefits, such as fast-tracked reviews of new drugs. U.S. prescription drug prices on average are nearly three times higher than overseas, according to a 2024 study by Rand Corp. Prices for branded drugs were more than four times higher, the report found. Trump signed an executive order in May to revive the policy of most favored nation, calling for prices to be increased outside of the U.S. and to \"end global freeloading.\"Trade association PhRMA, which represents many major pharma companies, has said that most-favored nation pricing isn't the best way to lower drug costs for Americans and instead blamed pharmacy benefit managers for the price disparity. The U.S. is the single most important market for many drugmakers, regardless of their home country. Despite being based across the Atlantic, European pharma companies are heavily exposed to the U.S. market, with half of the 10 largest companies on the Continent generating a majority of their sales in the U.S.",

    "body": "For couples, \"holidays are a scary time\" because they often call for revealing a new side of yourself to your partner, says Sabrina Romanoff, New York-based psychologist and a relationship expert for dating app Hily. Some people have decades-long, big family traditions they want to uphold. Others prefer to keep it low key. Whatever the activities are, and whatever the meaning behind them, opening up about what matters to you can feel very vulnerable.  Ultimately, the goal is to blend \"each other's cultures and worlds,\" says Romanoff. Here's how successful couples tackle this festive time of year. They're 'direct and honest' about what they want First, each partner has to know what they want and be open about it.Do they want their partner to join them for their family Christmas? Do they want to take some time off and have a quiet Hanukkah? \"You are better off being direct and honest with your partner so you both can really get what you both need,\" says Romanoff.Ultimately, there will likely have to be some flexibility, on both sides. \"I think the healthiest couples are those who can get creative and compromise,\" she says. \"There's only one Christmas Eve, there's only one Christmas Day.\" Maybe this year, the couple spends time with one side's family and next year they spend time with the other. They create new traditions togetherSecond, successful couples create new traditions together. \"That could mean going to see the tree together a Rockefeller Center,\" says Romanoff, \"or getting an ornament together.\" It could mean cooking a holiday meal or doing a hot chocolate crawl. Building something new together is a bonding experience. \"I think that's what brings security\" in the relationship, she says.Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

Elizabeth Frantz | ReutersU.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was suspending the diversity visa program at President Donald Trump's direction, saying the man suspected of killing two students at Brown University and a MIT professor had been granted one.Noem posted on X late Thursday that she had instructed the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to pause the (DV1) program \"to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"On Dec. 13, two students died and nine others were injured when someone opened fire at the physics building at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Police later identified Portuguese national Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, 48, as the suspect.Valente was a former student at the university and had been enrolled in a Ph.D. program in physics in 2000, the university's president, Christina H. Paxson, said. Valente is also suspected of having killed MIT physics professor Nuno Loureiro, 47, in his home in Brookline, Massachusetts, two days after the Brown shooting. Valente and Loureiro are believed to have attended the same university in their native Portugal.Authorities announced the suspect's identity hours after Valente was found dead in a New Hampshire storage facility on Thursday, Providence Police Chief Oscar Perez said. Guns were also found at the scene.\"There's no longer a threat to the public,\" the U.S. attorney's office in Boston said in a statement after Valente's death was confirmed. Authorities believe Valente acted alone and have not disclosed a motive for the killings. Noem said that Valente entered the U.S. through the DV1 program in 2017 and was granted a green card.\"In 2017, President Trump fought to end this program, following the devastating NYC truck ramming by an ISIS terrorist, who entered under the DV1 program, and murdered eight people,\" she wrote on X.The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program (DV Program) allocates up to 50,000 immigrant visas every year, according to the USCIS website.The program is a lottery.

    "body": "watch nowWhile discounts drove purchasing in the early days of the holiday shopping season, consumers are shifting into more thoughtful, quality gifts in the back half of the season as total spending growth slows.U.S. consumers had spent $187.3 billion so far online between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, up 6.1% from the same stretch last year, according to Adobe Analytics. Total holiday season e-commerce spend is still expected to cross $253 billion, which would be 5.3% above last year, with the growth rate slowing later into December as delivery in time for Christmas gets tighter. E-commerce sales typically \"slow sharply\" from about Dec. 16 to Dec. 18, and then \"decline rapidly\" in the ensuing days, until Christmas Eve is the slowest shopping day of the season, Casey Armstrong, chief marketing officer for ShipBob, told CNBC. Armstrong said shopping picks up again on Dec. 27, which is typically the strongest day for ShipBob's customers late in the season. The company is a third-party logistics firm that ships for small, medium and social-oriented brands. A shopper carries packages in Union Square in San Francisco, Dec. 11, 2025.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFor shoppers who are willing to order online in the back half of the season, quality, rather than discounts, is driving interest. Captify analyzes more than 1 billion search events per day from 3 million websites, and it shows outsize search growth in apparel and athleisure brands including Alo Yoga, Warby Parker, Aritzia, Bombas and Quince into December compared to earlier in the season. Searches for Alo Yoga rose 256% for the period between Dec. 7 and Dec. 15 compared to the stretch from Nov. 28 to Dec. 6. Quince searches are up 124% for those same time frames. \"These gains point to a rise in thoughtful, quality-driven gifting as shoppers seek products from highly regarded brands\" said Oscar Chow, Captify head of insights for the U.S.RetailNext, which tracks in-store shopping, has also seen evidence of consumers valuing quality this season, even if that means buying fewer items. \"Consumers are willing to pay more to get those decisions right\" said Joe Shasteen, global manager of advanced analytics at RetailNext. The firm expects this dynamic to peak in the days leading up to Christmas.There is also evidence showing a shift toward gifting experiences and subscriptions as the season winds down. Chow said they offer shoppers a \"deadline-proof gift.\"Examples include growth in interest in the later weeks of the season for Roblox Robux, Cameo Kids, Kindle Unlimited, Strava Subscription, Peloton All-Access, MasterClass subscriptions and the Disney+, Hulu and HBO Max subscription bundle.Discounts are still available as holiday shopping winds down, but they're much lower than during Cyber Week highs. Adobe Analytics said toys will see the biggest promotions, peaking at 15% off list price in December, followed by furniture, bedding and televisions at 10% off.To be sure, there are discount-motivated consumers throughout the season, which makes toys a strong category. Data from Adobe and Captify show consumers are still seeking out Mattel's Barbie Dreamhouse, Disney's Stitch toys, and Play-Doh sets, among others.

Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty ImagesFor those that want a physical gift to give, stores are critical in the days leading up to Christmas.The last Saturday before Christmas has been coined \"Super Saturday\" by the retail sector and is often one of the top store shopping days of the year. But with Christmas landing on a Thursday this year, the volume will likely be lower on Super Saturday this year than on Dec. 22 through Dec. 24, according to RetailNext. \"We expect some of the highest conversion rates of the season to occur in the final days before Christmas, potentially rivaling or even surpassing Black Friday,\" Shasteen of RetailNext said. The warmer temperatures and dry conditions hitting much of the country this weekend should also help lift store traffic this weekend, according to Evan Gold, Planalytics executive vice president of global partnerships and alliances.Shoppers who don't want to navigate stores, but also don't want to chance shipping timelines, are increasingly using buy online, pick up in store options in the final stretch of the holiday shopping season. Adobe Analytics predicts BOPIS will peak on Dec. 22 and Dec. 23, with 32% to 37% of e-commerce orders utilizing the service, a spike in typical usage from the rest of the year.Kohl's told CNBC its pickup orders more than double in the week leading up to Christmas and that a quarter of shoppers who pickup an online order end up buying something else while they are there. At Bath and Body Works, about 30% of customers picking up online orders add something before checkout. It's also a cost savings for retailers to fulfill online orders from stores. Target has said order pickup or drive-up saves the retailer 90% over brown-box delivery from fulfillment centers. So far this season, three-quarters of its digital orders have been picked up from stores.Walmart told CNBC last year that weekly scheduled pickup volume increased 14% in the two weeks leading up to Christmas compared to the average volume in the prior 12 weeks. More than 80% of Walmart customers say they shop in-store in the three days before Christmas, according to its customer insights and strategy holiday pulse tracker conducted this month.Last December, volumes of Walmart Express Delivery, orders fulfilled from store inventory that come with an extra fee, reached 2.5 times the monthly average. The retailer said on Christmas Eve alone, 77% of digital orders were fulfilled via the express option.While Dick's Sporting Goods declined to share specifics, the retailer said it sees a \"significant uptick in BOPIS\" as Christmas nears, and it also sees an \"attach rate\" for shoppers \"to make sure they grab those last-minute gifts on a single trip to the store.\"",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

Based on the story, it is likely the apartment has at least two bedrooms, according to Cody Garrett, a certified financial planner at Measure Twice Financial in Houston.Today, a two-bedroom apartment at that location would cost around $2 million, Garrett estimates, with a mortgage payment of around $10,000 per month before taxes, insurance and maintenance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump promises 'largest tax refund season of all time.'

The median asking rent for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment in that same ZIP code is $9,175 per month as of November and $8,400 per month more broadly on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy, a New York City real estate search website owned by Zillow.Meanwhile, the median asking price for a two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment is around $2.5 million as of November and almost $2.2 million on the Upper West Side, according to StreetEasy data. To rent or buy? New York City Madison Square park view with Christmas lights and Manhattan skyscrapers.Getty ImagesThe question \"Should I buy or should I rent?\" is increasingly relevant today.Renting is cheaper than paying a mortgage in all 50 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an April Bankrate study. That cost difference has grown in 38 metro areas in the past year, Bankrate's research found. Yet, New York does not top the list for the biggest difference between renting and buying. Instead, cities including San Francisco; San Jose, California; Seattle; Denver; and Salt Lake City are in the top five. There are reasons why buying can be more financially challenging. Rising home prices have outpaced rent increases in many markets, while mortgage rates have also climbed. Housing supply can also be an issue, with not enough homes available for aspiring purchasers.Emotions may also factor into the buying vs. renting trade-off. For some, buying can offer a sense of security. Others may prefer the reduced responsibility for upkeep that renting provides.\"I actually consider a primary residence to be a lifestyle decision, not an investment,\" Garrett said.To help clients gauge housing affordability, Garrett said he refers to the 28/36 rule. That means no more than 28% of gross monthly income should go to housing costs, and total debt including housing should be no more than 36% of monthly gross income. Monthly homeownership costs are typically measured by PITI — the sum of mortgage principal, interest, taxes and insurance.The fictitious couple Walter and Emily Hobbs in the \"Elf\" movie would need gross income exceeding $450,000 to justify buying the property, according to Garrett. Walter is an executive at a children's book publisher, while Emily also has an unspecified high-level job. Even if they meet that income threshold for home ownership, they may still be squeezed by saving and planning for retirement, Garrett said. Moreover, their son Michael attends York Preparatory school, where annual tuition and fees currently run around nearly $68,000 for grades six through 12.Garrett recently worked with a client who purchased a home in the same neighborhood for around $15,000 per month. Ahead of the purchase, Garrett cautioned the client about how the high home costs could require sacrifice in other aspects of life, including pushing their targeted retirement date later.The \"Elf\" movie has other lessons when it comes to cost of living, particularly for the character Jovie, who works at Gimbels department store and lives in Chinatown.Because it appears she is living paycheck to paycheck, she likely isn't saving for retirement or emergencies, Garrett said, which is common among people who move to New York in search of success. As Leon the snowman tells Buddy when he leaves the North Pole for New York, \"This might be the golden opportunity to find out who you really are.\"Those who move to New York or other big metro areas with similar aspirations may take steps to try to defray the high cost of living, Garrett said. For example, to ease her financial situation, Jovie may find roommates or additional streams of income, he said. ",

    "body": "watch nowNew York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Friday that \"technical factors\" likely distorted November's inflation data, pushing the headline reading lower than it otherwise would have been.\"There were some special factors or practical factors that really are related to the fact that they weren't able to collect data in October and not in the first half of November. And because of that, I think the data were distorted in some of the categories, and that pushed down the CPI reading, probably by a tenth or so,\" Williams said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\"It's hard to know, we'll get some when we'll get to December data, I think we'll get a better reading of how much that distortion, how big the effect was, but I do think that that was pushed down a bit by these technical factors,\" he added.The consumer price index rose at a 2.7% annualized rate last month, a delayed report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected the CPI to have risen 3.1%.Williams said the data may have a downward bias because it was collected mainly in the second half of November, when sales were widespread, and noted there were also complications with rent and other categories. The New York Fed president said he took some comfort from categories not affected by those issues, seeing cooling price pressures in certain sectors.\"Some of the data that we're seeing is actually pretty encouraging in the sense of the CPI news. and I think it represents a continuation of the disinflationary process we've seen,\" Williams said.Because the October CPI release was canceled, Thursday's report lacked several of the standard data points typically included in a CPI report. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said it could not go back and collect October survey data, though it relied on \"nonsurvey data sources\" to construct the index. As a result, economists may be cautious about interpreting the report as clear evidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path, given the absence of an October comparison. Economists believe some some inputs to the owners' equivalent rent calculation for the canceled October month were estimated by the BLS to have zero inflation, distorting that calculation downward.",

    "body": "watch nowElon Musk's 2018 CEO pay package from Tesla, worth some $56 billion when it vested, must be restored, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled Friday.\"We reverse the Court of Chancery's rescission remedy and award $1 in nominal damages,\" the judges wrote in their opinion. In the decision, the Delaware Supreme Court judges said a lower court's decision to cancel Musk's 2018 pay plan was too extreme a remedy and that the lower court did not give Tesla a chance to say what a fair compensation ought to be.The decision on the appeal in this case, known as Tornetta v. Musk, likely ends the yearslong fight over Musk's record-setting compensation. Musk's net worth is currently estimated at around $679.4 billion, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Dorothy Lund, a professor at Columbia Law School, told CNBC that while the Friday opinion may restore the 2018 pay plan for Musk, it leaves the rest of the lower court's decision unaddressed and intact. \"The court had previously decided that Musk was a controlling shareholder of Tesla and that the Tesla board and he arranged an unfair pay plan for him,\" she said. \"None of that was reversed in this decision.\"\"We are proud to have participated in the historic verdict below, calling to account the Tesla board and its largest stockholder for their breaches of fiduciary duty,\" lawyers representing plaintiff Richard J. Tornetta said in an e-mailed statement.Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The Delaware Supreme Court issued the order per curiam with no single judge taking credit for writing the opinion and no dissent noted.Read more CNBC tech newsGoogle and Nvidia VC arms back vibe coding startup Lovable at $6.6 billion valuationMetaX and Moore Threads' IPOs underscore Chinese chipmakers' growing challenge to NvidiaInstacart shares drop on report that FTC is probing company over AI pricing toolAmazon says AI chief Rohit Prasad is leaving, Peter DeSantis to lead 'AGI' groupMusk's 2018 CEO pay package from Tesla, comprised of 12 milestone-based tranches of stock, was unprecedented at the time it was proposed. After it was granted, the pay plan made Musk the wealthiest individual in the world.Tesla shareholder Tornetta sued Tesla, filing a derivative action in 2018, accusing Musk and the company's board of a breach of their fiduciary duties. Delaware's business-specialized Court of Chancery decided in January 2024 that the pay plan was improperly granted and ordered it to be rescinded.In her decision, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick also found that Musk \"controlled Tesla,\" and that the process leading to the board's approval of his 2018 pay plan was \"deeply flawed.\" Among other things, she found the Tesla board did not disclose all the material information they should have to investors before asking them to vote on and approve the plan.After the earlier Tornetta ruling, Musk moved Tesla's site of incorporation out of Delaware, bashed McCormick by name in posts on his social network X, formerly Twitter, where he has tens of millions of followers, and called for other entrepreneurs to reincorporate outside of the state.Tesla also attempted to \"ratify\" the 2018 CEO pay plan by holding a second vote with shareholders in 2024. In November, Tesla shareholders voted to approve an even larger CEO compensation plan for Musk. The 2025 pay plan consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted to the CEO if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade and is worth about $1 trillion in total. The new plan could also increase Musk's voting power over the company from around 13% today to around 25%. Shareholders had also approved a plan to replace Musk's 2018 CEO pay if the Tornetta decision was upheld on appeal. That plan is now nullified.As CNBC previously reported, a law firm that currently represents Tesla in this appeal penned a bill to overhaul corporate law in Delaware earlier this year. The bill was passed by the Delaware legislature in March, and if it had applied retroactively, it could have affected the outcome of this case.Read the Delaware Supreme Court's ruling here. watch now",

    "body": "Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTween retailer Claire's is facing legal challenges from some of its Asia-based suppliers over millions in unpaid debts as it tries to emerge from a second bankruptcy under new ownership, according to claims the suppliers filed in Hong Kong. The clash with vendors comes as private equity firm Ames Watson navigates its first holiday season as Claire's new owner and works to ensure it has the right merchandise in stock after buying the mall retailer and about 1,000 of its stores out of bankruptcy for $140 million in September.Since acquiring Claire's, Ames Watson has been trying to rebuild what co-founder Lawrence Berger previously told CNBC is a \"broken business.\" Its bid to get the company back to profitability will hinge in part on a successful holiday season and its ability to stock popular merchandise moving forward. The retailer's sprawling supply chain, made up of longtime vendors equipped to handle the rigorous safety standards governing children's products, has long been considered the company's \"secret sauce,\" former Claire's CEO Ron Marshall told CNBC. Without the support of those suppliers during its first bankruptcy in 2018, the retailer's holiday season would've been a \"nightmare,\" said Marshall, who led the company from 2016 to 2019.The dispute with suppliers adds another challenge for Ames Watson as it tries to fix the long struggling retailer. As the U.S. hits the final days of peak shopping, Ames Watson said \"Claire's has inventory in place for the holiday season.\"A clash over ordersClaire's disputes with its suppliers in Asia surround orders placed in the months before the retailer's second bankruptcy filing in August, when it was still owned by hedge fund Elliott Management and having financial difficulties. Claire's ordering volume for one supplier had dropped by 79% in March and 76% in April compared to the prior year, records reviewed by CNBC show. Then ordering ramped back up to the company's regular cadence in May and June, with volume down only 2% and 3% in those months, respectively, compared to 2024, according to the records.At the time Claire's increased its orders again, the company was running out of cash, considering outright liquidation and looking for a buyer to save its business, according to a declaration Claire's CEO Chris Cramer filed with the court after the company filed for bankruptcy. While the vendors, including those who are now pursuing legal action against the retailer, were aware the company was navigating financial difficulties when the orders were placed, they expected to be paid as they had been during the retailer's first bankruptcy filing, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. watch nowBut by the time the vendors finished manufacturing the body jewelry, nail polish and friendship bracelets Claire's had ordered ahead of the holiday shopping season, the retailer had filed for bankruptcy protection and the vendors weren't paid for some orders, the people said. When Ames Watson acquired the company, some of the vendors who were owed money agreed to keep working with Claire's without getting paid for those debts, concerned they'd lose one of their largest clients and potentially their business, the people said. But others refused, and have taken legal action against Claire's Hong Kong-based sourcing office RSI International, over millions in unpaid debts, according to claims the suppliers filed in the local court. Meanwhile, about a week after Ames Watson announced it would acquire Claire's out of bankruptcy, RSI International filed a notice to transfer its assets to a new entity. The business transfer gave creditors 30 days to file a claim to recoup unpaid debts, after which transferors aren't responsible for the obligations under Hong Kong Law.  In a statement to CNBC, Ames Watson didn't comment on RSI International. It said it was \"not involved in the operation or purchasing decisions made prior to the acquisition.\" \"Since then, we have focused on responsibly stewarding the business and engaging suppliers in good faith as we strengthen Claire's for the long term,\" the company said. \"We are excited about the company's direction in 2026,\" it added.Hedge fund Elliott Management, which owned Claire's at the time the orders were placed, declined to comment.The holiday stakesAt the core of Ames Watson's strategy to revive Claire's is improving its merchandise, which could become more difficult if the company has strained relationships with some suppliers. Compounding the problem is President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, which have already strained retail supply chains globally and raised costs for importers. Marshall, Claire's former CEO, said ensuring vendors in Asia got paid during the company's first bankruptcy was key to having the right products in place for the holiday season that year.\"These were suppliers where we had generational relationships and in many cases, represented 30, 40, 50% or even more of their total volume, and the intellectual capital that represented was core to the success of Claire's,\" Marshall said. \"There's a difference between having product on the shelves, which we could have done, and having the right product on the shelves.\"He said the disputes Claire's is having with its suppliers could \"disrupt the supply chain\" both now and moving forward, making a turnaround more difficult. \"There needs to be fresh, novel product to lure [customers] into the store, and if you don't have that continual replenishment of really exciting product, she's gonna pass you by,\" said Marshall. \"This is literally the most fickle customer in the world: an 8-year-old girl.\"",

    "body": "Workers stand on lifts in front of the newly added lettering for President Donald Trump's name at the facade of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, a day after its board announced it would rename the institution in Washington, Dec. 19, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's name was added to the facade of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts on Friday, a day after the center's board voted to rename that Washington institution the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\" Workers affixed Trump's name to the building, above the center's original name.The center's website had already been updated on Thursday to say it is now \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"\"Our Chairman, President Donald J. Trump, has not only saved this historic building but also created a truly bipartisan place to celebrate the arts,\" the center said in a statement Friday.Trump took effective control of the Kennedy Center in February, naming himself its chair and appointing the board of trustees, which voted for the new name on Thursday.White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the board \"voted unanimously\" for the name change. But Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who is an ex officio member of the board, disputed Leavitt's claim.\"As I tried to push my button to voice my concern, to ask questions and certainly not to vote in support of this, I was muted,\" Beatty said in a post to X. \"Yet it was said at the end it was a unanimous vote.\"Other board members also said they were muted during the vote, and that they would have voted against the name change.The law establishing the center in the 1960s says its name cannot be changed.And the law says \"no additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials shall be designated or installed in the public areas of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\"Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., said in a social media post that work on the building \"needs to stop as it's illegal to change without Congress.\"Missouri Republican Rep. Robert Onder in July proposed a bill to change the Kennedy Center's name to that of Trump's. The bill has no cosponsors. Kennedy family members were outraged by the center's name change.\"It is beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy,\" said Maria Shriver, who is a niece of the late president. \"It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable.\"Kennedy's grandson, Jack Schlossberg, suggested that the renaming was spurred by his decision to run for a House seat from New York.\"Trump explicitly motivated to act by JACK FOR NEW YORK,\" he said in a social media post. \"Our campaign represents everything Trump can't stand or defeat.\"CNBC requested comment from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for comment. He is the nephew of the late president.",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's new \"Gold Card\" visa program uses a novel definition of wealth as a job skill to allow the overseas wealthy to bypass immigration rules and secure citizenship, according to immigration attorneys.Trump last week announced the start of applications for the \"Trump Gold Card,\" a new investment visa for foreign nationals. In exchange for $1 million and a $15,000 processing fee, \"Gold Card\" applicants will get full-time residency in the U.S. in \"record time,\" according to the program's website. The website also offers a \"Corporate Gold Card,\" allowing companies to pay $2 million to secure a \"Gold Card\" for an employee, and a \"Platinum Card,\" which offers special tax benefits and may eventually be offered for $5 million. Only Congress can set immigration policy, meaning the president doesn't have the power to create or destroy a visa program. So to create the \"Gold Card,\" Trump is effectively adding a new fee model to two existing programs – known as EB-1 and EB-2 – experts explained to CNBC.The EB-1 and EB-2 programs are both employment-based programs aimed at attracting award-winning or celebrated professionals. The EB-1 program, nicknamed the \"Einstein Visa,\" is aimed at those with   \"extraordinary abilities\" – such as scientists, artists, entrepreneurs,  athletes and professors who have achieved \"sustained international or national acclaim.\"The EB-2 is for researchers, scientists and others whose skills are useful to help solve national problems, like a leading cancer researcher developing new treatments, or a top energy scientist who can help expand the power grid. White House officials say that the $1 million payment is proof that \"Gold Card\" holders are successful business people who meet the requirements for exceptional abilities. Anyone with $1 million to spend on a visa is likely to be a productive addition to the American economy and society, they say. Entrepreneurs who started companies overseas can come to the U.S. to expand or start new ventures, creating more jobs. Spending by the \"Gold Card\" wealthy is also expected to help real estate, the service economy and other industries.\"Why shouldn't we expedite the people who are willing to step up, to give the United States $1 million,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC last week. \"Let's bring in the top of the top, the best. Why should we take people who are below average?\"Immigration attorneys, however, say that replacing highly skilled or celebrated talents with foreign nationals whose sole qualification is writing a $1 million check distorts the intent of the EB-1 and EB-2 programs. Not everyone with $1 million payment is a high-achieving businessperson or entrepreneur, they say. Some may have borrowed the money from friends, family or a lender. Others may have inherited their fortunes but have scant job skills.\"Having $1 million has nothing to do with your value as a person of extraordinary ability,\" said Emily Neumann, an immigration attorney with Reddy Neumann Brown PC. \"It doesn't mean you are able to provide value to the United States of America. These categories were supposed to be reserved for people who can foster innovation and contribute to the economy and create jobs. There is no requirement that \"Gold Card\" holders have a track record of any of those things, just because they happen to have $1 million.\" While \"Gold Card\" applicants can't legally skip the current waiting line for EB-1 and EB-2 holders, some attorneys fear the White House will give \"Gold Card\" applicants priority. Neumann said she has an Indian client who's a leading expert in artificial intelligence and machine learning and is working on AI applications for doctors to better diagnose patients. He's approved for the EB-1 but is still waiting on a green card, which could take years.\"They're using up a limited number of green cards meant for people who have done wonderful things,\" she said. \"It's a very different standard.\"Using the EB-1 and EB-2 programs for the \"Gold Card\" program has created other potential hurdles. While Trump has said he would sell \"millions\" of \"Gold Cards,\" and Lutnick said sales could raise $1 trillion in revenue, the two programs are capped at around 28,000 a year. Individual countries are capped at 7% of the total, which is why the the waiting list for E-1 and E-2 applications  from India and China already extends for several years. Immigration attorneys say India and China would be largest sources of demand for \"Gold Cards.\" Yet because of the waiting lists, few are likely to apply.\"If 'Gold Card' holders will be allowed to jump the queue, there will likely be lawsuits from those currently on the wait list,\" said Reaz Jafri, an immigration attorney with the international law firm Withers. \"And if not, who will want to pay the $1 million and then wait for three years?\"The unanswered questions and legal risks surrounding the \"Gold Card\" have caused potential buyers to hold off on applying, attorneys say. Dominic Volek, group head of private clients at Henley & Partners, said a number of his clients in Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore are interested in the \"Gold Card\" but are waiting for proof that the program works.Some are also worried about paying the $1 million and then having their visas overturned by a court or a future Democratic administration.\"They want to see the dust settle and see if there are any major legal challenges,\" Volek said.Another concern is the structure of the fee. While some national investment visas are more expensive – such as Singapore's at nearly $8 million or New Zealand's at nearly $3 million – they're structured as investments rather than non-refundable payments. Without an explicit guarantee of a green card, the overseas wealthy are reluctant to pay the $1 million.\"It's not clear if you make the payment once it's approved or you provide the payment as evidence, or if it's kept in escrow during the process,\" Jafri said. \"They haven't addressed so many basic questions.\"Proof of funds is proving to be another hurdle for the overseas wealthy. In order to screen for money laundering or criminal activity, the U.S. government typically requires proof that the $1 million fee didn't come from illegal or illicit sources. Many potential applicants from Asia, Africa and the Middle East are already balking at the demands, since financial documentation is not as thorough.\"The biggest sticking point for a lot of clients is being able to document the source of money,\" Jafri said. \"In certain parts of the world it's not so easy to document.\"",

    "body": "A guest poses for a photograph during the Jellycat Road Trip to Joy at Nordstrom Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.Jeff Schear / Stringer/ Getty ImagesChristmas is just around the corner and if you're stuck on what to gift your Gen Z family members, a cuddly plush toy might be the answer this year.  2025 has proved that toys are not just for kids, as more young adults show off extensive collections of plushies. Experts say it signals a longing for community and a return to childhood. The popularity has been driven by a manic craze for Labubu dolls — collectable toys produced by Chinese toy company Pop Mart — as well as for soft toys, also known as \"Jellies,\" designed by British brand Jellycat. Brightly coloured stuffed animals and wide-eyed dolls can be seen lined up on walls or falling out of overstuffed shelves, in videos posted by Gen Z on TikTok.The platform — which has become a barometer for Gen Z trends — is currently home to millions of videos showing young adults obsessed with plushies. Videos range from building a \"Labubu wall,\" to hacks on finding authentic Labubus, or a five-rack shelf dedicated to displaying Jellies.\"It's the biggest year we've ever seen of adults buying toys,\" Melissa Symonds, U.K. toys director at global consumer insights firm Circana, told CNBC Make It in an interview.\"Adults of all ages do buy into toys, but it's primarily the younger, the Gen Z people, that are really driving this strong growth that we've had in the last few years,\" Symonds said. Labubu dolls are on display at a Pop Mart store in Shanghai, China.Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesIn fact, a recent Circana report found that 43% of U.K. adults bought a toy for themselves or another adult this year, and that rises to 76% for Gen Z shoppers between the ages of 18 to 34-years-old.Across toy genres, plushies are the fourth most popular category for adults, with games and puzzles ranking top, followed by building sets like LEGO, and action figures coming in at third place, according to data from Circanca shared with CNBC.It's a similar story across the pond, with sales of licensed toys increasing by 18% for U.S. adults over the age of 18 in the first half of the year, per Circana. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when  you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life.\"Melissa Symonds Executive director of toys at CircanaSymonds explained that businesses are tapping into what's called the \"joy economy\" in which consumers seek out comfort and nostalgia in products and experiences, especially when faced with economic or political pressures. \"The economy, the wars, everything is really depressing and serious, whereas toys just bring a little bit of joy back into life,\" Symonds said.  Pop Mart and Jellycat have benefited from that trend. Pop Mart posted a near 400% surge in net profit in the first half of the year, and its revenue jumped 204.4% year on year to 13.88 billion yuan ($1.93 billion). In 2024, roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, Pop Mart previously told CNBC Make It. Meanwhile, Jellycat saw its revenue rise 66% to £333 million in 2024, up from £200 million in 2023. Its profit before tax more than doubled to £139 million, up from £67 million the prior year. \"Seeing the response across multiple generations to our new characters has been wonderful,\" Jellycat's CEO Arnaud Meysselle said in a statement to CNBC. \"It's been amazing to meet so many adults discovering Jellycat for the first time at our recent experience launches in Beijing, Seoul, and Los Angeles — and to welcome many others into our online communities,\" Meysselle said. 'Peter Pan effect' Guests attend the Jellycat X Selfridges Amuseables Bag launch in London, England.Dave Benett | Dave Benett Collection | Getty ImagesFans of Jellycat, Labubu, and plushies in general span from corporate workers to military personnel who tout the benefits the toys have on their mental health on TikTok, as they grapple with increasingly stressful adult lives. Circana's Symonds said that this is a symptom of the \"Peter Pan effect\" which refers to a psychological syndrome where adults struggle to grow up and take on responsibilities. \"There's almost this irony that when you're a kid, you can't wait to grow up, but then when you're an adult, you realize that being a kid was the best time of your life,\" she said. \"There's a bit of that Peter Pan effect where they [Gen Z consumers] don't want to grow up, but I think it's just holding on to that joy element that brings them happiness.\" Gen Z adults have had it fairly rough as a generation as many say they were priced out of the adulthood they were promised. Economic and geopolitical turmoil has disrupted their lives, footage of war replays on their social media feeds every day, and the cost of living continues to skyrocket. Some of the conflicts they've seen through their adult lives include the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to the Israel-Hamas war. And to top it all off, rising inflation means their buying power decreases every day with economic milestones like buying a house or starting a family feeling out of reach. Many Gen Z are instead \"doom spending\" to fill the gap. This refers to a phenomenon where people splash out on small luxuries like travel, designer goods, or even expensive toys because they know they might never be able to afford bigger milestones like owning a home or even children. Delaying parenthood also means Gen Z have more disposable income to spend on small luxuries. \"I think some of it might be because they're [Gen Z] choosing to have kids slightly older, so they've got a slightly longer period of time where they have money coming in, but don't necessarily have to spend it on schools or lunch boxes, so they're choosing to spend it on themselves to bring themselves some happiness,\" Symonds said.'Part of the community' Alongside economic woes, Gen Z have also struggled with loneliness and for some, buying and collecting toys can help them feel like they're part of a community. Some 85% of British Gen Z reported experiencing feelings of loneliness, according to a Hinge survey that polled 2,000 Gen Z adults in the U.K. in March. More than half of low-income young adults experienced severe loneliness, according to the research. Jellycat's Meysselle explained that the brand has looked to create a community for its fans from launching Instagram and TikTok accounts in 2022, both of which have racked up over two million followers since. Jellycat Fish & Chips Experience at Selfridges, London.Tim CharlesIt's also invested in themed pop-up experiences that fans can visit in person, from Jellycat Fish & Chips in Selfridges in London, to Jellycat Patisserie in Galeries Lafayette in Paris, and Jellycat Diner in FAO Schwarz in New York. Around 80% of fans that turned up to Jellycat's Space Experience in Seoul that was launched in November, were in their 20s and 30s — the largest percentage of adults at a Jellycat experience so far. Selfridges' toy buyer Joe Evans told CNBC Make It that Jellycat is its fastest-selling toy brand, and, in the past two years, there's been \"a meteoric rise\" in Gen Z and millennial customers who want to \"feel like they're part of a community and collect,\" toys. \"When you purchase a Jellycat, you feel like you're part of a community, you feel like you're part of something, there are a lot of groups online that talk, and people race each other for the best and the newest product,\" he added.

    "body": "Shoppers at the Glendale Galleria in Glendale, Calif., on Dec. 20, 2025, the final weekend of Christmas gift buying.Myung J. Chun | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesU.S. consumers showed resilience this holiday season, driving retail spending up 4.2% year over year, according to preliminary data released Tuesday by Visa.The report from Visa Consulting and Analytics indicated that despite lingering economic headwinds, shoppers were still spending, particularly on technology and personal goods. The findings tracked payments activity over a seven-week period beginning Nov. 1 using a subset of Visa payments network data in the U.S. and cover core retail categories, excluding spending on automotive, gasoline and restaurants. The figures are also not adjusted for inflation.In-store shopping accounted for the bulk of holiday spending, capturing 73% of total retail payment volume during the period, while online purchases made up the remaining 27%. However, e-commerce was the primary driver of growth, with online sales rising 7.8% compared with last year, reflecting continued demand for convenience and early-season promotions.\"The underlying surprise here ... is that consumer spending is holding up reasonably well in light of softer consumer confidence than we had this time last year and a number of headwinds and concerns about inflation,\" Michael Brown, principal U.S. economist at Visa, told CNBC.Brown noted that the 2025 holiday season marked a distinct shift in consumer behavior, citing the growing influence of artificial intelligence in how shoppers find products and compare prices. \"We are seeing consumers use AI in a big way in comparison shopping and then helping to narrow down that perfect gift,\" Brown said. \"This is the first holiday shopping season where roughly half of the consumers in that survey responded that they are going to leverage AI for one of those two tasks.\"Read moreThe breakdown of spending categories highlights a shift toward personal goods and convenience, and away from home renovation projects.Electronics emerged as the season's top-performing category, with sales climbing 5.8%. Visa attributed this jump to a refresh cycle driven by \"high-performance devices in the AI era.\"Apparel and accessories also posted strong numbers, rising 5.3%. General merchandise stores — retailers that offer a \"one-stop\" experience — saw a 3.7% lift.Conversely, the home improvement sector struggled during the holidays. Spending on building materials and garden equipment fell 1%, suggesting consumers prioritized gift-giving and gadgets over home maintenance as the year closed out. Furniture and home furnishings remained essentially flat, eking out a 0.8% gain.While the headline number is positive for the retail sector, the lack of inflation adjustment means the \"real\" volume growth will likely be more modest depending on the final Consumer Price Index readings for the period. Currently, Brown said, real spending growth adjusted for inflation is still up about 2.2% this season. \"That's not too bad in light of a lot of uncertainty this year,\" Brown said. \"The consumer is uncertain, they're cautious, but they're also smart about how they're spending their money.\"Visa's numbers also point to a disconnect between sentiment and action this season. According to the CNBC All-America Economic Survey released last week, 41% of Americans said they planned to spend less for the holidays this year, 6 points higher than a year ago.The CNBC survey found that the high cost of goods was emerging as a major factor in determining how much shoppers spend and where they spend, suggesting yearslong inflation and the rise in import goods prices from tariffs are being felt at checkout.",

    "body": "An aerial view of Singapore's Marina Bay Street Circuit on Sept. 17, 2024.Roslan Rahman | Afp | Getty ImagesSingapore's inflation in November remained steady at 1.2%, missing estimates, as a higher increase in prices of services was offset by a steeper decline in electricity costs.The reading was lower than Reuters-polled analysts' median estimates of 1.3%.  Core inflation in the city-state, which strips out prices of private transport and accommodation, also came in at 1.2%, compared to expectations of 1.3%.Higher services inflation at 1.9% was due to larger increases in the costs of point-to-point transport, which includes taxis, ride-hailing and car-pooling services, and health insurance.In contrast, inflation for retail and other goods slowed as the prices of clothing and footwear, as well as personal-care appliances declined, in addition to the fall in electricity costs.Core inflation is forecast to be around 0.5% in 2025, before rising to 0.5%–1.5% in 2026. Headline inflation is expected to average 0.5%–1.0% in 2025 and 0.5%-1.5% in 2026, MAS said in a statement.\"Supply shocks, including those stemming from geopolitical developments, could lift some imported costs abruptly. However, a sharper-than-expected weakening in global demand could keep core inflation lower for longer,\" the statement said.The inflation reading comes after better-than-expected economic data from Singapore, with non-oil exports surging 11.6% year on year in November, beating estimates of a 7% rise. Singapore's economy grew at 4.2% in the third quarter, also beating expectations of 4% expansion. Last month, the Singapore's ministry of trade and industry upgraded the country's annual GDP forecast to \"around 4%,\" and about 1%-3% for 2026, a sharp revision from April's forecast, when it had warned that zero growth was also a possibility. The ministry said that the global environment had proved more resilient than anticipated, with manufacturing and export demand remaining strong in the third quarter. MAS has held its monetary policy steady for the last two meetings, after easing it in January and April meetings amid the threat of tariffs over the global economy. ",

    "body": "Ted Sarandos, left, co-CEO of Netflix, and David Zaslav, CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery.Mario Anzuoni | Mike Blake | ReutersHours before Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix, Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, called WBD CEO David Zaslav to inform him Netflix wouldn't be bidding any higher. WBD shareholders now have a chance to call Sarandos' bluff.WBD shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash, though that deadline may be artificial. Paramount can extend it all the way to WBD's annual meeting, which hasn't been set yet but this year took place June 2. If Paramount acquires 51% of outstanding WBD shares, it would control the company, even though the WBD board already agreed to sell the company's studio and streaming assets to Netflix. Both Netflix and Paramount can use the coming days and weeks to speak with WBD shareholders to gauge whether they'd like to take Paramount's offer or stick with the board's recommendation to sell to Netflix. To tender or not to tender, that is the question. There are sound arguments for both sides. The decision also presents a game theory element for shareholders who may simply want a bidding war rather than caring about the right buyer.To tenderThere are two overarching reasons why a shareholder might tender their holdings to Paramount. The first is if the investor believes Paramount's $30-per-share, all-cash offer for the entirety of WBD is more valuable than Netflix's $27.75-per-share bid for just the Warner Bros. film studio and HBO Max streaming business. The second is a belief that tendering shares is the best way to force a bidding war between Netflix and Paramount.A shareholder could decide Paramount's current offer is better than Netflix's if they think it has a higher likelihood of regulatory approval or if they believe Discovery Global — the portfolio of linear cable networks including CNN, TNT, Discovery, HGTV and TBS that's set to be spun out — will have minimal value as a publicly traded company. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison told CNBC earlier this month he values Discovery Global at $1 per share, given his prediction on the likely multiple (two times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) at which it will trade based on current valuations for similar linear cable networks. If WBD doesn't agree to sell the entire company to Paramount, it plans to split Discovery Global out as its own publicly traded entity in mid-2026. Paramount's argument is that $30 per share is already greater than Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer plus $1 per share for Discovery Global. David Ellison, CEO of Paramount Skydance, exits following an interview at the New York Stock Exchange, Dec. 8, 2025.Brendan Mcdermid | ReutersParamount's bid is also all cash, while Netflix's bid includes 16% equity with a so-called collar, which means shareholders won't know exactly how much Netflix stock they'll actually receive until the deal closes. As for regulatory approval, Paramount has played up arguments that a combined Netflix and HBO Max streaming business would be anticompetitive. Netflix has more than 300 million global paying customers. The idea of the largest streamer buying HBO Max has already raised concerns with politicians, including President Donald Trump, who said there may be a \"market share\" issue with a Netflix deal. While Paramount would combine Paramount+ with HBO Max, Paramount+ has about 80 million subscribers, presenting less of a risk to competition. The second, more nuanced argument to tender is to maximize upside even if the assets ultimately go to Netflix. Ellison has already made it known Paramount's $30-per-share offer isn't best and final. Tendering could cause Netflix to come back with a higher offer, which may then prompt Paramount to raise its bid as well. GAMCO Investors chairman and CEO Mario Gabelli told CNBC earlier this month \"the notion of Company A and Company B having a bidding war — that's what we like as part of the free market system.\" He added last week that while he was previously leaning toward tendering his shares to Paramount, \"the most important part is to keep it in play.\" Not to tenderOther shareholders may believe, in contrast, that not tendering is the best way of jumpstarting a bidding war. If Paramount sees that it's not getting traction with shareholders as the annual meeting gets closer, it may raise its bid to get more shareholders on board. There are additional reasons not to tender. Shareholders may want the Netflix and Discovery Global equity portion of the Netflix proposal. In a WBD filing last week, the company said a mystery \"Company C\" proposed to acquire Discovery Global and its 20% stake in WBD's streaming and studios business for $25 billion in cash. That bid was rejected by the WBD board as \"not actionable.\" Still, the mystery bid suggests there may be an interested buyer in all of Discovery Global if it gets spun out, which could result in far more than $1 per share, according to Rich Greenfield, an analyst at LightShed Partners. That's a good reason not to tender, he said, because it makes the Netflix offer much more valuable than Paramount's bid. Ensuring WBD splits Discovery Global is also the safe play for shareholders in case regulators block a Paramount-WBD merger, Greenfield said. Since the Paramount deal is for all of WBD, including CNN, Ellison's bid — which includes roughly $24 billion from Middle Eastern sovereign funds — may run into regulatory and political hurdles, Greenfield noted.\"You want the split to happen,\" Greenfield said in an interview. \"If the Paramount deal doesn't get regulatory approval, now you've prevented the split from happening. You're stuck in 2027 with declining cable networks, and you haven't spun them off. Does the U.S. really want a company funded by more Middle Eastern money than money from the Ellisons owning CNN?\" 'Where's Poppa?'WBD's board has argued part its reasoning for rejecting Paramount's $30-per-share bid was its concern with financing, noting more funding comes from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds than the Ellison family, which has committed about $12 billion. Paramount altered the terms of its deal Monday to help address funding concerns. Oracle founder Larry Ellison, the father of David and one of the world's five wealthiest people, agreed to provide \"an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" should the existing financing fall through, Paramount said in a statement. Paramount also said Monday it will publish records confirming the Ellison family trust \"owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that all material liabilities of the Ellison family trust are publicly disclosed.\" Paramount has said the family trust will backstop the financing. WBD's board had previously argued the trust is an \"opaque entity,\" preferring a direct commitment from the Ellisons. Notably, even with the Monday announcement, the Ellisons haven't increased their personal equity investment, which still stands at $12 billion. Internally, some WBD executives have cited the 1970 Carl Reiner movie \"Where's Poppa?\" when speaking about the bid, according to a person familiar with the matter. WBD has pushed for the Ellisons to commit more personal money to the deal. Still, a WBD shareholder may not care where the funding is coming from as long as it's there. The three SWFs involved in the deal are the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi's L'imad Holding Co. and the Qatar Investment Authority. The PIF and QIA, in particular, are known institutions that have contributed billions of dollars to other U.S.-based deals.Correction: This story has been revised to correct that Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders have until Jan. 21 to tender their shares to Paramount for $30 in cash. A previous version misstated this deadline.",

    "body": "Key PointsCapitol Hill's \"Crypto Queen,\" Sen. Cynthia Lummis, will retire at the end of her term in 2026.Lummis leads the Senate subcommittee on crypto, where she is a fierce ally of the industry. Her retirement tees up a Republican primary in Wyoming, a deeply Republican state. Senator Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., listens during a panel titled ''Make the Greatest Economy in the World Work for All Americans'' at the America First Policy Institute America First Agenda Summit in Washington, July 26, 2022.Sarah Silbiger | ReutersThe cryptocurrency industry is mourning the loss of its fiercest advocate on Capitol Hill after Sen. Cynthia Lummis announced Friday she would not seek reelection. Lummis, R-Wyo., said last week that the \"difficult, exhausting\" final weeks of this year's Congress led her to withdraw her reelection bid, saying she's \"come to accept that I do not have six more years in me.\"Lummis is chair of the Senate Banking Committee's crypto subpanel and a reliable ally for the industry — helping muscle through the Genius Act, a first-of-its-kind bill regulating stablecoins, in July. She is currently negotiating legislation as part of an industry-backed push for broader regulation of cryptocurrency. Crypto interests bemoaned her retirement, which sets up a primary for her seat in ruby-red Wyoming in 2026. \"Senator Lummis has been a great ally on crypto — very sorry to see her go!\" said David Sacks, the White House AI and crypto czar, in a post to X. Conner Brown, the head of strategy and the Bitcoin Policy Institute, called Lummis \"the Senate's first and finest bitcoiner.\"\"We are incredibly lucky to have had her leadership at so many critical moments for bitcoin policy over these critical years,\" Brown said. Read more CNBC politics coverageEuropean Union approves over $105 billion toward Ukraine aid package for next two yearsBrown and MIT prof shooter suspect Neves Valente is found dead, authorities saysTrump Media to merge with fusion company TAE Technologies, DJT stock soarsTrump announces 'warrior dividend' of $1,776 to U.S. soldiers in prime-time speechEpstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell petitions to vacate sex crime convictionCongressional stock trading ban bill to get a vote in new year: House RepublicansFBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino is stepping down in JanuaryObamacare subsidies extension to get vote after 4 Republicans buck leadershipFCC chief Carr tells Senate that his agency is 'not formally ... independent'Trump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowKennedy Center to be renamed 'Trump-Kennedy Center,' White House saysTrump vowed to block tankers carrying Venezuela's oil — nearly a dozen at sea nowHouse passes bill to ease permits for building out AI infrastructureTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationAnd Coinbase vice president of U.S. policy Kara Calvert said Lummis has \"helped bring digital assets from the fringes of policy debates to the floor of the U.S. Senate.\"\"I can think of no better way to cap off her legacy than passing the landmark market structure legislation she's fought so hard to advance,\" Calvert said.Lummis was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, where she served until 2016. She was elected to the Senate in 2020, becoming the first female senator from Wyoming. Republican Rep. Harriet Hageman is Wyoming's lone representative in the House. People familiar with her thinking told NBC News she is likely to run for Lummis' seat. Whoever wins a Republican primary for the seat is highly favored to win the general election. President Donald Trump carried Wyoming by more than 45 points in the 2024 election. Hageman defeated then-Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., in 2022. Cheney lost Trump's favor after she voted to impeach him in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and joined Democrats in investigating his conduct that day. Hageman lauded Lummis for her work on crypto in a statement, saying Lummis' \"forward-looking approach reflects her belief that financial and technological progress can coexist and allow for individual freedom and fiscal safety.\" — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.

Spot gold was up 1.99% to $4,440.26 per ounce. Prices are up nearly 70% since the start of the year.The metal has soared this year, smashing consecutive price records as risk assets lost ground. Gold is typically viewed as a safe haven asset in times of economic or geopolitical turbulence.

Due to outsized fiscal deficits in the U.S., U.K., Europe, and increasingly Japan and China, \"the monetary value of gold has arguably reemerged,\" according to Matthew McLennan, head of global value team at First Eagle Investments.\"The value of gold as a monetary potential hedge has reemerged,\" McLennan told CNBC's \"The Exchange\" on Dec. 17. \"Gold went from being depressed relative to the nominal assets that you would want to use as a potential hedge against it, to more rationally valued. And I think the other precious metal complexes followed it higher with some leverage.\"watch nowInvestors will also be watching the race for the nomination of the next chair of the Federal Reserve, with the central bank's independence and credibility in question following repeated pressure from U.S. President Trump on existing chair Jerome Powell.\"What we're quite focused on here is the long term fiscal credibility of the United States, because I think that is the condition precept for having an independent Fed and for having a rational chair,\" McLennan added.He also has his eye on wage inflation. \"So really what's going to matter going forward is a function of whether job openings, which have inflected higher recently, whether they follow corporate earnings higher,\" he said.

    "body": "Formula 1 cars and a circuit made with Lego are displayed at the 2025 Canadian International AutoShow at the Metro Convention Centre in Toronto, Feb. 21, 2025.Nurphoto | Getty ImagesLego is rebuilding how consumers engage with motorsport brick by brick.In 2025, Lego kicked off a partnership with Formula 1 that brought officially licensed sets to global retail shelves and immersive experiences to races around the world. In the nearly year since launch, the collaboration has bolstered fan engagement for both brands, lead to promotional sales of Lego products and expanded the demographic reach for the toy company and the racing organization.In August, Lego CEO Niels Christiansen touted the company's Formula 1 sets as one of the innovations that fueled record first-half revenue and operating profit. The company, which is privately held, reported a 12% year-over-year revenue bump to 34.6 billion Danish kroner, or $5.4 billion, for the first six months of 2025.\"It is a massively growing fan base,\" Julia Goldin, chief product and marketing officer at Lego, told CNBC. \"It is the biggest motorsport now in terms of its fandom. ... We felt that we could really tap into that and deliver something very unique.\"With Formula 1, Lego isn't just leveraging an existing fandom, it's expanding it, bringing underserved demographics into the world of racing and engaging new customers. \"Lego has a great reputation for picking out the right trends to become a part of, and motorsports in recent years has been on a real upswing,\" said James Zahn, editor in chief of The Toy Book.\"F1, as we've seen, has just become a cultural juggernaut where it is attracting an audience that isn't your typical motorsports fan,\" he said. \"It seems to transcend ages and interests.\"ESPN, which broadcast the 2025 F1 season in the U.S., reported record viewership numbers for the races. The Disney-owned sports network saw an average of 1.3 million viewers across its stations and platforms through the majority of the racing calendar. That was up from a previous record of 1.21 million viewers set in 2022 and up from just 554,000 in 2018, the first year of ESPN's broadcasting deal with F1.Next year, U.S. broadcasting rights move to Apple TV following the success of the Apple-distributed \"F1: The Movie,\" which hit cinemas in June.F1 Academy Lego car model during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Las Vegas on Nov. 19, 2025 in Las Vegas.Hector Vivas | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesIn expanding its catalog of products — introducing meticulously designed F1 car brick sets, complete with team-accurate liveries — Lego has built gateways into the brand for newcomers. \"At the heart of it was understanding our audience's passion points,\" Goldin said. \"When we choose to go into a partnership, could we see ourselves doing something unique that would offer real value ... we felt like we had a real opportunity to deliver experiences that they would really love.\"The F1 portfolio included products for Lego's Duplo line for preschool children, traditional sets for casual builders and Lego Technic sets for more advanced builders.

Building a new future\"Lego is one of our dream partners,\" said Susie Wolff, managing director of F1 Academy, an all-female racing league under the broader F1 umbrella. \"When they joined Formula 1, I immediately reached out to Julia [Goldin], the [chief product and marketing officer], and said, 'Listen, could we explore doing something together with F1 Academy?'\" Wolff told CNBC. \"There's just so many synergies between what they're trying to do and what our main mission is.\"F1 Academy held its inaugural season in 2023. The division was established to address the lack of female drives in the F1 series and aims to develop young female drivers and prepare them for higher levels of competition.\"We're trying to break down the preconceptions of motorsport being a male-dominated environment,\" Wolff said, noting Lego has similarly made strides to promote inclusivity with its brick sets.As part of the ongoing relationship between the two brands, Lego has signed on as a team sponsor for an F1 Academy car starting in 2026. Behind the wheel is Esmee Kosterman, a 20-year-old Dutch driver.F1 Academy Lego livery reveal during previews ahead of the F1 Grand Prix of Las Vegas at Las Vegas Strip Circuit in Las Vegas, Nov. 19, 2025.Hector Vivas | Getty Images Sport | Getty ImagesLego's Goldin said while the F1 Academy partnership is an extension of the existing racing partnership, \"they're doing it in a unique way, because they are actually partnering up to support a life-size car and the driver.\" \"That's a very important element of bringing more attention and kind of underscoring the credibility and authenticity of women participating in motorsports and, importantly, for their parents to see the opportunity [and] potential for them to be engaged in the sport,\" Goldin said. Zahn of The Toy Book described the collaboration between Lego and Formula 1, particularly the F1 Academy, as a \"perfect partnership.\"\"[The] Female motorsports fan has always been there, but they haven't necessarily been embraced on the consumer product side of things,\" he said.Wolff and Goldin both noted that one of the fastest-growing segments of the Formula 1 fan base is women. \"We are tapping exactly into the the trend of this fandom and we're adding value to the partner, as well,\" Goldin said. \"We see from our data that not only are we engaging more F1 fans with the Lego brand, but vice versa. There are more Lego brand fans that are now becoming fans of Formula 1.\"",

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | ReutersH-1B applicants face a challenging year ahead as political pushback to the visas is reinforced with a slew of actions from the U.S. administration.On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in India posted on X that since Dec. 15, it has started conducting online presence reviews of all H-1B and H-4 visa applicants in a bid to curb the \"abuse of the H-1B program.\"The U.S. Department of Labour last week proposed a wage protection law, which experts said could dissuade companies from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees. This would \"substantially increase the prevailing wage across the board for all H-1B holders,\" Manish Daftari, partner at immigration consultancy Vialto Partners, told CNBC. He added that \"companies will most likely reduce the number of H-1B sponsorship\" once this rule is implemented. In addition, a proposal by the Department of Homeland Security for a weighted selection rule that prioritizes the highest-paid workers when making selections for the H-1B lottery is reportedly in the final stages of review.\"These rules could make the H-1B largely inaccessible to recent graduates and early career professionals– even if they work in emerging or critical fields,\" warned Cecilia Esterline, Niskanen Center's senior immigration policy analyst.Any changes to the H-1B rules will likely disproportionately hurt Indians, as they dominate the program, making up more than 70% of the recipients in recent years.Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Tata Consultancy Services, and Google are the top five employers sponsoring H-1B visas, according to data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.\"If one or both rules are implemented, there may be some job losses, but the biggest impact will likely be that companies move away from sponsoring H-1Bs for employees,\" said Daftari.H-1B disruptions Many H-1B applicants are already facing significant delays as U.S. consulates in India are rescheduling visa appointments to comply with the social vetting requirements.The rescheduling of appointments that has occurred in the last two weeks — often with no notice — \"has created substantial disruption in people's ability to return to the U.S.,\" said Daftari.Most of the December and January appointments have been moved to March and April, with some pushed back even as far as August, he said.The U.S. Department of State is conducting social media reviews of all H-1B and H-4 applicants globally as part of standard visa screening.The goal of the social media review is to identify security threats and discrepancies in applicant information, such as job title differences on LinkedIn, but experts have questioned the need for extra scrutiny for all applicants. Applying social media review to all cases, including renewing applicants, \"is an inefficient and possibly ineffective policy\" which could create \"delays for American employers and consumers,\" said Esterline.Political undertonesVisa candidates are set encounter increased challenges next year as more policy changes come into force.\"Most of these policies appear to be for appeasing domestic political constituencies,\" said Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies. He noted that there might be an eventual workaround for some of these rules as the need for \"skills in U.S. tech is non-negotiable.\"U.S. Vice President JD Vance said Sunday that his government has worked \"to restrict H-1B visas\" because it believes it is wrong for companies \"to bypass American labor just to go for cheaper options in the third world.\"Vance was most likely referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's move to raise the H-1B visa fee to $100,000 for new applications. watch nowWhile these restrictions caused a slowdown in hiring and a shrinking of the talent pool, they also had the desired effect as companies explored ways to upskill their existing workforces and build new talent pipelines to American universities and large companies.But the decisions to levy hefty fees for H-1B visas also incurred backlash from industries and policymakers.In October, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for imposing a $100,000 fee for the H-1B worker visas. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that attorneys general of 20 states, including California and New York, have sued the Trump administration for raising the fee for H-1B visas.\"This administration has taken advantage of valid concerns about the H-1B to justify a broad-brush approach to limiting H-1B access,\" Esterline said.",

Lori Van Buren | Albany Times Union | Hearst Newspapers | Getty ImagesHoliday road-trippers are feeling some relief at the pump this year.The average price of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. has been below $3 a gallon for most of the month — the lowest level since 2021, according to AAA. The association said it's shaping up to be the cheapest December for drivers filling up their tanks going back to the pandemic year of 2020.Fuel prices are down about 7% from a month ago, AAA data shows, and have tumbled roughly 43% from mid-2022 highs near $5 a gallon that followed runaway inflation in the wake of the pandemic.The latest slide in prices comes as AAA forecasts a record of more than 122 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles from home in the 13 days between Dec. 20 and Jan. 1. AAA found nearly nine of 10 people on the move for the holiday — or close to 110 million — are expected to travel by car.The drop in pump prices may help mitigate the impact of lingering inflation elsewhere during the holiday season.Just over 40% of those polled said they planned to spend less at the holidays this year, a six-point increase from a year ago, according to CNBC's All-America Economic Survey. Of those that are pinching pennies, 46% blamed the high cost of goods.The national average masks wide, regional variances, as Hawaii and California both recorded average gas prices above $4 on Monday. In Oklahoma, meanwhile, a gallon came in just below $2.30.",

    "body": "The logo of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean at their office building in Seoul, South Korea, October 15, 2025. Kim Hong-ji | ReutersShares of South Korean firm Hanwha Ocean surged 10% Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the firm would help build new frigates for the country's Navy. Speaking at a press conference, Trump said that the warships will be built at the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in Philadelphia, acquired by the South Korean company in 2024, and in which it has pledged to invest $5 billion as part of South Korea's $150 billion shipbuilding pledge. The shipbuilding pledge is part of the broader U.S.-South Korea trade deal that saw tariffs reduced on South Korean exports to 15%, in exchange for a $350 billion investment pledge from Seoul, among other concessions. Hanwha Ocean is one of South Korea's major shipbuilding firms, having expertise in building commercial ships such as LNG carriers, as well as and military naval platforms including submarines and surface vessels. South Korean defense stocks have been on a roll this year, with major defense players such as Hanhwa Aerospace and Hyundai Rotem gaining over 170% and 270%, respectively year to date. Hanhwa Ocean has surged more 220% so far this year. watch nowLast week, the U.S. Navy announced the FF(X) class of ships — smaller combatant ships — which it said will complement larger, multi-mission warships and enhance operational flexibility around the globe. Secretary of the Navy John Phelan said the new frigate class would be part of Trump's envisioned \"Golden Fleet.\"Trump on Monday stateside said that the U.S. Navy will build two new \"Trump-class\" battleships, and may expand the count to as much as 25 such ships. The U.S. president described the ships as \"some of the most lethal surface warfare ships,\" adding that the they will \"help maintain American military supremacy, [and] inspire fear in America's enemies all over the world.\"Describing them as \"the fastest, the biggest, and by far, 100 times more powerful than any battleship ever built,\" the Trump-class battleships are envisioned to be equipped with hypersonic weapons, lasers, cruise missiles, and nuclear weapons, according to the U.S. President.",

    "body": "Shares in Novo Nordisk surged over 7% Tuesday, after the Wegovy maker secured approval of its GLP-1 pill — a world first. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of Novo Nordisk's GLP-1 pill gives the Danish pharmaceutical giant a head start over U.S. rival Eli Lilly. The pill's starting dose of 1.5 milligrams will be available in pharmacies and via select telehealth providers with savings offers for $149 per month in early January, the firm said. Cash-paying patients can access it for the same price via President Donald Trump's direct-to-consumer website, TrumpRx, according to the deal Novo Nordisk struck with his administration last month. Drug pricing has been top of mind this year as the U.S. looks to reduce the costs paid by consumers.watch nowThe approval caps a turbulent year for Novo, which has been marked by board drama, supply chain shortages, a bidding war against Pfizer, and criticisms over the execution of its U.S. strategy. Eli Lilly is expected to launch its own pill soon, having filed for FDA approval. However, Novo's clinical data looks \"fantastic,\" Rajesh Kumar, who heads up European life Sciences and healthcare equity research at HSBC, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.It has food and water restrictions, which may make it harder for GPs to prescribe but its tolerability and efficacy are better than Eli Lilly's pill, Kumar said. \"Novo actually might have an edge, and it will entirely depend on how they execute,\" he added. Lilly also reported positive findings from a maintenance trial where patients switched directly from taking the company's injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk's rival shot Wegovy. This may help Lilly \"keep a bit of market share,\" Kumar said. \"That's the thing we have to watch,\" he added. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino also contributed to this report.",

    "body": "US film producer David Ellison arrives for Paramount's \"Transformers: Rise Of The Beasts\" premiere in New York City on June 5, 2023. Angela Weiss | Afp | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance on Monday guaranteed the backing of billionaire Larry Ellison in an amended offer for Warner Bros. Discovery — a clear response to questions raised by the WBD board of directors. \"Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" the company said in a news release. Paramount said Ellison, the father of Paramount CEO David Ellison, has also agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust or adversely transfer its assets during a pending transaction. The guarantee does not replace committed funds from RedBird Capital and sovereign wealth funds, but constitutes a new layer of security for the commitments. Paramount Skydance is offering $30 per share, all cash, for Warner Bros. Discovery in a hostile attempt that's meant to rival an agreement with Netflix. Last week, Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC's David Faber the board had concerns about the supposed backing of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison in the bid. \"We were not confident that one of the richest people in the world would be there at closing,\" Di Piazza said at the time. \"Doing a deal is great; closing a deal is better.\"WBD earlier this month agreed to sell its studio and streaming assets to Netflix in a transaction valued at roughly $83 billion on an enterprise basis. Paramount wants to buy the entirety of WBD, including its portfolio of TV networks, and says its offer comes with an enterprise value of $108.4 billion.Paramount notably did not increase its bid on Monday, reiterating that it believes the deal is superior, though Paramount did hike its proposed reverse breakup fee to match that of Netflix's offer. WBD confirmed receipt of the amended offer on Monday and said in a release it would \"carefully review and consider Paramount Skydance's offer in accordance with the terms of Warner Bros. Discovery's agreement with Netflix.\" \"What we've done in this amended filing is we've cleared the brush of obfuscation around the offer,\" said Gerry Cardinale, founder and managing partner of RedBird Capital Partners, on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Monday. watch nowRedBird is an investor in Paramount Skydance and has also committed to financing the proposed Paramount acquisition of WBD. Cardinale said Monday that as part of the amended filing Larry Ellison would back the bid through an irrevocable trust, which is anchored by 1.2 billion Oracle shares. \"Like we've done through the six bids that we've made, we are being responsive to what their concerns are,\" Cardinale said.Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery rose 3% in early trading Monday, while Paramount gained more than 7%. Netflix's stock was down nearly 1%. Paramount vs. Netflix Paramount made three offers for WBD in the fall, which were all rejected by the company. WBD then launched a formal sale process that brought in offers from other bidders, including Netflix. Cardinale said Paramount's unsolicited offers likely spurred WBD to open up to a sale, putting Paramount \"a little bit on the back foot.\"During Monday's CNBC interview Cardinale, like Ellison on CNBC last week, appealed directly to WBD shareholders. \"At the end of the day ... the shareholders own this company. The board doesn't own it. [CEO] David Zaslav doesn't own this company,\" said Cardinale. \"This should be a lot more simple than it is. It's very simple.\"Besides the question of value between the two bids, the question of regulatory approval has also been raised by Paramount as well as industry onlookers. \"The Netflix deal kills competition,\" Cardinale said, adding that a combination of streaming platforms Netflix and HBO Max would create 420 million subscribers under one roof. \"No wonder the constituents in the ecosystem — talent, creators, theatrical exhibitors —  are losing their minds on this because they see the pricing power that they will create.\" Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters have said they are confident their deal would pass regulatory muster. Sarandos has also issued reassurances about the future of the theatrical slate for WBD under Netflix's ownership. At a conference earlier in December, Sarandos argued the Netflix offer for WBD's assets would preserve jobs at a time of mounting layoffs across the industry. ",

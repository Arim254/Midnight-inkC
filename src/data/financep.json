    "body": "Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesSoftware startup NinjaOne has surpassed $500 million in annual recurring revenue, or ARR, the company announced Tuesday.The IT management platform saw revenue grow nearly 70% year over year and its customer base increase more than 60% over the last year to 35,000.President and Chief Financial Officer Chris Matarese told CNBC that the ARR milestone has largely been driven by the startup's continuous product innovation and customer support.\"I think we've probably spent four times the industry average in support, and we've had 98% customer satisfaction scores throughout our history or better,\" he said.Founded in 2013, NinjaOne offers patch management, backups, remote monitoring and management, endpoint security, and more under a unified software system rather than multiple siloed tools.Co-founder and CEO Sal Sferlazza said in a statement that as opposed to legacy tech, NinjaOne's \"multi-tenant-native architecture can innovate faster\" to generate several software solutions at once.Read more CNBC tech newsMemory chip giants spark global semiconductor rally as shortages stoke price hikesMusk's X faces probes in Europe, India, Malaysia after Grok generated explicit images of women and childrenDemocratic mayor of Silicon Valley's largest city opposes billionaire taxCNBC Disruptor 50 2026: Nominate a company to be included on the list of the most innovative startupsThe company snagged a $5 billion valuation after a $500 million funding round led by Iconiq Growth and CapitalG, Alphabet's venture capital arm, in February 2025.Matarese said customers, which include IT departments and managed service providers, have reported a 50% reduction in endpoint management and support costs and a 20% boost in staff retention after adopting NinjaOne.\"About 75% of our customers replace four tools or more when they use Ninja,\" he said. \"The less tools you have, the more everything is unified, the better everything works.\"He added that the company expects another 60% to 70% in revenue growth for 2026 and plans to launch five to six additional products over the next year, some of which may incorporate artificial intelligence.Although the AI boom has helped several tech companies reach record highs, investors have expressed concern that the cloud software industry may be eaten by AI agents instead. Matarese, however, said his startup intends to approach AI as an opportunity rather than as competition.In October, NinjaOne rolled out its Patch Intelligence AI feature, which provides AI-driven insights to help IT teams manage Windows patches. Matarese said that more artificial intelligence features are likely to follow.\"I think AI is a tool that the best SaaS [software-as-a-service] companies are going to use to improve their offerings,\" he said. \"I think the true value in AI comes from augmenting human judgment, not replacing it.\"watch now",

    "body": "House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) speaks to the media ahead of a secure briefing about U.S. action in Venezuela, on Capitol Hill  in Washington,, D.C., U.S., Jan. 5, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Trump administration on Monday briefed congressional leaders on the U.S. military operation that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro, sharpening a partisan divide over the president's authority to use force without congressional approval.Top Republicans who attended the classified briefing rallied to the president's defense while Democrats questioned the scope of the operation and pushed to halt further military action.The partisan split-screen among the lawmakers briefed, who are part of the so-called \"Gang of Eight\" group authorized to receive highly classified information, underscores the difficulty Congress may face in trying to rein in President Donald Trump's military efforts. U.S. President Donald Trump has, in recent days, said the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela, threatened Colombia and Cuba and renewed his push to acquire Greenland. Those remarks followed a weekend military strike that captured Maduro from Caracas and whisked him to the U.S. to face criminal charges without prior congressional authorization. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., called the raid in Venezuela \"a decisive and justified action,\" rejecting claims that Trump exceeded his authority.\"We are not at war, we do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela and we are not occupying that country,\" Johnson said. Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep. Doug LaMalfa dies at 65, GOP saysClassified Venezuela briefing leaves lawmakers split along party lines after Maduro captureRubio explains how U.S. might 'run' Venezuela after Maduro's ouster\"The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war; that is true. But it also vests the president of the United States with vast authorities as commander-in-chief,\" Johnson said. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., meanwhile, said that the briefing raised far more questions than it answered.\"The plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying,\" Schumer said. \"I did not receive any assurances that we would not try to do the same thing in other countries.\"Senate Democrats plan to force a vote later this week on a measure to suspend Trump's military action in Venezuela, known as a war powers resolution. The measure, brought by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., would require Trump to cease military action in Venezuela unless Congress approves it. Kaine introduced a similar resolution in November, which the Senate rejected after only two Republicans — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky — supported it. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, so at least four Republicans would need to break ranks for Kaine's measure to succeed. The House of Representatives would also need to approve the measure. Lawmakers there narrowly defeated a Venezuela war powers resolution 211-213 in December. \"There's real concern as it relates to congressional action connected to our sole power to declare war,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., before the briefing. \"No further military action should be taken in Venezuela or anywhere else without explicit congressional approval, and we need to legislate that.\" The lawmakers were briefed by top members of the president's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Attorney General Pam Bondi and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The administration has labored to frame the use of the military in Venezuela as a law enforcement action, since Maduro had outstanding warrants for his arrest in the United States. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla, the Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, who was in the briefing, echoed that view. \"This was a law enforcement operation,\" Mast said. \"This law enforcement operation required great military capabilities … because the individual that had to be brought to justice could bring to bear an air force, a navy, an army.\" Mast said  Trump was not seeking a protracted military engagement, but did not rule out similar operations if the president deems them necessary to \"defend the homeland.\"The bipartisan leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee, however, who have jurisdiction over the U.S. law enforcement apparatus, were not invited to the briefing. They are not traditionally part of the \"Gang of Eight,\" but issued a joint statement excoriating the snub. \"President Trump and Secretary Rubio have stated that this was a law enforcement operation that was made at the Department of Justice's (DOJ) request, with assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),\" the statement from Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill., read.    \"The administration's refusal to acknowledge our Committee's indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the Committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro's arrest,\" they said. CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "A Chevron gas station in San Francisco, Oct. 28, 2025.Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's call for U.S. oil companies to rebuild Venezuela's energy sector after the overthrow of President Nicolás Maduro is easier said than done. Chevron holds the advantage as the only major U.S. oil company currently operating in Venezuela, according to Wall Street analysts. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized the industry and seized their assets in 2007. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, at 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. But a long and expensive road lies ahead for U.S. oil majors to restore Venezuela to its peak production of 3.5 million barrels per day reached in the 1990s.\"It's a high-risk area for oil companies to invest in,\" said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen, chief analyst and head of research at Global Risk Management.It would require roughly $53 billion of investment over the next 15 years to just maintain crude oil production level of 1.1 million barrels per day, or bpd, according to estimates from consulting firm Rystad Energy. The capital expenditures needed to reach 3 million bpd by 2040 would more than triple, to $183 billion, according to Rystad.Certainty and stabilityU.S. oil majors will want certainty about who is charge in Caracas and how stable the government is, said Bob McNally, founder of Rapidan Energy. They will need to know whether the legal and fiscal regime will last long term because energy investments are 30-year projects, said David Goldwyn, who served as the State Department's special envoy for international energy affairs from 2009 to 2011.The situation in Caracas right now is anything but certain. Trump declared Saturday that the U.S. will run Venezuela after Maduro's overthrow. Secretary of State Marco Rubio appeared to backtrack, telling NBC News in a Sunday interview that the U.S. will use its leverage to pressure Caracas to meet U.S. demands. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez has assumed power in Venezuela, pledging over the weekend that the government would defend the country's resources, but later said Caracas sought to cooperate with the U.S. A major question is whether Venezuela could return to a regime similar to Maduro's in the future and nationalize oil assets again, said Global Risk Management's Rasmussen.Surplus reserves U.S. oil majors will grapple with whether it makes financial sense to invest tens of billions of dollars in Venezuela when there is already so much oil in the world, said McNally, a former White House energy advisor under President George W. Bush. \"There are plenty of reasons to think this is going to be more of a long and winding road, rather than a quick shot,\" McNally said.Chevron maintains joint ventures with state-owned Petróleos de Venezuela through a special licensed issued by the U.S. government. Those partnerships are responsible for about 23% of Venezuela's output, according to JPMorgan. \"The company would be in an advantaged position to potentially scale future output as they have significant oil resources in place through their JVs and have been a key developer of the country's energy infrastructure,\" JPMorgan analyst Arun Jayaram told clients in a Monday note. Chevron shares climbed more than 5% Monday. — CNBC's Hayley Cuccinello contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "Moor Studio | Digitalvision Vectors | Getty ImagesFollowing the U.S. military operation in Venezuela that led to the removal of its leader, Nicolas Maduro, AI-generated videos purporting to show Venezuelan citizens celebrating in the streets have gone viral on social media.These artificial intelligence clips, depicting rejoicing crowds, have amassed millions of views across major platforms like TikTok, Instagram and X. One of the earliest and most widely shared clips on X was posted by an account named \"Wall Street Apes,\" which has over 1 million followers on the platform. The post depicts a series of Venezuelan citizens crying tears of joy and thanking the U.S. and President Donald Trump for removing Maduro. The video has since been flagged by a community note, a crowdsourced fact-checking feature on X that allows users to add context to posts they believe are misleading. The note read: \"This video is AI generated and is currently being presented as a factual statement intended to mislead people.\"The clip has been viewed over 5.6 million times and reshared by at least 38,000 accounts, including by business mogul Elon Musk, before he eventually removed the repost. CNBC was unable to confirm the origin of the video, though fact-checkers at BBC and AFP said the earliest known version of the clip appeared on the TikTok account @curiousmindusa, which regularly posts AI-generated content.Even before such videos appeared, AI-generated images showing Maduro in U.S. custody were circulating prior to the Trump administration releasing an authentic image of the captured leader. The deposed Venezuelan president was captured on Jan. 3, 2026, after U.S. forces conducted airstrikes and a ground raid, an operation that has dominated global headlines at the start of the new year. Along with the AI-generated videos, the AFP's fact-check team also flagged a number of examples of misleading content about Maduro's ousting, including footage of celebrations in Chile falsely presented as scenes from Venezuela. Misinformation from major news events is not new. Similar false or misleading content has circulated during the Israeli-Palestine and Russia-Ukraine conflicts. However, the massive reach and realism of AI-generated content related to recent developments in Venezuela are stark examples of how AI is advancing as a tool for misinformation. Platforms such as Sora and Midjourney have made it easier than ever to quickly generate hyper-realistic video and pass it off as genuine in the chaos of fast-breaking events. The creators of that content often seek to amplify certain political narratives or sow confusion among global audiences.Last year, AI-generated videos of women complaining about losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a government shutdown also went viral. One such AI-generated video fooled Fox News, which presented it as real in an article that was later removed.In light of these trends, social media companies have faced growing pressure to step up efforts to label potentially misleading AI content.Last year, India's government proposed a law requiring such labeling, while Spain approved fines of up to 35 million euros for unlabeled AI materials.To address growing concerns, major platforms, including TikTok and Meta, have rolled out AI detection and labeling tools, though the results appear mixed.CNBC was able to identify some videos on TikTok presented as celebrations in Venezuela that were labeled as AI-generated. In the case of X, the platform has relied mostly on community notes for content labeling, a system critics say often reacts too slowly to prevent AI misinformation from spreading before being identified.Adam Mosseri, who oversees Instagram and Threads, acknowledged the challenge facing social media in a recent post. \"All the major platforms will do good work identifying AI content, but they will get worse at it over time as AI gets better at imitating reality,\" he said.\"There is already a growing number of people who believe, as I do, that it will be more practical to fingerprint real media than fake media,\" he added. — CNBC's Victoria Yeo contributed to this report ",

    "body": "Visitors to the OC Auto Show at the Anaheim Convention Center check out the newly unveiled Ford Expedition in Anaheim on Thursday, October 3, 2024.Leonard Ortiz | Medianews Group | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Ford Motor on Tuesday said its U.S. vehicle sales last year increased 6% to achieve the company's best annual sales since 2019.The Detroit automaker reported sales of 2.2 million vehicles in 2025, including a 2.7% uptick to more than 545,200 units during the fourth quarter. In 2019, the automaker sold 2.42 million vehicles in the U.S.Ford finished the year as the third-largest automaker in the U.S. behind Toyota Motor and domestic sales leader General Motors. Ford's U.S. vehicle sales for the year were largely in line with analyst expectations, such as those from Cox Automotive, which expects industrywide sales to have risen about 2% to 16.3 million units in 2025.\"We're really pleased with where we finished the year,\" Andrew Frick, president of Ford's nonfleet vehicle businesses, said during a media call. \"As the year unfolded, we saw really good performance throughout. ... We outperformed the industry for 10 straight months.\"Ford's fourth-quarter performance came as it continues to battle production troubles with its F-Series pickup trucks due to two separate fires at a New York plant of key aluminum supplier Novelis.Frick said the automaker \"seems to be on track\" to offset lost production of tens of thousands of its lucrative pickup trucks this year, including adding another shift to a plant in Michigan.F-Series sales, including the popular F-150, were up 8.3% in 2025, but off 3.1% during the fourth quarter. Like many automakers, Ford's all-electric vehicles business notably declined 14.1% last year, including a roughly 52% plummet during the fourth quarter. A nearly 22% increase in sales of Ford's hybrid vehicles, which the company expects to grow, assisted in offsetting those losses.Traditional vehicles with internal combustion engines continued to dominate Ford's sales, representing about 86% of the company's volume in 2025.",

Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesCalifornia Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa has died, House GOP officials said on Tuesday. He was 65. LaMalfa's death tightens the razor-thin House majority and could imperil Speaker Mike Johnson's grip on the House. The House stood at 219 Republicans and 213 Democrats after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., resigned on Monday. LaMalfa's death brings the House to 218 Republicans. Democrats are favored to pick up additional seats from special elections in the coming months. Two Democrats are in a runoff in Texas at the end of the month, and the election to replace now-New Jersey Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill will take place later this year. LaMalfa represented California's 1st Congressional District since 2013. He chaired the Congressional Western Caucus.

He also served on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. His electoral prospects, however, were increasingly at risk in 2026 after California adopted new congressional maps that favor Democrats. \"Congress is devastated to learn this morning about the passing of our dear friend and colleague, Doug LaMalfa,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \"He was as fierce of a fighter for his state's vast natural resources and beauty as we have ever known.\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also expressed condolences for LaMalfa. \"A fourth-generation rice farmer, Rep. LaMalfa treasured his community, worked powerfully to protect California's farmers and served those he represented with principled purpose, from the state legislature to the United States House of Representatives,\" Jeffries said. President Donald Trump on Tuesday mourned LaMalfa in remarks before the House GOP conference.\"He was a fantastic person,\" Trump said. \"He voted with me 100% of the time.\" House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said in a post to X he's \"devastated about the sudden loss of our friend, Congressman Doug LaMalfa.\"\"Doug was a loving father and husband, and staunch advocate for his constituents and rural America,\" Emmer said. A cause of death has not been released. California Gov. Gavin Newsom now has 14 days to announce a special election to replace LaMalfa, per California election laws. The election then must take place no more than 140 days after Newsom's proclamation -- potentially pushing an election to replace LaMalfa to June.This story is developing. Please check back for updates. Correction: There are 213 Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives. That fact was misstated in an earlier version of this article.",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., holds a news conference in the Mansfield Room in the U.S. Capitol on Monday, December 1, 2025. Bill Clark | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesThe Pentagon will cut the military retirement pay of Sen. Mark Kelly for what Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the Arizona Democrat's \"seditious\" statements on a video with other members of Congress telling service members they have the right to refuse to execute illegal orders.Hegseth also issued a formal letter of censure against Kelly, which the Defense secretary said details  \"reckless misconduct\" by the retired Navy captain and astronaut.Hegesth said the Defense Department has begun a proceeding aimed at reducing Kelly's rank in retirement, which would in turn lead to a decrease in retirement pay. \"Six weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he is still accountable to military justice. And the Department of War — and the American people — expect justice,\" Hegseth said.Kelly has 30 days to file a response to the decision to cut his rank and retirement pay, according to Hegseth's tweet.The Pentagon in November announced a probe of Kelly for his involvement with the video, and said that further actions could include a recall to active duty and a court-martial proceeding. Hegeth's statement on Monday suggests that the Pentagon has ruled out that more severe option.But, in his tweet, Hegseth warned, \"Captain Kelly's status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"Kelly, in a statement on X, vowed to fight the disciplinary action \"with everything I've got,\" and called Hegseth \"the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country's history.\"\"Over twenty-five years in the U.S. Navy, thirty-nine combat missions, and four missions to space, I risked my life for this country and to defend our Constitution – including the First Amendment rights of every American to speak out,\" Kelly wrote. \"I never expected that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense would attack me for doing exactly that.\"\"My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife Gabby recovered from a gunshot wound to the head– all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder,\" Kelly wrote. \"Generations of servicemembers have made these same patriotic sacrifices for this country, earning the respect, appreciation, and rank they deserve.\"Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn't like, they will come after them the same way,\" the senator said. \"It's outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.\"The video that Kelly spoke on was made in response to the U.S. military conducting 20 airstrikes on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean against purported drug smugglers, killing scores of people.Read more CNBC politics coverage‘Greenland belongs to its people’: European leaders unite over Trump’s threats to annex territoryTrump wants to take over Greenland — but the island's economy faces 'major challenges'Hilton shares fall after DHS says MN hotel canceled reservation due to immigration enforcementRepublican Rep.

Elissa Slotkin, House Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, both of Pennsylvania.Slotkin is a former CIA analyst. Deluzio and Goodlander are former Navy officers, and Houlahan is a former Air Force officer.But unlike Kelly, the other three veterans on the video separated from their service branches rather than retiring from them. As a result, they are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as Kelly is.Hegseth, in his statement on Monday, said about the Pentagon's move to discipline Kelly: \"These actions are based on Captain Kelly's public statements from June through December 2025 in which he characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders.\"\"This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay,\" Hegseth said.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer condemned the Pentagon's action on Monday.\"Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,\" Schumer, D-N.Y., wrote in a tweet responding to Hegseth.\"Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump. This is a despicable act of political retribution,\" Schumer wrote. \"I stand with Sen. Kelly, who will always do the right thing no matter the consequences.\"",

    "body": "A Samsung Electronics Co. CXL memory module displayed on a monitor during the Semiconductor Exhibition (SEDEX) in Seoul, South Korea, on Wednesday, Oct. 23, 2024.SeongJoon Cho | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSemiconductor stocks rallied to start the year, led by the world's biggest memory chip firms that are getting a boost from continued artificial intelligence-related demand. South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics, the world's two biggest memory makers, are up 11.5% and 15.9% respectively year-to-date. Micron is 9% higher this year. Memory is a core component of the type of chips required to train and run AI models such as those designed by Nvidia and AMD. As tech giants continue to spend billions of dollars buying those chips and building out AI data centers, memory is in short supply.In particular, a specific component called dynamic random-access memory or DRAM, which is used in AI data centers, saw a huge price spike in 2025. Memory prices are expected to rise another 40% through the second quarter of 2026, according to Counterpoint Research.\"The recent rally across the semiconductor space has been driven largely by the memory side of the market rather than logic chips,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC by email.\"We're seeing a combination of very strong demand from AI workloads and relatively constrained supply, particularly in high-bandwidth memory, which is essential for training and running large AI models.\"This is seen as positive for Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron as they are expected to be in a position to charge a higher price for their memory chips as demand shows no sign of abating. Investor sentiment is positive on these names as they prepare to report their fourth-quarter earnings in the coming week, with analysts expecting a huge profit surge.Samsung is seen reporting a 140% jump in fourth-quarter operating profit, according to LSEG estimates. Meanwhile, Micron's earnings per share are expected to rise more than 400% year-on-year in the December quarter.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconMicron and ASML stocks have rallied this year so far. The rally in memory chip stocks has fed through to other parts of the supply chain as investors expect strong AI demand seen in 2025 to continue this year.Intel shares are up nearly 7%, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — the world's biggest semiconductor maker — has risen nearly 10%. Both companies, which manufacture various types of semiconductors, are seen benefiting from a continued AI boom.Meanwhile, ASML, the Dutch firm that designs critical machines required to manufacture the most advanced chips in the world, has seen its shares rise nearly 14% this year. Bernstein on Sunday raised its price target for ASML's stock from 800 euros ($937) to 1,300 euros, implying a roughly 24% rise from Tuesday's trading price. \"ASML stands to benefit enormously from the wave of capacity expansion planned for 2026 and 2027,\" with memory chips, Bernstein analysts wrote in their note on Sunday. The analysts added that ASML will benefit \"from the upcoming DRAM super cycle.\"Analysts expect memory makers like Samsung and other manufacturers to increase their production capacity for memory, which will benefit ASML because its tools are needed to make these more advanced memory chips. \"Recent comments from SK Hynix pointing to a potential HBM supercycle have reinforced the idea that this is not just a short-term bounce, but a more structural shift linked to the ongoing build-out of AI infrastructure,\" Barringer said.\"That has helped improve sentiment across the sector, especially for companies with direct exposure to AI-driven memory demand.\"",

    "body": "Elon musk and the xAI logo.Vincent Feuray | Afp | Getty ImagesElon Musk's X is being investigated by authorities in Europe, India and Malaysia after its Grok chatbot let users create and share AI-generated sexualized images of children and women.British media watchdog Ofcom also said it's requested information from X, which is owned by xAI, concerning the Grok issues. And on Sunday, a member of Brazil's parliament said on social media that she's asked the country's federal public prosecutor and data protection authority to suspend use of Grok until an investigation is completed. The probes follow a global surge over the past few weeks in the use of Grok to create and share nonconsensual, intimate images, or NCII, derived from photos or videos of real people in response to user's prompts. The concerning images have been widely shared on X. Musk's company recently updated its Grok Imagine features, enabling easier image generation from text-based prompts on the platform.While safety experts and tech critics decried the proliferation of exploitative images and clips on X, Musk appeared to mock the situation by sharing an array of Grok-generated images, including one depicting himself in a bikini, punctuated by laughing-crying emojis.At a press conference on Monday, European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said the authority was \"very seriously looking into this matter\" and was \"well aware\" that X and Grok were \"now offering a spicy mode showing explicit sexual content with some output generated with childlike images.\" \"This is not 'spicy,'\" Regnier said. \"This is illegal. This is appalling. This is disgusting. This is how we see it, and this has no place in Europe.\" Late last week, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology ordered X to conduct a \"comprehensive technical, procedural and governance-level review\" of Grok. The company was given until Jan. 5 to comply. The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission said over the weekend that it's investigating X and will call in company representatives. \"MCMC urges all platforms accessible in Malaysia to implement safeguards aligned with Malaysian laws and online safety standards, especially in relation to their AI-powered features, chatbots and image manipulation tools,\" the group said in a statement. watch nowMeanwhile, in the U.S., the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) called on the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to investigate the matter in an interview with CNBC. Dani Pinter, chief legal officer and director of the Law Center for NCOSE, said there's \"not a lot of legal precedence on point for these specific issues.\"However, she said federal laws prohibit the creation and distribution of child sexual abuse materials, or CSAM, and that can be applied to virtually created content \"when it depicts an identifiable child, or depicts a child engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\" Those laws include the Take It Down Act, which was endorsed by First Lady Melania Trump before it was enacted last year. A DOJ spokesperson said in an emailed statement to CNBC on Monday evening, \"The Department of Justice takes AI-generated child sex abuse material extremely seriously and will aggressively prosecute any producer or possessor of CSAM. We continue to explore ways to optimize enforcement in this space to protect children and hold accountable individuals who exploit technology to harm our most vulnerable.\"The FTC declined to comment. XAI didn't provide a comment beyond an automated reply. Musk's social media company made its first public statement on the matter on Saturday in a post on the official X Safety account.  \"We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary,\" the company wrote. Musk wrote, in a separate post on X,  \"Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\"The following day, an xAI employee named Ethan He wrote in a post on X that Grok Imagine was updated, but he didn't specify any changes regarding the ability to create harmful explicit images. Musk and X have a history of allowing users who created posts showing child sexual exploitation to stay on the platform.In 2023, X briefly suspended then reinstated the account of a user named Dom Lucre after he posted \"child exploitation pictures associated with the criminal conviction of an Australian man in the Philippines,\" Mashable reported. Musk said at that time that X decided to delete Lucre's offending posts but to reinstate the right-wing influencer to the platform. Lucre currently has a monetized account on X with 1.6 million listed followers.Tom Quisel, CEO of Musubi AI, which helps social networks and AI companies automate content moderation using AI, said it appeared that xAI had failed to build even \"entry level trust and safety layers\" into the rollout of Grok Imagine to X.Quisel said it would be easy for a company like xAI to have its model detect and block \"an image involving children or partial nudity,\" or to reject users' prompts to put the subject of a photo in sexually suggestive outfits.The controversy has done nothing to harm X's traffic.According to Apptopia, which tracks mobile app trends, daily downloads of Grok have increased 54% since Jan. 2, while daily downloads of X have jumped 25% in the past three days.

    "body": "Nvidia is building out an automotive tech business. Pictured here are its autonomous vehicle test cars at the company's auto garage in Santa Clara, California, June 5, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNvidia on Monday said it is working with robotaxi operators in hopes of having them use the company's AI chips and Drive AV software stack to power their fleets of autonomous vehicles as soon as 2027.Around that time, the chipmaker said that it hopes to power partner deployment of \"Level 4\" robotaxis, meaning vehicles capable of driving without human intervention in pre-defined regions, Xinzhou Wu, Nvidia's vice president of automotive, said at a self-driving demonstration in San Francisco last month.\"We will probably start with a limited availability but work with the partner for us to get our footing,\" Wu said. Since 2015, Nvidia has offered chips and other technology for cars under the Drive brand name, but that remains a small part of the company's business. Automotive and robotics chips accounted for just $592 million in sales in the quarter ended in October, or about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue. Nvidia announced a robotaxi partnership with Uber in October.The chipmaker said in December that it had developed software that can power a self-driving car and that Mercedes-Benz models to be released in late 2026 will be able to use Nvidia's technology to navigate cities like San Francisco.Self-driving cars remain one of the primary areas where Nvidia can show growth outside of AI infrastructure. CEO Jensen Huang has said that robotics — including self-driving cars — is the company's second most important growth category after artificial intelligence.\"We imagine that someday, a billion cars on the road will all be autonomous,\" Huang said at a launch event on Monday at the CES conference in Las Vegas. \"You could either have it be a robotaxi that you're orchestrating and renting from somebody, or you could own it.\"In addition to chips that go inside self-driving cars, Nvidia sells access to its famed AI chips as well as its simulation software to automotive companies so they can train self-driving models and develop technology. Nvidia says that car makers can use its Drive AGX Thor automotive computer, which costs about $3,500 per chip, to save on research and development costs and get self-driving features to market faster. Nvidia said it works with car makers to tune its technology, such as determining how hard the car should accelerate, for specific vehicles. \"Some say, 'Hey, I need your help on training and optimizing my software on your chip, but I'll take care of simulation myself,'\" said Ali Kani, general manager of Nvidia's automotive platform.Car companies, like Mercedes-Benz, want to tune Nvidia's technology, market it as part of its in-car experience and sell it as part of or alongside a new car. Robotaxis have caught on in the past year, led by Alphabet's Waymo, which is operating a commercial taxi service without drivers in five U.S. markets, including San Francisco. Nvidia's robotaxi announcement signals that it is targeting self-driving fleets in addition to personal cars that consumers can buy.watch nowRiding an Nvidia self-driving vehicleIn December, Nvidia offered reporters and analysts an hourlong ride through San Francisco in a 2026 Mercedes-Benz CLA sedan. While my car had a safety driver employed by Mercedes-Benz behind the wheel, the driver said that the car was driving itself for 90% of the ride. The drive was uneventful. San Francisco is a tricky city to drive in, with big hills, frequent red lights and trucks unloading in the middle of streets, but I never felt stressed and could focus on holding a conversation. But there was one major snag: The driver took control during a thorny situation where two buses and a self-driving Waymo were trying to pass in a four-lane road with street parking that also had trucks on both sides unloading goods. The driver had to back the car up and wait for the jam to clear. Nvidia said my drive was \"Level 2 Plus Plus,\" which means that its technology has features similar to Tesla's Full Self-Driving mode. Nvidia-powered cars like the Mercedes-Benz will have increasing self-driving capabilities, but the responsibility of keeping everyone safe still falls to the driver, who must pay attention at all times. The chipmaker said the system would eventually be able to do \"park-to-park,\" meaning it can drive from a starting parking space to another, but the Mercedes-Benz CLA cars won't come with that feature to start. \"Any parking situation that you feel is intimidating, that car will solve for you,\" said Mercedes-Benz Group CEO Ola Källenius at an Nvidia event on Monday. The Mercedes-Benz model that Nvidia demonstrated was launched last year in Europe, but it's launching in the U.S. this year, Kani said. The Mercedes-Benz cars were rolled out with lane keep and driver assistance features to help drivers stay in their lanes, Kani said. The vehicles received a lane-switching feature through a software update and will get hands-free highway driving, urban driving and park-to-park features this year.Nvidia said that it is using two AI systems in Drive-powered cars to ensure safety. The car mostly drives with an \"end-to-end\" system, called a vision-language model, that uses AI to decipher visual sensors and chart a path. The chipmaker said it also built a second, safety-oriented \"stack\" that uses strict rules — such as stopping at a stop sign — to take over when the AI is unsure about what to do. Still, Nvidia hopes that recent advances in generative AI — driven by the company's graphics processing units — will allow self-driving algorithms to become more capable. Nvidia is targeting 2028 for point-to-point self-driving features in consumer cars. Eventually, Nvidia said it wants to make the car itself feel like an actual driver that the users can simply speak to. \"With transformers and generative AI, we can do much more,\" Wu said.

These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\" they continued. \"Greenland belongs to its people.

Why that mattersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedEnacted in July, Trump's multitrillion-dollar legislation included several retroactive tax changes for 2025 that affect returns filed in 2026.  However, the IRS didn't update withholding tables for employers, which dictate how much to take from workers' paychecks. As a result, 2025 employee withholdings were based on taxes owed before Trump's cuts.   \"We expect that's going to pretty dramatically increase refunds on average during the [2026] tax filing season compared to prior years,\" said Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit think tank. As of Dec. 26, the average refund for individual returns was $3,167 during the 2025 filing season, up slightly from $3,138 in 2024, according to the latest IRS data.Who could see a bigger tax refund in 2026 Millions of Americans could see a bigger refund or smaller tax bill in 2026, and a few tax breaks will impact a \"significant portion\" of filers, according to Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank.For 2025, Trump's legislation increased the standard deduction to $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, which impacts most filers. That's up from $15,000 and $30,000, respectively, before the change. Many families could also see a higher child tax credit. For 2025, the maximum tax break increased to $2,200 from $2,000 for families eligible to claim the full value.  The new $6,000 senior deduction for individuals age 65 and up could also impact many older Americans from 2025 through 2028. The full deduction is available with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income ($150,000 for married couples filing jointly).  Larger tax cuts for fewer Americans Trump's legislation also added temporary tax breaks for smaller groups of filers, which could provide \"much larger\" cuts, according to Lautz.Some of these include deductions on tip and overtime income, a tax break on auto loan interest, and a higher limit for the deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. Approximately 6 million workers report tipped wages, according to IRS estimates. And nationally, about 6% of workers reported overtime pay in 2024, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an economic organization.  \"Where we'll see the biggest increases in refund size is actually from the higher SALT cap,\" Lautz said.  For 2025, the SALT deduction limit was raised to $40,000, up from $10,000 in 2024, which includes state and local income taxes and property taxes. But you can only claim the SALT deduction if you itemize tax breaks. Roughly 90% of filers don't itemize, according to the latest IRS data.",

    "body": "Colorado residents fill out cards and share their stories for content to send to congressional representatives regarding health-care cuts on Nov. 1, 2025, the first day of ACA open enrollment, in Northglenn, Colorado.Tom Cooper | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesFor the first time in years, many Americans enrolled in a health insurance plan via the Affordable Care Act marketplace will need to keep a careful accounting of their annual income — or risk a hefty federal tax bill.Enhanced ACA subsidies lapsed at the end of 2025, leaving millions of households on the hook for higher insurance premiums. The lapse also reintroduced the so-called subsidy cliff, whereby households that earn even $1 more than a specific income threshold will lose all eligibility for subsidies, also known as premium tax credits.That income cutoff, which varies by family size, is $62,600 for a single person, $84,600 for a two-person household and $128,600 for a family of four in 2026, for example. watch nowMore than 2 million people enrolled in an ACA marketplace plan have an income near the subsidy cliff. ACA enrollees also tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it hard to predict their annual earnings, experts said. Households over the limit would have to pay back any federal subsidies they received for premiums — potentially worth thousands of dollars — when they file taxes next year for 2026.\"Starting February, March, April 2027 is when you'll start to see the horror stories of people with astronomical tax bills, from the payback of these credits,\" said Tommy Lucas, a certified financial planner and enrolled agent at Moisand Fitzgerald Tamayo, which was No. 69 on CNBC's Financial Advisor 100 list for 2025. The potential financial impact is exacerbated by a multitrillion-dollar legislative package known as the \"big beautiful bill\" that Republicans passed over the summer, which stripped away guardrails capping the amount of excess subsidies households must repay, experts said. \"I don't know of anything else that's as penalizing in the tax code by adding one extra dollar [of income],\" Lucas said. \"You've got to be on your game starting now.\"Read more CNBC personal finance coverageWho could see bigger tax refunds in 2026 from Trump's cutsACA subsidy cliff may mean 'astronomical tax bills' for many, CFP says2026 tax brackets could mean a slightly bigger paycheck — what to expectWhy estate planning helps 'forestall bad outcomes': 'My Mother's Money' authorSome ETFs compete on price, but fees shouldn't always be biggest concern: analystStudent loan forgiveness is taxable again: Plan for the 'tax bomb,' CFP saysUSPS changes may delay postmarks.

These 5 tips can helpOver 300,000 student loan borrowers were denied a new repayment planUnmarried couples aren't 'a default unit' if one dies. Why that mattersCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe total sum households need to pay back to the federal government \"could easily be $10,000,\" said Cynthia Cox, vice president and director of the Affordable Care Act program at KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group. The sum depends on factors like age, geography and family size, Cox said. An older couple who inadvertently earn too much money and go over the subsidy cliff may need to pay back around $20,000, for example, she said.Congress could still extend ACA subsidiesThere's a chance Congress may still act to extend enhanced ACA subsidies in some form and prevent a surprise tax bill for many households next year. Democrats on Capitol Hill have said they want to extend them, while most Republicans have said they're opposed. However, a group of Republicans has recently engaged in bipartisan talks in the House and Senate that may yield legislative action. \"I think the chances are pretty slim something will pass,\" Cox said. \"From a personal finance perspective, you have to just count on nothing happening in Congress.\"Millions of people are near ACA subsidy cliff The subsidy cliff is in effect for the first time since Congress enacted enhanced premium subsidies in 2021 as part of a Covid-19 pandemic relief law.Now, households with an income in 2026 that exceeds 400% of the federal poverty line are ineligible for any premium tax credits. They'd be on the hook for the full, unsubsidized health insurance premium.For example, the average 60-year-old with an income of $62,000 would pay about $515 a month in health premiums, or approximately 10% of their annual income, according to a KFF analysis. This person would be eligible for premium subsidies.However, the same person earning $64,000 would pay $1,244 per month, about 23% of their income, since they would fall over the subsidy cliff, KFF found.Millions of people have an income near the subsidy cliff. In 2025, about 3% of ACA enrollees — nearly 725,000 people — earned between 400% and 500% of the federal poverty line, for example, according to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis of federal data.Another 7% — about 1.8 million people — earned 300% to 400% of the poverty line, it found. That equates to more than about $47,000 per year for an individual and about $96,000 for a family of four.\"People around that income [threshold] didn't have to worry about that for the past five years,\" Cox said.\"[Now], if your income is right around that threshold for subsidy eligibility, then you need to be really careful about how much money you're making,\" she said.How ACA premium tax credit worksAbout 22 million Americans received premium subsidies, also known as premium tax credits, in 2025. Households can opt to receive the tax credit in one of two ways: As a lump sum during tax season or as an advanced payment. Under the latter option, by far the most popular, the federal government issues the tax credit directly to a consumer's insurer, which then lowers the consumer's out-of-pocket premium. Consumers receive those advanced ACA subsidies based on an estimated annual income they provide when signing up for insurance. They must reconcile those subsidies during tax season and repay any excess tax credits to the IRS.watch nowACA enrollees tend to have relatively volatile incomes, making it difficult to predict their annual pay accurately, Cox said.About one in five people, 21%, between 19 and 64 years old who shop for insurance on the ACA marketplace are in households with \"high levels of income volatility,\" according to a KFF study published in May. The researchers define volatility as a difference of at least 20% between estimated and actual income. Why you should know your ACA 'cliff number'The federal government determines eligibility for ACA subsidies based on \"modified adjusted gross income.\" Determining MAGI may be challenging, experts said. It's one's adjusted gross income — a line item on households' tax returns — with some other elements added back. The two \"biggies\" for most people are any tax-exempt interest, such as from municipal bonds, and any untaxed Social Security benefits, Lucas said. \"It's definitely important for people on the ACA to know their cliff number, their 400%,\" Lucas said. They should monitor their income monthly to see how it's trending, he said. \"There are ways to keep an eye on your income and even make changes mid-year to stay eligible for the subsidies, so you don't have a big surprise come tax time next year,\" Cox said. For example, households can consider making pre-tax contributions to financial accounts like a 401(k), individual retirement account or health savings account, which helps to reduce modified adjusted gross income, experts said. Additionally, retirees and other households may choose to draw money from Roth retirement accounts, which, with some exceptions, doesn't count toward taxable income. Savers can withdraw Roth contributions tax-free, even if they're not yet age 59½. Consumers who are still working and have some flexibility in their hours and work schedule might also opt to work less to reduce their annual earnings. ",

Because we are a Japanese company,\" Cessot said. He added that New York City's Fifth Avenue store uses coffee beans imported from Japan.Luxury brandsRecently, cafes have been particularly prevalent with designer brands.Over the past few years, fashion house LVMH has opened a Dior cafe in Dallas and Louis Vuitton Cafe in New York. It has also remodeled the Tiffany brand's Blue Box Café. All three locations are collaborations with Michelin-starred chefs.Remodeled Tiffany Blue Box Café in NYC.Source: Tiffany & Co.Prada, which is not a part of LVMH, is also rumored to be opening a New York location in 2026. The luxury retailer opened a cafe in London in 2023 and in Singapore in 2025.Coach, meanwhile, opened its first cafe in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2024. Since then, it has opened four in the U.S. and over a dozen more internationally.Marcus Sanders, Coach vice president of global food and beverage, said the company is seeing double to triple digit sales at stores where it added a cafe. \"Ultimately what I see happening is there's this really cool nexus of fashion meets hospitality,\" Sanders said. \"People are excited to be able to experience their favorite brands in a different way.\"The cafe rollout is also an effort by Coach to tap into popularity with Gen Z, Sanders said, which has been the core demographic driving its cultural resurgence. The brand saw a revenue increase of 22% in its fiscal 2026 first quarter.Standing outWhile more brands are adding cafes to their stores, this trend is not a new phenomenon. Barnes and Noble and Target have both partnered with Starbucks for their in-store cafes since 1993 and 1999, respectively. Capital One and Ralph Lauren both opened their first cafes in 2014. Capital One told CNBC that it now operates 65 cafes nationally. Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, operates over 40 cafes across the world, including in cities like London, Barcelona, Hong Kong and Singapore. Both companies are continuing to expand, with new openings planned for 2026.Pine said Covid decimated the experience economy but that people are looking to spend their time out and about again. He noted that cafes are one of the primary ways to do that.But as more companies jump on the trend, it will become increasingly commoditized, he said.\"It's something that you need to refresh to think about how you change this over time and you need to design it uniquely,\" Pine said. \"The Tiffany Blue Box Cafe [is] a beautiful example of that, so that it's not just about the coffee, it's about immersing you in the brand values, in the brand colors, in what it stands for.\"Coach put its own spin on the concept with pastries like the Tabby cake, an edible version of one of its best-selling handbags. Coach Tabby cakeSource: Coach Inc. At Capital One, cardholders of the namesake bank and Discover, which it acquired in a $35 billion stock deal in 2025, get half off beverage purchases. Unlike Coach, the bank doesn't run the food and beverage operations. Capital One said its cafes are independently run by a third-party provider and it does not share in profits or losses.  The bank can instead focus its efforts on how to leverage the space to increase its brand awareness. \"Bank accounts and credit cards and money are things that don't always feel tangible. And so the cafes can show up as a personification of what is Capital One,\" said Jennifer Windbeck, Capital One's head of retail bank channels. Uniqlo said it owns and operates the majority of its cafes, including the one inside its New York City flagship location, which has a coffee bar on the second floor of the store. Cessot said the goal was to make it a service area where guests can come pick up online orders, get their clothing repaired and customize their apparel. \"There's one aspect that is making profits, which we are obviously monitoring week over week, month over month. And then the second aspect is really about the customer. And really the reason why we opened this coffee is to really help our customer and enhance their shopping experience,\" Cessot said.Watch the video to learn more about why so many retailers are opening cafes.— CNBC's Melissa Repko contributed to this report",

    "body": "People walk near a sign outside of Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesA federal grand jury indicted three Silicon Valley engineers on charges of stealing trade secrets from Google and other technology companies and transferring sensitive data to Iran, prosecutors said Thursday.Samaneh Ghandali, 41, her sister Soroor Ghandali, 32, and Mohammadjavad Khosravi, 40 — all residents of San Jose — were arrested Thursday and appeared in a federal district court the same day.The indictment identified the defendants as Iranian nationals. Soroor was in the U.S. on a nonimmigrant student visa. Samaneh later became a U.S. citizen, and Khosravi, her husband, became a U.S. legal permanent resident. Prosecutors said that Khosravi previously served in the Iranian army.The trio faces charges of conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, theft and attempted theft of trade secrets, and obstruction of justice, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of California.Prosecutors alleged the three defendants exploited their positions at leading technology firms that develop mobile computer processors to obtain hundreds of confidential files, including materials related to processor security and cryptography. Samaneh and Soroor worked at Google before joining a third company identified only as Company 3. Khosravi worked at a separate firm referred to as Company 2, which develops system-on-chip (SoC) platforms such as the Snapdragon series for smartphones and other mobile devices.SoC is a semiconductor that integrates numerous components, such as graphics processing units and memory, into a power-efficient package. Common SoCs include Qualcomm's Snapdragon, found in most high-end Android phones, and Apple's A-series for iPhones.In a statement to CNBC, Google said it had detected the alleged theft through routine security monitoring before referring the case to law enforcement. \"We have enhanced safeguards to protect our confidential information and immediately alerted law enforcement after discovering this incident,\" spokesman José Castañeda said. The tech giant also pointed to measures to protect its trade secrets, including restricting employees' access to sensitive information, two-factor authentication for work-related Google accounts and logging file transfers to third-party platforms such as Telegram. Alleged efforts to concealAuthorities alleged the defendants routed stolen files through a third-party communications platform to channels bearing each of their first names, before copying the material to personal devices, each other's work devices, and to Iran. \"The method in which confidential data was transferred by the defendants involved deliberate steps to evade detection and conceal their identities,\" said FBI Special Agent in Charge Sanjay Virmani. The defendants sought to cover their tracks after Google's internal security systems flagged Samaneh's activity and revoked her access to company resources in August 2023. According to the indictment, she signed an affidavit falsely claiming she had not shared Google's confidential information outside the company. During that period, a personal laptop linked to Samaneh and Khosravi was used to search for methods to delete communications and to research how long mobile carriers retain message records, prosecutors said.The couple also allegedly photographed hundreds of computer screens containing confidential information from Google and Company 2, in what appeared to be an attempt at circumventing digital monitoring tools. On the night before the pair traveled to Iran in December 2023, Samaneh allegedly took about 24 photos of Khosravi's work computer screen containing Company 2's trade secrets, including its Snapdragon SoCs. Prosecutors allege that while in Iran, a device linked to Samaneh accessed those photographs, while Khosravi accessed additional Company 2's proprietary information, such as Snapdragon SoC hardware architecture.Prosecutors said in the indictment that Snapdragon SoC trade secrets had independent economic value because they were not generally known and could not be readily obtained from Company 2's competitors, who could benefit from their disclosure or use. If convicted, each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison for each trade secret charge and up to 20 years for obstruction of justice, along with fines of up to $250,000 per count.",

The paper also reported that Washington's Metropolitan Police Department on Jan. 24 filed a report about forced sexual contact at the department in December.CNBC obtained a public copy of that police report, which says, \"The complainant reported a sexual contact against her will\" during an incident at 11:30 a.m. ET on Dec. 18 at the Department of Labor building.The complainant's name was not given in the public copy of the report, nor was the name of the alleged assailant.Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer speaks during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 30, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe inspector general's office would not confirm or deny it was conducting an investigation when contacted by CNBC.Dr. DeRemer, the Labor Department, the Police Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CNBC.The Times in late January reported that a member of Secretary Chavez-DeRemer's security detail with whom she had been accused of having a romantic relationship, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the inspector general.The Labor Department's social media account in January posted a video that featured a slideshow of artworks depicting glorified scenes of American history.The caption above that video said, \"One Homeland. One People. One Heritage. Remember who you are, American.\"Social media users noted similarities between the Labor Department's post and a Nazi Party slogan.The slogan \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer,\" which the U.S. Holocaust Museum notes was used by Adolf Hitler and his Nazi Party, translates to \"One People, One Country, One Leader.\"",

    "body": "Robots taking part in a martial arts performance at the 2026 Spring Festival Gala in Beijing, China on February 16, 2026. Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChinese humanoid robots are having a moment in the spotlight after a standout performance at the country's annual Spring Festival Gala this week, with videos from the event circulating widely online. The show, widely considered the world's most-watched television program, featured robots from several startups performing everything from kung fu moves to choreographed dances to elaborate gymnastics displays. The show marked a sharp contrast from the 2025 Gala, which had featured less advanced versions of the robots twirling handkerchiefs in a wobbly folk dance. Around that time, public demonstrations of the humanoids often drew skepticism, such as a marathon incorporating robots in April that made headlines for stumbles, crashes and breakdowns. But a year can make quite the difference. Viewers of this week's event have expressed everything from admiration for the technological advancements to concern about what they mean for the labor force and the U.S.-China tech race. As we watch them push the physical boundaries humans are capable of, it becomes apparent they can achieve human-level actions, and eventually superhuman-level performances.Reyk KnuhtsenAnalyst at SemiAnalysisAnalysts told CNBC that while humanoid robots still have more to prove, the advancements made over the past year warrant global attention.  \"People should absolutely be taking these robots seriously,\" Reyk Knuhtsen, analyst at SemiAnalysis, told CNBC. \"After this spring gala demonstration, they're becoming visibly more lean, fluid, and capable.\" \"As we watch them push the physical boundaries humans are capable of, it becomes apparent they can achieve human-level actions, and eventually superhuman-level performances,\" he added. China's early leadChina has already eked out an early lead in the manufacturing and deployment of humanoid robots, according to data from Barclays. Analysts at the company estimate that of the roughly 15,000 humanoid robot installations in 2025, China accounted for more than 85%, compared with just 13% in the U.S.\"The fundamental advantage that China has is a nearly vertically integrated robotics value chain: from the rare earths and high-performance magnets to the physical components, and the batteries,\" Zornitsa Todorova, Head of Thematic FICC Research at Barclays, told CNBC. Leading Chinese humanoid companies like Unitree are hoping to maintain that lead into this year. The start-up, whose robots were prominently featured at the Spring Festival Gala, expects between 10,000 and 20,000 shipments in 2026, the CEO told local media just before the show ended. The enhanced dexterity shown in routines like aerial flips and weapon handling signals strong potential for economic impact in physically demanding tasks that involve delicate tool handling and precise movements.Lian Jye SuOmdia chief analystChina's manufacturing advantage, combined with government support, has also enabled Chinese robotics producers to manufacture their products at much lower prices than competitors, Todorova said.Unitree, for example, advertises a base price of $13,500 for its G1 humanoid robot. Meanwhile, Tesla's Optimus, a humanoid leader in the U.S., is expected to keep prices higher in the near term. CEO Elon Musk said during an earnings call in Jan. 2025 that the robot's production cost could fall below US$20,000 if annual output reaches 1 million units, though final pricing would depend on market demand.Analysts expect U.S. humanoid manufacturers to also increase production this year, but say they likely have their work cut out for them.\"Other markets will ramp up but likely lag due to China's established supply chains and production scale,\" said Omdia chief analyst Lian Jye Su, adding that China is likely to lead for at least the next few years. Caveats remainWhile the Spring Festival Gala showcased rapid advances, analysts cautioned that humanoid robots still face technical hurdles. \"The enhanced dexterity shown in routines like aerial flips and weapon handling signals strong potential for economic impact in physically demanding tasks that involve delicate tool handling and precise movements,\" said Omdia's Su. \"However, they still need to prove reliability in unstructured, human-centric environments for delicate tasks like healthcare or household assistance. Ongoing AI and mechanical upgrades will be required.\"In those tasks, advances in the underlying AI and minutiae mechanical engineering will matter more than raw manufacturing and shipment numbers. \"[T]he AI model race is still undecided, and that will be the defining factor in the end, as the robot will only be as useful as its model,\" said Knuhtsen. While China's robotics companies have impressed viewers with their flashy kung-fu routines, the analyst said advances in reasoning, longer task durations, and the ability to chain multiple tasks together to perform different chores will matter more this year.\"I think this is where a lot of economic value lies, and it's steadily improving.\"",

The therapies rely on induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells — adult cells that are reprogrammed back into a stem-cell-like state.Stem cells are are capable of self-renewal and work as a repair system, replacing damaged cells and maintaining tissues, allowing them to be used in regenerative medicine.\"While the treatment could potentially see widespread use and become a blockbuster in Japan and the US over the long term, we expect almost no profit contribution near term,\" said Citigroup Global Markets Japan's analyst Hidemaru Yamaguchi.Sumitomo's stock has been overheated, and recent gains have been  \"excessive,\" he added.According to Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, formal approval will be granted within the next one to two months, NHK reported.The endorsement comes years after Kyoto University professor Shinya Yamanaka, who later won a Nobel Prize for his stem cell research, first succeeded in generating iPS cells from mice in 2006. Japan has been striving to develop stem-cell therapies, with Kyoto University's CiRA, which runs a clinical-grade iPS cell bank, providing researchers access to prepared cells that can be used in trials for a range of conditions.Sumitomo Pharma develops and markets prescription medicines across multiple therapeutic areas, including neuroscience, oncology and regenerative medicine.",

Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's headline inflation rate fell to 1.5% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. The reading ended a run of 45 straight months in which inflation had remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target.Core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, eased to 2%, the lowest level since January 2024 and matching the 2% forecast by economists polled by Reuters. It was down from 2.4% in December.The so-called \"core-core\" inflation — excluding prices of fresh food and energy — came in at 2.6%, compared with 2.9% in December.The slowdown was driven by declines in fresh food, raw meat and fresh flower prices, as well as a sharper drop in petroleum products.Goods inflation fell to 1.6% from 2.7%, its lowest level since August 2021, while services inflation held steady at 1.4%.In January, the Bank of Japan upgraded its inflation forecasts for fiscal 2026, which begins April 1. It projected core inflation at 1.9% and \"core-core\" inflation at 2.2%, up from 1.8% and 2%, respectively, in its October 2025 outlook.The BOJ also wrote in its outlook that the year-over-year rise in consumer prices is likely to fall below 2% in the first half of 2026, as food prices stabilize and government efforts to ease living costs.Rice inflation slowed for an eighth straight month to 27.9%.Among those measures is an election pledge by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to suspend an 8% food tax for two years.Takaichi swept to a landslide victory in the Feb. 8 Lower House election, with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party winning 316 seats, the strongest showing by a single party since the end of World War II.The inflation reading comes after Japan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter on Monday, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.Despite the slowdown in headline inflation, the Bank of Japan is unlikely to delay rate hikes, according to Norihiro Yamaguchi, lead Japan economist at Oxford Economics. He said fresh-food prices remain volatile, while energy costs fell after Japan scrapped its fuel tax in December. As a result, the core-core index, which excludes fresh foods and energy, provides a clearer gauge of underlying price pressures, easing only gradually to 2.6% from 2.9%. Yamaguchi expects the BOJ to raise rates to 1% at its June meeting, after assessing spring wage negotiation data.",

Bing Guan | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe private credit boom is facing a new test after Blue Owl Capital permanently restricted withdrawals from one of its retail-focused debt funds.Shares in Blue Owl Capital fell nearly 6% on Thursday after the private market and alternative assets manager sold $1.4 billion of loan assets held in three of its private debt funds.The biggest portion of the sale came from a semi-liquid private credit fund marketed to U.S. retail investors called the Blue Owl Capital Corporation II, which will stop offering quarterly redemption options to investors, reigniting debate over whether stress was beginning to resurface in one of Wall Street's fastest-growing corners.\"This is a canary in the coal mine,\" Dan Rasmussen, founder and adviser at Verdad Capital told CNBC. \"The private markets bubble is finally starting to burst.\"The broader concern is that years of ultra-low interest rates and thin yield spreads encouraged lenders to make riskier moves, financing smaller, more leveraged companies at yields that appeared attractive compared with public markets, market watchers said.\"Years of ultra-low rates and ultra-low spreads and very few bankruptcies led investors to go further and further out the risk spectrum in credit,\" Rasmussen said. \"This is a classic case of 'fool's yield,' high yield that doesn't translate into high returns because the borrowers were too risky.\"Private credit, which are generally direct loans made by non-bank lenders to companies, have ballooned into a roughly $3 trillion market globally.When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom.Michael ShumCascade DebtPublicly traded business development companies, or BDCs, which are investment vehicles that lend to small and mid-sized private companies and are a major part of the private credit market, are increasingly funded by retail investors rather than institutions, according to Duke University's Fuqua School of Business. The Fuqua research, which was published last September, showed that institutional ownership of BDC shares has steadily declined over time, falling to about 25% on average by 2023.\"This trend indicates that retail investors are playing an increasingly large role in supplying equity capital to publicly traded BDC,\" the researchers pointed out.In 2025, the eight largest members of the S&P BDC Index offered dividend yields which can go up to 16%, with Blue Owl's at over 11%. For comparison, the S&P Global's U.S. high yield corporate bond index 1-year, 3-year and 5-year returns stand at around 7.7%, 9% and 4%, respectively.\"The majority of loans in private credit funds that individual investors tend to own, they're high yield loans. They are, by their nature, somewhat risky,\" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.\"Over the course of the cycle, you can anticipate some material defaults across these funds,\" he added.Rising risks?Private credit concerns recently resurfaced after investors grew uneasy that AI tools could disrupt traditional enterprise software models, a major borrower group of the industry, adding to existing concerns in over rising leverage, murky valuations and the possibility that isolated borrower stress could reveal deeper systemic weaknesses. The First Brands Group collapse last September brought to fore risks in private credit after the heavily leveraged auto-parts maker ran into distress, highlighting how aggressive debt structures had built up quietly during years of easy financing. The episode heightened fears that similar risks could be lurking across the market, prompting JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to warn that private credit risks were \"hiding in plain sight,\" warning that \"cockroaches\" will likely emerge once economic conditions deteriorate.The fundamental problem private market deals have is multi-year commitments that don't line up with quarterly redemptions, said Michael Shum, CEO of Cascade Debt, which builds infrastructure software for private credit and asset-based lenders.\"When times are good, cashflows cover normal redemption requests. When times are bad, requests surge and it becomes a race to the bottom,\" he said.Blue Owl did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",

Abigail Spanberger will deliver the Democratic rebuttal to President Donald Trump's State of the Union address next Tuesday, a primetime slot for the newly elected state executive to lay out the Democratic Party's vision ahead of the pivotal 2026 midterm elections. Spanberger defeated Republican Winsome Earl-Sears by 15 points in last year's elections, flipping the state from Republican to Democratic control. She was previously a member of the House of Representatives from Virginia.The rebuttal to the State of the Union is a high-stakes opportunity for the party outside of the White House to lay out its vision for the country after the president gives his speech. The stakes are even higher for Democrats this year, who are looking to rip away Trump's complete control of Washington in the midterm elections. \"Virginians and Americans across the country are contending with rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring,\" Spanberger said in a statement announcing her speech. \"Next week, I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve — leaders who are working hard to deliver for them.\"House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said in a statement that Spanberger \"stands in stark contrast to Donald Trump, who will lie, deflect and blame everyone but himself for his failed presidency on Tuesday evening.\"And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said she will \"lay out a clear path forward: lower everyday costs, protect healthcare, and defend the freedoms that define who we are as a nation.\"Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., gave the rebuttal to Trump's joint session of Congress last year. The last time a governor gave the rebuttal was in 2022 when Republican Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds spoke following President Joe Biden's State of the Union address.",

Brendan McDermid | ReutersLONDON — European stocks were set to open higher on Friday as traders await economic data and more earnings reports, while monitoring tensions between the U.S. and Iran. London's FTSE 100 is set to open 0.5% higher, Germany's Dax 0.3%, and France's CAC 40 0.6%, according to data from IG. Friday will see more European companies reporting earnings, including Air Liquide, Danone, Sika, Anglo American, and Kingspan Group. Traders are also parsing through economic data, including U.K. retail sales figures, German producer price figures, and PMI flashes for the U.K., France, Germany, and the euro zone. The U.K.'s retail sales figures were estimated to have risen 1.8% in January 2026, up from a 0.4% increase in December 2025, pointing to an uptick in the economy, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Additionally, sales volumes rose by 4.5% over the year. Britain's public finances, released Friday, showed that the public sector recorded a £30.4 billion ($40.8 billion) surplus in January 2026, which is double the level recorded a year earlier. Public borrowing stood at £112.1 billion since the start of the fiscal year in April 2025, 11.5% less than the same period a year ago. The British pound was down 0.1% against the dollar, trading at $1.344, following the release of the data. British government bond yields, known as gilts, edged higher. The 10-year Gilt was up less than a basis point to 4.376%, while the 2-year Gilt rose 1 basis point to 3.588%. Geopolitical tensions are also in focus after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would decide whether to take military action against Iran in the next 10 days.U.S. futures climbed overnight as key economic data is due to be released, including the personal consumption expenditures index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, and the gross domestic product report for the fourth quarter.Asia-Pacific markets were mostly lower on Friday, after the three major Wall Street indexes were down overnight amid a drop in private credit stocks and the tensions in the Middle East.",

    "body": "Les Wexner speaks during a deposition about Jeffrey Epstein. Courtesy: GOP Oversight via YouTubeJeffrey Epstein would \"name drop\" President Donald Trump as one of the many high-profile people he claimed to know, billionaire retail magnate Leslie Wexner said this week in a congressional deposition about the notorious sex offender.The 88-year-old Wexner, who was one of Epstein's top clients and benefactors, said Epstein \"held [Trump] out as a friend,\" according to a video of the deposition that House Democrats released Thursday.But Wexner, the retired founder of Victoria's Secret ex-parent L Brands, said he did not believe Trump and Epstein were actually friends. And he denied seeing or hearing anything about Trump having a sexual relationship with someone introduced to him by Epstein or his convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell.He also told lawmakers that both Trump and Epstein would sometimes be at the lingerie company's fashion shows — though he suggested it was a \"coincidence\" and that he can't recall \"something ... that would put them together.\"\"I remember because Trump would always introduce himself to me, and I always thought it was kind of odd that he was at the fashion show because he had nothing to do with fashion,\" Wexner said.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.The deposition occurred as the Department of Justice's recent release of millions of additional Epstein-related files raises new questions about the late sex criminal's ties to a growing list of prominent figures.Video of the nearly five-hour deposition, conducted Wednesday in New Albany, Ohio, where Wexner lives, was shared on the YouTube account for the House Oversight Committee's Republican majority. Democrats on the Oversight panel, who had traveled to Ohio for the deposition, said that no Republican committee members attended.They also expressed skepticism about Wexner's insistence that he had virtually no social life with Epstein, and they vowed to continue investigating.\"I do not believe when Mr. Wexner says that he did not have a personal relationship or a friendly relationship\" with Epstein, Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the panel's ranking member, told reporters Wednesday.Asked if he had a relationship with Trump, Wexner laughed and said he did not. Despite their occasional exchanges at the fashion shows, \"we didn't know each other,\" Wexner said. \"I'd be shocked if he remembered me.\"Trump has never discussed Epstein with Wexner, he said.But when asked if Epstein ever discussed Trump with him, Wexner paused and then said, \"I would describe it — he would name drop it.\"\"So he would say things like, 'I know [former President Bill] Clinton or I know the Pope or I know God... It was that kind of name dropping, but never, I can't remember [a] specific place, but Jeffrey dropped a lot of names.\"Asked to clarify that Epstein specifically referenced Trump, Wexner seemed to backtrack. \"No, I'm saying it could have and I don't remember,\" he said.Wexner also said Epstein never shared any information with him about Trump's sexual activities.The comments revealed from the deposition video align with the prepared statement Wexner gave the committee, in which he claimed he was \"duped\" and \"conned\" by Epstein but was uninvolved with, and ignorant of, any of his criminal activities.Wexner in the deposition also denied ever meeting prominent Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in Epstein's presence. Giuffre has claimed that Wexner sexually abused her. Wexner, in his prepared statement, said he has never been unfaithful to his wife in 33 years of marriage.",

The strait is a key chokepoint for the global oil trade. Oil traders are worried that a war between the U.S. and Iran could disrupt crude flows through the strait. ",

    "body": "India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi (L) takes a group photo with AI company leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman (C) and Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei (R) at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi on February 19, 2026.Ludovic Marin | Afp | Getty ImagesOpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei had an awkward moment on Thursday as they chose not to hold hands during a group photo of political and tech leaders. They were on stage at the India AI Impact Summit, alongside Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, among others. Both had been keynote speakers.Modi had lifted Altman and Pichai's hands before an applauding crowd, with others following suit. However, Altman and Amodei, who were side by side, raised their fists instead of holding hands with one another. It comes as competition intensifies between ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Claude maker Anthropic, with both vying for their models to become the default choice for consumers globally. The companies have also recently traded shots over the potential use of adverts in AI models.The image of Altman and Amodei opting out of holding hands quickly made the rounds on social media.Siddharth Bhatia, cofounder of AI startup Puch AI, posted on X: \"When AGI? The day Dario and Sam hold hands.\"Justine Moore, an investing partner at Andreesen Horowitz, shared a picture with the words: \"When you're forced to do a group project with your opp.\"watch nowLast month, Anthropic released Super Bowl commercials that poked fun at OpenAI's plan to start testing ads for free users and ChatGPT Go subscribers in the U.S. Altman called the ads \"clearly dishonest,\" saying: \"I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it.\"Anthropic's chief customer officer, Paul Smith, later told CNBC that it was focused on growing its business rather than making \"flashy headlines,\" in a veiled swipe at OpenAI.Speaking at the summit after the photo, Altman told CNBC: \"We still have some work to do to figure out the exact ad format that's going to work best.\"Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI staff and researchers, including Amodei, who left the company after disagreements over its direction. The company has marketed itself as a \"safety-first\" alternative.OpenAI and Anthropic have since raised billions of dollars of capital as they've competed for users, enterprise customers and market share.During his speech at the summit on Thursday, Amodei discussed the \"serious risks\" associated with AI, including the autonomous behavior of AI systems, their potential misuse by individuals and governments, and the potential for economic displacement.Altman, in his speech, argued that the industry's understanding of AI safety should include \"societal resilience,\" adding: \"We believe no AI lab can deliver a good future on their own.\"",

    "body": "A \"Now Hiring\" sign is seen at an AutoZone on Feb. 11, 2026 in Hollywood, Florida. Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesWith the upheaval of the Covid pandemic came opportunity, as a shift in the labor market gave workers unprecedented opportunities for mobility and a chance to climb the pay scale.The \"great resignation,\" as it came to be known, saw record numbers of employees quit in favor of better opportunities, as companies couldn't hire workers fast enough to fill the vacancies that the pandemic helped create. A record 4.5 million left their jobs for greener pastures in March 2022. But that is changing.The level of \"quits\" as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has contracted by nearly one-third since hitting its peak in early 2022, a period during which job openings have nearly halved. One metric helps further tell the story: During the same period, the disparity between average annual pay increases for those staying in their jobs and for those leaving has all but collapsed, going from a peak of 8.4 percentage points in April 2022 to 1.9 percentage points in January. That's the lowest level since payrolls processing firm ADP began tracking the data in November 2020.Call it the \"big stay,\" or just another outgrowth of the low-hire, low-fire labor market, but it's a trend that has significance for workers.A pendulum swing\"It's a very stable labor market. There's very little hiring, very little firing,\" said Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP. \"It's an outgrowth of the pandemic from where it was all hands on deck.\"A lack of labor supply and a pernicious skills gap was the story when the economy was trying to recover from the massive drawdown it had seen during the early Covid days. Workers and employers were adjusting to the new world of hybrid work, and companies were hungry for new recruits.As the \"great resignation\" peaked, there were more than two job openings per each worker the BLS classified as unemployed. That pendulum has swung back, however, and there are now more available workers than openings.watch nowLayoffs, though, remain low. Last week saw just 206,000 initial jobless claims, with the longer-term average at 219,000, about in line with historical norms for a healthy labor market. Though hiring has slowed considerably, the unemployment rate is just 4.3%. \"If you were to parachute into this labor market in any time period of the United States, you'd be mostly happy with what you found,\" Richardson said. \"The action is in the granular data.\"For instance, pay trends are peculiar to industries. In the high-turnover leisure and hospitality industry, pay gains are better for job stayers, with the disparity at 2.5% in stayers' favor, according to ADP. However, construction, which is struggling with labor supply during the U.S. crackdown on illegal immigration, has a 6.6 percentage point advantage for switchers.The incentives are still strong for switchers, with annual pay growth averaging 6.4% in January, well above the 4.5% for stayers, according to ADP data. But the gap is narrowing and could close further due to current labor market moves.A new realityThe trends come with a fresh flock of workers combing the want ads for jobs.Searches were up 31% in January from December while job postings were little changed, according to Indeed Hiring Lab.\"The reality facing those seeking jobs in 2026 is that openings per unemployed person have declined, and hiring timelines are lengthening,\" Indeed experts Laura Ullrich and Sneha Puri wrote. \"While some sectors continue to see elevated levels of postings, the macro environment remains in the low-hire, low-fire stagnation of 2025.\"Even with the low unemployment rate, Richardson said she is concerned with the \"lack of dynamism in the labor market\" as most hires are in the health-care industry and turnover is receding.\"The fact that it is low-hire, low-fire is actually not a great state to be in. The churn is important to the productivity growth,\" she said. \"You want to see the most talented go to the places where that talent is the most rewarded. And if we are in this really stable period, that means that talent is not being repositioned to its best use.\"",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Figma closed up 7% on Thursday, but were short of the initial surge following earnings.The stock was up by as much as 15% after the bell on Wednesday, when the design software maker reported fourth-quarter results that beat analysts' expectations and offered rosy guidance.Figma's revenue grew 40% year over year to $303.8 million during the period. It reported a net loss of $226.6 million, or 44 cents per share, compared with net income of $33.1 million, or 15 cents per share, in the fourth quarter of 2024.The company expects to report $315 million to $317 million in first-quarter revenue, which implies 38% year-over-year growth. Analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $292 million.Analysts at Bank of America said Figma's fourth-quarter results were solid, and its guidance took center stage. They said all key growth drivers are \"very much in place\" at the company, but it could still face some headwinds because of broader market uncertainty.\"Figma's AI monetization timetable is certainly on track, though Figma shares could remain under pressure until a tangible revenue disclosure, given the bearish sentiment on apps generally,\" the analysts wrote in a Wednesday note.In recent months, investors have grown worried about artificial intelligence's potential to disrupt software companies, sparking a massive sell-off in the sector. Shares of the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF are down more than 20% year to date.Figma, which was caught up in the sell-off, has been working to build AI into its products. The company announced a partnership with the AI startup Anthropic on Tuesday.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFigma one-year stock chart.\"If you look at software, not only is it not going away, there's going to be way more of it than ever before,\" Figma CEO Dylan Field said in a Wednesday interview. He did note, however, that the market is \"potentially increasingly competitive.\"Analysts at Morgan Stanley said even Figma's \"best in class growth rates\" couldn't insulate shares from the \"rising tide of investor concerns around the disruptive impacts of GenAI.\" They said the company's fourth-quarter results suggest it is a strong participant in the AI innovation cycle, and not a company at risk of disruption. The analysts pointed to rising usage of Figma's AI-based tooling, broadening partnerships with AI companies and competitive monetization avenues. \"Bottom line, we come out of the Q4 print feeling better about Figma's expanding solution portfolio and positioning in an AI world, and with shares having pulled back considerably we see a much moreattractive risk/reward in the shares,\" the analysts wrote in a note Thursday. — CNBC's Jordan Novet contributed to this report Read more CNBC tech newsAmid Epstein fallout, Bill Gates becomes point of controversy at India AI summitOpenAI and Anthropic's rivalry on display as CEOs avoid holding hands at AI summitChinese tech companies progress 'remarkable,' OpenAI's Altman tells CNBCAnthropic is clashing with the Pentagon over AI use.

    "body": "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent testifies before a House Financial Services Committee hearing about the annual report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 4, 2026. Kylie Cooper | ReutersDozens of House Democrats wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Thursday calling for an investigation into possible conflicts of interest and national security concerns related to World Liberty Financial, the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture.The letter, led by Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y. and 40 other lawmakers, landed after Bessent testified at a contentious House Financial Services Committee hearing earlier this month. Meeks at the hearing called Bessent a \"flunky\" of President Donald Trump and raised questions about a $500 million stake that Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan — a royal from the United Arab Emirates also known as the \"spy sheikh\" — bought in World Liberty Financial last year.\"The Trump family's $500 million deal connected to the Emirati royal family is not only a matter of national financial instability, but it also carries serious national security implications,\" Meeks said in a statement accompanying the letter. \"Trust that the record will reflect whether Secretary Bessent chooses to answer to the American people, or his mob boss.\"The request for a probe was made as World Liberty Financial is seeking a national bank charter, a distinction reviewed and issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an independent arm of the Treasury Department that regulates banks. World Liberty Financial held a day-long forum Wednesday at Mar-a-Lago where presidential sons Don Jr. and Eric Trump touted the family's stablecoin and called traditional banking a \"Ponzi scheme.\"Meeks at the hearing asked Bessent to commit to pause any pending applications from World Liberty Financial before the OCC and to complete an investigation into the \"conflicts of interest and foreign influence.\"\"The OCC is an independent entity,\" Bessent said then, over the shouts of Meeks, without addressing the topic further.President Donald Trump and his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, are co-founders emeritus of the company, which is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families.\"This is no longer just a debate about crypto chartering theory. It is about foreign ownership, national security, regulatory integrity, and whether our bank-chartering process is resilient to political and geopolitical pressure,\" the lawmakers wrote Thursday.In the letter, Democratic members asked for information on the safeguards in place to ensure that \"foreign government officials, sovereign proxies, or politically connected investors cannot use the bank-chartering process to gain leverage over the U.S. financial system or access sensitive financial or technological infrastructure.\"It also asks what role the White House, Office and Management and Budget and Treasury have in \"reviewing, approving, or otherwise influencing national bank or trust chartering decisions made by the\" OCC. It lawmakers requested a response from Treasury by Feb. 26.A Treasury Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\"The credibility of America's banking regulatory framework, and of the institutions charged with protecting it, depends on transparency, independence, and a demonstrated willingness to resist undue influence,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Our constituents need confidence that our banking system is governed by law, not proximity to power; by prudential judgment, not political convenience.\"",

    "body": "Man and boy sit on a paved sidewalk and draw alien faces.Annie Otzen | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he would direct the Department of Defense and other agencies to make public government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life.Trump said the files that will be identified and released will also concern unidentified aerial phenomena and unidentified flying objects, as well as \"any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters.\"In a Truth Social post, the U.S. president said his move was based on the \"tremendous interest\" in the subject, without providing additional details. This comes after he accused former U.S. President Barack Obama of leaking \"classified information\" on aliens. \"I don't know if they're real or not, but I can tell you he gave classified information,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. Obama said on Saturday in a podcast that aliens were real, \"but I haven't seen them, and they're not being kept in ... Area 51.\" \"There's no underground facility, unless there's this enormous conspiracy, and they hid it from the president of the United States,\" Obama added.Area 51 refers to a classified U.S. Air Force facility in Nevada, and has been the center of conspiracy theories saying the U.S. government has been conducting research and using the facility for storing extraterrestrial materials and technology. Obama had previously said that the first question he wanted answered when he became president was \"Where are the aliens?\"After the podcast on Sunday, the former U.S. president clarified his stance on a post on Instagram, saying that the universe was so vast that the odds are good that there's life out there. However, he said that he also saw \"no evidence\" during his presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with Earth.\" In late 2024, the Pentagon said it had seen 757 new reports of unidentified anomalous phenomena, or UAPs between May 2023 and June 2024, NBC News reported.Of these, 21 \"merit further analysis\" due to \"anomalous characteristics and/or behaviors,\" the report said, adding that there was no evidence, so far, to substantiate life from another planet being involved in these sightings.",

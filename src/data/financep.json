    "body": "Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, Jan. 10, 2025.Angelika Warmuth | ReutersSilver prices slid as much as 16% on Thursday, snapping a two-day rebound, as the white metal continues to reel from excessive volatility.Spot silver prices are were last down over 9% at around $80 per ounce, while futures in New York were over 5% lower at $79.6 per ounce.Silver had been on a record-breaking spree before crashing almost 30% last Friday. In 2025, it gained about 146%, data from LSEG showed.Analysts point to speculative flows, leveraged positioning and options-driven trading, rather than physical demand, as key drivers of the recent price swings.\"You'd seen a lot of speculator positions build up ... I don't think it's been fully flushed out,\" said Sunil Garg, managing director of Lighthouse Canton.While Garg says the fundamental case for silver demand still holds, he advises to wait a bit more for the speculative positions to get \"wiped out\" first. Silver has a wide range of industrial and technological uses, extending from solar power, catalysts and electronics, amongst others.\"The margin requirements being raised by various metals exchanges around the world ... that's just something that's going to kill off some of the speculation,\" said Garg. The CME Group has raised margin requirements following the steep sell-off last Friday.\"As prices fell, dealer hedging flipped from buying into strength to selling into weakness, investor stop-outs were triggered, and losses cascaded through the system,\" Goldman Sachs said in a note on Wednesday. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSilver prices in the past one yearSilver's correction has been larger than gold's due to tighter liquidity conditions in the London market, which magnified price swings.Goldman added that the timing of the volatility suggested Western flows, rather than Chinese speculation, are behind much of the build-up and unwind, noting that most of the more violent moves occurred while Chinese futures markets were closed.The volatility in silver prices has drawn growing comparisons to meme stocks such as GameStop, the video-game retailer that became a global phenomenon in 2021 after retail traders on Reddit piled in en masse, sending its shares soaring far beyond what traditional valuation models could justify.Market watchers had warned that prices were detached from sustainable levels, turning the silver trade increasingly meme-like.The precious metals theme captured the public attention and led to \"momentum trading that exceeded even the type of outsized moves that we have seen in a wide range of speculative assets,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.Spot gold and futures declined a little under 1% to $4,918.7 and $4,938 per ounce, respectively.",

Revenue was up a modest 1% over the same period.The Japanese technology and entertainment giant raised its full-year outlook and now expects operating profit of 1.54 trillion yen, an increase of 110 billion yen, or 8% from its previous forecast.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconSony also raised its annual revenue projection by 300 billion yen to 12.3 trillion yen, or 3%, while keeping its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs at 50 billion yen.Sales in the game and network services division, which houses its popular PlayStation home console brand and represents Sony's top revenue driver, totaled 1.613 trillion yen, down 68.7 billion yen from a year earlier.While the unit has benefited from a shift to digital game purchases and growth in the PlayStation Plus subscription service in recent quarters, hardware shipment growth has remained more subdued.Sony's hardware business is expected to face headwinds this year from rising component costs. PlayStation consoles rely on a type of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips, which are in short supply as demand from artificial intelligence and data center operators increases.As a result, contract prices for conventional DRAM chips are projected to rise 90% to 95% in the current quarter from the previous three months, according to a report from market researcher TrendForce on Monday.In an earnings call on Thursday, a Sony executive said the company aims to blunt the impact of higher memory costs by focusing on monetizing its current install base and further expanding its software and network service revenue. Offsetting some of the pressure on the gaming business were stronger results from its music and imaging segments.Revenue in Sony's music business rose 12.6% from a year earlier in the December quarter, supported by growth in live events, merchandising and streaming services. Meanwhile, its imaging and sensing solutions business grew by over 20% in revenue. The unit specializes in the development and manufacturing of semiconductor-based imaging and sensing technologies, including components used in smartphones.Sony said that while the ongoing memory shortage is expected to impact the smartphone industry, its image sensors are primarily for the high-end market, which it expects to be less affected.Shares of Sony reversed gains  after the earnings release and ended the trading day flat on Thursday.",

Shell posted adjusted earnings of $3.26 billion for the quarter, missing analyst expectations of $3.53 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus. A separate, company-provided analyst forecast had put Shell's expected fourth-quarter profit at $3.51 billion.It marks Shell's weakest quarterly result since the first three months of 2021, when adjusted earnings came in at $3.2 billion.For the full-year 2025, Shell posted weaker-than-expected adjusted earnings of $18.5 billion, compared to annual profit of $23.72 billion a year earlier.\"I'd start off by saying it was actually a very strong operational quarter for us,\" Shell CEO Wael Sawan told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Thursday.\"A few things hurt us this quarter. Number one was some tax adjustments which went against us, chemicals has indeed been weak, but I would look to the strength actually of our integrated gas, upstream and marketing businesses,\" Sawan said.The company announced a 4% increase in its dividend to $0.372 per share and a $3.5 billion share buyback program, a move that marks the 17th consecutive quarter of $3 billion or more in buybacks.Net debt came in at $45.7 billion at the end of last year, with gearing at 20.7%.

    "body": "TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump (L) and China's President Xi Jinping arrive for talks at the Gimhae Air Base, located next to the Gimhae International Airport in Busan on October 30, 2025.Andrew Caballero-reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he had a \"long and thorough call\" with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, naming Iran, Russia's war in Ukraine, China's energy purchases and his upcoming visit in April among the key talking points.  Beijing's statement, however, singled out Taiwan as \"the most important issue\" in bilateral relations, urging the U.S. to \"handle the issue of arms sales to Taiwan with prudence.\" China maintains Taiwan is part of its territory, claims that have been rejected by the democratically governed island.Washington approved arms sales to Taiwan worth as much as $11.15 billion in December last year — one of its biggest ever — to strengthen the island's defenses and deter any military aggression by Beijing. China appears to be reminding Washington \"where the red lines are\" while seeking to avoid any action that could jeopardize Trump's plans to visit China in April, said David Meale, practice head for China at Eurasia Group.    Trump during his call stressed on the commercial ties between the two countries, including China's purchase of oil and gas, agricultural products and airline engine deliveries.   China agreed to increase its purchase of American soybeans to 20 million tones for the current season, 25 million for next, Trump said. \"The 'transaction-oriented' mindset of Trump should be a gift to Beijing as opposed to an ideology-driven one reinforced by coalition-building,\" said Neo Wang, lead China macro analyst at Evercore ISI in New York. The U.S. ambassador to China, David Purdue, reportedly said in a closed-door meeting in Hong Kong last month that Boeing was involved in the ongoing negotiations ahead of Trump's visit. Wang expects a signing ceremony for a deal covering as many as 500 Boeing aircraft to be witnessed by the two leaders during Trump's trip to Beijing. With a potential aircraft deal being the \"headline victory,\" Trump could remove the remaining 10% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports, \"during or shortly after\" the April meeting, Wang added. While Trump portrayed the call as an \"excellent\" discussion and touted his personal relationship with Xi was \"an extremely good one,\" Xi took a more measured tone, saying that \"the U.S. has its concerns and China has its concerns\" but a solution could be found if both sides approached each other with \"reciprocity.\"    Missing: rare earths, Venezuela Both sides did not mention China's supplies of rare earth minerals — an issue that flared up last year after Beijing used its dominance in critical minerals to gain leverage and push Trump to temper his tariff threats.    That could be a sign that the flow to the U.S. has been \"satisfactory,\" Wang said. Trump also sought to ramp up the U.S. stockpile of critical minerals through a new initiative, dubbed \"Project Vault,\" aimed at strengthening its supply chain to counter China's dominance in the sector.   The official readouts from both sides also left out the simmering tensions around Venezuela after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife in a stunning military operation earlier this year and seized the country's oil industry. Following the military operation, Trump had demanded that Venezuela cut its economic ties with several countries including China, but later softened his tone to say that Chinese investment would be welcome.   Iran flashpoint   Trump's call with Xi came hours after the Chinese president held a video conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin to discuss geopolitical flashpoints in the region. Putin's foreign affairs adviser Yuri Yshakov told reporters at a briefing following the Xi-Putin call that the two leaders sought to align their positions on global flashpoints including over Iran, Venezuela and Cuba. watch nowAccording to the official readouts, Xi and Putin appeared to be projecting a strong united front, with Moscow calling bilateral relations an important stabilizing factor at a time of growing global turmoil.Trump's call with Xi, where they discussed \"the current situation with Iran,\" came ahead of a critical talks between Washington and Tehran on Friday, although debates continued over the scope of the talk's agenda.    The Trump-Xi call suggested \"both sides have asks of each other for how they approach third country issues,\" said Meale, expecting the Middle East tensions to continue to be in play in the lead up to Trump's April visit. Trump had threatened strikes against Iran following Tehran's violent crackdown on protestors and earlier this week deployed a naval task force including aircraft carriers to the region. China is the largest buyer of Iranian oil. \"The broad swathe of topics covered in the call points to Trump's carrot and stick approach with China,\" said Reva Goujon, director at Rhodium Group, as the American leader takes aim at Russia's oil exports and seeks Beijing's cooperation in bringing Putin to the negotiation table to ultimately broker a peace deal in Ukraine.

Big orders for data center memory are taking production capacity for memory for smartphones and other devices.The company's smartphone customers, who buy their own memory and pair it with Qualcomm's processors and modems, are closely watching their purchases and inventories and adjusting them based on the availability of memory.Qualcomm finance chief Akash Palkhiwala said the guidance gap versus consensus estimates was due to the memory issue. watch now\"We're starting to see that memory is going to define the size of the mobile market,\" Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in an interview. Amon added that handset demand remains high, and the smartphone market is going through an upgrade cycle, but he said Qualcomm anticipates issues with smartphone supply. He said that the company doesn't know if smartphone makers will raise prices, but Amon said he expects Qualcomm's customers to focus on higher-tier devices, which will be more capable of absorbing memory price increases than budget handsets. Amon said on an earnings call that Qualcomm was most competitive in premium-tier handsets. \"We see this as an industry issue affecting everything in consumer electronics,\" Amon said. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconQualcomm one-day stock chart.During the quarter, Qualcomm reported $7.82 billion in handset sales, a 3% rise on an annual basis. Qualcomm's overall revenue grew 5% during the quarter. Qualcomm's smaller businesses grew more quickly during the quarter.  The company's Internet of Things group, which includes both chips for industrial uses as well as the chip that powers the Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, increased 9% during the quarter to $1.69 billion in sales. And Qualcomm's growing automotive business, which provides chips for carmakers, including Toyota, rose 15% to $1.1 billion for the division. Qualcomm said that it expected data center sales from its new AI chips and other data center products to start appearing in fiscal 2027.\"Everything is on track,\" Amon said on an earnings call. Net income in the period came in at $3 billion, or $2.78 per share, versus $3.18 billion, or $2.83 per diluted share in the year-ago period. In addition to selling chips, Qualcomm also licenses its intellectual property for technologies such as 5G to other hardware companies. That's reported as QTL revenues, which are significantly more profitable than hardware sales. Qualcomm reported $1.59 billion in QTL revenue during the quarter. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Qualcomm's net income for Q1 fiscal 2025 was $3.18 billion. A previous version misstated the company's net income for that period.WATCH: Memory is where the bottleneck is and we like Micron, says FL Putnam's Ellen Hazenwatch nowRead more CNBC tech news'Muskonomy' shakeup: SpaceX valuation approaches Tesla's after merger with xAIPinterest CEO rebukes, fires 'obstructionist' employees who created tool to track layoffsNvidia, OpenAI appear stalled on their mega deal.

    "body": "Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Alphabet Inc., during the Bloomberg Tech conference in San Francisco, California, US, on Wednesday, June 4, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle parent Alphabet beat Wall Street's expectations for its fourth quarter but a new, high bar for expected spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure tempered enthusiasm.Despite exceeding expectations on revenue, earnings per share and cloud, the Google parent's shares kept dipping in extended trading Wednesday, showing Wall Street remains sensitive toward AI spending.Alphabet said it expects 2026 capital expenditures to be in the range of $175 billion to $185 billion. The top end of that forecast would be more than double its 2025 capex spend. With the projection, Alphabet is resetting the year's expectations for how it'll spend in 2026 and testing its favor with Wall Street. The company said in October that it expected \"a significant increase\" to capex in 2026, but the projections shared Wednesday surpassed those of its hyperscaler peers.In its quarterly report last week, Microsoft didn't provide a specific forecast for the year, but said capex will \"decrease on a sequential basis\" this quarter, after the company reported spending of $37.5 billion in the latest period. Meta said it expects to spend between $115 billion and $135 billion in 2026, which at the high end would be almost double last year's figure of $72.2 billion.Amazon reports results on Thursday. Analysts expect the company's capex for 2025 to close at about $124.5 billion and for that figure to increase 18% this year to $146.6 billion, according to FactSet.Alphabet's spend increase comes at a time when Wall Street has been particularly sensitive to extra AI spend.Despite positive tech earnings, the software sector as a whole has lost 30% of its value in the last three months, CNBC's Michael Santoli said. That's due to concerns that AI tools will upend existing software tools and make higher spending riskier. Up until this point, Alphabet has been largely spared from any major stock moves, especially after it was one of the top performers of 2025. But while Wall Street balks at the bountiful spending, tech companies are racing to build more infrastructure to keep up with customer demand for AI services.Google's cloud unit, which houses most of its AI products and services, saw its backlog surge 55% sequentially and more than double year-over-year, reaching $240 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, Alphabet finance chief Anat Ashkenazi told analysts on a call Wednesday. Google recorded a nearly 48% increase in cloud revenue compared to a year ago.watch nowThe planned 2026 capex spend will go toward investing in AI compute capacity for Google DeepMind and to meet \"significant cloud customer demand as well as strategic investments in other bets,\" Ashkenazi said.She added that it would also be used to \"improve the user experience and drive higher advertiser ROI in Google services.\"Ashkenazi broke down how Alphabet used capex in 2025, which could signal how the company may invest this year. \"The vast majority of our capex was invested in technical infrastructure with approximately 60% of that investment in servers and 40% in data centers and networking equipment in Q4,\" Ashkenazi said.In between explaining the Capex increase, executives on Wednesday's call played up AI wins from the quarter. Google's flagship AI app Gemini now has 750 million monthly active users, up from 650 million last quarter, executives said. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai leaned into the company's deal with Apple to overhaul the Siri virtual assistant using the Gemini AI models, reiterating that the iPhone-maker had chosen Google as its preferred cloud provider.When asked what keeps executives up at night, Pichai responded \"compute capacity.\" \"Be it power, land, supply chain constraints, how do you ramp up to meet this extraordinary demand for this moment?\" he said. In December, Alphabet agreed to acquire data center company Intersect for $4.75 billion in cash and the assumption of debt.Pichai's comments reflect CNBC's reporting that showed the company is under pricey pressure to build quickly. Amin Vahdat, Google's AI infrastructure boss, told employees that the company has to double its serving capacity every six months in order to meet demand for AI services, CNBC reported in November.\"The competition in AI infrastructure is the most critical and also the most expensive part of the AI race,\" Vahdat said at the time.",

    "body": "Larry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, speaks during an interview with CNBC on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., Jan. 15, 2026.Brendan McDermid | ReutersBlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani want Indians to invest in the country's equity markets instead of gold.The advice comes at a time when the yellow metal has been witnessing heightened volatility, while Indian stocks have been underperforming with the Nifty 50 down nearly 2% so far this year. A large portion of domestic savings in gold and silver \"are unproductive,\" Ambani said during a fireside chat with Fink on Wednesday, adding that money in the \"stock market is compounding.\" Reliance Industries — India's largest conglomerate — and BlackRock — the world's largest asset manager — partnered to launch mutual funds in India last year. Jio BlackRock Asset Management rolled out its first equity fund in August last year and as of December end, it had assets under management of 31.98 billion rupees ($353 million) across its equity funds. Indians are among the leading buyers of gold in the world, but the country has been seeing increasing financialization of savings, with mutual funds growing in popularity. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconNifty 50 returns so far this yearGlobal consultancy firm Bain & Company estimates retail investor-driven assets of Indian mutual fund industry to grow to 300 trillion rupees ($3.3 trillion) by 2035 from 45 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2025.Indians still hold majority of their assets in gold and real estate — allocating nearly 59% in financial year 2025, according to a report by Bain. The share of physical assets was 66% in financial year 2015.At the event, Fink said that the next 20-25 years will be an \"era of India\" and Indians need to invest in their country's growth through capital markets. India is expected to remain the fastest-growing economy in the world, according to the International Monetary Fund, which has pegged its growth at 6.4% in 2026. In contrast, the IMF projects the world economy to grow by 3.3% in 2026. Major economies like Germany, the U.K and Japan are likely to grow in the low single digits.Fink also shared that based on BlackRock's experience in the U.S., the segment of the population that had invested in growth of America is far \"better off than those who just kept all their money in a bank account\"\"Indian equity market over the next 20 years will double and triple and quadruple,\" Fink told India's The Economic Times in a separate interview, adding that he doesn't see \"gold moving that way.\"Even as foreign investors have been net sellers of Indian equities for over a year, rising domestic participation in Indian equities has haled the markets stay in positive territory.Investment through systematic investment plans, which refer to investing bite-sized sums at regular intervals, tripled to 2.89 trillion rupees ($31.9 billion) in financial year 2025 from 2021, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India shows.In the last one year, MSCI India Index's dollar return of 2.61%, pale in comparison to 43.67% for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. However, over the last 5-year period, the India index has delivered nearly twice the returns of the broader emerging market index.",

Global benchmark Brent also fell 2.04% to $68.04 a barrel.Iran is seeking to focus talks on its longstanding nuclear dispute with Western powers, while the United States wants the agenda to also cover Tehran's ballistic missile program, its alleged backing of armed groups across the Middle East, and its domestic human rights record.On Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \"should be very worried,\" sending oil about 3% higher.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconOil prices slip after announcement of U.S.-Iran talksTrump had warned last month that he could order strikes on Iran if Tehran fails to agree to a deal around its nuclear program. He had also threatened to intervene in support of protesters who have been raising voices against the Islamic Republic.Analysts cautioned that markets may be over-interpreting diplomatic signals that could quickly reverse.\"It can be difficult to filter the messaging on Iran talks, which could lead to de-escalation but could also prove a mere tactical distraction ahead of military action,\" said MST Marquee's head of energy research, Saul Kavonic, who expects the oil market to \"jump around\" as sentiment around Iran talks develops and actual outcomes become clearer.He added that underlying risks remain elevated despite the pullback in prices. \"Ultimately, the large build up of military assets in the region by the U.S. and allies suggests a strike is more likely than not and the oil price is building in a premium to at least partly reflect that.\"Other analysts echoed the fragile nature of any diplomatic thaw and the asymmetric risks to oil supply should tensions flare again.\"Oil markets continue to react to the on again off again nature of potential talks between the United States and Iran, reflecting the deep distrust that each side has for the other,\" said Andy Lipow, president at Lipow Oil Associates.While Lipow said he does not expect Washington to directly target Iranian oil infrastructure, the risk of escalation could still come from Tehran. \"Iran might issue threats to tankers transiting the Strait of Hormuz in an attempt to halt loadings, and in the worst case attack those tankers in order to close the waterway, sending oil prices significantly higher.\"The Hormuz strait between Oman and Iran is a vital channel where about one fifth of global oil production flows daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It is a pivotal waterway linking crude producers in the Middle East with key markets across the world.Analysts at Citi warned that upside pressures remain embedded in the market.\"Crude oil prices moderated because of discussions concerning the upcoming US-Iran negotiations which have eased immediate risk premium, but both we and market participants remain concerned about upside risks,\" Citi said, pointing to U.S. actions toward Iran and uncertainty around Indian purchases of Russian oil as key factors.Citi noted that market positioning continues to reflect supply concerns, with oil for near-term delivery trading at a premium to later months, and skewed call option pricing showing that traders are still paying up for protection against higher prices.

The stock rose in extended trading. Ciena is replacing human resources software company Dayforce, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement on Wednesday. Private equity firm Thoma Bravo acquired Dayforce for $12.3 billion.Ciena sells a variety of products for high-speed fiber optical networks. Nearly 18% of revenue in the 2025 fiscal year came from an unnamed cloud provider, and about 11% came from AT&T, according to the company's annual report. Ciena's market cap has almost tripled in the past year. Shares of companies added to the S&P 500 often rise ahead of their inclusion in the index, as fund managers buy shares to match the benchmark. Technology companies AppLovin, Datadog, DoorDash and Robinhood entered the S&P 500 in 2025.For Ciena, the entry marks a return. The company joined the index in 2001, boosted by the dot-com and telecom boom, and was removed in 2009, when it was replaced by Visa. Investor excitement has returned due to soaring demand for data center infrastructure that can run generative artificial intelligence models. The opportunity represents \"a major contributor to our 2026 expected growth rate,\" Ciena CEO Gary Smith told analysts on a conference call in December. At the time, the company called for revenue to grow about 24% during the 2026 fiscal year, which would mark the fastest rate of expansion since 2011.On Tuesday, Ciena's stock closed at the highest price since 2001. Network equipment giant Cisco recorded a new high on Tuesday as well.As companies look to deliver additional AI capacity, components such as memory have become harder to find, driving up prices. Optical parts are also constrained, Marc Graff, Ciena's finance chief, said on the December conference call.\"We've worked really closely with our key suppliers and I know who those are, to make sure that we can secure supply,\" Graff said.WATCH: Josh Brown's best stocks in the market: Morgan Stanley, Baker Hughes and Cienawatch now",

Vcg | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's Hong Kong-listed technology stocks slid into bear market territory on Thursday, marking a sharp reversal from last year's rally as tax worries and global risk aversion rattles investor confidence.The Hang Seng Tech Index, which is dominated by mainland Chinese tech firms, fell more than 1%, taking the index down a little over 20% from its October peak. The index is down for a sixth straight session.Market participants pointed to fears of a possible increase in value-added tax on internet services as a key trigger for the recent decline. The anxiety follows a VAT increase that has already been implemented on certain telecom services, raising worries that internet platforms could be next.Speculation briefly extended to online gaming and other digital transactions, amplifying fears of fresh policy headwinds for a sector already scarred by years of regulatory tightening. Following a decline in tech stocks, officials Tuesday dismissed the speculations of a levy on the gaming industry.\"The sell-off in recent days is driven by concerns over possible VAT tax increase on internet services, online gaming and other online transactions. This follows the recent VAT increase on certain telecom services,\" said Qi Wang, investment strategist at UOB Kay Hian.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconPerformance of the Hang Seng Tech index in the past one yearThe pullback in China's tech stocks has also coincided with broader volatility in global technology markets, driven by fears around artificial intelligence-driven disruption to software companies.\"To me it's a barrage of negative news globally,\" said Phelix Lee, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.\"We have Anthropic reportedly rolling out an AI plugin that automates bits of legal work, sparking fears in legaltech firms and fueling the broader software sell down; then we have VAT hike rumors on Chinese internet firms and risk-off sentiment builds in the hardware AI trade as there are reports of rupture between Nvidia and OpenAI\"Despite the sharp drawdown, some investors see the sell-off as a corrective move rather than the start of a deeper downturn. Looking at the broader Hong Kong and China equity markets, the recent weakness appears concentrated in pockets that had previously outperformed, according to Morningstar. \"I regard the action as a healthy pullback and it's largely concentrated in sectors that have probably overshot fair values,\" said Lorraine Tan, director of equity research for Asia at the firm.Other asset managers say the fundamental outlook for Chinese tech has not materially deteriorated, even as near-term positive triggers lack visibility. \"Catalysts have been somewhat lacking for the sector,\" said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privée. \"Recently, there's also been regulatory noise in travel and e-commerce, which we think are specific rather than systemic, as well as some worries about value-added tax,\" Ling said. \"Fundamentally nothing has changed to derail our positive outlook [for Chinese tech stocks]. Valuations continue to be supportive, sector earnings have potential to rebound, and AI may provide a stream of catalysts ahead.\" ",

    "body": "The replica of the ARM is an electronic chip board during a collaborative ceremony launching a partnership between Malaysia and ARM Holdings in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on March 5, 2025. Hari Anggara | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesShares of UK-based semiconductor designer Arm Holdings plunged 7.48% in after-hours trading Wednesday after the company's licensing revenue missed Wall Street estimates.Arm's fiscal third-quarter licensing revenue rose 25% from a year earlier to $505 million, but came in 2.9% below the $519.9 million expected by analysts surveyed by FactSet.Andrew Jackson, an equity analyst at Ortus Advisors, said that investors were also reacting to Arm's guidance only slightly beating estimates, as well as a poor outlook delivered by its chip design customer Qualcomm. Shares of Qualcomm also nosedived 9.68% after hours Wednesday. While the company's fiscal first-quarter results beat expectations, its forecast disappointed due to a global memory shortage.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconDespite missing Wall Street estimates for licensing revenue, Arm posted record quarterly revenue of $1.242 billion for the last three months of 2025, driven by artificial intelligence demand. That figure beat LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.Arm's chip designs power most of the world's smartphones and are increasingly used in AI data centers and edge computing devices. \"ARM is trying to diversify into AI chips used for DC/servers, but the success of this remains uncertain, and its business model is still heavily reliant on royalties from chips used in consumer products such as handsets,\" Jackson said.He added that if Chinese smartphone production declines due to the memory shortages, Arm's outlook could worsen before improving.Executives at both Qualcomm and Arm have signaled that smartphone makers may scale back production volumes as supply constraints persist.Rolf Bulk, an analyst at Futurum Group, told CNBC that such a scenario would also pressure Arm customers like Apple and Samsung.  Smartphones remain Arm's largest end market, accounting for roughly half of its revenues, even as exposure  to data centers increases, Bulk said. Shares of Arm, which went public in 2023, have also faced broader tech market pressures in the lead-up to earnings and are down 4% year-to-date. ",

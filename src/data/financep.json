    "body": "U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) during a Senate Finance Committee hearing in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on April 8, 2025 in Washington, DC. Kayla Bartkowski | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is \"losing a self-inflicted trade war\" with China, leaving the United States with a \"weak hand\" going into his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Senate Democrats said Wednesday in a new report on the effects of Trump's wide-ranging tariffs.\"Trump's trade wars have imposed significant costs\" on U.S. consumers and businesses, \"sold out American farmers,\" and the president \"has strengthened China's hand while weakening America's leverage,\" the report says.CNBC received the report by Democrats on the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs a day before Trump is set to meet Xi in South Korea.Trump is \"putting America's long-term prosperity and security at risk,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said in a statement to CNBC.\"Trump needs to change course on his trade war with China now and stop hurting American families, farmers, and businesses,\" Warren said.Warren's comments came before Trump, speaking at the Asia Pacific Economic Forum in Gyoeongju, South Korea, said he was optimistic of reaching a trade deal with Xi, which could include reducing tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods.\"It's going to work out very, very well for everybody, and ... I look forward to seeing him,\" Trump said.The report points to inflation data and other economic metrics in the wake of Trump's implementation of global tariffs in April.\"Between January and April, year-over-year Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation was falling, but it has rebounded since May — after Trump announced his universal tariffs,\" the report said.\"Last week, CPI data showed that inflation increased by 3 percent year-over-year in September, the highest rate since May 2024,\" the report said.Core goods inflation, which includes physical products such as clothing, furniture, electronics, appliances, and cars, but excludes food and energy, also increased 1.5 percent over the year in September. Grocery goods also trended higher.\"Studies suggest that President Trump's tariffs are costing American families around $1,500 more per year and disproportionately harming lower- and middle-income households that spend a greater share of their incomes on essential goods,\" the report said.In addition to inflation data, the report also pointed to jobs data as evidence that Trump's trade policy is not reaping rewards.\"Rather than reviving manufacturing as promised, Trump's strategy has also caused the sector to shed 42,000 jobs and manufacturing employment has contracted for four straight months — the longest monthly streak of losses since early 2020,\" the report said.Warren and the other committee Democrats said that despite Trump's talk about an impending deal with Xi, it is clear China has the upper hand and continues to impose pain on American businesses and farmers.The report cited rare earths export controls imposed by China, and that nation's refusal, since May, to buy U.S.-grown soybeans. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this week that there was a framework of a deal that would see China defer restrictions on rare earths exports, and that also would alleviate U.S. farmers' concerns.China purchased $12.6 billion worth of American soybeans in 2024, but just $2.5 billion worth in the first half of 2025 before the effective boycott began.\"Simultaneously, Trump's tariffs have raised costs on farm inputs like fertilizer and equipment, squeezing farmers from both sides,\" the report noted.The report also says that China has expanded exports in the wake of Trump's tariffs.\"In September alone, China's exports to Africa increased 56.4%, to Southeast Asia by 15.6%, and to the EU [European Union] by 14%,\" the report said.\"China's exports continue growing despite U.S. tariffs, reaching record trade surpluses by routing goods through third countries. ",

    "body": "TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 27: U.S. President Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One as he arrives at Haneda Airport on October 27, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan. Takashi Aoyama | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said he expects to lower fentanyl-linked tariffs on China as Beijing confirmed a high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and the American leader.A spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Xi will meet Trump in Busan, South Korea, on Thursday to exchange views on issues of shared concerns, without elaborating.\"We are willing to work with the U.S. to push the meeting toward achieving positive outcomes,\" the spokesperson said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC.Earlier on Wednesday, Trump told reporters aboard the Air Force One that fentanyl flows into the U.S. and \"farmers\" will be among topics he expects to discuss with Xi on Thursday.When asked whether the potential one-year pause in Beijing's implementation of rare earth export controls would be enough to draw more concessions from the U.S., Trump said \"we haven't talked about the timing yet but we are gonna work out something.\"The two leaders' meeting — their first in-person sit-down since Trump's return to the office in January — comes as bilateral tensions have escalated in recent weeks. Beijing has turned up the heat on rare earth export controls, while Washington has retaliated with port fees on Chinese ships and threatened software-related export restrictions. A delicate trade detente between the world's top two economies that includes lower tariffs on each other's goods is nearing its expiration on Nov. 10, if they fail to agree on another extension. Trump has also threatened additional 100% tariffs on Beijing starting Nov. 1. The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday reported that the U.S. could cut the 20% fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese exports by half, in return for Beijing's crack down on the export of chemicals that make fentanyl. If Washington were to lower those tariffs to 10%, that would bring the average duty on most Chinese imports — currently around 55% — to about 45%.On whether Taiwan would be on the agenda, Trump said \"I don't know if we'll even speak about Taiwan. He may want to ask about it. There is not that much to ask about it.\"Answering a question about exports of Nvidia's Blackwell chips to China, Trump said \"I think we may be talking about that with President Xi.\"watch nowIn a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit on Wednesday, Trump said that he hoped to reach an agreement with Xi, which will be \"a good deal for both.\" The U.S. will also finalize a trade agreement with South Korea \"very soon,\" he added.Chinese President Xi will also deliver a speech at the summit and hold bilateral meetings with foreign leaders, a spokesperson of the ministry said last Friday.The U.S. president kicked off his whirlwind Asia trip on Sunday, signing a flurry of trade and mineral agreements with Southeast Asian leaders and most recently Japan.Likely outcomes from the Trump-Xi meeting include Beijing's guarantee of ensuring the U.S. access to rare earth items under its export-control measures, purchases of Boeing aircraft, approval for the sale of TikTok's U.S. operation and more efforts on curbing fentanyl flows, according to Neo Wang, China strategist at Evercore ISI.In return, the U.S. could offer to loosen export controls on certain semiconductor equipment and AI chips, roll back the 100% tariff threat, in addition to a reduction of 10 percentage points in the fentanyl-linked tariffs, starting from Nov. 10 as part of a renewed tariff truce, Wang said.\"We expect Beijing to give Trump a way out on the fentanyl deadlock, such as via a new promise from Xi in person, to facilitate Trump's reduction on China fentanyl tariff, effective no later than Nov. 10,\" Wang added.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "The logo and lettering of Paramount Skydance Corporation can be seen at a Paramount stand at the Media Days in Munich (Bavaria, Germany). Matthias Balk | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance is slashing nearly 1,000 jobs beginning on Wednesday, just months after the close of its merger, according to a person close to the situation. The layoffs will eventually amount to 2,000 roles, the person said.\"When we launched the new Paramount in August, we made clear that building a strong, future-focused company would require significant change – including restructuring the organization,\" CEO David Ellison told employees in a memo on Wednesday morning. \"As part of that process, we must also reduce the size of our workforce, and we recognize these actions affect our most important asset: our people.\"The merger between Paramount and Skydance closed in August, weeks after receiving long-sought regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission.Shortly after the deal closed Ellison and Paramount leadership telegraphed the upcoming job cuts, and said it had identified more than $2 billion in cost synergies.In Wednesday's memo, Ellison said the cuts would address \"redundancies that have emerged across the organization,\" as well as \"phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth.\"\"Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success,\" Ellison said in the memo. The layoffs will occur across the company, which includes CBS News, a portfolio of pay-TV networks and the film studio.Under Ellison's leadership Paramount has made a series of changes and deals since the summer — including a 7-year, $7.7 billion media rights deal for TKO Group's UFC and the acquisition of online publication The Free Press. The company has also made three takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery in recent weeks, CNBC previously reported.While it's the first round of layoffs for the newly merged company, Paramount had been through a series of employee cuts prior to the deal close. In 2024, Paramount's prior leadership said it would reduce its U.S.-based workforce by 15%.In June Paramount cut its U.S.-based staff by 3.5%, or several hundred employees, CNBC reported at the time.Layoffs have been hitting the media industry broadly in recent months as companies contend with the decline of the traditional pay-TV bundle and macroeconomic headwinds that have weighed on advertising revenue.— CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this article.",

Kent Nishimura | ReutersShares of Nvidia rose more than 4% Wednesday, making the tech giant the first company to cross the $5 trillion market value threshold.The extraordinary milestone reflects a remarkable rise for the company, which has evolved from a niche video game processor to an integral player in the artificial intelligence boom.Nvidia's stock, which closed up 5% Tuesday, has climbed more than 50% year-to-date.The latest move higher comes shortly after CEO Jensen Huang said Nvidia expects $500 billion in AI chip orders and announced plans to build seven new supercomputers for the U.S. government.Separately, Nvidia announced on Tuesday that it is taking a $1 billion stake in Nokia, forming a strategic partnership with the networking company to develop next-generation 6G cellular technology.Read more CNBC tech newsApple's iPhone Air doesn't look like a best-seller.

Last quarter, Microsoft disclosed the scale of its Azure cloud infrastructure business in dollars for the first time. The company said revenue in fiscal 2025 from Azure and other cloud services jumped 34% from the prior year to more than $75 billion.Microsoft is expected to report total revenue growth of 15% for the quarter from $65.6 billion a year ago, according to LSEG.Analysts will be paying close attention to Microsoft's capital expenditures as the company races to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI demand.Microsoft said in July that it expected to spend $30 billion in capex and assets acquired through leases during the quarter, representing annual growth of more than 50%. CFO Amy Hood told investors at the time that capex will grow in fiscal 2026, but it will be a slowdown from 2025.Following its fiscal fourth-quarter results, which included better-than-expected earnings and revenue, Microsoft's stock popped 4%. Ahead of Wednesday's results, analysts at Jefferies, who recommend buying the stock, said they expect Azure to deliver strong upside, and that the company is well positioned even though it's seasonally the weakest quarter.In addition to Azure, they said they see momentum from the Microsoft 365 productivity suite driving \"robust bookings growth and rising AI contribution.\"TD Cowen analysts, who also have a buy rating, said they expect Microsoft to offer healthy guidance, especially around Azure. The analysts highlighted Microsoft's ongoing infrastructure projects and said that if the sites all get deployed, they could result in $30 billion to $40 billion in incremental annual revenue for the company.Much of Microsoft's AI momentum has been attributed to its tight relationship with OpenAI.On Tuesday, OpenAI announced it has completed its restructuring and formally outlined Microsoft's stake in the company. Under the new structure, OpenAI's nonprofit will hold a 26% stake in its for-profit arm, worth about $130 billion. Microsoft will hold a 27% stake worth about $135 billion, and current and former employees and investors will own the remaining 47%.Microsoft shares have gained 29% this year, closing at a record $542.07 on Tuesday. The Nasdaq is up 23% in 2025.Microsoft is scheduled to hold its quarterly call with investors at 5:30 p.m. ET.WATCH: Microsoft market cap jumps to $4 trillionwatch now",

    "body": "A 'For Sale' sign is posted beside property for sale in Alhambra, California.Frederic J. Brown | AFP | Getty ImagesMortgage interest rates dropped for the fourth straight week last week, spurring both current homeowners and potential homebuyers to call their lenders. Total mortgage application volume increased 7.1% compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index.The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased to 6.30% from 6.37%, with points falling to 0.58 from 0.59, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. That is the lowest level since September 2024.Refinance demand, which is most sensitive to interest rate changes, jumped 9% for the week and was 111% higher than the same week one year ago. Last year at this time, the average rate on the 30-year fixed was 43 basis points higher.\"This recent decline in rates spurred the second consecutive week of increased refinance activity, driven mainly by conventional refinance applications,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA, in a release. \"The ARM [adjustable-rate mortgage] share of applications, which had been trending higher, dipped below 10 percent last week, as lower rates prompted more borrowers to choose fixed rate loans.\"Kan also noted that the average loan size of a refinance application remained elevated at $393,900, as borrowers with larger loans can see more savings on a refinance.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home rose 5% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week one year ago. Homebuyers are still facing high prices and increasing uncertainty on the economy.\"Purchase applications increased compared to a holiday-shortened week across most loan types. However, USDA applications fell more than 26 percent, impacted by the ongoing government shutdown,\" Kan added.Mortgage rates dropped even more to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. The markets, however, with very little government data to go on due to the shutdown, are focused even more intently than usual on Wednesday's announcement and news conference from the Federal Reserve on interest rates.\"We already know the Fed will be cutting rates, and that rate cut has no bearing on what happens to mortgage rates going forward,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"Rather, it would be the tone of the Fed's press conference, or the nature of any changes in the Fed's bond buying policies (something that might be included in [the] statement).\"",

    "body": "The Ultium Cell factory in Warren, Ohio, is shown, July 7, 2023.Gene J. Puskar | APGeneral Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers at manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio on Wednesday, citing a slowdown in the electric vehicle market.The company confirmed there were around 1,200 layoffs at Detroit's electric vehicle plant and 550 cuts at Ohio's Ultium Cells battery cell plant, in addition to 850 temporary layoffs at that site in Ohio. The company also said it would temporarily lay off 700 at Ultium Cells' Tennessee plant.\"In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,\" the company said in a statement. \"Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint, and we believe our investments and dedication to flexible operations will make GM more resilient and capable of leading through change.\"GM also said battery cell production at its Ohio and Tennessee facilities will be temporarily paused beginning in January. It anticipates resuming operations at both battery cell sites by the middle of 2026 and will use the pause to upgrade its facilities.Wednesday's layoffs follow the company saying last week that it would cut more than 200 salaried employees, mostly engineers at its global tech campus in metro Detroit, as part of a restructuring effort.After September, federal incentives of up to $7,500 to purchase electric vehicles was discontinued, leaving consumers racing to use the benefit before the expiration. Though sales for plug-in vehicles soared to records for many automakers in the third quarter, that demand is expected to decline following the discontinuation.GM previously reported a more than doubling of sales for electric vehicles during the third quarter from the year prior, a trend other automakers like Ford Motor and Hyundai saw as well.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box\" last week.Still, GM's third-quarter results last week included a $1.6 billion impact from its all-electric vehicle plans not playing out as anticipated, signaling it was undergoing a reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing processes. The Detroit News first reported on the layoffs.",

    "body": "Google and Alphabet Inc. CEO Sundar Pichai arrives at the federal courthouse in Washington, Monday, Oct. 30, 2023.Jose Luis Magana | APAlphabet is set to report third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday.Here's what analysts are expecting according to LSEG consensus:Revenue: $99.89 billionEarnings per share: $2.26Wall Street is also watching several other numbers in the report:YouTube advertising revenue: $10.01 billion, according to StreetAccountGoogle Cloud revenue: $14.74 billion, according to StreetAccountTraffic acquisition costs (TAC): $14.82 billion, according to StreetAccountAs Alphabet reports its latest results, Wall Street expects the search giant to show 13% year-over-year revenue growth.The company's stock price soared 38% in the third quarter, its best quarterly performance in two decades. It's continued to rally, climbing 11% so far in October, topping off a quarter full of artificial intelligence product announcements and a regulatory win.Alphabet's biggest win came when U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in September ruled against the most severe antitrust consequences that were proposed by the Department of Justice. That would've included the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser, which provides data that helps its advertising business deliver targeted ads.Mehta dedicated roughly 30 pages of the 226-page filing to explaining generative AI and the market as \"highly competitive,\" and wrote that there have been \"numerous new market entrants,\" creating some concern about Google's ability to compete in AI. However, Mehta's decision to let Google keep Chrome with little reprimand, sent shares soaring.After the big rally, President Donald Trump congratulated Google executives at a dinner in Washington. The ruling continued to rally investors the following days, pushing the company into the $3 trillion market capitalization club — territory occupied only by Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple.During the quarter, the search giant also faced off with the DOJ again in a separate remedies trial for its ad tech monopoly case. In legal filings, Google's lawyers conceded that the open web was in a \"rapid decline,\" sending a wave of reactions. Google later walked back the statement. Closing arguments are scheduled for late November.In August, Google announced its new lineup of AI-powered Pixel 10 smartphone series to rival Apple's iPhone, and launched a widespread advertising campaign poking fun at the iPhone maker. Alphabet shares rose in August after reports that Google is in talks to incorporate its Gemini technology for a revamped version of Apple's Siri voice assistant. Gemini has been atop AI performance benchmarks but has lower usage compared with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Apple is also exploring partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI as it tries to renew its AI road map, according to reports.In September, Google's Gemini app took the top spot on Apple's App Store, dethroning ChatGPT. That came after the company introduced the image editing feature Nano Banana with its \"Flash\" AI model. The app allows users to blend multiple photos together and use prompts to create things such as digital figurines of themselves based on photos they upload. Google in September began adding its Gemini AI chatbot to Chrome for Mac and Windows users in the U.S. That feature allows users to ask Gemini for help understanding the contents of a particular webpage, work across tabs or do more within a single tab, such as schedule a meeting or search for a YouTube video.In October, the company launched Gemini Enterprise, targeting corporate clients with agents that perform specific work tasks. Google CEO Sundar Pichai also said at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference that Gemini 3, the latest version of the company's AI model, will be released this year. During the quarter, Alphabet continued reducing head count to streamline the company as it seeks to prioritize investment in AI.The company eliminated more than one-third of its managers overseeing small teams compared with a year ago, CNBC reported in September. The company also laid off more than 100 design-related roles from its cloud division during the quarter. Additionally, Google cracked down on some of its remote work policies and pushed employees to use more AI tools in their day-to-day work.Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo also had a number of announcements during the quarter.In August, Waymo said that it obtained permits to begin testing its autonomous vehicles with trained safety drivers on board in New York City.In September, Waymo was cleared to begin testing driverless rides at the San Jose Mineta International Airport in San Jose, California, with plans to offer paid rides at the airport later this year, in time for Super Bowl LX and the 2026 FIFA World Cup. That month, Waymo also received clearance to test its robotaxis at San Francisco International Airport. This month, it announced plans to bring its robotaxi services to London, its first European destination.Google also changed its tone in fact-checking for its video platform YouTube. As a part of the shift, the company's YouTube division said in September that it would soon allow accounts that were previously banned for spreading misinformation related to Covid-19 and the 2020 U.S. election to apply for reinstatement. In a letter submitted to Congress in September, the company's lawyers touted \"free expression\" and vowed to avoid fact-checking.YouTube began allowing those accounts to apply for reinstatement in October.WATCH: Google has to show it's protecting search this earnings season, says G Squared's Victoria Greene",

Carlos Barria | ReutersMeta is slated to report third-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the bell and investors will be watching for any indication that it will increase spending on artificial intelligence.Here's what analysts polled by LSEG are expecting:Earnings per share: $6.69Revenue: $49.4 billionMeta has spent the year investing heavily in AI, and it conducted a massive overhaul of the organization leading those efforts after the lukewarm debut of its open-source Llama 4 software in April.The social media company said last Wednesday that it would lay off about 600 workers in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit, but it left that group's top-tier TBD Labs unscathed. A day before, Meta said it formed a joint venture agreement with Blue Owl Capital in a deal worth $27 billion to help fund and build a gigantic data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana.When it reported second-quarter earnings in July, Meta said that its heavy AI spending would \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\" At the time, Meta raised the low end of its previous outlook for 2025 total expenses and said it expected the figure to come in the range of $114 billion to $118 billion.Wall Street is expecting Meta to report third-quarter sales of $49.4 billion, representing a 22% year-over-year increase, according to LSEG. Overall sales for Meta's full year are projected to jump 19% year over year to $196.2 billion.Meta's advertising sales are expected to come in at $48.5 billion for the third quarter, according to analysts polled by StreetAccount.Wall Street expects Meta to report 3.5 billion daily active people for the third quarter.Investors may be monitoring for any signs that its Meta AI app is getting more traction ever since it debuted the AI-powered Vibes short video creation tool and social feed on Sept. 25. Downloads of the Meta AI app on both iOS and Android soared 56% month to month to 3.9 million downloads as of Oct. 18, according to data provided to CNBC by mobile research firm Appfigures.But while Meta has been paying creators to post AI-generated videos on Vibes, as CNBC reported on Tuesday, OpenAI's competing Sora app appears to have logged more downloads on iOS relative to the Meta AI app during the same time period, the Appfigures data showed. Sora recorded 2.6 million downloads on iOS from Sept. 30 through Oct. 18, while Meta AI had 1.1 million.Investors are also likely watching for any signs Meta may be shifting its Metaverse strategy.Meta said Monday that Vishal Shah, who was previously leading the company's metaverse initiatives, would become a product leader for its AI unit.The company's Reality Labs unit — which developers virtual reality, augmented reality and AI-powered smart glasses — is expected to post an operating loss of $5.1 billion while generating $316 million in sales in the third quarter, according to StreetAccount.WATCH: Earnings are more important to markets than the Fed.watch now",

    "body": "Talent professionals and job seekers alike are grappling with the enormous rise in job applications submitted every day, according to experts.The number of applications submitted on LinkedIn has surged more than 45% in the past year, with nearly 9,500 applications submitted every minute, according to a representative for the company.As a result, hirers are \"drinking through a fire hose of applications,\" according to technical and executive head hunter Nicole Kaiser.At Kaiser's company, popular roles can receive 300 to 500 applications within three days, she says, with some accumulating more than 1,000 applications over the weekend.\"Those numbers are overwhelming,\" she says.Kevin Dabulis, a talent acquisition expert with over 30 years of experience, has observed a similar spike in applications.\"Years ago, when you when you posted a job on the internet, you would get 4 or 5 decent resumes,\" he recalls. Now, each job posting receives between 150 to 200 applications within the first 24 hours, he says.As a result of the sheer volume of applications, \"a lot of time is wasted\" for job seekers and hirers alike, Dabulis says.Impact on hiring processThe magnitude of applications has slowed the hiring process \"down to a crawl,\" Kaiser says.Depending on company size, in-house recruiters generally handle the hiring process for 15 to 20 jobs at a time, according to Kaiser, and they spend between 30 seconds and two minutes looking at each resume.With hundreds of people applying for each job, \"it's a massive amount of time to be spending just reviewing\" resumes, she says – and that's only the first step in the hiring process.According to a survey conducted by LinkedIn, over one-fifth of HR professionals in the U.S say they're spending between 3 to 5 hours going through applications every day, but 70% of hirers say that less than half the applications meet all the criteria for the role.Kaiser and Dabulis have observed similar patterns. Among hundreds of applications, \"less than 5\" are typically well-suited for the job, according to Dabulis.Part of the problem stems from AI auto-apply tools, Kaiser says: in recent months, she estimates that she's seen a 25% increase in applications submitted with AI.AI application tools are prone to misrepresenting or exaggerating candidates' experience, Kaiser says, and as a result, \"we're having the wrong people apply en masse to the wrong roles because of AI.\"While many job seekers worry that their applications are being filtered out by AI software, \"most companies are not using ATS at the scale and size that people think they are,\" she says.Many companies use AI to screen for keywords, but in Kaiser's experience, she and her peers at other companies still rely heavily on manually reviewing applications.To limit the number of applications, many companies are taking their open roles off job sites after only a few days, according to Kaiser.\"Now the adage is really true: if you didn't get in in the first two days, you're not going to get in at all,\" she says.What job seekers can doAccording to LinkedIn, 38% of U.S. job seekers said they were applying to more jobs than ever, but hearing back less often.Dabulis was laid off recently, he says, which gave him perspective from the \"candidate side\" of the hiring process.Over the past few months, Dabulis submitted over 700 job applications using LinkedIn's Easy Apply feature.\"I have not gotten one response back,\" he says.Services that promise to streamline the application process are tempting, but they're ultimately \"a waste of time\" in today's job market, Dabulis says.\"When you spread yourself out there so thin, you're just a whisper in the wind.\"Dabulis found more success when he shifted his strategy to focus on connecting with recruiters and building his personal brand on LinkedIn.\"I think it's getting yourself seen, and getting yourself out there and marketing yourself and targeting companies that you want to work for,\" he says.According to Kaiser, relationships are key to standing out in today's job market, and \"referrals are going to be the way of the future,\" she says.Still, she has a \"boring\" response for the number one thing she looks for in an application: a clear, concise resume that demonstrates how your skills apply to the job in question.In Kaiser's view, AI is no match for a thoughtful, well-tailored application.\"Put an AI resume, an AI-submitted anything up against somebody who spent their time trying to figure out how to make their resume match the job description, and more than likely that person's going to get the phone call,\" she says.Still, Kaiser recognizes that this method of applying to jobs takes more time, and she has \"a lot of compassion\" for the challenges job seekers face today:\"I understand that this market's insane, and that they're being asked to do things that we've never asked anybody else to do, because we haven't had this technology or numbers like this,\" she says.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "A Boeing 777x is displayed during the International Paris Air Show at the Paris-Le Bourget Airport on June 20, 2023.Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty ImagesBoeing said Wednesday its jetliner deliveries drove it back into cash-positive territory for the first time in nearly two years, but it took a $4.9 billion charge on additional delays of its long-awaited 777X wide-body plane.Boeing is on track to deliver the most aircraft this year since 2018, before two crashes grounded its bestselling jetliner, the Covid pandemic hit supply chains and a host of manufacturing crises drove years of losses at the top U.S. exporter.everyCEO Kelly Ortberg, an aerospace veteran who came out of retirement to helm Boeing in August 2024, has worked to steady the manufacturer's sprawling supply chain and cash-generating production lines.The 777X, an updated version of its 777 plane, took its first flight nearly six years ago but still hasn't won regulator approval. Boeing said it now expects the first delivery in 2027, leading to the noncash charge.Boeing CFO Jay Malave told analysts that questioned why the charge on the program was so high that slower production rates and holding onto planes longer for rework added to costs.\"The team is just not going to sit here and take this lightly and hasn't taken it lightly,\" Malave said. \"They are focused — we are all focused on doing everything we can to improve the long-term productivity on this program, while also working to mitigate the total delay impact to our customers the best we can.\"Boeing shares were down roughly 4% in early afternoon trading, though they were still up more than 20% so far this year.A Boeing 777x aircraft during an aerial display on the opening day of the Farnborough International Airshow in Farnborough, UK, on Monday, July 18, 2022.Jason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"While there's still more work to do to advance our development programs, particularly on our commercial development and certification programs, we're seeing positive signs across our business, and I'm proud of how we are coming together to turn our company around,\" Ortberg said in a staff note.Still, Boeing generated free cash flow of $238 million, its first time in the black on that metric since late 2023.The company lost $4.78 billion, or $7.14 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. That's better than a $5.76 billion loss a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a loss of $7.47 a share. Revenue jumped 30% to $23.27 billion for the third quarter, up from $17.84 billion a year ago and ahead of analysts' estimates.A year ago, Boeing machinists were on strike in a contract impasse that crippled production at the majority of the company's commercial airplane factories.Here's how Boeing performed for the third quarter compared with analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Loss per share: $7.47 per share adjusted vs. a loss of $4.59 expectedRevenue: $23.27 billion vs. $21.97 billion expectedAirline customers have said they've seen an improvement at Boeing, with more accurate delivery projections, a change in tune from the complaints of prior years.In the first nine months of the year, Boeing delivered 440 airplanes, up from 291 in the same period last year. Airlines and other customers pay for the bulk of the planes when they receive them, so increasing the delivery pace is key for Boeing to stem an outflow of cash totaling close to $17 billion since the start of 2024 through June of this year.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?Boeing gets FAA approval to hike 737 Max outputAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit wins court approval for a $475 million bankruptcy lifelineLast year was supposed to be a turnaround year for Boeing, but a midair blowout of a door panel in January 2024 resulted in a near catastrophe and increased federal scrutiny that slowed production.But Boeing has made progress. Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration lifted a production cap for Boeing's 737 Max to 42 a month from 38, a restriction it put in place after the accident. Ortberg said the company will increase production beyond that level when it has FAA approval.The FAA is also now allowing Boeing to perform final sign-offs on some of its aircraft, a sign of increased confidence from its regulator.Boeing's commercial unit revenue rose 49% from a year earlier to $11.09 billion, though it still had negative operating margins. Its defense unit generated $6.9 billion, up 25% from last year in the third quarter, with a 1.7% operating margin, while its profitable global services business brought in nearly $5.4 billion, a 10% increase.The company isn't out of the woods. Its Max 7 and Max 10 variants and the 777X are years behind schedule.\"Pencils are down from a design perspective\" on an anti-icing system for the two Max variants, the largest and smallest of the family, Ortberg told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday. \"We know what hardware and software changes are needed to the airplane.\"He said Boeing is now working through certification with the FAA.Additionally, about 3,200 of its defense unit workers who make F-15 fighter jets and missile systems have been on strike since the summer as the two sides have yet to reach a new contract.",

    "body": "Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesCharacter.AI on Wednesday announced that it will soon shut off the ability for minors to have free-ranging chats, including romantic and therapeutic conversations, with the startup's artificial intelligence chatbots.The Silicon Valley startup, which allows users to create and interact with character-based chatbots, announced the move as part of an effort to make its app safer and more age-appropriate for those under 18.Last year, 14-year-old Sewell Setzer III, committed suicide after forming sexual relationships with chatbots on Character.AI's app. Many AI developers, including OpenAI and Facebook-parent Meta, have come under scrutiny after users have committed suicide or died after forming relationships with chatbots.As part of its safety initiatives, Character.AI said on Wednesday that it will limit users under 18 to two hours of open-ended chats per day, and will eliminate those types of conversations for minors by Nov. 25.\"This is a bold step forward, and we hope this raises the bar for everybody else,\" Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told CNBC.Character.AI introduced changes to prevent minors from engaging in sexual dialogues with its chatbots in October 2024. The same day, Sewell's family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the company. Character.AI in December also announced safety features that would place conservative limits on romantic content for teens, but the change Wednesday gets rid of open-ended chats for minors altogether.To enforce its latest policy, the company said it's rolling out an age assurance function that will use first-party and third-party software to monitor a user's age. The company is partnering with Persona, the same firm used by Discord and others, to help with verification.To enforce the policy, the company said it's rolling out an age assurance function that will use first-party and third-party software to monitor a user's age. The company is partnering with Persona, the same firm used by Discord and others, to help with verification.In 2024, Character.AI's founders and certain members of its research team joined Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit DeepMind. It's one of a number of such deals announced by leading tech companies to speed their development of AI products and services. The agreement called for Character.AI to provide Google with a non-exclusive license for its current large language model, or LLM, technology.Since Anand took over as CEO in June, 10 months after the Google deal, Character.AI has added more features to diversify its offering from chatbot conversations. Those features include a feed for watching AI-generated videos as well as storytelling and roleplay formats.Although Character.AI will no longer allow teenagers to engage in open-ended conversations on its app, those users will still have access to the app's other offerings, said Anand, who was previously an executive at Meta.Of the startup's roughly 20 million monthly active users, about 10% are under 18. Anand said that percentage has declined as the app has shifted its focus toward storytelling and roleplaying.The app makes money primarily through advertising and a $10 monthly subscription. Character.AI is on track to end the year with a run rate of $50 million, Anand said.Additionally, the company on Wednesday announced that it will establish and fund an independent AI Safety Lab dedicated to safety research for AI entertainment. Character.AI didn't say how much it will provide in funding, but the startup said it's inviting other companies, academics, researchers and policy makers to join the nonprofit effort.Regulatory pressureCharacter.AI is one of many AI chatbot companies facing regulatory scrutiny on the matter of teens and AI companions.In September, the Federal Trade Commission issued an order to seven companies including, Character.AI's parent, as well as Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI and Snap, to understand the potential effects on children and teenagers.On Tuesday, Senators Josh Hawley, R-Mo, and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn, announced legislation to ban AI chatbot companions for minors. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law earlier this month requiring chatbots to disclose they are AI and tell minors to take a break every three hours.watch nowRival Meta, which also offers AI chatbots, announced safety features in October that will allow parents to see and manage how their teenagers are interacting with AI characters on the company's platforms. Parents have the option to turn off one-on-one chats with AI characters completely and can block specific AI characters.The matter of sexualized conversations with AI chatbots has come into focus as tech companies announce different approaches to dealing with the issue.Earlier this month, Sam Altman announced that OpenAI would allow adult users to engage in erotica with ChatGPT later this year, saying that his company is \"not the elected moral police of the world.\"Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman said last week that the software company will not provide \"simulated erotica,\" describing sexbots as \"very dangerous.\" Microsoft is a key investor and partner to OpenAI.The race to develop more realistic human-like AI companions has been growing in Silicon Valley since ChatGPT's launch in late 2022. While some people are creating deep connections with AI characters, the speedy development presents ethical and safety concerns, especially for children and teenagers. \"I have a six-year-old as well, and I want to make sure that she grows up in a safe environment with AI,\" Anand said.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselor.",

    "body": "Target's merchants and designers have drawn inspiration from traveling to rodeos, ski lodges and college campuses. Some of the retailer's fall accessories have western accents, such as purses with fringe and cowgirl-inspired hats.Melissa Repko | CNBCMINNEAPOLIS — When shoppers browse Target's aisles this fall, they will see purses with fringe accents, dresses made of suede-inspired fabrics and hats with a cowgirl flair. As winter comes, they'll find cozy sweaters with a ski lodge spin.Target's creative team has traveled the world to find inspiration for its brands, from a rodeo in Colorado to ski lodges in the French Alps and restaurants in New York's Hudson Valley.With global trips, an artificial intelligence-powered tool and sharper critiques of its own merchandise, the big-box retailer wants to get back to its roots: designing attention-grabbing, fashion-forward clothing and home decor at an affordable price.Target's merchandise was once a competitive advantage, but even the company admits it has lost that edge. The big-box retailer's sales have declined in some categories that it's best known for, such as home goods, as competitors lure away customers.As consumers' enthusiasm for Target's offerings has faded, annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and the company expects sales to decline this year. Shares of Target have tumbled about 35% in the last year, as its own merchandising issues, a sloppier store experience and boycotts over its rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion programs all weigh on its business. Discretionary items, long a strength for Target, have also become a tougher sell for shoppers, as groceries and rent hit household budgets.The company is undergoing major changes as it tries to reverse its struggles. Last week, the retailer announced it would cut 1,800 corporate jobs — its largest round of layoffs in a decade.Target is also gearing up for a leadership transition. Michael Fiddelke, the company's chief operating officer and former chief financial officer who has spent two decades at the company, will start as Target's CEO in February as Brian Cornell retires.Target CEO Michael Fiddelke poses for a portrait at Target headquarters in Minneapolis, Minn. on Tuesday, June 24, 2025.Elizabeth Flores | The Minnesota Star Tribune | Getty ImagesIn an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters, Fiddelke outlined his three key priorities as he steps into the company's top job: regaining Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience, and using technology to speed along the business.He said improving Target's merchandise — which earned it the nickname \"Tarzhay\" among shoppers — \"is a critical first priority for me.\"\"When we lead with style and design, when our guests can walk into a Target store or scroll through the app and find that stylish, unique thing that ideally they could only find at Target, that's at an unexpected value, that's when we're at our best,\" he said.The crucial holiday shopping season will test whether Target's efforts to refresh its merchandise are bearing fruit. Nearly a third of its annual sales came from the holiday quarter last year.Yet to draw eyeballs to fresh merchandise, Target will have to overcome a fundamental challenge: fewer shoppers are coming to its stores.Read moreTarget's store traffic has fallen nearly every week since late January, according to Placer.ai, an analytics firm that uses anonymized data from mobile devices to estimate visits to locations. In September, monthly store traffic declined by 7.6% year over year across Target's locations — its steepest drop since February, the firm found.Customer transactions and the average amount shoppers spent when they visited Target's stores or website fell year over year in the retailer's most recently reported fiscal quarter, which ended Aug. 2.Oliver Chen, a senior equity research analyst who covers retail and luxury goods for TD Cowen, said Target's competition from a wide range of retailers, including T.J. Maxx, Shein and Amazon, has grown fiercer. Plus, social media means trends move faster than before — forcing Target to adapt to stay ahead.\"It's not like they disappeared, but if you and I were the same and we didn't change, we would be less relevant in the age of TikTok,\" he said. \"You can't stand still.\"For the holiday quarter, Target is trying to capitalize on fresh merchandise to attract shoppers. Fiddelke said Target will have 20,000 new items in the fourth quarter, double what the company had a year ago.Target launches limited-time collections with brands to try to fuel shoppers' excitement and create buzz. It recently launched a collection with Woolrich, a Pennsylvania-based outdoorswear company with items including sweaters, pancake mix and camping chairs.Melissa Repko | CNBCOut with the basic and beigeNeon footballs, 1980s-themed Doritos and an aisle of colorful Owala water bottles with mix-and-match lids.On a recent store tour in Edina, a suburb of Target's hometown of Minneapolis, Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez pointed out those examples of Target's fresher approach to merchandise for the fall and holiday season. He said the colorful assortment marks a shift from the past few years, when Target's merchandise became \"too basic\" after the pandemic.\"Everybody was quarantined,\" he said. \"Nobody was traveling. Nobody was out there getting inspired. Our designers were stuck at home. Our merchants were stuck at home. We weren't seeing new fabrications, new silhouettes, new trends. We didn't have our finger on the pulse of consumer culture, what was trending, what was happening. We lost touch.\"He added that when Target got stuck with too much of the wrong stuff as people's spending shifted after the pandemic, its team reacted by \"making conservative decisions,\" not only about the size of orders but also about the styles they picked.For example, Target's back-to-college collection in fall 2024 included mostly neutral-colored and gray dorm accessories and furniture — and performed poorly. The company reversed that approach this fall, adding back \"mix-and-match\" dorm decor for a wider range of styles \"across everything from preppy, glam [and] modern,\" Gomez said. That led to higher sales.\"It was a proof point to us that, let's get back to listening to the consumer, trusting our instincts, and then leaning into style and design,\" he said.Kiosks display copies of the new Taylor Swift album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" at a Target in Watertown, MA on October 5, 2025.Jason Bergman | Sipa USA | APNow, Gomez said he's trying to embolden merchants and designers to \"unleash your creativity.\"\"We cannot be a leader in style and design if we're going to be playing it safe, if we're going to be conservative, if we're going to live in a world of neutrals,\" he said.Those efforts go beyond clothing and home goods. Among its recent moves, Target launched a collection inspired by Netflix's \"Stranger Things,\" timed to coincide with the TV series' final season, including T-shirts, action figures, and Chips Ahoy, Doritos and Frosted Flakes with 1980s labels. This fall, it has a limited-time collaboration with Pennsylvania-based outdoor wear company Woolrich with red-and-black checkered shirts, camper chairs and pancake mix, among other items. And as Taylor Swift's new album launched, it opened stores at midnight so customers could get their hands on exclusive vinyls and CDs of \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"Yet Gomez said Target's changes will take time, and some will not take hold until next year. In particular, he said Target needs to revive sales in its home and hardlines categories.Target has renamed hardlines to Fun101, a category that includes items like sporting goods, TVs and laptops. It has also slimmed down the number of bulky and basic items that it sells, such as carrying fewer bicycles, TVs and printers, and more items where it can stand out on style or design, like water bottles, coolers and tech accessories, he said.Target is trying to refresh its home category with new collaborations, including Marvel- and Disney-themed bedding for its kids' home line, Pillowfort, which launched in February.He said home is another area of the store that needs \"major work,\" in both its products and experience. In the spring, Target will give its largest private-label home brand, Threshold, a new look.It's tried to refresh the home category in the meantime with three new collaborations this year: Disney- and Marvel-themed kids' bedding collections for its private brand Pillowfort; a line of bedding and bath items from direct-to-consumer brand Parachute; and a collaboration with \"Queer Eye\" star Jeremiah Brent, which will launch in December.Target's own brands — which are sold only on its website and stores — are a critical part of how it stands out. Along with selling national names like Levi's, it has more than 40 of its own brands, including kids' clothing brand Cat & Jack, activewear line All in Motion and a new floral line called Good Little Garden. Target private brands drove about $31 billion in sales last year, accounting for nearly 30% of its annual net sales.Target is turning its store in New York City's SoHO neighborhood into a new concept that shows off more of its fashion-forward, unique merchandise. The store, shown in a company rendering, will have bolder displays that rotate.Courtesy of TargetA new style displayOne of the clearest illustrations of Target's effort to regain its reputation for style and design will land soon in New York City's SoHo neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and Houston Street.Starting in November, the big-box retailer is turning that neighborhood store into a new concept that shows off more of its fashion-forward, unique merchandise and carries less of its convenience store staples like toothpaste, shampoo and snacks, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.Target chose the location because it sits in an influential global style capital and has higher foot traffic, Sylvester said. She added the store will feel more like a \"pop-up shop,\" with Target rotating merchandise monthly and showing off its products — such as fashion-forward clothing and home collaborations — in \"bold, iconic displays.\"Even beauty items and basics will look different, as Target plans to show them off in a more \"stylized way,\" Sylvester said. And the retailer may expand aspects of the concept store to other locations, she said.\"It's a really important place for us to say 'This is who Target is,'\" Sylvester said. \"And we want to really evoke that sense of discovery.\"Behind the scenes, Target is enlisting a new tech tool to spot and react to trends faster. Early this year, it began using Target Trend Brain, a generative artificial intelligence-powered tool built to help the company's designers and merchants identify the colors, materials and silhouettes that customers want and move more quickly to turn those insights into items.Instead of having employees manually review and tag images from fashion runways, the AI-powered tool can help synthesize photos to forecast what will be popular in the coming seasons. For instance, Target used the tool to reinforce its initial forecast that greens, berries and blues would be the must-have colors of the fall and winter.Jenny Breeden, Target's senior vice president of product design and packaging, said the tool allows Target's trend and design teams to do a \"pulse check\" closer to when they set merchandise for a season and make adjustments.Target is trying to regain its reputation for creative and unique merchandise this holiday season. One example of its new items is its plush charcuterie sets from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape.Melissa Repko | CNBCSome of Target's creative designs will soon hit shelves: charcuterie-inspired plush sets for kids from Target's private-label toy brand, Gigglescape; subtle Western-inspired tops for its womenswear line Universal Thread; and gifting options like assorted chocolate truffles from one of its food brands, Favorite Day.Yet as Target tries to regain its reputation for affordable style, some of its freshest ideas for holiday gifts and winter apparel have come from employees getting out in the world, Breeden said. As the merchants and designers traveled, they observed textures, fonts, graphics and other details that they took back to Target's design studio in Minneapolis.Those trips resumed after the Covid pandemic, but with a new spin, she said. Instead of traveling with just one category's team, Target is bringing employees across categories. For example, the company sought ideas in European ski resorts and holiday markets for both apparel and home.She said the team also wants to get closer to its customers and the trends influencing them, even going to college dorms and tailgates and attending music festivals.\"We really realized that we needed to go deeper and go to the real source of where the trends were emerging, because culture is moving so fast,\" Breeden said. \"Gone are the days where you wait for Fashion Week and see how it trickles through.\"\"It's pretty incredible how eye-opening that is when you're really there in it, versus seeing it from an artist's distance,\" she said.",

    "body": "Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference for Eli Lilly and Company in Houston, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly and Nvidia are partnering to build what they call the pharmaceutical industry's \"most powerful\" supercomputer and so-called AI factory to help accelerate drug discovery and development across the sector, the companies announced Tuesday. It's the latest stride by Nvidia and the pharmaceutical industry to harness AI to help shorten the time it takes to bring cures to patients, while reducing costs at every stage of drug discovery and development. The process typically takes about 10 years on average from dosing the first human with a drug to its launch on the market, said Diogo Rau, Eli Lilly's chief information and digital officer, in an interview. Eli Lilly expects to complete the buildout of the supercomputer and AI factory in December. They will go online in January. But the new tools likely won't yield significant returns for the company's business and that of any other drugmaker until the end of the decade. \"The things that we're talking about discovering with this kind of power that we have right now, we're really going to see those benefits in 2030,\" Rau said. The industry's efforts to use AI to bring medicines to people faster are still in the early stages. There are no drugs on the market designed using AI, but progress is evident in the number of AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials, recent AI-focused investments and partnerships among drugmakers.Eli Lilly will own and operate the supercomputer, which will be powered by more than 1,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs – a newer family of chips from Nvidia – connected on a unified, high-speed network. The supercomputer will power the AI factory, a specialized computing infrastructure that will develop, train and deploy AI models at scale for drug discovery and development.The supercomputer \"is really a novel scientific instrument. It's like an enormous microscope for biologists,\" said Eli Lilly's Chief AI Officer Thomas Fuchs. \"It really allows us to do things we couldn't do before at that enormous scale. Scientists will be able to train AI models on millions of experiments to test potential medicines, \"dramatically expanding the scope and sophistication\" of drug discovery, according to a release from Eli Lilly. While finding new drugs isn't the only focus of the new tools, it is \"where the big opportunity is,\" said Rau.\"We're hopeful that we'll be able to discover new molecules that we never would have with humans alone,\" he said. Several AI models will be available on Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform that allows biotech companies to access drug discovery models that Eli Lilly has trained on years of its proprietary research. That data is worth $1 billion.Eli Lilly launched that platform in September as a way to expand access to drug discovery tools across the sector. \"It's really powerful to be able to give that extra starting point to these startups that, you know, otherwise could take a couple of years burning their capital to get to that point,\" said Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health care, adding that the company is \"delighted to participate\" in that effort. In exchange for access to the AI models, biotech companies are expected to contribute some of their own research and data to help train them, Rau noted. The TuneLab platform employs so-called federated learning, which means that companies can take advantage of Lilly's AI models without either side directly sharing data.Eli Lilly also plans to use the supercomputer to shorten drug development and help get treatments to people faster. The company said new scientific AI agents can support researchers, and advanced medical imaging can give scientists a clearer view of how diseases progress and help them develop new biomarkers — a measurable sign of a biological process or condition — for personalized care. \"We would actually like to deliver on that promise of precision medicine,\" Powell said. \"Without an AI infrastructure and foundation, we'll never get there, right? So we're doing all of the necessary building, and now we're seeing this true lift off, and Lilly is an exact example of that.\"Precision medicine is an approach that tailors disease prevention and treatment according to differences in a person's genes, environments, and lifestyles.",

    "body": "watch nowThe easy part for the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will be announcing a widely anticipated interest rate cut when it wraps up its two-day policy meeting. The hard part will be taking care of other details that are presenting substantial challenges to policymaking these days.Markets are assigning a nearly 100% probability that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a second consecutive quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, reduction in the federal funds rate. The overnight lending benchmark is currently targeted between 4%-4.25%.Beyond that, policymakers are likely to debate, among other things, the future path of reductions, the challenges posed by a lack of economic data and the timetable for ending the reduction in its asset portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Underlining all of those deliberations will be a growing divergence of opinion over what the future holds for monetary policy.\"They are at a moment in the policy cycle where there's genuine disagreement between people who are thinking we will probably cut rates but I'm not ready to cut again just yet, and people who think even though there's risks, it's time to do more now,\" said Bill English, a Yale professor and the Fed's former director of monetary affairs. \"There's dissent between people who want to cut now, and people who want to wait and see a bit more.\"watch nowJudging by recent statements and prevailing Wall Street sentiment, newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran is likely to dissent in favor of a bigger cut, as he did at the September FOMC meeting.At the same time, regional Presidents Beth Hammack of Cleveland, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Jeffrey Schmid of St. Louis have expressed reluctance to go much further on cuts, though it's far from clear whether they will vote against a cut this week. Only Miran, who wanted a half-point reduction, actually dissented in what was an 11-1 committee vote last month to cut by a quarter point.Left to try to straddle the difference will be Chair Jerome Powell, who in a recent speech gave an implied nod to an October cut when he expressed worry over the state of the labor market.Investors will look to the central bank chief, who will leave the position in May 2026, for guidance on the prevailing sentiment.\"I would expect him to try to walk a middle ground, not tip his hand necessarily, on December,\" English said, referring to the next policy meeting after this one. \"I don't think he wants to be locked into a rate cut in December. But on the other hand, it does seem like he's worried about the labor market and about the outlook for real activity, so he doesn't want to come across as hawkish.\"Markets currently also are pricing in a near-certainty of a December reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, so it would take a lot do dissuade Wall Street from anticipating more Fed easing.Worries about jobsOne big reason officials are in the mood to lower is concern over the labor market. Even with an absence of data, there are clear signs that inflation is slowing even if layoffs, judging by state-level jobless claims submissions that are still ongoing despite the federal shutdown, do not appear to be accelerating.In fact, worries over jobs could keep the Fed cutting well into 2026, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.\"We expect 25 [basis points Wednesday] and then again in December, and then again in January and March and April,\" Tilley said. \"Then that would bring them down to what we think of as the neutral range to 2.75% to 3%.\"watch nowFed officials in September indicated, through the \"dot plot\" of individual members' expectations, that they won't get to a rate that neither pushes nor restrains growth — the so-called \"neutral\" rate — until 2027, and even then it will be a quarter point above where Tilley sees.However, he thinks the Fed won't have any choice but to react to labor market weakness, particularly as it poses a challenge to surprisingly strong economic growth seen in the second half of this year.Worries over jobs have taken more of the Fed's focus even as inflation remains well above the central bank's 2% target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week, in the only official data release during the shutdown, that the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index was stuck at 3% in September.Lack of data challengeOutside of the CPI report, central bankers face the additional challenge of the data blackout that has accompanied the government shutdown.\"It's hard to make policy to achieve two goals ... when you're not getting data about about at least one of them,\" Tilley said, referring to the Fed's dual mandate to maximize employment and keep prices stable, and the absence of the September nonfarm payrolls report due to the shutdown.\"I expect that to be communicated as more uncertainty about the path forward, that they have to be ready to pivot and hold rates, if need be, or to reduce them faster when they finally do get data,\" Tilley said.Finally, markets will be looking for more definitive answers on when the Fed will stop reducing its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, most of which is in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Nicknamed quantitative tightening, or QT, the process has entailed allowing proceeds from maturing securities to roll off rather than being reinvested as usual.In a recent speech, Powell indicated the time is getting closer to where the Fed will want to stop QT. While financial conditions are largely still solid, there have been some small signs lately that short-term markets are tightening up. With the Fed's overnight funding facility nearly drained, officials are likely to signal this week that QT is in its final stages.Market commentary was split over whether the Fed will announce the actual end of the program, or signal a future date when it will cease.\"There are signs that they're getting close to bottom, so to speak, in terms of getting through ample reserves and actually getting some tightness and liquidity. So that's why I would expect an announcement, if not action,\" Tilley said.",

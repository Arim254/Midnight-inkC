    "body": "Workers demolish the facade of the East Wing of the White House on Oct. 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe White House on Tuesday dismissed anger over the demolition of parts of the building's East Wing to build a new ballroom at the behest of President Donald Trump.\"In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House,\" the White House said in a statement.The White House called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.Photos of construction workers tearing down parts of the building went viral online Monday, triggering public anger over the planned 90,000-square-foot, $250 million ballroom.\"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back,\" Trump said during a Rose Garden event Tuesday. \"That's music to my ears. I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it.\"In July, Trump said that construction of the ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building.\"\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said of the White House at the time.The Treasury Department has told staff not to share photos of the East Wing, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. The department is located next to the White House, and has a clear view of the demolition work.\"Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details,\" the Treasury spokesperson told CNBC.\"Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images.\"The Wall Street Journal first reported Treasury's message to employees.\"Trump's billionaire ballroom. This is a disgrace. Welcome to the Second Gilded Age,\" Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., tweeted Monday, above a photo from The Washington Post showing the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will finance the construction of the ballroom.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom's construction. It is unclear how much Comcast and other donors contributed. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.",

    "body": "The Mattel, Inc. logo is displayed outside the headquarters of the toy company known for products including Barbie and Hot Wheels in El Segundo, California on June 8, 2023.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBarbie-maker Mattel posted third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations as ongoing global tariffs continue to hamper the toy manufacturer's sales in North America.Shares of the company fell 4% in after hours trading.Here's what Mattel reported for its third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. $1.07 expectedRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $1.83 billion expectedFor the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $278 million, or 88 cents per share, down from $372 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs associated with restructuring and certain product recalls, per-share profit was 89 cents.Net sales fell 6% to $1.74 billion, coming in short of Wall Street's expectations.This is the first time in three quarters that the toy giant has missed on both earnings and revenue expectations.In May, Mattel pulled its annual financial targets and said it would increase prices for some products in the U.S. to counter higher input costs due to the Trump administration's tariffs on key trading partners. On Tuesday the company issued full-year guidance that calls for net sales to increase between 1% and 3% and for earnings per share to come in between $1.54 and $1.66.\"While our U.S. business was challenged in the third quarter by industry-wide shifts in retailer ordering patterns, the fundamentals of our business are strong,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said in a release. \"Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, orders from retailers in the US have accelerated significantly.\"Tariffs have put pressure on toy manufacturers industry-wide. Approximately half of Mattel's global toy sales come from the U.S., and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China, Kreiz noted on CNBC in May.During the third quarter, sales in North America fell 12%, with the largest year over year declines in the company's infant, toddler and preschool category. International sales meanwhile climbed 3%.Overall, sales for two of Mattel's largest toy brands saw declining sales: Global Barbie sales fell 17% from the same quarter a year earlier, and Fisher-Price sales dropped 19%. The company's global Hot Wheels sales ticked up 8%.Moving forward, Mattel has focused on expanding its entertainment offerings and employing new technology. On Tuesday, Mattel and Hasbro partnered with Netflix to capitalize on the success of the movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" to offer dolls and other consumer products tied to the film.Mattel is producing dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets and currently is taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.Correction: Mattel reported net income of $278 million. A previous version of this article misstated the figure. ",

Its popularity has spurred Netflix to release it twice in theaters — once in August for a two-day weekend event and again next week around Halloween.Partnering with Mattel and Hasbro will allow Netflix to offer a suite of consumer products based around the film.Mattel will handle dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets, while Hasbro will focus on plush, electronics, roleplay items and board games, the companies announced Tuesday. There will likely be some overlap in product categories between the two toy makers, however. Mattel is currently taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. And Hasbro's first product is a \"KPop Demon Hunters\" themed Monopoly Deal game. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.\"Netflix, Mattel and Hasbro joining forces on this first-of-its-kind collaboration means fans can finally get their hands on the best dolls, games, and merchandise they've been not-so-subtly demanding on every social platform known to humanity,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, said in a statement Tuesday.",

    "body": "YOKOHAMA, KANAGAWA, JAPAN - 2025/08/28: A loaded container ship is docked inside Tokyo Bay. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesJapanese exports in September snapped four months of declines, climbing 4.2% year on year, as shipments to Asia saw robust growth, partially offsetting the drop in exports to the U.S.Exports, however, missed expectations of a 4.6% rise, according to median estimates in a Reuters poll of economists.Shipments to Asia climbed 9.2% compared to the same period last year, while exports to the U.S., Japan's second largest trading partner, dropped 13.3%. Exports to mainland China, Japan's largest trading partner rose 5.8%.SJapan's exports had fallen into negative territory as the country grappled with U.S. tariffs, with its shipments of automobiles to the world's largest economy taking a huge hit.Tokyo in July clinched a trade deal with Washington, bringing down tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from the 25% initially proposed by President Donald Trump. Auto shipments to the U.S. dropped 24.2% in September in terms of value, a softer fall compared to the 28.4% drop in August.Semiconductor exports from Japan were one of the main drivers of the overall growth in September, rising 12.6% in terms of value year-on-year.The world's fourth-largest economy saw imports increase 3.3% year on year, reversing course from the 5.2% decline in August and beating the 0.6% growth expected by the Reuters poll.The data comes a day after the country got its first female prime minister in Sanae Takaichi, after months of political turmoil following electoral losses of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party under former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba.Takaichi's stance of a loose momentary policy and massive fiscal stimulus is likely to weaken the yen, making Japanese goods more competitive, benefiting exporters — heavyweights on the benchmark Nikkei 225 that hit a record high on Tuesday.Markets have priced in the so-called \"Takaichi trade\" since she took the helm of the LDP in September, which has seen the Nikkei rise to record highs and the yen weakening past the 150 mark.However, the country's economy has held up better than expected, with the second-quarter GDP being revised upward to 0.5% quarter on quarter from 0.3% estimated initially.",

    "body": "watch nowLauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, said the surge in enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has all the markings of a bubble.\"We are absolutely in an AI bubble now. It is going to burst,\" she said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday to David Faber. \"I don't know when, I don't know the order of magnitude. A lot of people are going to lose money.\"Her remarks come as enthusiasm for AI continues to drive markets higher, with investors betting the technology will transform industries and lift corporate earnings. Taylor Wolfe said investors are underestimating the risks tied to the surge in AI-related spending by major technology companies.\"There are trillions of dollars that are being earmarked to be spent relative to hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow generated by the Mag 7,\" she said, referring to the group of large-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. \"They're going to have to borrow to invest in all this CapEx, and we have yet to see the returns on investment.\"Her remarks come at a time when analysis shows the S&P 500 has become pretty much an AI index.Taylor Wolfe believes the mismatch between capital expenditures and profit potential makes current valuations difficult to justify.\"Show me the trillions of dollars of profits that are going to be generated in the next five years,\" she said. \"And you just can't. The math doesn't work.\"She said the current environment is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when investors chased anything associated with the internet regardless of valuation or business model. During the dotcom era, the right thing to do wasn't short the bubble companies; it was to look where no one else was looking, she said.\"You'd have been better off owning a railroad in 2000 than buying Cisco at 35 times earnings, Taylor Wolfe said. \"So at Impactive, what we're doing today is looking for our railroads.\"At the 13D Monitor's Active-Passive Investor Summit Tuesday, Taylor Wolfe presented her new idea Advanced Drainage Systems, which she called the undisputed leader in plastic stormwater and residential septic systems. She said the company is AI proof.",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHBO Max is the latest streaming services to raise its prices.The streaming giant, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Tuesday that it is raising prices across all plans. HBO Max's Basic with ads plan is increasing $1 a month to $10.99, the Standard plan is going up $1.50 to $18.49, and Premium is increasing $2 to $22.99. HBO Max last raised prices in June 2024.The price hikes are effective immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the new prices starting on their next billing date on or after November 20, the company said. The updates come as the streaming market becomes increasingly saturated with options — and as other major apps hike their prices. Disney raised the price of its Disney+ plans and bundles last month, Apple hiked the price of Apple TV by 30% in August and Netflix raised its prices early this year.WBD CEO David Zaslav indicated in September that price increases were on the way along with a stricter crackdown on sharing passwords.\"The fact that this is quality, and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality, we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,\" Zaslav said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month. \"We think we're way underpriced.\"As of June 30, WBD said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That stat includes HBO Max as well as other legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service.HBO Max's news comes as its parent company, WBD, undergoes changes of its own. The company announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. A streaming and studios company would include its movie properties and HBO Max, while a global networks business would include linear channels like CNN and TNT Sports. At the same time, WBD is fielding takeout interest from companies including Paramount Skydance and said Tuesday it's open to a sale. ",

More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, 1-day performanceIt's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBYND, all timeYet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.watch nowThe return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Netflix fell around 7% in extended trading Tuesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said. \"It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,\" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a have a material impact on our results going.\" Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.Here's how the company did in the period ended September 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share:  $5.87 vs. $6.97, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.51 billion vs. $11.51 billion, according to LSEGNetflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%. Still, Netflix said it posted its best ad sales quarter ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.\"Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. \"This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.\"Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of \"Strangers Things\" and new seasons of \"The Diplomat\" and \"Nobody Wants This\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" and Rian Johnson's \"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.\"Netflix is also still riding the coattails of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated film has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" dolls, plush, roleplay items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.",

    "body": "Customers check out at a supermarket on August 12, 2025 in New York City. Liao Pan | China News Service | Getty ImagesThe September consumer price index report coming out Friday will command full attention from financial markets, even as some investors will view the data with a skeptical eye.With the Bureau of Labor Statistics already under scrutiny this year for its broad menu of data releases, the government shutdown gripping Washington, D.C., will only raise concerns from parts of Wall Street about whether the inflation reading will present a full picture.\"Skeptics like me are going to be focused on how clean is this data,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"What were the accommodations made for the lack of full personnel staff showing up? What adjustments were made before the data got reported?\"Indeed, the BLS this year has faced a host of questions over its data collection methods. President Donald Trump in August, furious over huge downward revisions in nonfarm payrolls data, sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.watch nowThough still considered part of the \"gold standard\" U.S. economic data collection apparatus, the BLS has also been criticized for its decidedly analog approach, which includes in-person visits, phone calls and written response forms.The agency faces the added burden of staffing cuts — even before the shutdown — and has eliminated several cities from its collection efforts. Now, it is putting together a key inflation report with most of the government closed and risks that sample data could be incomplete.For those reasons, Khanduja thinks investors should be careful with how much emphasis they place on the CPI reading.\"The efficacy and the cleanliness of data — there will definitely be a little bit of a skepticism had from my end, and I'm thinking the market will do the same,\" he said.Muted expectationsEven with the questions over the data, economists aren't looking for anything dramatic from the actual numbers.The Dow Jones consensus has the CPI report showing 3.1% annual inflation levels on both the headline, or all-items, gauge as well as the core, which excludes food and energy. Economists see the monthly headline number rising 0.4% and 0.3% for core, right in line with the August gains.What gives this report an even higher profile is that all other data collections and releases have been suspended during the shutdown. The reason the Labor Department called back BLS staffers is because the CPI report is used to index Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.So outside of this, there will be no other releases, leaving investors as well as Federal Reserve policymakers flying blind on data. That in itself presents a bevy of problems and another headache for agencies like the BLS.\"As the shutdown appears likely to last into November, it is not clear how the BLS will deal with an unprecedented lack of real-time collections,\" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark said in a note. \"November data collections are also increasingly likely to be affected. We will be watching for any possible release of guidance on October CPI collections with Friday's September report.\"In the meantime, the Fed will hold a meeting next week, with markets widely expecting a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate, likely to be followed by another in December. Fed funds currently stand at 4.00% to 4.25%.However, there's considerable uncertainty about what will happen in 2026 and beyond. Trump wants rates aggressively lower, and he's likely to nominate a candidate next year to succeed Chair Jerome Powell with that philosophy.With a lack of data certainty, though, formulating policy will be difficult.\"I don't think we're going to learn a whole lot from this [CPI] data that we're not seeing at the moment,\" Mike Wilson, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, said Tuesday on CNBC. \"I think it will give the Fed cover to do what I think they need to do, which is cut rates in a more meaningful way. To me, that [is] the risk, that we don't get the data that allows the Fed to cut more meaningfully.\"",

    "body": "Elon Musk interviews on CNBC from the Tesla Headquarters in Texas. CNBCA day ahead of Tesla's quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.Tesla's board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting next month.On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package \"outrageous,\" in part because Musk's \"political activities have damaged Tesla's brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.\" The site says the plan doesn't require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\"Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,\" the site says. \"That's our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.\"Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People's Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk's previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.Following those firms' suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, \"ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.\" The company added that shareholders who sold would \"have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.\"watch nowThe Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\" The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI's ChatGPT.By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he \"vociferously opposes this pay package\" and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.\"Most of the time we've held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it's grown over time, and that's why we haven't chosen to dump it,\" Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he's preferred to \"hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.\"Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.He said he views Tesla's board he as \"insufficiently independent,\" and that it's allowed Musk to be an \"absentee CEO.\" The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it's still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.Musk has \"been an inconsistent CEO at best,\" Lander said, \"and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.\"Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.WATCH: Former Tesla board member on Muskwatch now",

DraftKings targeted the company for its team and proprietary technology. \"We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,\" DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC. \"We believe that Railbird's team and platform—combined with DraftKings' scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.\"Predictions markets allow customers to trade on the outcomes of various events in the worlds of finance, culture and entertainment, which will allow DraftKings to expand beyond its sports betting business. The markets on election outcomes and sports are the most controversial.  Dozens of states, their gaming regulators and tribes are suing or taking other actions to try to prohibit companies from offering trades based on sporting events, because they see it as unlicensed gambling.  Nevada is among the states warning that companies risk losing their gambling licenses if they offer sports in their prediction markets.If DraftKings offers sports events contracts, it's likely to focus only on states that don't offer licensed sports betting, like California and Texas, to avoid running afoul of the states where it offers sports betting.  Additionally, technology exists to prevent those sports trades from being available on tribal lands.  DraftKings also may offer more advanced \"know your customer\" guardrails, a term commonly used to reference identity verification, given its experience in the regulated gambling market.  ",

    "body": "Nicoletaionescu | Istock | Getty ImagesIt is tech's biggest question, and there is a wide range of takes on every side.With artificial intelligence-driven spending leading to record deals and valuations, seemingly everyone is weighing in on the AI boom — and potential bust.Economic bubbles happen with a rapid rise in market values and asset prices in a specific area, often fueled by speculation, followed by a crash during which money is quickly taken out.More than 1,300 AI startups now have valuations of over $100 million, with 498 AI \"unicorns,\" or companies with valuations of $1 billion or more, according to CB Insights.Megacaps like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are spending billions on data center buildouts, and blockbuster deals are being announced left and right from OpenAI, Nvidia and others.The deal and spending euphoria are drawing parallels to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and even the 2008 financial crisis.Others see strong demand and a technological revolution with money that's \"well spent.\"Here's what CEOs and experts have said in recent days:We continue to see opportunity because ultimately, AI bubble or not, it boils down to real dollars being spent on real capex with a ... very long runway of funding ahead.Anneka TreonING global head of Private Banking, Wealth Management and InvestmentTreon said that although companies are spending a staggering half of their operating cash flows on AI initiatives, there is more than enough capital to fund it.\"That source, that runway of funding, is not something that I think we need to be concerned about,\" Treon said on CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" last week.Total global AI spending is expected to hit $375 billion this year, and is forecasted to reach 500 billion in 2026, according to a report by UBS. Whether these massive expenditures will actually yield expected returns on capital won't be clear until at least more than a year from now, Treon said.However, Treon finds the current market backdrop to be optimistic.\"You're seeing easier monetary policy, you're seeing easier fiscal policy, you're seeing strong earnings growth, and you're seeing capex booms,\" she said.We point out that the share of the economy devoted to AI investment is nearly a third greater than the share of the economy devoted to internet related investments back during the dotcom bubble. So, we think there are enough analogies there to make the call.Jared Bernsteinformer Biden CEA chairmanBernstein told CNBC'S \"Squawk Box\" last week that surging asset prices and extreme valuations indicate that an AI bubble is the \"likely outcome.\"He said that bubbles are defined by a vast gap between investment levels and the actual \"credible expectations\" for future profits.Bernstein pointed to OpenAI, which has already made around $1 trillion in AI deals, including a $500 billion data center buildout project, despite being set to generate only $13 billion in revenue.\"You've got to account for future earnings,\" Bernstein said. \"But to us and many others, that divergence between credibly, plausible, expected future earnings and this level of investment certainly looks bubbly.\"Despite the Magnificent Seven's spending spree on AI, Bernstein said that their profits are mostly coming from other areas like advertisements and cloud services.\"If you actually look at the AI investments, they tend to be a small share of [the profits],\" Bernstein said. \"So that actually contributes to the bubble hypothesis.\"I think some of the investments that we've seen so far is not on AI, it's more on cloud and the power of cloud. So I don't believe this is a bubble, but I believe this is capital that in most cases is going to be well spent.Larry FinkBlackRock CEOFink said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" last week that there is definitely a \"skyrocketing amount of capital\" being funneled into AI, which he believes is not a sign of a bubble but rather a necessary investment for the U.S. to remain a global leader in AI technology.\"Investing in AI does not just mean investing in GPUs and chips, it means investing in HVAC and IT, investing in power grids and power supplies,\" Fink said.The BlackRock CEO said that these massive stakes will ultimately lead to some failures, but he is confident that major hyperscalers like Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are in a \"really good position\" to be winners.\"That is capitalism,\" Fink said. \"We're going to have some big winners and we're going to have some big losers ... but if you have a diversified portfolio, you're going to be fine.\"Are we in an AI bubble? Of course! ... Of course we are. I mean, we’re hyped, we’re accelerating, we’re putting enormous leverage into the system.Pat Gelsingerformer Intel CEOGelsinger said that although the AI-driven market is already in a bubble, it would be \"several years\" before he sees it ending.\"We're displacing all of the internet and the service provider industries as we think about it today,\" Gelsinger said on \"Squawk Box\" last week. \"We have a long way to go.\"The ex-Intel CEO believes that major disruptive technologies will develop in the latter end of this decade, when companies might begin to materially benefit from them, giving the bubble plenty of time before it pops.\"That being said, it will change,\" Gelsinger said. \"These are radical improvements in AI efficiency that occurred this year.\"To me, the main ingredient in bubbles is psychological excess — there's no such thing as a price too high. And I don't detect that level of mania at this time, so I have not put the bubble label on this incident.Howard MarksOaktree Capital Management co-founderIn an interview with CNBC's Sara Eisen last week, Marks said that while there is unquestionable excitement for AI, he has not seen it reach a \"critical mass of mania\" that indicates a definite bubble.\"My response to date has been that the valuations are not crazy,\" Marks said. \"High, but not crazy. And when things are either high or low, but not crazy, you can't make an observation that has a high likelihood of being correct.\"The veteran investor likened the current AI enthusiasm to the internet boom of the late 1990s, which correctly promised to change the world despite leaving many companies ultimately worthless.Marks warned of common behaviors seen in \"bubble psychology,\" where investors will back any company with even the slightest chance of massive returns. Although he sees hints of this excessive risk-taking pattern in today's AI boom, Marks said true bubble behavior has not been hit yet.We’re certainly seeing lots of evidence of bubble-like behavior in the AI space. We see the kind of circular revenue deals, we see a lot of very aggressive price behavior.Ben InkerGMO co-head of asset allocationInker said on CNBC's \"Money Movers\" last week that firm investments are shifting from being financed by free cash flow to relying on debts and massive stakes from Nvidia.\"It's one thing if Microsoft or Meta wants to invest a whole bunch of money in data centers where they've got the cash flow for it,\" Inker said. \"OpenAI doesn't, xAI doesn't, even Oracle is issuing a lot of debt to be doing this.\"Last year, OpenAI expected about $5 billion in operating losses on $3.7 billion in revenue, and is still losing money. Inker said this makes Nvidia's $100 billion investment in OpenAI — for building data centers backed by Nvidia chips — concerning.\"It is that this entire ecosystem has kind of run out of the capital from the cash flow of the hyperscalers, who have been funding things so far, and now needs to be funded by debt and these very strange deals between Nvidia and AMD and some of these money-losing firms that have huge capital needs,\" Inker said.WATCH: $1 trillion-worth of AI deals in one chartwatch now",

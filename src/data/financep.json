    "body": "HashKey Group logo seen on a smartphone and on a pc screen.Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesHashKey shares slid 2.5% on Wednesday as they debuted on the Hong Kong stock exchange, after the crypto exchange raised $206 million in its initial public offering, at a time when crypto currencies have taken a beating. HashKey, Hong Kong's largest licensed crypto exchange, raised around 1.6 billion Hong Kong dollars after pricing the IPO at HK$6.68 per share, near the higher end of the marketed range of HK$5.95 to HK$6.95. Shares closed at HK$6.51.While mainland China has imposed a blanket ban on cryptocurrencies since 2021, Hong Kong has been more receptive toward digital assets. Key cornerstone investors included Fidelity, UBS, Chinese investment firm CDH Investments and Cithara Fund amongst others. JPMorgan and financial services firm Guotai Haitong were among the joint bookrunners.\"Our mission is to make digital assets massively accessible, and what we are doing is to create a compliant platform to connect our users with the digital assets industry,\" HashKey Chief Financial Officer Eric Zhu told CNBC. \"We are confident that the [crypto] penetration rate in Hong Kong, in the Asian market, is going to catch up with what happens in the U.S,\" Zhu added.The listing comes amid recent volatility in global cryptocurrency markets after touching record highs. The world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has dropped around 36% in about a month after hitting an all-time high and crossing past $126,000 in early October. It is down about 6% so far this year. Established in 2018, HashKey operates a licensed digital asset platform offering exchange trading, over-the-counter services, on-chain services such as staking and tokenisation, as well as asset management solutions for institutional and retail clients.\"This is a milestone for the digital asset and wealth management industry in Asia. We believe Hong Kong is establishing itself as a key hub for regulated digital assets in Asia,\" said William Ma, CIO at GROW Investment Group.—CNBC's Emily Tan contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A job seeker speaks with a recruiter at the KeySource booth at the Mega JobNewsUSA South Florida Job Fair held in the Amerant Bank Arena in Sunrise, Florida, on April 30, 2025.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesNonfarm payrolls grew slightly more than expected in November but slumped in October while unemployment hit its highest in four years, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday in numbers delayed by the government shutdown.Job growth totaled a seasonally adjusted 64,000 for the month, better than the Dow Jones estimate of 45,000 and up from a sharp decline in October.The unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, more than expected and its highest level since September 2021. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time jobs for economic reasons swelled to 8.7%, its peak going back to August 2021.In addition to the November report, the BLS released an abbreviated October count that showed payrolls down 105,000. While there was no official estimate, Wall Street economists were largely expecting a decline following a surprise increase of 108,000 in September. The October slump came from a steep fall in government employment as deferred layoffs instituted earlier this year took effect. Government payrolls were off 162,000 for the month, and fell an additional 6,000 in November.The October decline marked the third time in six months that payrolls saw a net negative level. The BLS report also showed that August's numbers were revised down 22,000 to show a steeper loss of 26,000, while September's initial count was pushed lower by 11,000.The BLS had cautioned that the household survey, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, will be affected for several months by impacts of the shutdown. Challenges in capturing the October numbers led to the cancellation of both the jobs report and the closely watched consumer price index.Despite the complications, the report painted a familiar picture of the labor market. The jobs climate continues to be one of low hiring and low firing, affected as well by stringent border practices under President Donald Trump that have drained the workforce of the usual influx of immigrants. The establishment numbers showed most of the gains in November came from a familiar source — health care added 46,000 jobs, accounting for more than 70% of the total net increase. Construction rose by 28,000, while social assistance contributed 18,000.On the down side, transportation and warehousing was off 18,000, part of a continuing trend in job losses for the sector. Leisure and hospitality also posted a loss of 12,000. \"The U.S. economy is in a jobs recession,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The nation has added a mere 100,000 in the past six months. The bulk of those jobs were in healthcare, an industry that is almost always hiring due to America's aging population.\"However, the White House put a positive spin on the report.\"The strong jobs report shows how President Trump is fixing the damage caused by Joe Biden and creating a strong, America First economy in record time,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"Workers' wages are rising, prices are falling, trillions of dollars in investments are pouring into our country, and the American economy is primed to boom in 2026.\"From a policy perspective, the Federal Reserve has had to work a difficult line between trying to head off further weakness in the labor market and guarding against making stubbornly high inflation worse.At its most recent meeting, the central bank lowered its key interest rate by a quarter percentage point but signaled that the bar is higher for additional cuts. The Fed has approved three consecutive reductions since September, taking its benchmark funds rate down to a target range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"The Fed is unlikely to put much weight on today's report given data disruptions,\" said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. \"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory.\"Markets continued to put low odds on another rate cut in January. The probability was around 24.4% following the jobs report, unchanged from Monday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Fed officials have maintained that the labor market is not a source of inflation, and Tuesday's jobs report backed up that assertion.Average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, below the estimate for 0.3%, and were up 3.5% from a year ago, the smallest annual gain since May 2021.The 0.1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was largely a function of labor force growth.Over the two-month period, household employment actually increased by 407,000. However, that was offset partially by a rise of 323,000 in the labor force as the participation rate edged higher to 62.5%.In other economic news Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that retail sales were flat in September, against a forecast for a 0.1% increase, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Excluding autos, however, sales increased 0.4%, better than the 0.2% estimate.",

    "body": "Waymo co-CEOs (L-R): Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri DolgovWaymoSelf-driving car company Waymo is in talks to raise $15 billion in funding in the new year.The robotaxi company plans to raise billions from Alphabet, its parent company, as well as outside investors at a valuation as high as $110 billion, according to a person familiar with the discussions.The latest funding discussions are indicative of Waymo's status as the leader of the pack in the U.S. robotaxi market. The company has been spending heavily to ramp up its fleet and continue expanding to more regions. Waymo is now either operating its robotaxis, planning to launch service or starting to test its vehicles in 26 markets, in the U.S. and abroad.Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said Waymo will \"meaningfully\" contribute to Alphabet's financials as soon as 2027, CNBC reported Tuesday.  If the Google sister company winds up raising as much as $15 billion, that would represent more than double the amount of its last funding round. That was a series C round of $5.6 billion at a $45 billion valuation, which closed in October 2024. Alphabet had committed $5 billion in a multiyear investment to Waymo at the time.That round was led by Alphabet alongside previous backers, including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price. At the time, Waymo co-CEOs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov said the funding would go toward expanding its robotaxi service.Waymo currently serves paid rides to the public in the Austin, San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta and Los Angeles markets. Earlier this month, CNBC reported that Waymo crossed an estimated 450,000 weekly paid rides, and the company in December said it had served 14 million trips in 2025, putting it on pace to end the year at more than 20 million trips total since launching in 2020.The company plans to open service next year in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington, D.C. Waymo also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026, which will mark the company's first overseas service region.Amazon's Zoox this year began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of mid-December.Fundraising plans were first reported by The Information.WATCH: 2025: The year that the robotaxi went mainstream with Waymo leading the packwatch now",

    "body": "Paul Putnam, 53, a rancher and independent contract pumper walks past a pump jack in Loving County, Texas, November 25, 2019.Angus Mordant | ReutersU.S. crude oil prices fell nearly 3% on Tuesday to close at the lowest level since early 2021, as a looming surplus and possible peace agreement in Ukraine weigh on the market.  West Texas Intermediate fell 2.73%, or $1.55, to close at $55.27 per barrel, the lowest since February 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Global benchmark Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92. U.S. crude has shed about 23% this year in its worst performance since 2018, while Brent is down about 21% for its worst year since 2020.U.S. gasoline prices have fallen below $3 per gallon to the lowest level in four years in a boost to consumers ahead of the holidays, according to the drivers' association AAA. Falling oil prices could signal a slowing economy. U.S. job growth totalled 64,000 in November but declined by 105,000 in October. The unemployment rate hit a four-year high of 4.6%.The oil market is under pressure this year as OPEC+ members have rapidly ramped up production after years of output cuts. Investors are also pricing in the possibility of lower geopolitical risk as President Donald Trump pressures Ukraine to accept a peace agreement with Russia. The threat of supply disruptions has loomed over the oil market since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Kyiv has launched repeated drone strikes on Russian oil infrastructure this year. The U.S. and its European allies, meanwhile, have targeted Russia's crude industry with sanctions. Ukraine's attacks on oil infrastructure and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil companies would likely be lifted relatively quickly in the event of an agreement, said Jorge Leon, Rystad Energy's head of geopolitical analysis, in a note to clients. \"This would significantly reduce the risk of near-term Russian supply disruptions and allow a sizeable volume of Russian oil currently stored on water to return to the market,\" Leon said. Russian oil stored on water is currently estimated at around 170 million barrels, according to Rystad.The end of U.S. sanctions on Russia would also change the incentives for OPEC+, Leon said. The group would likely resume a strategy to retake market share through higher production after recently pressing pause on that approach, he said. ",

    "body": "Tesla electric vehicles (EV) in front of the company's store in Colma, California, US, on Monday, Nov. 10, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesA California administrative law judge has ruled that Tesla's marketing around its \"Autopilot\" and \"Full Self-Driving\" systems was deceptive, and that the company should face a 30-day suspension of each of its licenses to sell and manufacture cars in the state, according the California Department of Motor Vehicles.The California DMV made formal accusations of false advertising against Tesla in 2022. Steve Gordon, the agency's director, said in a press conference on Tuesday that his agency has adopted the judge's order with a modified penalty, and will now give Elon Musk's automaker a chance to fix any deceptive or confusing claims about its Autopilot and FSD systems. If the marketing issues aren't resolved within a 60-day window, the DMV will move ahead with a 30-day suspension of Tesla's license to sell cars in the state, the agency said in a statement. However, Gordon said, the DMV will stay the judge's order for a suspension of Tesla's manufacturing license, so there will be no interruption to the company's factory operations in the state.In 2022, the DMV said that Tesla's marketing of its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving systems had suggested its cars could be operated autonomously, though they actually required an attentive driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time. Since that time, Tesla has changed the name of its premium, driver assistance option to Full Self-Driving (Supervised). \"A reasonable consumer likely would believe that a vehicle with Full Self-Driving Capability can travel safely without a human driver's constant, undivided attention,\" the judge wrote in the proposed order. \"This belief is wrong — both as a technological matter and as a legal matter — which makes the name Full Self-Driving Capability misleading,\" a violation of both civil and vehicle codes in California.Public relations firm FGS Global said in an emailed statement from Tesla that, \"This was a 'consumer protection' order about the use of the term 'Autopilot' in a case where not one single customer came forward to say there's a problem. Sales in California will continue uninterrupted.\"The California DMV did not cite consumer complaints in its accusations. However, Tesla is facing a class action lawsuit in California's Northern District from drivers who say that the company misled them for years regarding the self-driving capabilities of their Tesla electric vehicles.Tesla's stock price closed at a record on Tuesday, largely due to increased enthusiasm on Wall Street surrounding the company's plans for its Robotaxis and driverless technology.WATCH: Why EVs have worse depreciation rateswatch now",

    "body": "The Paramount logo is displayed on the water tower at Paramount Studios on December 8, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. Discovery board on Wednesday said it unanimously recommended that WBD shareholders reject a takeover offer from Paramount Skydance and stick with a \"superior\" proposal from Netflix. Last week, Paramount launched a hostile bid for WBD, taking a $30-per-share, all-cash offer directly to shareholders. Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison has argued the deal, which equates to an equity value of $108.4 billion, is better than Netflix's and that a Paramount-WBD combination would have better chances of winning regulatory approval. \"Following a careful evaluation of Paramount's recently launched tender offer, the Board concluded that the offer's value is inadequate, with significant risks and costs imposed on our shareholders,\" Samuel Di Piazza, chair of the Warner Bros. Discovery board, said in a news release. \"This offer once again fails to address key concerns that we have consistently communicated to Paramount throughout our extensive engagement and review of their six previous proposals,\" Di Piazza said. \"We are confident that our merger with Netflix represents superior, more certain value for our shareholders and we look forward to delivering on the compelling benefits of our combination.\"The WBD board noted the Paramount bid includes more than $40 billion of financing that is separate from the Ellison family despite Paramount claiming the funding has a \"full backstop\" from the family.\"Despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,\" the board said in a letter to shareholders. Netflix has proposed a cash-and-stock transaction for WBD's streaming and studio assets, worth an equity value of $72 billion or enterprise value of roughly $83 billion, including debt. Under that deal, Warner Bros. Discovery's portfolio of cable networks would be spun out into a separate entity. WBD noted that bid had \"no need for any equity financing and robust debt commitments,\" given Netflix's market valuation of more than $400 million. Netflix on Wednesday said it \"welcomes\" the Warner Bros. Discovery board's recommendation. \"This was a competitive process that delivered the best outcome for consumers, creators, stockholders and the broader entertainment industry,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in a statement. \"Netflix and Warner Bros. complement each other, and we're excited to combine our strengths with their theatrical film division, world-class television studio, and the iconic HBO brand, which will continue to focus on prestige television.\" This is breaking news.

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a Mexican Border Defense Medal presentation in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Dec. 15, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stateside designated Venezuelan government a \"terrorist\" organization and ordered a \"complete and total\" blockade of sanctioned oil tankers moving in and out of the country. In a post on Truth Social, Trump said \"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America.\"\"For the theft of our Assets, and many other reasons, including Terrorism, Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking, the Venezuelan Regime has been designated a FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION. Therefore, today, I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela,\" Trump said.He added, \"It [the blockade] will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before.\"Venezuela labeled Trump's statement \"grotesque,\" saying his action \"violates International Law, free trade and free navigation, which constitutes a serious threat against a sovereign nation,\" calling the blockade \"absolutely irrational,\" according to a Google translation of Venezuelan media reports. According to the U.S. State Department, designating an entity as a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" makes it illegal for any U.S. citizen to knowingly provide \"material support or resources\" to such an organization, among other measures. Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, told CNBC that a full embargo of Venezuelan oil would affect 800,000 to 900,000 barrels of oil per day, which could increase prices by about $2 to $3 per barrel. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThat would still leave the world \"well supplied\" as there's a global oil surplus of about 2 million barrels per day, Lipow said. However, Lipow also pointed out that \"The oil market will be watching the Chinese reaction as they are the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil, benefiting from discounted prices and, they may be reluctant to observe USA sanctions, keeping Venezuelan oil flowing into the market.\"Brent crude rose 0.9% to $59.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained 1% to $55.82 a barrel after after the news. Prices had hit a four-year low on Tuesday stateside, with WTI falling nearly 3% to $55.27 per barrel, while Brent lost 2.71%, or $1.64, to settle at $58.92.Lipow's view was also echoed by Bob McNally, president at Rapidan Energy Group, who said that \"nothing substantively has changed,\" as long as only sanctioned tankers are targeted.\"We estimate that sanctioned (only) tankers would threaten about 0.3 million barrels of Venezuela's roughly 0.9 million barrels a day of total crude exports.\"McNally said that this alone is not enough to impart a sustained spike into crude prices, which are beginning to fall as surpluses emerge.The Trump administration has escalated pressure on Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in recent months, saying that his \"days are numbered\" in an interview with Politico. Trump has categorically not ruled out a ground invasion of the South American nation.The White House has reportedly undertaken a large military buildup in the Caribbean, including deploying its largest aircraft carrier to the region, as well as launching strikes against boats that it claims were trafficking drugs to the U.S.— CNBC's Lee Ying Shan contributed to this report.",

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI is in discussions with Amazon about a potential investment and an agreement to use its artificial intelligence chips, CNBC confirmed on Tuesday. The details are fluid and still subject to change but the investment could exceed $10 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the talks are confidential. The Information first reported on the potential deal.The discussions come after OpenAI completed a restructuring in October and formally outlined the details of its partnership with Microsoft, giving it more freedom to raise capital and partner with companies across the broader AI ecosystem. Microsoft has invested more than $13 billion in OpenAI and backed the company since 2019, but it no longer has a right of first refusal to be OpenAI's compute provider, according to an October release. OpenAI can now also develop some products with third parties. Amazon has invested at least $8 billion into OpenAI rival Anthropic, but the e-commerce giant could be looking to expand its exposure to the booming generative AI market. Microsoft has taken a similar step and announced last month that it will invest up to $5 billion into Anthropic, while Nvidia will invest up to $10 billion in the startup.Amazon Web Services has been designing its own AI chips since around 2015, and the hardware has become crucial for AI companies that are trying to train models and meet growing demand for compute. AWS announced its Inferentia chips in 2018, and the latest generation of its Trainium chips earlier this month. OpenAI has made more than $1.4 trillion of infrastructure commitments in recent months, including agreements with chipmakers Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom. Last month, OpenAI signed a deal to buy $38 billion worth of capacity from AWS, its first contract with the leader in cloud infrastructure leader.In October, OpenAI finalized a secondary share sale totaling $6.6 billion, allowing current and former employees to sell stock at a $500 billion valuation.WATCH: Oracle says there have been ‘no delays’ in OpenAI arrangement after stock slidewatch now",

    "body": "Honda vehicles are lined up at a vehicle storage yard at an industrial port, on the day U.S. President Donald Trump struck a trade deal with Japan that lowers tariffs on auto imports, in Yokohama, near Tokyo, Japan, July 23, 2025. Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersJapan's exports in November rose at their fastest rate in nine months this year, growing at 6.1% year on year, data from the country's finance ministry released Wednesday showed.   The growth sharply beat expectations of an average 4.8% rise estimated by economists polled by Reuters, and was higher than the 3.6% seen in the previous month.  The export numbers were supported by a 23.6% increase in goods shipped to Western Europe, as well as an 8.8% rise in exports to the U.S., its second largest trading partner. This marks the first time that exports to the U.S. from Japan have increased since March.Exports of automobiles fell 4.1% by value, but auto shipments to the U.S. posted a recovery, rising 1.5% year in year in November. The data comes after revised GDP numbers for the third quarter showed that Japan's economy contracted more than initially estimated, shrinking 0.6% quarter on quarter, and 2.3% on an annualized basis. Shipments to mainland China fell 2.4%, but exports to Hong Kong jumped 11.4% compared to the same period the previous year. Exports of \"foodstuff\" to mainland China fell 5.9% by value. In November, tensions between Japan and China rose after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said that a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by force could trigger an intervention by Japan's military, leading to Beijing restricting imports of Japanese seafood. Imports into Japan rose 1.3% in November, compared to expectations of a 2.5% rise. Trade and diplomatic frictions aside, Japanese companies are positive on business growth, with the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showing that sentiment among Japanese companies mostly improved in the fourth quarter, especially among small manufacturers.Jesper Koll, expert director at Tokyo-based financial services firm Monex Group, highlighted the growth in semiconductor and equipment exports, saying that the U.S.-led boom in tech spending is translating into growing exports of specialized machinery and equipment.Exports of electrical machinery jumped 7.4%, and semiconductor-related exports surged 13% year on year, which Koll said is a \"confirmation of Japan's competitiveness in supplying machines that make machines.\"The market is underestimating the positive implications of the U.S. capex boom, much of what goes into the new data centers and AI hardware enablers and power centers is Made in Japan, and can only be made in Japan,\" Koll added.",

Washington has imposed export curbs on U.S. chip behemoth Nvidia, barring sales of its most advanced AI chips to China. Newer Chinese players such as Enflame Technology and Biren Technology have also entered the AI space, aiming to capture a share of the billions in graphics processing unit, or GPU, demand no longer served by Nvidia. Chinese regulators have also been clearing more semiconductor IPOs in their drive for greater AI independence.watch nowEarlier this month, shares of Moore Threads, a Beijing-based GPU manufacturer often referred to as \"China's Nvidia,\" soared by more than 400% on its debut in Shanghai following its $1.1 billion listing.Macquarie's equity analyst Eugene Hsiao said investor enthusiasm around Chinese AI-chip IPOs such as MetaX is partly shaped by longer-term expectations that China will build a self-sufficient semiconductor ecosystem as tensions with the U.S. persist.\"For that to work, you need these players. You need names like Moore Threads, Meta X, etc,\" he said.\"So I think when investors are looking at these IPOs, they implicitly are thinking about the nationalistic element,\" Hsiao noted, adding that the main driver of the frenzy, however, was the firms' growth potential.— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this article.",

    "body": "The Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, Nov. 20, 2025.Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNasdaq is moving closer to around-the-clock stock trading, a shift that some on Wall Street are calling unnecessary — and potentially destabilizing.The exchange said it plans to submit paperwork to the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow U.S.-listed equities and exchange-traded products to trade nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week. If approved, the new schedule would launch in the second half of 2026.Under the proposal, Nasdaq would expand trading hours to 23 hours each weekday from the current 16 hours. Stocks would trade in a \"day session\" from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. Eastern time, followed by a one-hour pause for maintenance, testing and clearing. A \"night session\" would then run from 9 p.m. to 4 a.m. the following morning.Critics argue that formalizing nearly nonstop trading could worsen some of the very problems that plague the structure of equity markets today — thin liquidity, sharp price swings and an increasingly \"gamified\" trading environment.'Worst thing in the world'\"This is literally the worst thing in the world,\" the Wells Fargo trading desk wrote in a note to clients. \"I cannot think of an action that single-handedly gamifies the stock market even more than it has already become. This is the epitome of making trading even more like gambling.\"Jay Woods, chief market strategist at Freedom Capital Markets and a former market maker on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, raised concerns about the impact on listed companies themselves.\"Listed companies need a time to break and release news events and to have meetings where they're not moving markets, and now we're taking that away from them,\" Woods said. \"You're opening up a new can of worms.\"Nasdaq currently operates three weekday sessions: pre-market trading from 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., the regular session from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., and after-hours trading from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m.Retail-focused brokers, including Robinhood, have already rolled out extended or near-24-hour trading for certain U.S. stocks and cryptocurrencies, responding to demand from individual investors who want the ability to trade on global news at any time.The New York Stock Exchange is pursuing its own extended-hours model, with plans for 22 hours of weekday trading that won initial SEC approval in February, contingent on data-feed upgrades.Liquidity clusterWells Fargo added that most liquidity already clusters around the market open and close, making the idea of stretching trading hours even further counterproductive. \"Most of the complaints that I hear on market structure are about how bad volumes are as most comes in around the open and close,\" the note said. \"And the industry move is to then elongate the trading day even further? This makes no sense at all.\"While Nasdaq says extended hours could eventually attract more participation, skeptics ask whether firms would be forced to staff trading desks around the clock.\"We know between 9:30 and 4, most traders are at their desk. The biggest institutions are working,\" Woods said. \"Are we going to have to add a whole new ecosphere of traders and institutions to man the desks so they can participate around the clock?\"Woods believes pauses in trading serve a purpose, enabling markets to digest information and participants to reset.\"We take breaks for a reason,\" Woods said. \"Let's recharge the batteries. Let's all get on the same page. We already have volatility ... during the day. If things move too far, too fast, we take a pause.\"",

    "body": "Shoppers walk past shops on Regent Street on the final weekday before Christmas in London on December 22, 2023.Henry Nicholls | Afp | Getty ImagesThe U.K.'s inflation rate cooled sharply to 3.2% in November, boosting the chances of the Bank of England cutting interest rates at its final meeting of the year on Thursday.Economists polled by Reuters had expected inflation to stand at 3.5% in the twelve months to November — the lowest annual rate since March — and down from 3.6% in October. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, also rose by 3.2% in the year to November, down from 3.4% in October, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.Lower food prices, which traditionally rise in the run up to Christmas, were the main driver of the fall, with decreases seen particularly for cakes, biscuits, and breakfast cereals, ONS Chief Economist Grant Fitzner commented Wednesday.watch now\"Tobacco prices also helped pull the rate down, with prices easing slightly this month after a large rise a year ago. The fall in the price of women's clothing was another downward driver,\" Fitzner said in comments on X.While the rise in the cost of goods leaving factories slowed, the annual cost of raw materials for businesses continued to rise, he added.Chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the drop in the inflation rate but said there is \"more work to do.\"\"I know families across Britain who are worried about the cost of living will welcome this fall in inflation. But there is more to do,\" she said on X.Christmas rate cutThe data, coming after a print on Tuesday showing the U.K. unemployment rate rose 5.1%, is likely to encourage the Bank of England's nine-member monetary policy committee (MPC) to cut the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75% when it meets on Thursday. Economists expect a 5-4 vote by the central bank's MPC, however, with BOE Governor Andrew Bailey expected to be the swing vote in favor of a trim.Growth in the U.K. remains stubbornly low, with the economy eking out only a 0.1% expansion in the third quarter, according to the most recent data, and signs that unemployment could be ticking higher. \"These figures, alongside the recent deluge of downbeat data, mean that an interest rate cut tomorrow looks certain,\" Suren Thiru, economics director at the ICAEW, said after the inflation data. \"While the financial squeeze on households and businesses remains severe, these figures offer reassurance that the U.K. is moving towards a more modest inflation environment, helped by lower food prices,\" he noted in emailed comments.\"The growing downward pressure from a loosening labour market and wilting economy should help keep it on a downward path,\" he said.

    "body": "Key tax credits that reduce the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance coverage for millions of Americans looked likely to expire by the end of the year after House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that there would be no vote on extending those subsidies this week.The House is not in session next week, meaning that Johnson was not leaving the door open for a later vote before the boosted ACA premium assistance expires.There remains a chance that enough Republicans in Johnson's majority caucus agree to back a Democrat-led effort to force an effective vote on extending the tax credits for Obamacare health plans.The tactic, a discharge petition, is identical to one recently used to force a vote on a bill compelling the release by the Department of Justice of investigative files related to sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualification\"We looked for a way to try to allow that pressure release valve, and it just was not to be,\" Johnson, R-La., said at a press conference, referring to the looming expiration date for the aid.\"We worked on it all the way through the weekend, in fact, and in the end, an agreement wasn't made,\" he said.Republican leadership in the House is continuing to push for a novel cost-sharing plan that would make it easier for small employers to provide their own health-care plans. A vote on that proposal remains set for Wednesday.\"It offers commonsense solutions to lower premium costs for everybody, all Americans,\" Johnson said. \"It expands access to quality care, provides every American with more options and flexibility to choose coverage that works for them and it brings greater transparency to America's health-care system.\"But Democrats and some moderate Republicans are continuing to push for votes on an extension of the enhanced Obamacare premium credits.The health policy research group KFF has said that about 22 million Americans, or more than 90% of total enrollment in ACA insurance coverage, receive enhanced subsidies, which were made available during the Covid-19 pandemic to increase the pool of people who are eligible for reduced health coverage premiums.KFF has estimated that when the boosted subsidies expire, people's premiums would more than double in 2026 on average.The deadline for signing up for ACA plan coverage on Obamacare marketplaces for 2026 was this past Monday.Moderate Republicans who want the credits extended are pushing a pair of bipartisan discharge petitions from Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., to force Johnson to hold a vote on their health-care bills to extend the credits with other reforms. That effort now appears to be on life support after Johnson's statement Tuesday.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who has has yet to back either of the bipartisan options, is pushing his own discharge petition that has the signatures of all 214 House Democrats. Only four Republicans need to break ranks and sign his petition to force a vote on his bill that would extend the credits. So far, Republicans have not done so, in the hopes that Jeffries will endorse one of the bipartisan proposals.\"I am pissed for the American people, this is absolute bulls---,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, a moderate Republican who is pushing for an extension of the credits, after he emerged from a GOP conference meeting Tuesday morning. \"If Hakeem Jeffries was serious about this, he would actually tell his conference, go sign the discharges and let's force a vote,\" Lawler said. \"But he's not, and that's the problem.\"Rep. Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., a supporter of the discharge petitions, said, \"Leadership of both parties are failing to take reasonable steps to support the compromise measure.\"Kiley said that Jeffries \"is instead insisting the only way to go is this three-year clean extension\" of the tax credits, with \"no reforms, which has already failed the Senate and so wouldn't become law if it passed the House anyway.\"Fitzpatrick's proposal would extend the credits through 2027. His petition has 24 signatures, well short of the 218 signatures needed to force a vote.Fitzpatrick said on Tuesday that he expects Jeffries' discharge petition will obtain 218 signatures.— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Susie Wiles, White House chief of staff, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, June 27, 2025.Yuri Gripas | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles after she told a reporter that Trump has an \"alcoholic's personality.\"Trump, in an interview with the New York Post, said he stood by Wiles after Vanity Fair published her surprisingly candid — and occasionally critical — remarks about the administration from a series of interviews this year.\"Oh, she's fantastic,\" Trump said.Wiles, a spotlight-averse figure who enjoys unparalleled influence and power in Trump's orbit, offered blunt descriptions of many of the administration's highest-profile officials over 11 interviews with Vanity Fair's Chris Whipple.Wiles — the daughter of former New York Giants kicker and NFL broadcaster Pat Summerall, who is described by Vanity Fair as an alcoholic and an absentee parent — told Whipple her difficult upbringing made her \"a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\"Trump does not drink, but he has \"an alcoholic's personality\" in that he \"operates [with] a view that there's nothing he can't do,\" Wiles said. \"Nothing, zero, nothing.\" In his interview with the Post, Trump said Wiles \"meant that I'm — you see, I don't drink alcohol. So everybody knows that — but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic.\"\"I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality,\" Trump said.\"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that — what's the word? Not possessive — possessive and addictive type personality,\" the president said. \"Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"Trump also attacked Vanity Fair, saying, \"I think from what I hear, the facts were wrong, and it was a very misguided interviewer, purposely misguided.\"Wiles, and much of Trump's Cabinet, had already pushed back on the Vanity Fair articles.In an X post, Wiles called them \"a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story. I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team,\" she wrote. She added that she has been \"honored\" to work for Trump for nearly a decade, and declared, \"None of this will stop our relentless pursuit of Making America Great Again!\"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement to CNBC, added that Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any president in American history.\" \"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie. The entire administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her,\" Leavitt said.What Wiles told WhippleWiles told Vanity Fair that Trump has engaged in legal \"retribution\" against his enemies since his return to office.Wiles said in March that she and Trump had a \"loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.\"Around five months later, she initially denied that Trump was \"on a retribution tour,\" contending that he was motivated by getting \"people that have done bad things\" out of the government.But she admitted, \"In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time.\"And she said that the administration's attempted prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James — who helmed a business fraud case against Trump and was seen as one of his most reviled political foes — \"might be the one retribution.\"The case against James on mortgage fraud-related charges was dismissed in November, after a judge ruled Trump's pick of prosecutor was invalidly appointed. The Department of Justice has so far failed to convince subsequent grand juries to reindict her.James' attorney Abbe Lowell told NBC News that Wiles' remark \"only confirms that this has been an improper vindictive prosecution.\"\"When they admit it's not justice they're after but pure revenge, believe them,\" Lowell said. Wiles also spoke about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering behind some of Trump's biggest agenda items, including his global \"reciprocal\" tariff policy.The early April tariff rollout, which Trump touted as America's \"Liberation Day,\" was the product of what Wiles described as a divided White House that could not agree on the policy's impact.\"So much thinking out loud is what I would call it,\" Wiles said in an interview at the time, recalling that she urged advisers who doubted the tariff plans to get on board, but \"they couldn't get there.\"Wiles said she believed a middle ground on tariffs would ultimately succeed, Whipple reported. \"But it's been more painful than I expected,\" she said.Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump sues BBC for $10 billion, claims defamation from Panorama documentaryPentagon takes big stake in new Korea Zinc refinery in Tenn., gets 10% of companyNew Trump tariffs collection hits $200 billion, Customs saysFormer Instacart employee says she was fired over her Democratic congressional campaignUkraine peace talks progressing, Russia open to EU membership, U.S. officials sayNew York AG sues UPS for allegedly shorting Christmas season workers' wagesTrump admin to hire 1,000 specialists for 'Tech Force'Trump doubles down on Rob Reiner criticism after killing; director's son in custodyTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationWhipple also reported Wiles saying that Vice President JD Vance, a onetime Trump critic who became a leading figure of the MAGA movement, had \"sort of political\" motivations for changing his views. He has been \"a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" she added.Vance, asked about the comments later Tuesday, said he only believes \"in the conspiracy theories that are true.\" He listed his concerns about putting masks on children during the Covid-19 pandemic and about former President Joe Biden's health during his time in office as examples.\"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets,\" Vance added.Wiles said Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, an author of the government-reform  guidebook known as Project 2025, was \"a right-wing absolute zealot.\"Attorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, \"completely whiffed\" on her early handling of government records related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, Wiles said.Trump said on the 2024 campaign trail that he would support declassifying files from the federal investigations of Epstein, a well-connected money manager who died in jail in 2019 while facing sex trafficking charges. But the Trump administration later said it determined that no more disclosures were warranted, sparking outrage from many MAGA supporters.Bondi, who in February gave binders with old information labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" to a group of conservative influencers, failed to appreciate that those people were \"the very targeted group that cared about this,\" Wiles said.\"First she gave them binders full of nothingness. And then she said that the witness list, or the client list, was on her desk,\" Wiles said, adding, \"There is no client list, and it sure as hell wasn't on her desk.\" As for Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX chief who briefly ran Trump's controversial government-slashing group known as DOGE, Wiles accused him of being \"an avowed ketamine [user]\" and \"an odd, odd duck, as I think geniuses are.\"She said that she \"was initially aghast\" when DOGE moved to dismantle the United States Agency for International Development, which Musk has claimed was rife with fraud.\"I think anybody that pays attention to government and has ever paid attention to USAID believed, as I did, that they do very good work,\" she said.\"Elon's attitude is you have to get it done fast. If you're an incrementalist, you just won't get your rocket to the moon,\" Wiles said. \"And so with that attitude, you're going to break some china. But no rational person could think the USAID process was a good one. Nobody.\"",

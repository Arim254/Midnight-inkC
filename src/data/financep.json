    "body": "Meta has been hit with an EU antitrust investigation over its use of AI features in WhatsApp, as the European bloc continues to ramp up challenges to US big tech giants.The probe will examine whether Meta's new policy on allowing AI providers' access to WhatsApp may breach EU competition rules, Brussels said in a statement Thursday morning.A new policy announced by Meta in October prohibited AI providers from using a tool allowing businesses to contact customers via WhatsApp when AI is the main service offered, the European Commission said. While businesses may still use AI tools for functions like customer support, the bloc was concerned the new policy might \"prevent third party AI providers from offering their services through WhatsApp in the European Economic Area (EEA),\" it added.\"The claims are baseless,\" a WhatsApp spokesperson told CNBC in a statement, adding that the app's application programming interface (API) was not designed to support AI chatbots and \"puts a strain on our systems.\"\"The AI space is highly competitive and people have access to the services of their choice in any number of ways, including app stores, search engines, email services, partnership integrations and operating systems,\" the company added.It comes months on from the Commission fining Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.45 billion) for breaching antitrust rules around online advertising. In April, Apple was fined 500 million euros after being found to have breached anti-steering obligations. The same month, Meta was hit with a 200 million euros fine for breaching obligations to give consumers the choice of a service that uses less of their personal data.Fines for breaking the EU's antitrust rules can reach as much as 10% of a company's annual revenue. There are no dates set for the antitrust investigation to close, but previous cases have run on for years. \"We must ensure European citizens and businesses can benefit fully of this technological revolution and act to prevent dominant digital incumbents from abusing their power to crowd out innovative competitors,\" said the bloc's Commissioner for Competition Teresa Ribera.The investigation will cover the entire EEA apart from Italy, to avoid an overlap with its own ongoing proceedings for the possible imposition of interim measures concerning Meta's conduct.U.S. President Donald Trump has previously threatened the EU with an investigation that could lead to tariffs for imposing fines and regulation on the country's tech giants.\"As I have said before, my Administration will NOT allow these discriminatory actions to stand,\" he said following the EU's Google fine in September.

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025. Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen Nvidia this week said it would take a $2 billion stake in chip design company Synopsys, it was just the latest in a string of massive investments announced by the chipmaker this year. Nvidia has also said it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, invest $5 billion in Intel and $10 billion in Anthropic — $18 billion in investment commitments from those four deals, not counting smaller venture capital investments.That doesn't even include the biggest commitment of all: $100 billion to buy OpenAI shares over a number of years, although there is still no definitive agreement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said Tuesday. It's a lot of money and a lot of deals, but Nvidia's got the cash to write big checks. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. That's up from $13.3 billion in January 2023, just after OpenAI released ChatGPT. That launch three years ago was key to making Nvidia's chips the most valuable tech product.As Nvidia has transformed from a maker of gaming technology into the most valuable U.S. company, its balance sheet has become a fortress, and investors are increasingly wondering what the company will do with its cash. \"No company has grown at the scale that we're talking about,\" said CEO Jensen Huang, when asked what the company plans to do with all its cash, on Nvidia's earnings call last month.Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to generate $96.85 billion in free cash flow this year alone and $576 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Some analysts would like to see Nvidia spend more of its cash on share repurchases. \"Nvidia is set to generate over $600B in free cash flow over the next few years and it should have a lot left over for opportunistic buybacks,\" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a note on Monday.The company's board increased its share repurchase authorization in August, adding $60 billion to its total. In the first three quarters of the year, it spent $37 billion on share repurchases and dividends.\"We're going to continue to do stock buybacks,\" Huang said. Nvidia is doing the buybacks, but it's not stopping there. Huang said that Nvidia's balance sheet strength gives its customers and suppliers confidence that orders in the future, which he called offtake, will be filled. \"Our reputation and our credibility is incredible,\" Huang said. \"It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that.\"Kress, Nvidia's CFO, on Tuesday said that the company's \"largest focus\" is making sure it has enough cash to deliver its next-generation products on time. Most of Nvidia's largest suppliers are equipment manufacturers like Foxconn and Dell, which can require that Nvidia provide working capital to manage inventory and build additional manufacturing capacity. Huang called his company's strategic investments \"really important work\" and said that if companies like OpenAI grow, it drives additional consumption of AI and Nvidia's chips. Nvidia has said that it does not require any of its investments to use its products, but they all do anyway. \"All of the investments that we've done so far — all of it, period — is associated with expanding the reach of Cuda, expanding the ecosystem,\" Huang said, referring to the company's AI software.In an October filing, Nvidia said it had has already made $8.2 billion in investments in private companies. For Nvidia, those investments have replaced acquisitions. Nvidia's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 is the largest the company has ever made, and it laid the groundwork for its current AI products, which aren't single chips but entire server racks that sell for around an estimated $3 million.But the company faced regulatory issues when it tried to buy chip technology firm Arm for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia called off the deal before it could be completed after regulators in the U.S. and UK raised concerns about its effects on competition in the chip industry. Nvidia has purchased some smaller companies in recent years, to bolster its engineering teams, but it hasn't completed a multi-billion acquisition since the Arm deal failed.\"It's hard to think about very significant, large types of M&A,\" Kress this week said, speaking at an investor conference. \"I wish one would come available, but it's not going to be very easy to do so.\"WATCH: Nvidia CEO says he supports export controls ahead of Senate Banking Committee meeting",

    "body": "watch nowNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday and that the two men  discussed chip export restrictions, as lawmakers consider a proposal to limit exports of advanced artificial intelligence chips to nations like China. \"I've said it repeatedly that we support export controls, and that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers were considering including the Guaranteeing Access and Innovation for National Artificial Intelligence Act in a major defense package, known as the National Defense Authorization Act. The GAIN AI Act would require chipmakers like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to give U.S. companies first pick on their AI chips before selling them in countries like China. The proposal isn't expected to be part of the NDAA, Bloomberg reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Huang said it was \"wise\" that the proposal is being left out of the annual defense policy bill. \"The GAIN AI Act is even more detrimental to the United States than the AI Diffusion Act,\" Huang said.  Nvidia's CEO also criticized the idea of establishing a patchwork of state laws regulating AI. The notion of state-by-state regulation has generated pushback from tech companies and spurred the creation of a super PAC called \"Leading the Future,\" which is backed by the AI industry. \"State-by-state AI regulation would drag this industry into a halt and it would create a national security concern, as we need to make sure that the United States advances AI technology as quickly as possible,\" Huang said. \"A federal AI regulation is the wisest.\"Trump last month urged legislators to include a provision in the NDAA that would preempt state AI laws in favor of \"one federal standard.\"But House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) told CNBC's Emily Wilkins on Tuesday the provision won't make it into the bill, citing a lack of sufficient support. He and other lawmakers will continue to look for ways to establish a national standard on AI, Scalise added. WATCH: Nvidia currying favor to be able to sell chips in Chinawatch now",

    "body": "A pedestrian walks past the Bank of Japan (BoJ) building in central Tokyo on July 28, 2023.Richard A. Brooks | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's central bank is caught in a bind as soaring government bond yields risk upending its policy normalization process.The Bank of Japan faces a stark choice: sticking with its policy of raising rates and risking even higher yields and further slowing an already sagging economy, or holding, even cutting rates to support growth that could accelerate inflation further.Japanese government bonds have been scaling new peaks over the past month. On Thursday, yield on the benchmark 10-year JGBs hit a high of 1.917%, surging to their strongest level since 2007. The 20-year JGB yield reached 2.936%, a level not seen since 1999, while 30-year hit a record high of 3.436%, LSEG data going back to 1999 showed. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconJapan abandoned its yield curve control program in March 2024, under which benchmark 10-year bond yields were capped at around 1%, as part of its policy normalization that also saw the country end the world's last negative interest rate regime.   Now, as the country weighs increasing rates at a time when inflation has been rising — it has stayed above the BOJ's 2% target for 43 straight months — the specter of bond yields spiking further looms large.    Anindya Banerjee, head of currency and commodities at Kotak Securities, told CNBC's \"Inside India\" that if the BOJ reverts back to quantitative easing and YCC to cap bond yields, the yen may also weaken and feed imported inflation, which is already a problem.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconRising bond yields mean higher borrowing costs for Japan, further straining the country's fiscal situation. Asia's second-largest economy already boasts of the world highest debt-to-GDP ratio, standing at almost 230%, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.Add to that a government that is poised to unleash its largest stimulus package since the pandemic to curb cost of living and prop up the struggling Japanese economy, and the concerns around Japan's ballooning debt become even more stark.Magdalene Teo, head of fixed income research for Asia at Julius Baer, said that the new debt issuance of 11.7 trillion yen to finance Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's supplementary budget is 1.7 times larger than that issued under her predecessor Shigeru Ishiba in 2024. \"This highlights the difficulty the government faces in balancing economic stimulus initiatives with maintaining fiscal sustainability,\" Teo said.Global implications?In August 2024, an unwinding of yen-funded leveraged carry trades due to a hawkish BOJ rate hike and disappointing macro data from the U.S. saw stocks globally sell-off, with Japan's Nikkei crashing 12.4% to record its worst day since 1987. Carry trade refers to borrowing in a currency with lower interest rates and investing in high-yielding assets, with the Japanese yen being the predominant currency funding such trades as the country's had a negative interest rates policy.   Now, rising Japanese yields have narrowed that rate differential, fueling concerns about another round of carry trade unwind and repatriation of funds into Japan. However, experts say that a repeat of the 2024 meltdown is unlikely.\"From a global perspective, the narrowing Japan–U.S. yield gap reduces the appeal of yen-funded carry trades, but we do not expect a repeat of the 2024 systemic unwind ... Instead, anticipate episodic volatility and selective deleveraging, particularly if yen strength accelerates funding costs,\" said Masahiko Loo, senior fixed income strategist at State Street Investment Management. Loo attributes said structural flows driven by retail allocations from pensions funds, life insurance, and NISA [Nippon Individual Savings Account] anchor foreign holdings, making large-scale repatriation unlikely.Justin Heng, APAC rates strategist at HSBC, concurred, saying that Japanese investors have shown little sign of repatriating funds, and have remained net buyers of foreign bonds. From January to October 2025, they purchased 11.7 trillion yen in overseas debt, far outpacing the 4.2 trillion yen bought in all of 2024, according to HSBC. That surge has been driven mainly by trust banks and asset managers benefiting from retail inflows under the Japanese government's tax-exempt investment program. \"We expect the continued decline in hedging cost, as a result of further Fed rate cuts, will also likely encourage Japanese investors to take more foreign bond exposure,\" Heng said.",

    "body": "watch nowNEW YORK — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday predicted that the administration still will be able to implement its tariff agenda regardless of whether it prevails in a pending case before the Supreme Court.Repeating assertions he had made prior to the high court hearing a month ago, Bessent cited several sections of 1962 Trade Act that give the president sweeping powers over import duties.\"We can recreate the exact tariff structure with [sections] 301, with 232, with 122,\" he said during an onstage interview at The New York Times DealBook Summit.Asked by host Andrew Ross Sorkin — the founding editor of DealBook and co-host of CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" — whether the administration had to implement those measures permanently, Bessent replied, \"permanently.\"Section 122 allows for tariff power up to 150 days, but 301 and 232 are less definitive on a time frame. Bessent also cited the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as providing broad tariff authority, though that is the use under scrutiny by the Supreme Court.President Donald Trump has used tariffs as a favorite negotiating tool against U.S. trading partners. The president has slapped duties on a wide range of products and virtually all imports that come into the country, though he has backed off on many of the more aggressive measures.Bessent cited some of the successes the administration has enjoyed thus far, naming China specifically despite ongoing tensions between the two nations.\"Because of the fentanyl tariffs, the Chinese are making the first the step forward that they've made\" on trade, he said. Bessent added that China has made \"a robust effort\" at halting the drug's import into the U.S.He added that he still thinks the U.S. stands a good chance of prevailing in the Supreme Court case.On a separate matter, Bessent dodged a question on Trump's pick for the next Federal Reserve chair and noted the limited power the central bank leader has over interest rates. Recent reports have indicated that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett is the front-runner.\"The important thing to remember here is that it's a board and [there are] several other voters from the from the regional banks,\" he said. \"The chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion, but at the end of the day ... he or she is one vote.\"Bessent told CNBC recently that he thought Trump could make the decision by Christmas, but the president indicated it may not come until the new year.",

    "body": "Russia's security council chief warned on Thursday that should the European Union use its seized frozen assets to support Ukraine, that could be tantamount to justification for war.  The European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, has been looking at how to use frozen Russian assets held in Europe to further support Ukraine.The move could be tantamount to an act justifying war, Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said in a comment posted to Telegram and translated by Google. \"If a frantic European Union attempts to steal Russian assets frozen in Belgium by issuing a so-called reparations loan, such actions could be classified under international law as a special kind of casus belli, with all the ensuing consequences for Brussels and individual EU countries,\" Medvedev said, referring to the Latin phrasing for an act that justifies war.watch nowRussia has previously said it would retaliate if the EU went ahead with using frozen assets option. The Commission has argued that the move is not theft, given it would be a loan and Ukraine would only have to repay it if Russia pays reparations. Russia and the European Commission did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. Unlocking $105 billionOn Wednesday the Commission proposed a \"Reparations Loan\" for Ukraine which would involve using cash from the balances of European financial institutions holding frozen Russian Central Bank assets. It also proposed borrowing the funds from international markets, offering member states an alternative to using Russian capital.Under the proposal to use the frozen assets, it plans to unlock 90 billion euros ($105 billion) for the effort, which is around two-thirds of the International Monetary Fund's $136.5 billion estimation of Ukraine's financing gap for 2026 to 2029. \"With Russia continuing to show no sign of willingness to commit to a just and sustainable peace, the strain on Ukraine's resources continues to grow, making sustained EU support all the more vital,\" the Commission said in a statement.  So far, European countries have used the profits generated by such assets to financially aid Kyiv, but some European leaders have expressed concerns about further measures due to potential financial and legal issues. Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner at the Kremlin, aimed at finding a solution to end the Ukraine war, in Moscow, Russia on December 2, 2025.Kremlin Press Office/Anadolu via Getty ImagesBelgium has been particularly tough on the subject, given that it hosts Euroclear — the financial institution that has the bulk of Russia's state assets which have been frozen in Europe since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Belgium's leadership has expressed concerns about the legal implications once the war is over and wants EU countries to commit to burden-sharing the responsibilities. One EU official, who did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the topic, told CNBC, \"If the EU chooses to borrow money to support Ukraine, this will need unanimity. If they choose to use the frozen assets then you can approve the plan by qualified majority.\"Hungary is against giving further cash to Ukraine, creating a barrier to achieving unanimity on the issue.Another EU official, who also did not want to be named due to the sensitivity of the talks, told CNBC: \"By putting forward two solutions to fund Ukraine, \"the European Commission wants to show that the only alternative is much worse for many more member states.\"The U.S. pushes for peace dealIt comes as peace negotiations continue. Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine's national security council, will meet U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff for talks in Miami on Thursday. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron is in Beijing on Thursday for a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The French leader is expected to urge his Chinese counterpart to do more to cooperate on Ukraine resolution.Discussions held between Russia and the U.S. failed to deliver a breakthrough on Tuesday, though U.S. President Donald Trump said that talks between his son-in-law Jared Kushner, Witkoff and Moscow were \"reasonably good,\" per reports.It's unclear which peace plan was presented to the Russians after an initial 28-point plan, secretly devised by the U.S. and Russia, was presented to Ukraine a few weeks ago.Speaking at the 2025 Investor Summit conference at the London Stock Exchange on Thursday, Kim Darroch, who served as the U.K.'s ambassador to the U.S. during Trump's first term, said: \"I don't think the Ukraine war is going to end anytime soon, unless the Ukrainians agree to capitulate and give up territory, plus to never join NATO, and this kind of stuff which I think is basically impossible to concede and survive politically.\" \"So, I think the war will drag on through the winter and beyond, which potentially is very dangerous for Europe because I think if Trump can't get a deal he may just walk away and stop weapons supplies to Ukraine and tell the Europeans, 'it's your problem, I tried to get a deal, so you do it.' And then I'm not sure we actually have the capacity to provide Ukraine with what it needs.\"— CNBC's Chloe Taylor contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A hiring sign is displayed in the window of a business in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 2025 in New York City.Spencer Platt | Getty ImagesThe U.S. labor market slowdown intensified in November as private companies cut 32,000 workers, with small businesses hit the hardest, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Wednesday.With worries intensifying over the domestic jobs picture, ADP indicated the issues were worse than anticipated. The payrolls decline marked a sharp step down from October, which saw an upwardly revised gain of 47,000 positions, and was well below the Dow Jones consensus estimate from economists for an increase of 40,000.Larger businesses, entailing companies with 50 or more employees, actually reported a net gain of 90,000 workers.However, establishments with fewer than 50 workers saw a decline of 120,000, including a drop of 74,000 among firms with 20 to 49 employees. The total loss was the biggest drop since March 2023.Education and health services led gainers with 33,000 hires, while leisure and hospitality added 13,000. But a broad-based decline across industries drove the total lower.The biggest loss came in professional and business services, which saw a decline of 26,000. Others shedding jobs included information services (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial activities and construction, both of which saw losses of 9,000.The rate of pay also slowed, with workers staying in their jobs seeing a 4.4% year-over-year increase, down 0.1 percentage point from October.\"Hiring has been choppy of late as employers weather cautious consumers and an uncertain macroeconomic environment,\" said ADP's chief economist, Nela Richardson. \"And while November's  slowdown was broad-based, it was led by a pullback among small businesses.\"The ADP report is the last jobs picture the Federal Reserve gets before it meets Dec. 9-10. Futures traders are assigning a nearly 90% probability that the central bank will approve another quarter percentage point cut in its key interest rate, despite misgivings from some officials over whether further easing is needed. The probability was about the same following the ADP release.In recent weeks, Fed policymakers have expressed a divergence of opinions. One side sees cuts as necessary to head off further labor market troubles, while the other worries that additional reductions could aggravate inflation, which has held considerably above the Fed's 2% target.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release its take on the nonfarm payrolls picture on Dec. 16, a date delayed because of the government shutdown.",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to change a longstanding recommendation that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, will significantly delay or eliminate that so-called birth dose of the shot entirely. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But either change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. Still, Merck during the panel's September meeting pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed big cuts to strict fuel economy standards for passenger cars enacted under the Biden administration. \"We are officially terminating Joe Biden's ridiculously burdensome, horrible actually, CAFE standards that imposed expensive restrictions,\" Trump said at the Oval Office, flanked by the CEOs of Ford Motor and Stellantis.The Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards date back to 1975 and have been tightened over the years to make vehicles more efficient.Former President Joe Biden had required automakers to increase the fuel efficiency of passenger cars and light trucks to about 50 miles per gallon by 2031. These stricter standards were expected to stimulate the production and sale of electric vehicles in the U.S. The standards proposed by the Trump administration would require cars to get about 34 miles to the gallon by 2031, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Trump has sought to dismantle pollution regulations and federal support for electric vehicles as well as renewable energy since taking office.  The oil industry group the American Petroleum Institute has lobbied the Trump administration to repeal the Biden fuel economy standards, contending that they aim to phase out liquid fuel vehicles.The announcement was attended by Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, as well as a plant manager for General Motors from Michigan.Ford CEO Jim Farley and Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa listen as U.S. President Donald Trump announces new fuel economy standards, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., December 3, 2025. Brian Snyder | ReutersMany of the officials in attendance, including U.S. dealers, said the new standards are more in line with the vehicles customers want to buy rather than the more costly ones automakers have been pushed to produce due to regulations.Trump and other officials also touted the new regulations as assisting in vehicle affordability, which has been an ongoing concern for the automotive industry, as the average new vehicle purchased hovers around $50,000.The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group that represents the majority of automakers operating in the U.S., also praised the cuts.\"We're reviewing NHTSA's announcement, but we're glad the agency has proposed new fuel economy standards,\" John Bozzella, CEO of the organization, said in a statement. \"We've been clear and consistent: The current CAFE rules finalized under the previous administration are extremely challenging for automakers to achieve given the current marketplace for EVs.\"U.S. EV leader Tesla did not respond for comment regarding the reduced standards.— CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

The stock rose 2% in extended trading. Here's how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:Earnings per share: $3.25 adjusted vs. $2.86 expectedRevenue: $10.26 billion vs. $10.27 billion expectedRevenue increased 8.6% from a year earlier in the fiscal third quarter, which ended on Oct. 31, according to a statement. Net income increased to $2.09 billion, or $2.19 per share, from $1.53 billion, or $1.58 per share, in the same quarter last year, boosted by a $263 million gain from strategic investments. Adjusted earnings per share exclude stock-based compensation.The Tableau data analytics business had a higher mix of cloud services than the company had predicted during the quarter, Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said on a conference call with analysts. Revenue from on-premises Tableau and MuleSoft app integration products are recognized during the quarter, rather than over time. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Salesforce called for $3.02 to $3.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $11.13 billion to $11.23 billion in revenue. Analysts polled by LSEG had expected $3.04 per share and $10.9 billion in revenue. The guidance implies revenue growth of between 11% and 12%, with about 3 points coming from Informatica, the data management company Salesforce acquired for around $8 billion in November. At the same time, the guidance factors in the continued shift to the cloud for MuleSoft and Tableau, as well as ongoing weakness from marketing and commerce products, Washington said.Salesforce's stock has badly underperformed the broader tech sector this year, in part due to concerns about the potential of artificial intelligence replacing some of its product capabilities. As of Wednesday's close, the shares are down 29% in 2025, while the Nasdaq has gained about 21%.During the fiscal third quarter, Salesforce acquired startups Regrello, whose AI software performs tasks, and Waii, which uses AI to compose code for running queries on data based on a few words of human input. The company also introduced Agentforce AI software for managing IT service requests, and issued a $60 billion fiscal 2030 revenue target, surpassing analysts' projections.Annualized revenue from Agentforce, which automates sales and customer service workflows, jumped 330% from a year earlier to over $500 million. Salesforce said it has won over 9,500 paid deals to date, up from over 6,000 as of September.Free cash flow grew 22% to $2.18 billion, but the total was below StreetAccount's $2.24 billion consensus.This is developing news.

    "body": "American flags flutter outside a Hyundai automobile dealership in Irvine, California, U.S., March 27, 2025. Mike Blake | ReutersDETROIT — Hyundai Motor and General Motors are set to be two of the greatest beneficiaries of lower U.S. tariffs on imports, including vehicles, from South Korea.The South Korean-based automaker is the largest U.S. importer of new vehicles from the country, followed by GM. Both automakers have paid billions of dollars in levies so far this year after President Donald Trump placed 25% tariffs on imported vehicles from South Korea and other countries in the spring. The Trump administration this past week confirmed plans to lower tariffs on certain products, including vehicles, to 15% from South Korea. A notice about the implementation of the trade deal was posted Wednesday on the Federal Register. Other countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom also have negotiated lower tariff rates with the Trump administration.Prior to the reduction, Hyundai reported U.S. tariffs costed the company 1.8 trillion won ($1.2 billion) in the third quarter, up from 828 billion won ($565 million) in the previous quarter. GM most recently said its tariff impacts, largely from South Korea and Mexico, were expected to be between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion in 2025.GM CFO Paul Jacobson said Wednesday that the automaker initially expected tariffs on South Korean imports to cost $2 billion but that the company has been able to offset many of those costs. He said GM expects the levies to cost closer to $1 billion or less in 2026.\"We do think that is going to be a tailwind next year, just not as much as the whole 50% because the ultimate tariff bill that we're going to pay this year for Korea was going to be a lot lower than the $2 billion from the stuff that we've been working on,\" Jacobson said during a UBS conference.The U.S. tariff announcement comes after South Korea officially introduced legislation in its parliament aiming to fulfill its promise to invest $350 billion for the U.S. over several years.Hyundai Motor Group Executive Chair Euisun Chung delivers remarks, as U.S. President Donald Trump, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Governor of Louisiana Jeff Landry stand, in the Roosevelt Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., March 24, 2025. Carlos Barria | Reuters\"Korea's commitment to American investment strengthens our economic partnership and domestic jobs and industry. We are also grateful for the deep trust between our two nations,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in a statement posted Monday on X.Hyundai North America CEO Randy Parker said the tariffs are still challenging but better than 25% as the automaker aims for a sixth-consecutive year of record U.S. retail sales in 2026. \"Fifteen percent is still 15%,\" he told CNBC during a phone interview Tuesday. \"Getting to 15% is a great milestone. It's been quite the journey reaching this agreement, which has been, I would say, quite extensive.\"Hyundai, including its Kia subsidiary that operates separately in the U.S., has significantly increased its sales and operations in the U.S. in recent years. But the automaker continues to import the majority of its vehicles — estimated to be nearly 1 million units this year — from South Korea.GlobalData estimates more than 1.37 million vehicles, or about 8.6% of the U.S. sales this year, will be vehicles that were imported from South Korea — making the country the largest exporter of American-sold vehicles aside from Mexico.Hyundai is expected to import more than 951,000 vehicles in 2025, according to GlobalData. That includes more than 369,000 for Kia and 582,000 for Hyundai and its luxury Genesis brand.Hyundai aims to have more than 80% of its U.S. vehicle sales be produced locally by 2030, the company said this year. That compares with roughly 40% currently. Despite the tariffs, GM is estimated to import nearly 422,000 vehicles from South Korea this year to the U.S., according to GlobalData. That would be a 3.6% increase compared with record imports of more than 407,000 units last year.GM has increasingly used South Korean plants to produce popular entry-level crossovers for Chevrolet and Buick. Its U.S. sales of South Korean-produced vehicles — largely entry-level models — have risen from 173,000 in 2019 to more than 407,000 last year, according to GlobalData.GM, in an emailed statement, said the company \"appreciates that negotiators have finalized an agreement on trade between the US and South Korea.\"\"GM's long-standing Korea operations produce high-quality, affordable crossovers that complement our U.S. vehicles and domestic production, which will soon rise to 2 million units. We will be monitoring and reviewing the details,\" GM said.GM produces its Buick Encore GX and Buick Envista crossovers, as well as the Chevrolet Trailblazer and Chevrolet Trax crossovers, at plants in South Korea. The company has touted the vehicles as being a pinnacle for the automaker's profitable growth in lower-margin, entry-level vehicles.Detainees are made to stand against a bus before being handcuffed, during a raid by federal agents where about 300 South Koreans were among 475 people arrested at the site of a $4.3 billion project by Hyundai Motor and LG Energy Solution to build batteries for electric cars in Ellabell, Georgia, U.S. September 4, 2025 in a still image taken from a video.

Kim Kyung-hoon | ReutersOpenAI has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Neptune, a startup that builds monitoring and de-bugging tools that artificial intelligence companies use as they train models. Neptune and OpenAI have collaborated on a metrics dashboard to help teams that are building foundation models. The companies will work \"even more closely together\" because of the acquisition, Neptune CEO Piotr Niedźwiedź said in a blog. The startup will wind down its external services in the coming months, Niedźwiedź said. The terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.\"Neptune has built a fast, precise system that allows researchers to analyze complex training workflows,\" OpenAI's Chief Scientist Jakub Pachocki said in a statement. \"We plan to iterate with them to integrate their tools deep into our training stack to expand our visibility into how models learn.\"OpenAI has acquired several companies this year. It purchased a small interface startup called Software Applications Incorporated for an undisclosed sum in October, product development startup Statsig for $1.1 billion in September and Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for more than $6 billion in May.Neptune had raised more than $18 million in funding from investors including Almaz Capital and TDJ Pitango Ventures, according to its website. Neptune's deal with OpenAI is still subject to customary closing conditions.\"I am truly grateful to our customers, investors, co-founders, and colleagues who have made this journey possible,\" Niedźwiedź said. \"It was the ride of a lifetime already, yet still I believe this is only the beginning.\"WATCH: Sam Altman hits reset at OpenAI, pausing side bets to defend ChatGPT’s AI leadwatch now",

    "body": "A person walks by a sign for Micron Technology headquarters in San Jose, California, on June 25, 2025.Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesMicron said on Wednesday that it plans to stop selling memory to consumers to focus on meeting demand for high-powered artificial intelligence chips. \"The AI-driven growth in the data center has led to a surge in demand for memory and storage,\" Sumit Sadana, Micron business chief, said in a statement. \"Micron has made the difficult decision to exit the Crucial consumer business in order to improve supply and support for our larger, strategic customers in faster-growing segments.\"Micron's announcement is the latest sign that the AI infrastructure boom is creating shortages for inputs like memory as a handful of companies commit to spend hundreds of billions in the next few years to build massive data centers. Memory, which is used by computers to store data for short periods of time, is facing a global shortage.Micron shares are up about 175% this year, though they slipped 3% on Wednesday to $232.25. AI chips, like the GPUs made by Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, use large amounts of the most advanced memory. For example, the current-generation Nvidia GB200 chip has 192GB of memory per graphics processor. Google's latest AI chip, the Ironwood TPU, needs 192GB of high-bandwidth memory. Memory is also used in phones and computers, but with lower specs, and much lower quantities — many laptops only come with 16GB of memory. Micron's Crucial brand sold memory on sticks that tinkerers could use to build their own PCs or upgrade their laptops. Crucial also sold solid-state hard drives. Micron competes against SK Hynix and Samsung in the market for high-bandwidth memory, but it's the only U.S.-based memory supplier. Analysts have said that SK Hynix is Nvidia's primary memory supplier. Micron supplies AMD, which says its AI chips use more memory than others, providing them a performance advantage for running AI. AMD's current AI chip, the MI350, comes with 288GB of high-bandwidth memory.  Micron's Crucial business was not broken out in company earnings. However, its cloud memory business unit showed 213% year-over-year growth in the most recent quarter. Analysts at Goldman on Tuesday raised their price target on Micron's stock to $205 from $180, though they maintained their hold recommendation. The analysts wrote in a note to clients that due to \"continued pricing momentum\" in memory, they \"expect healthy upside to Street estimates\" when Micron reports quarterly results in two weeks.A Micron spokesperson declined to comment on whether the move would result in layoffs.\"Micron intends to reduce impact on team members due to this business decision through redeployment opportunities into existing open positions within the company,\" the company said in its release.WATCH: Winners and losers from surge in prices for memory chipswatch now",

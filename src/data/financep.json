    "body": "Among Americans' favorite romantic comedies are \"Pretty Woman,\" \"Sleepless in Seattle\" and \"Sixteen Candles,\" according to a series of 2023 YouGov polls.In those and the many romcoms like them, the plot is fairly simple: The female lead pines after a man, they end up together, often after a series of kooky encounters. The end. The trope echoes a long-held belief about male-female dynamics.\"There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men,\" says Justin Lehmiller, senior research fellow at the Kinsey Institute, \"and that women would be more inclined to commit faster to a relationship.\"But a recent DatingNews.com and Kinsey Institute study of 2,000 U.S. singles refutes that claim.More than a quarter, 28.6% of men would speed up their move-in timeline in a relationship and 18.8% would marry sooner, according to the study. That's as compared to 18.8% of women who'd move in faster and 13.7% who'd marry sooner.According to Kinsey's findings, their motivating factor is financial: More men would speed up these milestones to save money.And that should come as no surprise, given the current economic climate, with job openings and hiring slowing and tariffs pushing prices higher. But, experts say there's more to it.There's kind of a stereotype out there that women want or need relationships more than men.Justin LehmillerSenior research fellow, Kinsey InstituteFor heterosexual men in particular, \"romantic relationships really become their primary source of social and emotional support,\" says Lehmiller. \"And so when men don't have that in their lives, we see that their levels of psychological well-being are lower.\"It's a trend Geoff MacDonald, scholar of singlehood and a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, knows well. MacDonald's MacLab focuses on wellbeing in singlehood and has found that women are more likely to be happy single than men.\"Women are just better at getting that kind of support through their friendships and through their family relationships,\" MacDonald says. \"Men tend to struggle with that more on their own.\"That could be as a result of cultural pressure, Lehmiller says.Traditional notions of masculinity \"restrict when and how men are able to express their emotions,\" he says. \"So they don't tend to get as close to their male friends or to have other people in their lives that they have close intimate relationships with.\"Romantic relationships help men meet those needs.Researchers aren't the only ones seeing men's eagerness to couple up. Kyle Scheinkman has been working at relationship coaching company Relationship Hero since 2018, first as a coach to clients and now as the director of coaching. The company's 100 or so coaches primarily offer services within the romantic relationship context, from relationship strengthening to help for those looking to find a partner.\"Generally speaking, men are more likely to sign up for coaching,\" he says. \"They're more likely to have more sessions and to spend more on coaching in the long run.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "description": "The longer you wait to give your child a smartphone or allow them to join social media, the happier and more successful they're likely to be as adults",
    "body": "The longer you wait to give your child a smartphone or allow them to join social media, the happier and more successful they're likely to be as adults, says psychologist Jean Twenge.To help parents facilitate that technological delay, Twenge recommends starting to teach kids how to use those technologies in safe and healthy ways at least six years in advance. Starting early helps prepare children to have healthier relationships with online technologies, aiding their development into well-adjusted, successful adults, she says.\"Ideally, it's great to have these rules in mind by the time your kids are in late elementary school, say, to be prepared. Because kids are getting these devices younger and younger,\" says Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University whose latest book, \"10 Rules for Raising Kids in a High-Tech World,\" published on September 2.In her book, Twenge recommended against social media for kids until age 16, and wrote that children shouldn't have a smartphone unless they also have a driver's license and are expected to \"get around independently.\" Her rationale: Those technologies are contributing to higher rates of mental health issues in teens, such as anxiety and depression, she wrote.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossThose statements made headlines, particularly because many U.S. parents give their kids smartphones and social media access much earlier. In one recent Pew Research Center survey, more than half of U.S. parents said their kids between the ages of 11 and 12 already had their own smartphones.If you talk with your children about how to use internet technology responsibly before they turn 10, or younger if they already regularly use internet-connected devices like laptops, you can help them understand and internalize the potential downsides of excessive smartphone and social media usage, she says.You might, for example, discuss the types of personal information you shouldn't share with anyone online, from nude pictures to personal information like a home address or Social Security Number. You could talk about the value of privacy — reminding your kids to never assume a text or Snapchat message will remain private, and to not post any information or opinions online that they wouldn't be comfortable having announced over the loudspeaker at their school.Twenge also advises teaching children that \"your time is a precious resource,\" and that they might ultimately regret spending much of their youth absorbed in a device instead of engaging with friends and family in person, she says.The idea is to hopefully set them up to have a healthier relationship with those technologies as they age, says Twenge. But these conversations alone won't guarantee success, she says — because you need to do something else, too.Initiate healthy dialogue, 'then put the parental controls in place'Twenge's other top piece of advice: Set firm rules around how your kids can use devices and the internet, once you're comfortable with them doing so.One of the rules in Twenge's book bans smartphones during the school day and overnight in kids' bedrooms. Another of her rules states that that if parents want to give their child a device, their first phone should be a \"basic\" one — a phone that isn't connected to the internet, but does allow them to make calls and send texts to their friends and family.You could also use parental controls to guide kids' initial smartphone experiences, like setting daily time limits for usage to ensure kids aren't getting sucked into social media for hours at a time, or blocking adult-themed websites and apps.\"Teach them that moderation is key — and then put the parental controls in place to make sure you're not wasting your breath,\" Twenge wrote.Whatever you do, communicate your rules directly to your children, she says.\"We're going to have that conversation [and] be very clear about what controls we're putting on that phone,\" says Twenge. \"Even when she gets that smartphone, [for] one example, we're going to block app downloads, so then if she wants to put additional apps on it, it's a discussion, rather than her just doing it unilaterally, where we don't even know what she has on it.\"If your kids already have smartphones or social media, and you're starting to regret that decision, don't feel like it's ever too late to reverse those choices, Twenge notes. Just be honest and transparent about why they're making that decision, she says: \"Look, I made a mistake. I've learned more and we're going to do it differently going forward...\"Even if your teen's initial reaction is extreme — \"You might get some slammed doors,\" she notes — stay firm and try and put everything in perspective, she suggests. \"Tell them, 'Hey, you're still going to be able to text your friends. You're still going to be able to call me. And it's this or no fun at all.' That helps put it in context.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "In 2011, I walked away from a six-figure law career and retired at age 41. I thought I was prepared financially. But emotionally? Not so much.After decades of working, I was used to the sense of purpose that came with a career, and I assumed I'd have to give that up once I stopped working. My biggest fear took the form of one major uncertainty: What would I do with all that unstructured time?Fast forward 14 years later, and my days are anything but idle. My wife and I now live in Portugal, the No. 1 country Americans want to move to. I spend my free time enjoying local food with friends and hiking the wildflower-dotted coastal trails. Retiring early is one of the best decisions I've ever made ... but I remember how overwhelming it felt at the start.Here's what I've learned so far in early retirement, and why I don't regret it.1. Uncertainty is an opportunity, not an obstacleI followed a predictable path for most of my adult life: law school, summer associate gigs, and eventually a stable legal career. Then came the 2008 financial crisis. The firm I worked for collapsed — and with it, my sense of direction. I couldn't picture myself doing anything other than practicing law.I could've stayed in the industry. But instead, I chose the unknown. Most people think early retirement is about not working anymore. But it's about redefining your identity without a roadmap. That required a mindset shift: I had to become an explorer.Ocean fog envelopes Sintra forest, within Portugal's Sintra-Cascais Natural Park, near Lisbon.Alex TriasThat mindset brought us to Portugal, a country where we didn't speak the language, didn't know anyone, and had no idea what to expect day-to-day. It was disorienting at first. But the uncertainty became our motivation to grow, learn, and build a fulfilling life from scratch.If you're delaying retirement because you don't know what comes next, that might be exactly why it's worth doing. Uncertainty could be your opportunity to travel down paths you've never imagined.2. You can still get ahead financially, even without a paycheckWhen we first retired, my wife and I assumed we'd gradually draw down our savings over time and hope it would last. But something surprising happened: Our net worth kept growing.A major reason is that living in Portugal drastically reduced our expenses. Here's what we save annually compared to our old life in Washington, D.C.:$15,000 on state income taxes$25,000 on health insurance and deductibles$14,000 on property taxes$20,000 on food, entertainment, and daily costsIn total, we estimate that we save about $5,000 per month just by living abroad.We follow the same financial strategy we did while working: We live below our means, reinvest the difference, and let compounding do the work. The only difference is that now, instead of salaries, our income comes from investments.Retirement doesn't have to be the end of building wealth. It can even be the beginning of a more sustainable, intentional version of it.3. Finding purpose in retirement is just as important as finding it in your careerWhether you're working or not, most of us want the same thing: to feel like we matter and are making a contribution.Coastal event collides against the rocks at Guincho beach, located on Portugal's Estoril coast.Alex TriasWhen we first retired, we had a built-in sense of purpose as parents to a young child. We joined school activities, studied the local language, and built a new life in Lisbon.But when our daughter went off to college, we were back to square one. Our schedules emptied out, and we faced the same question we did in 2011: What do we do with all this time?Before diving into hobbies or commitments, we made a plan. We identified six core priorities that bring meaning to our lives:Building and strengthening friendshipsPersonal care and physical healthQuality time as a coupleTravelVolunteer work and giving backLearning new skillsOnce we had those priorities in place, it became easier to build a routine that felt fulfilling.Today, my wife volunteers at our tennis club, takes pottery and Dutch lessons, and plays sports. I'm focused on writing, freelance retirement coaching, and helping a local nonprofit as a consultant. We host dinner parties, explore new recipes, and take short trips around Europe.With the right mindset, early retirement can be the perfect new starting point. You just have to be willing to embrace it.Alex Trias is a retired attorney. He and his wife have been living in Portugal since 2015.

    "body": "More travelers are heading to the mountains: Big Sky, Montana was named the top trending travel destination for 2026, according to a new report from Expedia, Hotels.com and Vrbo.The report ranks 10 global destinations on the rise based on increased flight and accommodation searches on Expedia from 24,000 global travelers over the last year.Big Sky, the Rocky Mountains town an hour's drive from Yosemite, may seems like it \"came out of nowhere,\" but it's \"long been known for world-class outdoor recreation, skiing and snowboarding in the winter and hiking, mountain biking and rafting in the summer,\" says Melanie Fish, travel expert for Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. Also adding to its charm are an evolving dining scene, growth in family-friendly offerings, community events and cultural activities, she tells CNBC Make It.Here are the top 10 hotspots for travelers in the coming year and how much search interest has risen from 2024:Big Sky, Montana, USA: 92% increaseOkinawa, Japan: 71% increaseSardinia, Italy: 63% increasePhu Quoc, Vietnam: 53% increaseSavoie, France: 51% increaseFort Walton Beach, Florida, USA: 45% increaseUcluelet, Canada: 44% increaseCotswolds, U.K.: 39% increaseSan Miguel de Allende, Mexico: 30% increaseHobart, Australia: 25% increaseOkinawa, a chain of islands with a subtropical climate in southern Japan, is the No. 2 trending destination for 2026, per Expedia searches.Travel to Japan surged in recent years thanks to a weak yen and lifted Covid restrictions, but some cities like Kyoto have introduced so-called tourist taxes to curb overcrowding. Meanwhile, Expedia recognized Okinawa for meeting its \"Smart Travel Health Check\" framework, aligned with World Travel and Tourism Council principles, for the region's efforts to offer cultural and natural experiences without the overcrowding seen in many major global cities.\"Expedia doesn't feel like it should or could be the arbiter of where travelers should visit or should want to visit, but we do play a role in informing travelers of what's happening in the places that they're making plans to travel to,\" Fish says about recognizing places that support sustainable travel practices.Kabira Bay, Ishigaki, Okinawa, Japan. The bay forms part of the Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park.Sean Pavone | Istock | Getty Images\"What we see in Okinawa is that they are taking proactive environmental measures like coral reef restoration, they're moving towards a decarbonized economy by using renewable energy sources,\" Fish says. \"They're celebrating local heritage and making sure visitors have educational opportunities.\"Rounding out the top three is Sardinia, another rising destination beyond hotspots like Rome, Florence or Venice. The island is the Mediterranean's second-largest after Sicily and is sometimes referred to as \"the Maldives of Europe\" because of its beaches.Parts of the region are considered a \"Blue Zone,\" an area of the world where people tend to live exceptionally long lives, thanks to healthy lifestyle habits, access to fresh food, and focuses on strong social ties and spirituality.\"Sardinia is going to take a little bit more effort to get to than the destinations that we are so familiar with, like Rome and Florence,\" Fish says, but travelers are finding it worthwhile to enjoy the island's beaches, food and diverse landscapes.\"There are beautiful coastlines, but then there's a mountainous interior, and then those charming towns,\" she says. \"That's really the trifecta of what travelers are looking for.\"Photo taken in Bosa, Oristano, Sardinia, Italy.Ellen Van Bodegom | Moment | Getty Images",

It has a portfolio of beverage brands, including Keurig, Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, Mott's, A&W, Penafiel, Snapple, 7UP, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, GHOST, Clamato, Core Hydration and The Original Donut Shop, as well as the Keurig brewing system.

Its U.S. coffee segment is a manufacturer and distributor of single-serve brewers, specialty coffee (including hot and iced varieties), and ready-to-drink coffee. Its international segment includes sales in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and other international markets.Stock Market Value: $36.11 billion ($26.59 per share)Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKeurig Dr Pepper stock performance year to dateActivist: Starboard ValueOwnership: n/aAverage Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Starboard is a very successful activist investor and has extensive experience helping companies focus on operational efficiency and margin improvement. They are known for their excellent diligence and for running many of the most successful campaigns. Starboard has taken a total of 161 prior activist campaigns in their history and has an average return of 21.49% versus 13.81% for the Russell 2000 over the same period.What's happeningStarboard has taken a position in Keurig Dr Pepper and has held meetings with the company's management.Behind the scenesKeurig Dr Pepper is a leading North American beverage company. The core of the company is its U.S. refreshment beverage segment (63.9% of revenue), which includes the manufacturing and distribution of branded concentrates, syrups, and finished beverages. The U.S. coffee segment (22.77%) includes goods relating to Keurig pods, single-serve brewers and accessories, with the remaining revenue deriving from the international segment (13.33%). In January 2018, Dr Pepper Snapple Group and Keurig Green Mountain announced a merger, providing investors unique exposure to the fastest growing hot and cold beverage markets and their respective retail channels. However, this merger did not come without its challenges, including certain synergistic uncertainties. Moreover, as a result of the merger, JAB Holdings — the owner of Keurig — became the majority owner of the combined company, reducing Dr Pepper shareholders to a minority stake of just 13%, and flooding KDP's board with JAB affiliates. This dynamic changed earlier this year when three JAB-affiliated directors resigned following a series of divestures that reduced JAB's ownership to below 10% — now 4.4% following an additional block sale.As JAB began to turn over control and shareholders regained influence, investors began to advocate for a reseparation of the beverage and coffee assets. And management has responded — though not in the way shareholders expected — announcing a merger with coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, followed by a separation of the beverage and coffee assets, now including both Keurig and Peet's in the coffee business. Coincidentally, or not so coincidentally, JAB owns a controlling 68% stake in JDE Peet's. The move shocked investors and sent KDP shares down 25% upon the announcement. It is not that shareholders don't want a separation, but more the structure and negative consequences of the transaction as structured. The logical way to have accomplished this would have been through a spin out of the coffee business by KDP into JDE Peet's using a tax-free Reverse Morris Trust. This would be simpler, economically better for shareholders and make more sense since Keurig is smaller than Peet's. Instead, KDP structured it as an all-cash acquisition with a large premium and using an $18.5 billion loan to finance it, causing a projected leverage-to-earnings ratio of greater than 5x in 2026. Just as the Reverse Morris Trust would have been favorable to KDP shareholders, the structure ultimately agreed upon was as favorable, if not more, to JAB.Starboard has entered this engagement in an unusual position. In the case of a pending strategic transaction, we typically see activists emerge where they can help influence or block a bad deal for shareholders. But that is not happening here — this is a cash deal, leaving KDP shareholders without a vote. Starboard certainly has had extensive success operationally and from a board level with consumer and retail companies, including Kenvue, Papa John's and Darden Restaurants, and we can see them adding significant value here. But the better analogy may be to Starboard's prior engagement in Ritchie Bros Auctioneer, now RB Global. In that engagement, Starboard also became involved shortly after the company's announced merger with IAA – a deal met with similar shareholder opposition. Starboard entered into a $500 million securities purchase agreement with the company that removed certain roadblocks and opposition to the merger, allowing it to consummate. Importantly, Starboard was also granted a board seat for its CEO Jeff Smith, restoring a great deal of investor confidence in the company. By the time Smith resigned from RBA's board less than two years later, the company's stock had more than doubled.Given this track record, Starboard's involvement at KDP likely reflects a similar constructive approach, seeking board representation through amicable settlement, leveraging the fund's expertise to help guide KDP behind the scenes through this inflection point and helping restore investor confidence among this rightfully skeptical shareholder base. Moreover, given the recent decline in KDP's share price, Starboard likely sees this entry as an opportunity to invest at a compelling discount, similar to RBA, where short-term merger headwinds could provide significant upside for long-term and value-oriented shareholders like Starboard. KDP's nomination deadline is not until February, but we do not think that will be relevant here as meetings have already taken place between Starboard and management and we expect an amicable resolution before then.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "It was 95 degrees when the first prototype of a Norwegian Wool jacket arrived at Michael Berkowitz's apartment in The Bronx, New York, in August 2014.Needing to test the waterproof knee-length wool coat without getting heat stroke, the founder and CEO of the then-fledgling apparel brand took it to a supermarket in West Harlem. \"[I] paced back and forth for 30 minutes in a walk-in freezer\" to evaluate its lining for warmth, recalls Berkowitz, 38. \"It's New York, so no one stops you, no one asks you. My face was cold by the end, but my body was totally warm. I remember thinking, 'OK, we're on to something.'\"At the time, Berkowitz was a commodities trader hoping to launch his own business. Today, Norwegian Wool's coats adorn the shoulders of billionaires, actors, politicians and financiers — at campaign events, during the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and in a Season 3 episode of HBO's \"Succession.\" The apparel brand was profitable in 2024, and has been for seven out of the last eight years, Berkowitz says.DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to starting a business—everything you need to know to be your own bossBerkowitz declined to share other financials, citing competitive pressure — but says his company's products are now sold in more than 100 stores worldwide, including Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, Nordstrom and his appointment-only New York showroom.The appeal of Norwegian Wool coats is part form, part function. Financiers are expected to dress a certain way, but the classic wool Italian coats most of them wear aren't designed for sub-40-degree weather, says Berkowitz.\"If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done,\" he says.Norwegian Wool's bestselling mid-length Euro Coats currently range from $1,545 to $2,945 each, depending on the type of wool used. The brand sells other lengths and styles, including blazers, sport coats, rain and ski jackets, and a variety of winter coat options and accessories for men and women. Roughly 40 billionaires have purchased Norwegian Wool coats, Berkowitz estimates.A luxury startup with modest rootsBerkowitz had the idea for Norwegian Wool while shivering on a subway platform with a friend in 2013, he says. \"I told him, 'I need a coat that looks good, that I could wear to work, that will actually keep me warm,'\" Berkowitz remembers. \"He put his arm on my shoulders, like, 'Dude, when you find it, get me one, too.'\"After doing some research, Berkowitz identified a simple culprit, he says: Many fashionable coats are designed in parts of Italy where the air rarely freezes. The average January temperature in Florence, for example, is roughly 40 degrees Fahrenheit — compared to 30 degrees in New York and 25 degrees in Chicago.Companies based in Canada and Scandinavia make warmer coats for harsher winters, but as one designer told him, the two industries \"don't talk to each other,\" he says.Norwegian Wool's showroom, located in New York's Midtown neighborhoodNorwegian WoolBerkowitz spent months flying to Italy and back to meet and woo factory owners, who'd ship prototypes to his apartment. He ultimately spent $250,000 — $50,000 of his own money and a $200,000 investment from the former CFO of his company, who'd heard about Berkowitz's efforts from a colleague — to sample the prototypes and order an initial run of 200 coats, he says.On nights, weekends and vacation days, Berkowitz carted those coats — one on his body and two in a small suitcase — to family-owned luxury stores across the U.S., he says. He often pitched directly to sales associates, who knew their clients' shared dilemma of wanting to feel warm while looking nice in a luxury coat, he says.He sold all 200 coats in three months and resigned from his day job in early 2015, he says.\"I didn't sleep much that year,\" says Berkowitz, adding that by day, he tried to hide his efforts to avoid jeopardizing his job. According to his former boss Alan Kestenbaum, now the CEO of New York-based holding company Bedrock Industries, he only ever came across as a \"street smart\" and eager employee who was \"the first to arrive and the last to leave.\"Like 'dipping your hand into warm butter'In 2017, Berkowitz landed his first partnership to sell coats at a major department store. The following year, Norwegian Wool participated in two fundraising rounds, both seven-figure deals with private investors, Berkowitz says. He remains the company's majority owner, he notes.Norwegian Wool coats are generally more expensive than Canada Goose parkas, and less pricey than cashmere coats from established Italian luxury brands like Loro Piana. But the quality of its materials is high, says \"Succession\" costume director Jon Schwartz: Norwegian Wool's cashmere feels like \"dipping your hand into warm butter.\"Berkowitz's dream for Norwegian Wool is a reputation akin to Range Rover cars — known worldwide for a blend of style and functionality, he says. He plans to add more product lines, invest in marketing and host pop-up retail events to improve the brand's visibility, he adds. Already, he's overheard Norwegian Wool come up in organic conversations, even when nobody realizes the brand's founder is in earshot, he says.If you show up wearing a [puffer coat] that looks like you're going to the Arctic, but it's only 40 degrees, you do not look like the person that's going to be able to break through walls and get a deal done.Michael BerkowitzFounder and CEO, Norwegian WoolAnd as someone squarely within Norwegian Wool's target demographic — businesspeople who want to make an impression with their appearance during cold winters, he says — he still tests many of the company's prototypes himself.Berkowitz outfitted himself and his friends with not-yet-released parkas for a February ski trip in the Alps. He brought a sample of a recently released bamboo blazer to Paris in September, tossing it on top of his rolling suitcase and into the plane's overhead bin to test it for wrinkling and pilling, he says.\"I test things out going to my office in Midtown or in vacation to the Alps,\" says Berkowitz. \"It doesn't matter where it is, as much as how I'm wearing it. It has to be representative of how our customers would wear it.\"Want to stand out, grow your network, and get more job opportunities? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How to Build a Standout Personal Brand: Online, In Person, and At Work.

Swiss private markets firm Partners Group fell 3.4%, as Sweden's EQT was down 4.6%.The moves follow a widespread sell-off among U.S. regional banks this week, as fears grow over risky lending practices potentially spilling over from the private credit market into the broader banking space.ICG manages more than $30 billion in private debt assets, about 25% of its total asstes under management as of late June. Partners Group manages $38 billion in private credit and CVC's private credit business, which focuses on direct lending opportunities, manages about 17 billion euros ($19.9 billion).Credit quality has come into sharper focus in recent weeks following U.S. car parts maker First Brands' implosion and the subprime auto lender Tricolor's bankruptcy. Investment bank Jefferies, which had exposure to First Brands, closed down 11% on Thursday before rebounding Friday.While First Brands' collapse stemmed mainly from its complex borrowing arrangements within the supply-chain financing and invoice receivables space, the debacle has spotlighted broader concerns over increased leverage and potentially lax credit standards.J.P.

We as regulators, we have to take a close look at it.\"Meanwhile, Tobias Adrian, director of the IMF's Monetary and Capital Markets Department, said the group is now keeping closer tabs on non-bank financial intermediaries, particularly in the private credit space.\"This leverage is probably resilient, but of course, we are watching underwriting standards very closely,\" Adrian told CNBC's Tso.watch now",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersTop proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services is recommending that Tesla investors vote against a pay plan for CEO Elon Musk that would grant him nearly $1 trillion more in stock.The \"mega performance equity award\" to Musk, designed to retain the CEO long-term, \"has an astronomical grant value conditioned upon far-reaching performance targets that, if achieved, would create enormous value for shareholders,\" ISS wrote on Friday.Tesla's 2025 annual shareholder meeting and proxy vote is scheduled for Nov. 5. The company is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Wednesday. ISS said that while some shareholders may support the pay plan, \"there are unmitigated concerns surrounding the special award's magnitude and design.\"Musk's plan, if approved, would be the largest ever awarded to a public company CEO. It could could net Musk up to an additional 12% stake in Tesla, should the company hit a market cap of $8.5 trillion and achieve other goals.Tesla disagreed with the ISS recommendations.In a post on X, which is owned by Musk, the automaker accused ISS of missing \"fundamental points of investing and governance,\" and complained that the advisors had previously \"recommended against compensation that shareholders have voted on twice before (and that Elon has already earned), as well as the 2025 CEO Performance Award (where Elon receives nothing unless shareholders win big).\"The company urged shareholders to vote with the board's recommendations on all proposals on the 2025 proxy.ISS previously advised investors to reject a \"ratification\" of Musk's 2018 CEO pay package, which was worth an estimated $56 billion at the time.The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 pay plan had been improperly granted by the Tesla board and must be rescinded. The ruling said Tesla hid crucial details from shareholders that they were entitled to before voting, and that Musk had controlled the board.Musk has appealed that court's decision to the Delaware State Supreme Court, with opening arguments in the appeal heard by a panel of judges this week.Representatives for ISS declined to comment beyond the report.ISS, along with Glass Lewis and smaller peers, can influence how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Musk accused ISS and Glass Lewis in 2023 of effectively controlling the stock market because of their influence with passive or index funds in some matters. He also baselessly compared ISS to a terrorist organization.Musk will be able to vote his own shares in the vote concerning his future pay. He holds at least 13.5% of Tesla's voting power, according to the most recent available disclosures on his stake. Those holdings alone could be enough to secure approval for the nearly $1 trillion pay package.In September, Musk added to his ownership of Tesla stock buying another $1 billion worth of shares.Among other ISS recommendations, the firm also suggested that shareholders should vote against giving Tesla's board authorization to invest in xAI, the AI company that Musk started in March 2023 but only disclosed publicly in July that year. Tesla has sold tens of millions of dollars worth of its Megapack battery energy storage systems to xAI.ISS also recommended against voting to reinstate Tesla board member Ira Ehrenpreis, a longstanding and close friend of Musk.In May, Tesla changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue for a breach of fiduciary duties so that only a shareholder that owns at least 3% of the company's stock can bring what's called a \"derivative\" action. Ehrenpreis presided over Tesla's governance committee at the time that change was made without a shareholder vote.WATCH: Former Tesla board member says it's hard to argue with valuationwatch now",

    "body": "If you or your child are hoping to attend college anytime soon, cost is likely top of mind. Top schools continue to increase tuition while many young adults fall deeper and deeper into debt. By the second quarter of this year, outstanding U.S. student loan debt topped $1.8 trillion, according to the Education Data Initiative.To keep costs down, prospective students could ideally win several scholarships. But that can be easier said than done.However, Carlynn Greene has done it — and she suspects you can too.Greene won 30 scholarships to attend both undergraduate and graduate school at the University of North Texas, graduating with no debt and degrees in broadcast journalism and public relations, advertising and applied communication.She's put those skills to use, working as a full-time content creator and the founder of Scholarship Guru, through which she's helped clients secure millions of dollars in scholarship awards.\"There are a lot of mistakes people make when it comes to scholarships,\" Greene says. Among the biggest, she says, is failing to put your best foot forward to in your essay.\"I always tell my students that you want to try and approach it as if you were marketing yourself, because a lot of the principles that we learn from marketing can be applied to scholarships,\" she says. \"Because you're trying to convince someone as to why they should invest in your education over someone else that's competing against you.\"Here's what Greene sees as the most common mistakes applicants run into when applying for scholarships — and how you can avoid them.1. Focusing on national scholarshipsIt's going to be hard for anyone — no matter how strong their essay — to stand out amid an enormous applicant pool, Greene says.\"Nine times out of 10, when people are starting out, they're applying for the ones that have very broad eligibility,\" she says. And while these national scholarships can come with five- or six-figure rewards, \"you are much more likely to win scholarships that are local, state level and also ones that I like to call intersectionality scholarships.\"By that, she means awards with multiple criteria that may describe you, including race, gender, geographic location and area of study. \"That will narrow down the competition pool,\" she says.2. Not treating yourself like a hot commodityGreene recommends imbuing your application materials with concepts from the world of marketing: scarcity and urgency. In essence, how are you or your academic goals unique — and why should you receive funding now?A medical student, for instance, may want to highlight that they plan to specialize in treating a rare and deadly disease, Greene says.\"If you find relevant data, like from a news article or research article that points this out and highlights it, that would communicate to the audience, the judges, that investing in your education makes more sense, as opposed to someone who perhaps is going into, let's say, plastic surgery,\" she says.3. Only applying to a handful of scholarshipsIt can be easy to get discouraged if you fail to win scholarships you were hoping for, but Greene says it can be a numbers game, even for excellent applicants.\"I won 30 scholarships, but I applied for a little over 100,\" she says. \"I've had another student, she won 20 scholarships. She applied for a little over 200. So it just depends.\"In addition to her website, Greene recommends using online tools such as Bold.org and Going Merry to find scholarships that meet your criteria and that you can apply for in bulk.Overall, for an average student, Greene recommends applying for anywhere from 100 to 200 scholarships.\"It can seem overwhelming, but when you compare it to even applications in the job market now, a lot of people are applying for hundreds of jobs,\" she says.Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZions, 5 dayThe credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWestern Alliance, 5-dayThat caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

    "body": "George Santos, who was expelled from the U.S. House of Representatives, arrives for the sentencing in his criminal corruption charges at Central Islip Federal Courthouse in Central Islip, New York, U.S., April 25, 2025.Shannon Stapleton | ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Friday evening said he has commuted the prison sentence of George Santos, releasing the disgraced former Republican congressman immediately.Santos \"was somewhat of a 'rogue,' but there are many rogues throughout our Country that aren't forced to serve seven years in prison,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.Santos was sentenced to 87 months in federal prison this year after pleading guilty to committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He began serving his sentence in late July.The 37-year-old New York representative served in the House for less than a year before he was expelled from Congress under a cloud of scandal in December 2023.Even before he was sworn in, Santos admitted lying about key details of his life on the campaign trail. While in Congress, he was charged by the Department of Justice with an array of federal crimes, including fraud, theft, money laundering and making false statements.Trump's decision to commute Santos' sentence came after multiple friends and allies of the imprisoned ex-politician made appeals for his clemency, a senior White House official told NBC News on Friday evening.Trump had also recently read Santos' writings from prison describing his living conditions, the official told NBC.In a flattery-filled letter published Monday in local Long Island news outlet The South Shore Press, Santos directly asked Trump for clemency.\"You have always been a man of second chances, a leader who believes in redemption and renewal,\" Santos wrote. \"I am asking you now, from the depths of my heart, to extend that same belief to me.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageIllinois Gov.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who weathered heavy criticism during his 2010 Senate campaign for saying he had \"served in Vietnam\" when he had never been deployed there.Trump had said earlier in October that Blumenthal \"should be investigated, and Justice should be sought.\" The attack came hours after Attorney General Pam Bondi, in a combative and politically charged Senate hearing, directly accused Blumenthal of lying about his military record.Blumenthal said in 2010 that he had misspoken about his service on multiple occasions. On CNN last week, the senator said Trump's accusations are \"completely deceptive and distorted.\"Trump did not serve in the military after receiving five draft deferments during the Vietnam War.Trump wrote Friday that Blumenthal's record \"is far worse than what George Santos did, and at least Santos had the Courage, Conviction, and Intelligence to ALWAYS VOTE REPUBLICAN!\"\"George has been in solitary confinement for long stretches of time and, by all accounts, has been horribly mistreated,\" Trump wrote.\"Therefore, I just signed a Commutation, releasing George Santos from prison, IMMEDIATELY. Good luck George, have a great life!\"Santos' attorney confirmed Santos was released from Federal Correctional Institution Fairton in New Jersey at 11 a.m. ET on Saturday.",

    "body": "As the global market for secondhand luxury items surges, authentication has become the defining factor separating credible platforms from the rest.The resale market for fashion and luxury items is expanding at an annual rate of 10%, three times faster than the firsthand market, according to a report released Oct. 9 by Boston Consulting Group and luxury resale platform Vestiaire Collective.The report projects the global resale market could reach up to $360 billion by 2030, from about $210 billion today.With more shoppers buying pre-owned designer brands, trust has become paramount. \"As counterfeit manufacturing becomes increasingly sophisticated, even luxury brands themselves sometimes fail to detect fakes, in some cases, unknowingly repairing counterfeit items,\" said Jaewha Choi, CEO of South Korean online marketplace Bunjang.Horror stories abound online of people paying thousands for fake Hermès bags or a Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches with swapped parts. Some counterfeits are so convincing they are dubbed \"superfakes,\" reportedly made with materials from the same leather suppliers as the original brands.Buyer bewareHowever, as the resale market expands, authentication has become a growing concern. The secondhand industry has long operated under the rule of \"caveat emptor,\" or buyer beware.To counter increasingly realistic \"superfakes,\" resale platforms are pouring resources into verification. Singapore-based online marketplace Carousell opened its first brick-and-mortar store for luxury items in downtown Singapore this year, allowing sellers to have their items graded by one of the company's appraisers before listing them for resale.The verification team inspects not only the material of a bag but also details like stitching and stamping, Tresor Tan, Director of Sales, Marketing and Client Relations at Carousell Luxury, told CNBC.\"At the end of the day, it's our reputation at stake as well,\" Tan said. \"And because of that confidence, we also offer our buyers a money-back guarantee on authenticity.\"watch nowThe company has built a proprietary database covering almost 500 product styles, and higher-valued items go through multiple checks. In cases where the authenticity is in doubt, the items will not be listed, Tan said.South Korea's Bunjang has also followed in the same vein, developing its own proprietary authentication system that combines traditional visual inspections with scientific equipment and artificial intelligence \"trained on hundreds of thousands of data points,\" Choi told CNBC.Bunjang claims a 99.9% authentication accuracy rate in identifying genuine goods, and its verification system can continuously learn and adapt to counterfeiting methods by leveraging AI.Trust fuels salesBoth Carousell and Bunjang said verification has boosted business.Bunjang said luxury goods now make up more than a quarter of its platform's $1.1 billion in annual gross merchandise value. Transactions and total value for luxury goods rose 30% year on year in the first half of 2025, Choi said.Carousell's Tan did not disclose specific figures but said the luxury segment has seen \"very strong interest\" and has recorded \"great growth.\"This growth that began with Carousell's 2012 launch as an online platform eventually led to the opening of its first physical store.\"When someone is buying and selling a $100,000 watch on the platform, it definitely catches our attention,\" she said, saying that users wanted Carousell's oversight in high-value transactions.Along with its verification process, the store also offers a money-back guarantee for its products. Tan said that while prices may not always be the lowest in the market, the store aims to offer \"fair value.\"\"We may be, say, $200 more expensive than what someone else is offering, but [consumers] will still ultimately weigh the different options for $200 savings,\" she said. \"Am I better off with a bit of assurance?\"Next wave of luxury consumersAffordability is the top reason for buying secondhand luxury items, cited by 80% of respondents, according to BCG's report.But it's not just about saving money. Shoppers are increasingly drawn to rare or discontinued collections that are no longer available in stores, Samantha Virk, Chief Marketing Officer and U.S. CEO of Vestiaire Collective, told CNBC.\"These motivations are getting stronger across the board as compared to surveys in previous years, showing that secondhand shopping is becoming a deeply ingrained part of how people engage with fashion today,\" Virk said.watch nowYounger shoppers, with their limited spending power, prefer to buy, enjoy and quickly resell items, Bunjang's Choi said.\"This remarkable growth reflects a fundamental shift in how Millennials and Gen Z, the next wave of luxury consumers, perceive and engage with luxury goods.\"",

    "body": "Boeing 737 Max aircraft are assembled at the company’s plant in Renton, Washington, U.S. June 25, 2024.Jennifer Buchanan | Via ReutersBoeing has won regulator approval to ramp up production of its best-selling 737 Max jetliners to 42 a month, a milestone for the manufacturer nearly two years after the Federal Aviation Administration capped its output after a midair near-catastrophe.In January 2024, the FAA restricted Boeing to building the planes at a rate of no more than 38 a month — though it had been below that level at the time — after a door plug from a nearly new 737 Max 9 blew off from an Alaska Airlines flight as it climbed out of Portland, Oregon.Boeing failed to reinstall key bolts on the door plug before it left the factory, a National Transportation Safety Board report found. The 737 Max returned and landed safely, but it put the company back into crisis mode just as leaders were expecting a turnaround year.The FAA said Friday that it would still oversee Boeing's production. \"FAA safety inspectors conducted extensive reviews of Boeing's production lines to ensure that this small production rate increase will be done safely,\" the agency said in a statement.Boeing said it would work with its suppliers to increase production.\"We appreciate the work by our team, our suppliers and the FAA to ensure we are prepared to increase production with safety and quality at the forefront,\" Boeing said Friday in a statement.Read more CNBC airline newsAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit Airlines on track for a $475 million bankruptcy lifeline'Seconds count': Avoiding airplane collisions at airports could come down to cockpit alertsU.S. startup airline Breeze Airways plans first international flightsAn increase in output is key to the company's turnaround after years of problems, since airlines and other customers pay for the bulk of an aircraft when they receive it. CEO Kelly Ortberg, named last year to stabilize the top U.S. manufacturer, said last month he expected to soon win FAA approval to raise output to 42, with other increases planned for down the line.\"We'll go from 42 and then we'll go up another five, and we'll go up another five,\" Ortberg told a Morgan Stanley investor conference in September. \"We'll get to where that inventory is more balanced with the supply chain, probably around the 47 a month production rate.\"The change shows the FAA's softening tone and increased confidence in Boeing after years of restrictions. Last month, the agency said it would allow Boeing to again sign off on some of its aircraft itself before they're handed over to customers, instead of that responsibility falling solely with the FAA.The Max program was crippled following two crashes of the planes in 2018 and 2019, which killed all 346 people on the two flights. The aircraft was grounded for nearly two years. Covid also hurt production, followed by supply chain problems and, last year, a labor strike at Boeing's main factories in the Seattle area.Boeing hasn't posted an annual profit since 2018. But it has increased output, and its deliveries of new planes are on track to hit the highest rate since that year.Boeing is scheduled to release quarterly results on Oct. 29.— CNBC's Phil LeBeau and Meghan Reeder contributed to this report.",

    "body": "A demo setup of racks of AI servers connected with Credo cables, displayed at the Open Compute Summit in San Jose, California.CredoIn July, Elon Musk posted photos from inside an xAI data center called Colossus 2, which the artificial intelligence startup aims to turn into a massive supercomputing facility in Memphis, Tennessee.Musk's pictures, posted to his X feed, didn't show off the pricey Nvidia racks that are filled with powerful graphics processing units. Rather, he focused on the wires behind the servers, including one image with thousands of neatly organized purple cables connecting the computers together.Those purple cables are the signature offering of Credo, a 17-year-old Silicon Valley-based semiconductor company whose name rarely gets mentioned alongside the leaders of the AI boom.But Wall Street has taken notice.Credo shares have more than doubled this year to $143.61 after soaring 245% in 2024. The company's market cap, which was about $1.4 billion at the time of its IPO in 2022, now sits at close to $25 billion. Credo is angling to position itself as a key supplier in the trillion-dollar AI infrastructure expansion, and is benefiting as the money flows downstream.The stock jumped 5% on Friday after analysts at JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage with the equivalent of a buy rating and a $165 stock price. They said the active electrical cable (AEC) market, which Credo pioneered, is on pace to hit $4 billion by 2028, as all the major hyperscalers invest in data center buildouts.\"The industry outlook is supported by increasing deployments from major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and xAI as well as broadening adoption, including Meta and more,\" the analysts wrote. They predict annualized revenue growth for Credo of at least 50% through 2028.watch nowRevenue in fiscal 2025, which ended in early May, more than doubled to $436.8 million. The company also turned profitable, recording net income of $52.2 million after losing $28.4 million the prior year. Analysts are expecting sales to more than double again in fiscal 2026 to almost $1 billion, according to LSEG.Credo's purple AECs cost between $300 and $500 each, depending on bulk discounts and other negotiations, according to an estimate from the 650 Group, an industry researcher. They are sturdy, moderately thick copper cables wrapped in a braided covering with big connectors containing chips on each side.Much of the excitement around Credo is driven by the AI boom, which to this point has been driven by a handful of hyperscalers that are rapidly building data centers for future expected workloads. Analysts expect $1 trillion in spending on AI data centers by 2030, but any pullback from the major cloud providers or scaling back in OpenAI's plans could hurt many suppliers, including Credo.For now, projections are way up and to the right.Expanding opportunityPrevious servers typically had one or two processors on a motherboard. Individual servers today can have up to eight, and the most powerful AI models require potentially millions of GPUs all working together as one.Each GPU needs its own connection to the switch, the term for a computer that routes data around the cluster, often mounted on the top of a server rack.Nvidia's latest products slot several of these boards together to comprise a system with 72 GPUs. Next year's fastest racks will have twice as many, and the following year, a Kyber rack will have 572 GPUs, Nvidia says.\"In the past, Credo's opportunity was one cable per server, but now Credo's opportunity is nine cables per server,\" said Alan Weckel, an analyst at 650 Group. He estimates that Credo has 88% of the market for AECs, which are also made by Astera Labs and Marvell.Many GPUs are connected by fiber optic cables powered by components made by companies like Broadcom and Coherent. AECs offer an alternative to fiber optic cables. They have chips called digital signal processors on both sides that use sophisticated algorithms to pull data out of the cable, enabling much longer lengths than traditional copper cables. Credo's longest AEC is seven meters long.Credo CEO Bill Brennan, who joined the company in 2013, told CNBC that hyperscalers are choosing his company's cables because they're more reliable than fiber optic cables. He said customers are trying to avoid what's called a \"link flap,\" where one part of an AI cluster goes offline because the optical cable connecting them fails, costing hours of pricey GPU time.\"It can literally shut down an entire data center,\" Brennan said.He said Credo is increasingly working with hyperscalers in the early stages of planning large AI clusters, especially as some designs become denser, allowing more servers to be connected by shorter cables.\"When you connect with these hyperscalers, the numbers are very large,\" Brennan said.Credo's AEC leadership team, Hal Hawthorne, Don Barnetson, Ameet Suri, and Ryan Cai.Corey Bentley, CredoThe company doesn't name its hyperscaler clients, but analysts have cited Amazon and Microsoft as customers. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman posted an image on LinkedIn of the company's Trainium AI chip racks on Friday that appeared to show Credo's purple cables.Credo says it expects three or four customers to make up more than 10% of revenue each in the coming quarters, including two new hyperscale customers this year.Amazon and Microsoft declined to comment. Meta and xAI didn't respond to requests for comment.At a conference for data center professionals in San Jose this week, Credo presented alongside a representative from Oracle Cloud. An example rack of Nvidia GPUs designed by Meta displayed at the show prominently featured Credo's purple cables.\"Every time you see a new announcement of a gigawatt data center, you can rest assured that we view that as an opportunity,\" Brennan told investors on an earnings call in September.It's a market that everyone in AI networking is targeting.Analysts at TD Cowen estimated earlier this month that the market for AI networking chips could be worth $75 billion per year by 2030. Major players include Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, which both have their own networking businesses and have the power to dictate which technologies are part of their broader systems.'Insatiable demand'Credo was founded in 2008 by a group of ex-Marvell engineers, who developed chips for a relatively arcane technology called SerDes, which is used for high-speed chip-to-chip connections.Brennan's job, when he joined in 2013, was to commercialize the technology. The company raised its first round of venture funding in 2015 from investors including Walden International, which was run by Lip-Bu Tan, now Intel's CEO.Christina Locopo | CNBCThe AEC business didn't take off until the AI boom in the early 2020s, because data centers didn't yet need its technology, Brennan said.However, there was early excitement in the air when Musk's car company came knocking in 2017. Tesla wanted help with its Dojo AI supercomputer and needed chips with more bandwidth than what was available at the time.Now, Credo is hoping to use its foothold with its active copper cables to branch out into additional product lines, including intra-rack connections, or what's called \"scale-up\" networking. The company announced new transceivers and software for optical cables this week.\"You've got this market pull like we've never had before,\" Brennan said. \"If you could deliver the next generation right now, it would be consumed. Generation after that, it would be consumed. You've got this insatiable demand from the AI cluster world.\"WATCH: OpenAI in Abilene, Texaswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowElectricity companies across the U.S. are struggling to figure out how much demand will actually materialize from the artificial intelligence boom, as the stock market speculates that vast sums of money will be spent on infrastructure to support a big data center buildout.\"There is a question about whether or not all of the projections, if they're real,\" Willie Phillips, who served as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from 2023 until April 2025, told CNBC. \"There are some regions who have projected huge increases, and they have readjusted those back.\"The AI companies are rolling out ambitious plans to build server farms that in some cases would consume as much electricity as entire cities. But the tech industry is shopping the same big projects around to multiple utilities as they look for the quickest access to power.\"We're starting to see similar projects that look exactly to have the same footprint being requested in different regions across the country,\" GridUnity CEO Brian Fitzsimons told CNBC. GridUnity uses software to give utilities and transmission operators a clearer picture of where power projects are requesting connections across the patchwork U.S. electric grid.This data center shopping is making it difficult for utilities to determine how much power generation they will need to ensure the reliability of the electric grid. Electricity prices, meanwhile, are rising for consumers because power supply is already struggling to keep pace with demand.FERC Chairman David Rosner warned in September that the difference of a few percentage points in electricity load forecasts \"can impact billions of dollars in investments and customer bills.\"\"Put simply, we cannot efficiently plan the electric generation and transmission needed to serve new customers if we don't forecast how much energy they will need as accurately as possible,\" Rosner said.Constellation Energy CEO Joe Dominguez warned of the problem on the nuclear power operator's May earnings call: \"I just have to tell you, folks, I think the load is being overstated. We need to pump the brakes here.\"AI bubble fearsThe stock market, however, is not really pumping the brakes. The steady pace of big data center announcements is fueling one of the biggest rallies in power company stocks in two decades.The utility sector has gained about 21% this year after rallying more than 19% in 2024. The companies that supply the U.S. with electricity have gained nearly $500 billion in value over that two-year period. The last time utilities advanced more than 40% in consecutive years was in 2003 and 2004.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned in August that the stock market is facing an AI bubble, cautioning investors that they were getting \"overexcited.\"While the exact magnitude of the coming demand is uncertain, experts generally agree that the U.S. is facing a historic increase in electricity consumption after a long period of flat growth. Existing data centers point to what is coming, Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, said.watch now\"We can see it. Data centers exist,\" he said. \"They're operating day in and day out, using a lot of electricity. It used to be the case a 50 megawatt data center was pretty big. Now, it's very common to have data centers that are 20 times that size — that are a gigawatt.\"Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm, estimates 120 gigawatts of additional electricity demand by 2030. This includes 60 gigawatts from data centers based on forecasts from the utilities. To put that in perspective, 60 gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the 2024 peak hourly power demand of Italy, the world's eighth-largest economy.\"This is not a bubble,\" Fitzsimons said. \"It's going to transform our nation completely. It's going to continue to grow. We need a 50-year energy policy.\"But the utilities need to get firm financial commitments from the data centers, Gramlich said.\"That is going to help us rationalize all these requests and get a better handle on the total estimate,\" he said. \"But the industry's got to plan based on the best information we have at the moment.\"The uncertainty about demand forecasts has raised concerns that utilities could spend billions of dollars on infrastructure that is not needed in the end. The utilities spent $178 billion on grid upgrades last year and are forecasting $1.1 trillion in capital investments through 2029, according to the Edison Electric Institute.Fitzsimons said the risk of the utilities overbuilding is lower than it was two decades ago due to constraints in the market.\"They're in a very different environment where we have massive supply chain problems,\" Fitzsimons said. \"We have inflation running off the hook for quite a long time now. They can't afford to overbuild. It's going to come down to better planning.\"Infrastructure constraintsA month after warning of a bubble, Altman struck a deal with Nvidia in which OpenAI would build 10 gigawatts of data centers with the chipmaker's graphics processing units. The plan requires as much electricity as New York City during the energy intensive summer days, raising questions about whether they can actually secure the power needed.It may be possible to secure that much electricity but the AI industry is facing constraints as their plans grow larger, Gramlich said. The companies are competing for scarce infrastructure, he said, which is increasing prices for essential electrical equipment like transformers, switches and breakers.\"We really don't have the electrical infrastructure to meet the aggressive targets,\" the analyst said. \"We don't have enough generation or transmission infrastructure to meet even the modest midpoint targets.\"The question is how fast new generation can be built, he said. Natural gas turbines are largely sold out through the end of the decade. The tech industry is investing in advanced nuclear power, but these technologies are not expected to reach commercial scale until the 2030s at the earliest.Renewable energy, meanwhile, can be deployed at the quickest speed, particularly solar and battery storage. More than 90% of the power projects waiting for a grid connection right now are solar, battery storage or wind, according to August data from energy consulting firm Enverus.\"For the past 10 years, our interconnection cues have been filled with a massive percentage of renewables,\" Fitzsimons said. \"The renewables are the fastest way to build out new capacity. There's no doubt in that because of the supply chain issues we have around natural gas turbines.\"But President Donald Trump opposes solar and wind while promoting coal, natural gas and nuclear power, raising uncertainty about whether enough new generation can be built. Utilities will turn data centers away if they do not have enough power available, Gramlich said.\"If they literally do not have the power to serve a customer, they're not going to sacrifice reliability,\" Gramlich said. \"That's their core job.\"Some AI companies believe they have found a solution — just build the power at the data center off the grid, called \"behind the meter\" in industry lingo.\"We should invest in just about every possible way of generating energy,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in an interview on Oct. 8. \"Data center self-generated power could move a lot faster than putting it on the grid and we have to do that,\" he said.",

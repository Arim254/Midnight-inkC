    "body": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday reiterated his push to restrict large institutional investors from buying single-family homes, arguing that Wall Street firms have crowded out would-be homebuyers.\"You have these big companies, these big corporations, buying up thousands of homes and renting them or doing whatever they do with them,\" Trump told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview in Davos, Switzerland. \"Some of them are flipping them for a big profit, but it got to be too much. We want people to be able to buy a home.\"Trump's comments followed an executive order he signed Tuesday directing federal agencies to curb institutional investor activity in the single-family housing market. The order gives the Treasury Department 30 days to define \"large institutional investor\" and \"single-family home,\" and directs federal agencies to issue guidance within 60 days to implement restrictions, including limits on acquisitions and the sale of federally owned single-family homes to institutional investors.However, housing analysts remain skeptical, saying a lack of affordability is being driven far more by a lack of supply than by investor demand.Institutional investors are not 'market movers'While Trump said Wednesday that institutional investors are \"gobbling up all the homes,\" they make up only a small share of the U.S. housing market. Firms that own 100 or more single-family homes control roughly 2% of the nation's single-family housing stock, according to John Burns Research and Consulting.In theory, widespread and growing corporate homebuying could drive up prices and make it tougher for families to elbow their way into a competitive housing market. However, the share of home purchases by institutional investors has declined from its pandemic peak, falling from about 3% in the first quarter of 2023 to closer to 1% a year later, as higher interest rates cooled investor activity, John Burns Research and Consulting's data shows.\"The real problem is that we've added far more households than we've built single-family homes,\" Jay Parsons, an analyst who tracks rental housing and development trends, tells CNBC Make It. \"It's all about supply and demand.\"Limiting investor demand does not add new homes to the market, and many housing economists say affordability will not improve without a significant increase in supply. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research estimate the U.S. would need millions of additional homes above current construction levels to meaningfully ease price pressures.In markets where institutional investors are most concentrated, analysts say their impact on prices and rents appears limited. A 2024 analysis by Parsons found that many of the most investor-saturated markets posted rent growth below the U.S. average, a pattern he linked to higher levels of housing construction.\"Institutional investors are just not the main market movers,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute. \"It's mainly a supply issue.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Vehicles bound for shipment parked in front of the Dream Angel vehicles carrier ship at the Nagoya Port in Nagoya, Japan, on Tuesday, June 18, 2024.Fred Mery | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's exports growth in the final month of 2025 missed analysts' estimates, rising 5.1% year on year, as shipments to the U.S. saw a double-digit decline. Reuters-polled analysts had estimated exports growth would remain unchanged from November at 6.1%.  Japanese exports fell during the middle of 2025, hit by U.S. tariff worries, but saw a rebound toward the end of the year after a trade deal with the U.S. was announced that saw duties slashed to 15%. Exports to the U.S. in December, however, resumed their decline, dropping 11.1%, after an 8.8% jump in the prior month. The gain in November was the first time exports to the U.S. rose since March.Shipments to mainland China, Japan's largest trading partner, climbed 5.6%, while exports to Hong Kong surged 31.1% compared to the same period last year. Exports to the wider Asia region gained 10.2%.Imports in December rose 5.1% year on year, jumping sharply from the 1.3% rise seen in November, and beating Reuters estimates of a 3.6% rise.For full-year 2025, Japan's exports rose 3.1%, a softer rise compared to the 6.2% increase seen in 2024, as shipments to mainland China and the U.S. — Tokyo's top two trading partners — fell 0.4% and 4.1% respectively. Exports to Hong Kong and Taiwan climbed 17.8% and 15.1% for the whole year, partially offsetting declines in the U.S. and China. The trade data comes at a time when Japan is bracing for snap elections on Feb. 8 called by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, with its Lower House set to be dissolved Friday.  A victory for Takaichi will allow her to push her fiscal agenda through Japan's parliament with little opposition, analysts have said. It could also involve keeping the yen weak, as it supports Japan's exports-oriented economy.Since the announcement of the elections, Japanese markets have been fueled by the so-called \"Takaichi trade,\" that has seen stocks mostly rise, and the yen stay weak. \"[A win] poses the potential for a more expansive fiscal policy after a record draft budget was already approved for the fiscal year starting in April,\" Sam Jochim, economist at Swiss private bank EFG, said in a note on Monday.A strong win for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party could lead to a rally in Japanese equities, but trigger a sell-off in Japanese government bonds and the yen, he added.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe yen, which was around 151 against the dollar when Takaichi took power on Oct. 21 has seen a sharp decline since, hovering around the 158 level currently.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday he is nearing the end of a search to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and hinted he has his candidate in mind.In a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the president said a search that began in September and once included as many as 11 candidates is nearly over.\"I'd say we're down to three, but we're down to two. And I probably can tell you, we're down to maybe one, in my mind,\" the president said to CNBC's Joe Kernen. Still, Trump declined to name the one.The candidate list included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investors.The finalists had been widely believed to be Former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governor Christopher Waller, National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett and BlackRock fixed income head Rick Rieder. Trump in the interview said Rieder, the last to interview, is \"impressive\" and praised all the candidates.In recent days, Trump said he preferred Hassett stay at the NEC, likely eliminating him from contention. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent led the interview process. Trump in the past has expressed support for Bessent to take the Fed job, but said Wednesday, \"Scott only wants to stay where he is.\"The statement on the Fed chair is the latest in a series of dramatic twists and turns in the saga following a year of unprecedented tumult for the central bank. Though Trump criticized Powell and his colleagues heavily during his first term in office from 2017 to 2021, he ramped up the pressure considerably in 2025. That included more verbal assaults on policymakers as well as threats to fire Powell and an actual attempt to sack Governor Lisa Cook, a move that was the subject of a Supreme Court hearing earlier Wednesday on presidential authority over the institution.With Powell's removal as chair a near certainty, the next question turns to whether he'll stay on another two years to serve out his remaining term as governor. Staying on would give Powell a continued say over monetary policy and interest rates and could act a bulwark against Trump's efforts to exert control over Fed decisions. Trump indicated some indifference as to what Powell decides.\"We live with the cards you're dealt,\" he said. \"If that happens, his life won't be very, very happy, I don't think, by doing it. I think he wants to get out. He has not done a good job.\"Trump again criticized Powell for the renovation project at Fed headquarters, the price of which has run north of $2.5 billion. The Justice Department has subpoenaed Powell relative to the project.\"I could have done it for $25 million and it would have been nicer than what they're doing,\" Trump said.",

    "body": "INCHEON, SOUTH KOREA - MAY 22:  Shoppers look at goods at a Wal-Mart store May 22, 2006 in Incheon, South Korea. Chung Sung-jun | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's economic growth slowed in the final quarter of last year as a sharp slump in construction investment, coupled with a pullback in exports, outweighed modest gains in consumption.The economy expanded 1.5% in the October to December period from a year earlier, according to the central bank's advance estimates, missing economists' forecast of 1.9%. That compared with 1.8% growth in the prior quarter, when the economy expanded at its fastest pace in over a year. On a quarterly basis, gross domestic product contracted 0.3%, marking the steepest slowdown since the fourth quarter of 2022. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.1% expansion. For the full year, South Korea's economy grew 1%, its slowest annual expansion since 2020, when output contracted 0.7% during the pandemic.Construction investment shrank 3.9% from the previous quarter as both building and civil engineering activity declined, according to data from the Bank of Korea. Facilities investment fell 1.8%, led by a drop in transportation equipment. Exports pulled back 2.1% from the previous quarter as motor vehicles and machinery shipments fell. Manufacturing and utilities supply, including electricity, gas and water, dropped 1.5% and 9.2%, respectively.  Meanwhile, private consumption expanded 0.3% on services expenditures while government spending rose 0.6%, driven by health care benefits. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and his American counterpart, Donald Trump, reached a trade agreement in November that included $150 billion in Korean investment in the U.S. shipbuilding sector and an additional $200 billion in investment pledges. In exchange, the Trump administration agreed to reduce tariffs on South Korean cars and auto parts to 15% from 25%.Tariff tensions continued to cloud the outlook for the export-oriented economy. Last week, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on certain imported AI chips as part of his push to encourage semiconductor production in the U.S.U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had suggested South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers could face tariffs of up to 100% unless they commit to increased production in America.Lee on Wednesday downplayed the renewed threat of semiconductor tariffs, saying the costs would likely be passed on to American consumers.The Bank of Korea last week kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2.5%, while signaling a possible end to its current easing cycle amid geopolitical uncertainties and persistent capital outflow risks.The won has faltered more than 6% against the dollar since July last year, hovering near 16-year lows, driven in part by Korean retail investors piling into U.S. equities. Market intervention efforts, including waiving the foreign-exchange stability levy for banks, have so far failed to halt the currency's decline.Inflation remained subdued, easing to 2.1% last year from 2.3% in 2024, broadly in line with the central bank's 2% target.The Ministry of Economy and Finance last week raised its 2026 GDP forecast to 2% from its August projection of 1.8%.This is breaking news.

    "body": "A drone view shows Netflix logos on buildings in the Hollywood neighborhood in Los Angeles, California, U.S., Jan. 20, 2026. Daniel Cole | ReutersNetflix jumped into the advertising business later than its media peers, but its strategy shift is starting to pay off.This week Netflix reported its fourth-quarter earnings, which were mostly overshadowed by the company's recent pursuit to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets. However, beyond the headlines, metrics like customer engagement, subscriber numbers and advertising revenue paint a promising picture. The earnings report provided some long-awaited clarity on the progress of Netflix's advertising strategy, and how it has been factoring into the overall business. On Tuesday Netflix said 2025 advertising revenue exceeded $1.5 billion — about 3% of total full-year revenue for the streaming giant — and is expected to double this year. Overall company revenue jumped almost 16% percent for 2025, while net income rose 26%. \"We're making good progress and the opportunity ahead of us is massive,\" Co-CEO Greg Peters said on Tuesday's call with investors. Wall Street analysts, however, noted that ad revenue disclosure fell short of their previous forecasts, indicating that it could be taking longer than expected to get the ad business off the ground. \"The last couple of years were slower out of the gate than we had estimated. However, advertising revenue growth is hitting its stride and should yield a similar contribution to revenue growth as we had estimated in our pre-4Q forecast,\" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a research note Wednesday. Robert Fishman of MoffettNathanson noted total ad revenue was lower than the research firm had forecast but welcomed the fresh insights into the company's ad business. \"At least now we can finally have a better understanding of the contribution from advertising to total growth and can back into core subscription revenues,\" Fishman said in a note on Wednesday. Netflix's stock fell about 2% on Wednesday.Advertising has come front and center for media companies after it became clear that a subscription-only streaming model wouldn't be enough to support profitability. Advertisers, despite various headwinds, have been eager to find a place on streaming platforms, especially Netflix. Yet the industry leader was late to the advertising game after leadership long rejected the business model. It launched its cheaper, ad-supported tier in late 2022, coinciding with a brief slowdown in subscriber additions. Advertising and a crackdown on password sharing were put forth as measures to drive growth. And it has, even if slowly. Netflix said Tuesday it had 325 million global subscribers at the end of 2025. That marks an increase of roughly 23 million from the end of 2024, when Netflix last disclosed its global paid memberships. For comparison, Netflix added roughly 41 million subscribers in 2024 and almost 30 million in 2023. Against a backdrop of consistent price increases for streaming services, companies are increasingly leaning on the belief that consumers will opt for cheaper, ad-supported plans rather than drop out altogether. Peters said Tuesday that while there remains a gap between average revenue per membership of the company's standard, no-ads plan subscription and its ad-supported plan, \"that gap is narrowing.\" \"And while, because there's a gap, it means we're under-realizing revenue growth in the near time, it also, therefore, represents an opportunity for us,\" Peters said, pointing to upgrading the tech stack and ad capabilities to help drive growth.

It can also assist with managing medications and book appointments with a user's One Medical provider. The tool pulls answers from a variety of sources, including licensed and proprietary data, knowledge verified by medical experts and in some cases, publicly-available data, Amazon said.Health AI appears in the app for One Medical, the health-care company Amazon acquired for $3.9 billion in 2023. One Medical runs brick-and-mortar clinics and also offers some telehealth services to members who pay between $99 and $199 a year for its services.Amazon said Health AI isn't intended to provide diagnosis or treatment, and it shouldn't replace a doctor's visit. The tool is \"programmed with clinical protocols\" that identify when symptoms or conditions require escalation to a provider or for an in-person visit, the company said.Read more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule updateConversations with Health AI also aren't added to a patient's medical records, Amazon said. The company began testing Health AI among a subset of One Medical members last Spring before rolling out the tool more broadly.Other AI providers have also jumped into the lucrative health-care market. Earlier this month, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Health, a feature within its chatbot that enables users to upload medical records and receive personalized advice. Anthropic released its Claude for Healthcare feature shortly after. Amazon said Health AI is easier for patients to use because it doesn't require them to upload documents or connect outside apps, and it's \"more actionable\" compared to other offerings.\"In short: other AI health chatbots provide general health information,\" Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services, told CNBC in a statement. \"One Medical's Health AI assistant knows your health story, can take actions based on a patient's request, and keeps your trusted providers in the lead. It's the difference between getting answers and getting care.\"Amazon has pushed deeper into health-care over the past decade. In addition to acquiring One Medical, Amazon also bought online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million in 2018. Two years later, it launched its own offering called Amazon Pharmacy.The company said Health AI may direct users to One Medical and Amazon Pharmacy services \"where it is helpful,\" but protected health information isn't used to market or advertise general merchandise from its broader webstore.   watch now",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesFacebook and Instagram parent company Meta on Wednesday said it will begin to show advertising on its Threads microblogging service to all users globally starting next week. \"With ads on Threads, businesses can authentically join this conversation while finding new ways to connect with the people most interested in their business,\" the company wrote in a blog. Wall Street analysts expect Threads to become a significant revenue driver for Meta as the company monetizes the platform. The company is set to report its fourth quarter earnings results next week.Meta said the full launch will be \"gradual\" and potentially take a few months to roll out. The social media company first tested ads on Threads with users in the U.S. and Japan last January. Since its launch in July 2023, Threads has been a direct competitor to Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter. Meta's service has amassed more than 400 million active monthly users globally, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in August.Earlier this month, TechCrunch reported that Threads had lured more daily mobile users worldwide than X, citing data from Similarweb.Meta said it plans to continue bringing new features to Threads. That includes new ad formats and third-party verification services that are already available on Facebook and Instagram. Correction: This story has been revised to reflect that Threads has more daily mobile users worldwide than X. A previous version misidentified the category of user in which Threads had surpassed X.watch nowRead more CNBC tech newsTech stocks lead Wall Street sell-off as tensions over Greenland escalateMost of Instagram's ads ran on Reels in 2025, data showsOpenAI to focus on 'practical adoption' in 2026, says finance chief Sarah FriarElon Musk's xAI faces tougher road building out data centers after EPA rule update",

Chip Somodevilla | GettyAs Americans prepare for the start of tax season next week, several new tax breaks are on the table as part of President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill.\" \"We passed the largest tax cuts in American history, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security for our great seniors,\" Trump said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday.According to the Tax Foundation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed into law last summer represents the country's sixth-largest tax cut, and is expected to reduce federal tax revenue by $5 trillion from 2025 through 2034.Experts expect the new law to result in larger tax refunds for many Americans this spring.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageTrump says inflation was 'defeated.'

There are always caveats,\" said certified public accountant Sheneya Wilson, founder and CEO of Fola Financial in New York. Taxpayers must figure out a few details first, she said: \"It starts with whether it's a deduction or credit, and whether you'll be eligible based on your income level.\" Deductions reduce taxable income, and credits reduce tax due. The three tax breaks Trump referenced are all temporary and in effect from 2025 through 2028. They are federal breaks; state and local taxes may still apply.Here's how they work, and what taxpayers need to know about them before filing:No tax on tipsThe new tax law allows certain workers to deduct up to $25,000 of \"qualified tips\" per year on federal returns. The tips deduction phases out once modified adjusted gross income exceeds $150,000 for single filers or $300,000 for married couples filing jointly.  Not all tipped workers are eligible. Some occupations don't qualify for this deduction. Some low-income workers may not benefit from this tax break because they won't pay federal income tax, given the 2025 standard deduction. watch nowAlso, this tax break does not include tips received \"under the table,\" Wilson said. \"Your tips must be reported on your W-2 or 1099, and then you can take the deduction on that income. \"If you have W-2 income — hourly wages plus tips — it will not reduce your normal taxable wages; it will only reduce the tip portion.\"No tax on overtime payOBBBA allows eligible workers to deduct \"qualified overtime pay\" on federal returns. The break is capped at $12,500 for single filers or $25,000 for married couples filing jointly. This tax break phases out for higher earners.This is a tax break only for overtime pay, not all wages. In a blog post, payroll company ADP offers this example: If you were paid $10 an hour for non-overtime earnings, and $15 per hour for overtime, only the $5-per-hour premium pay for overtime is eligible for the tax deduction. As you prepare your 2025 return, \"make sure you have your last pay stub and that it shows how much of your pay was properly calculated as overtime,\" Wilson said. This tax break \"applies to all income you earn via time and a half,\" she said. \"It will typically be on your final pay stub. The W2 won't explicitly state how much of the pay was overtime.\"Senior 'bonus' deductionwatch nowThe 2025 tax law offers a \"bonus\" deduction of up to $6,000 for Americans age 65 and older and up to $12,000 for married couples filing jointly to reduce the amount of federal income subject to tax. The measure does not affect how Social Security is taxed, and people do not need to have claimed Social Security benefits to qualify for the deduction. Eligibility for this tax break depends on income. Taxpayers with up to $75,000 in modified adjusted gross income — or up to $150,000 if married and filing jointly — may receive the full deduction. For incomes above those thresholds, the deduction gradually phases out. Even if you didn't make the most of the break on your 2025 return, experts say to take steps now to manage your income and take advantage of the deduction in the future. SIGN UP: Money 101 is an 8-week learning course on financial freedom, delivered weekly to your inbox.

    "body": "One kilogram gold bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery, operated by Gold Corp.Matt Jelonek | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold prices climbed to a fresh record above $4,800 on Wednesday, extending a sharp rally as investors sought safety amid tariff threats from the White House and renewed concerns about a global trade war.The surge has reignited debate among investors over how much prices can rise after a blockbuster year for the bullion.Following a record-breaking 2025, gold has entered 2026 with momentum intact as geopolitical tensions, falling real interest rates and efforts by investors and central banks to diversify away from the dollar reinforce its role as the world's ultimate haven, analysts said.Forecasts are increasingly bullish. Analysts surveyed by the London Bullion Market Association expect prices to rise above $5,000 this year, citing expectations of lower U.S. real rates, continued Federal Reserve easing and sustained central-bank diversification away from the dollar.Julia Du, a senior commodities strategist at ICBC Standard Bank, sees gold prices pushing as high as $7,150.\"Gold remains the headline story after a record-breaking 2025,\" the LBMA said in its forecast survey.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGoldman Sachs also reiterated its bullish stance, calling gold its highest-conviction trade, driven by a shift in who is buying the metal.\"Gold remains our highest conviction long or base case, the price by the end of this year is $4,900,\" said Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs.He noted that central bank purchases drove gains in 2023 and 2024, while the rally accelerated in 2025 as private-sector demand increased.\"Private investors are starting to diversify into gold through different channels,\" he said in a media briefing on Wednesday, with ETF inflows offering one clear evidence of that shift, though it's difficult to separate retail demand from institutional flows. According to Goldman Sachs, demand largely came from private wealth firms, asset managers, hedge funds and pension investors.For many gold bulls, geopolitics remains the defining backdrop. Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP,  said the current cycle does not resemble a speculative peak. She expects gold prices to reach $5,400 this year.\"Last year was historic, sort of a once in a hundred year event across precious metals, where silver basically doubled,\" she said.\"Gold was up 60%, so we won't see a repeat of those gains, but $5,400 is a solid 30% up year on year,\" she said. \"This is a secular trade. This isn't a commodity blowoff top.\"Geopolitical tensions, she argued, are not fading into the background. Recent flashpoints, including U.S. actions in Venezuela and Washington's push to assert control over Greenland, have only deepened investors' flight to gold.\"You're entering a world where ... there is a strong demand to secure critical metals, critical commodities in this decade,\" Shiels said.",

Zak Bennett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesStagnant mortgage rates, falling housing supply and ongoing economic uncertainty weighed heavily on homebuyers in December. Pending home sales, a measure of signed contracts on existing homes, dropped 9.3% last month from November, according to the National Association of Realtors. Analysts were expecting a slight gain. Sales were 3% lower than December 2024.\"The housing sector is not out of the woods yet,\" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the Realtors. \"After several months of encouraging signs in pending contracts and closed sales, the December new contract figures have dampened the short-term outlook.\"Sales fell month to month in all regions of U.S. and were higher annually only in the South. Homes also stayed on the market longer in December, at an average of 39 days compared with 35 days in December 2024.Mortgage rates in December, when these deals were inked, barely moved at all. The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed loan sat around 6.25%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That is slightly lower than it was over the summer, but consumers were also facing a market with fewer homes available for sale.

Inventory was up 12% from a year ago, but that is off an extremely low level. \"Consumers prefer seeing abundant inventory before making the major decision of purchasing a home. So, the decline in pending home sales could be a result of dampened consumer enthusiasm about buying a home when there are so few options listed for sale,\" Yun added. ",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., during the 2025 IIF annual membership meeting in Washington, Oct. 16, 2025.Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, offering a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader of one of Trump's signature policies. Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, initially praised Trump's moves to secure the borders of the world's largest economy. Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to the lowest level in 50 years for the period from October 2024 to September 2025, the BBC reported citing federal data.But Dimon, who has long advocated for immigration reform to boost U.S. economic growth, also made an apparent reference to videos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers rounding up people alleged to be undocumented immigrants.\"I don't like what I'm seeing, five grown men beating up a little old lady,\" Dimon said. \"So I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.\"It's unclear if Dimon was speaking about a specific incident, or more broadly about ICE confrontations.In the first year of his second term, Trump has overhauled U.S. immigration policy with a focus on mass deportations, tightened asylum access and ramped-up spending for ICE personnel and facilities. Among a torrent of new policies that changed the landscape for seeking American citizenship, the administration also rescinded guidance on where ICE arrests could happen, leading to raids at schools, hospitals and places of worship.Unlike during Trump's first term, American CEOs have mostly avoided public criticism of his policies. Wall Street analysts have speculated that business leaders fear retribution from the Trump administration, which has sued media companies, universities and law firms, and instead choose to appeal to the president out of the public spotlight.On Wednesday, Dimon said that he wanted to know more about who is being swept up in ICE raids: \"Are they here legally? Are they criminals? ... Did they break American law?\"\"We need these people,\" Dimon added. \"They work in our hospitals and hotels and restaurants and agriculture, and they're good people .… They should be treated that way.\"'A climate of fear'For years, in annual shareholder letters and media interviews, Dimon has cited an immigration overhaul as one of the main avenues to unlock higher U.S. economic growth.The veteran CEO of JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market cap, has previously supported a merit-based system for green cards as well as citizenship for people brought to America as children, and pushed back on proposals to limit H-1B visas. On Wednesday, Dimon urged Trump to allow citizenship \"for hardworking people\" and \"proper asylum\" opportunities.\"\"I think he can, because he controlled the borders,\" Dimon said.Later in the wide-ranging interview, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told Dimon that she was surprised at how careful he and other CEOs were in speaking about Trump.\"You are one of the more outspoken business leaders,\" Beddoes said. \"I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical. There is a climate of fear in your country.\"Dimon pushed back, saying that he let his views be known about Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and stance towards European allies. \"I think they should change their approach to immigration,\" Dimon said. \"I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?\"watch now",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have \"formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland.\"Trump said that as a result of that negotiation, he would no longer impose punitive tariffs on a slew of European countries that were set to begin Feb. 1.In an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernen minutes after posting the statement, Trump described the Greenland framework as the \"concept of a deal.\"Asked for more details about the proposal, Trump said, \"It's a little bit complex, but we'll explain it down the line.\"But he suggested that the framework involves mineral rights for the U.S., as well as the Trump administration's proposed \"Golden Dome\" missile defense system.watch now\"They're going to be involved in the Golden Dome, and they're going to be involved in mineral rights, and so are we,\" Trump told Kernen.Asked to confirm that the tariffs were no longer coming next month, Trump said, \"No, we took that off because it looks like we have, pretty much the concept of a deal.\"Read Trump's entire announcement, which he posted on Truth Social:Based upon a very productive meeting that I have had with the Secretary General of NATO, Mark Rutte, we have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region. This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations. Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations — They will report directly to me. Thank you for your attention to this matter!Stocks shot up immediately after Trump posted the update.The announcement came after a meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in which some NATO members discussed a proposal to give the U.S. sovereignty over small pockets of Greenland's land, The New York Times reported, citing three senior officials familiar with the discussion.Other details about the framework agreement were unclear. Asked for additional information, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly echoed Trump's assurance that more details will \"continue to be unveiled as discussions continue.\"Despite its lack of clarity, the announcement marks a stunning twist in the ongoing controversy over Trump's persistent efforts to acquire Greenland for the U.S.The Trump administration in recent weeks has floated buying the island or even utilizing the U.S. military to take control of it, even though it is a territory of Denmark, a NATO ally.Danish and Greenlandic officials have rebuffed the U.S., reiterating that Greenland is not for sale. As tensions ratcheted up, a slew of European NATO nations increased their military presences in the territory. Over the weekend, Trump responded by threatening to hit those countries with new tariffs starting at 10% next month and increasing to 25% in June.During a speech at Davos earlier Wednesday, Trump laid out his case for the U.S. to obtain Greenland on national-security grounds.His remarks, including his call for \"immediate negotiations\" with Denmark, unnerved some in the audience.But Trump also said he would not use military force in pursuit of the territory, in an apparent shift from his prior stance.Stocks, which had plummeted a day earlier amid Trump's increasing aggression toward Greenland, immediately rebounded.Later Wednesday, Trump — who recently said that anything less than full ownership of Greenland was \"unacceptable\" to him — declined to say if the new framework involved the U.S. acquiring the island.\"It's a long-term deal,\" Trump told CNN after a pause. \"It's the ultimate long-term deal. And I think it puts everybody in a really good position.\"Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said in an X post, \"The day is ending on a better note than it began.\"He urged parties to \"sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines\" laid down by Denmark.Some European leaders cautioned against celebrating prematurely, however.\"It's good that they are engaged in dialogue,\" Germany's Finance Minister Lars ⁠Klingbeil told his country's ZDF television after Trump's meeting with Rutte.\"But we have to wait a bit and not get our ‍hopes up too soon,\" Klingbeil said.",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, speaks at the American Business Forum at the Kaseya Center in Miami on Nov. 6, 2025.Chandan Khanna | AFP | Getty ImagesJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon on Wednesday advocated for a test of President Donald Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates in two U.S. states: Vermont and Massachusetts.Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, addressed a question about Trump's order for banks to voluntarily limit their interest rates for a year. The president had called for the lower rates to take effect Tuesday.Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified as defying Trump's proposal.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said Wednesday. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said. In earnings conference calls last week and behind the scenes, banks have pushed back against Trump's order this month to voluntarily forgo billions of dollars in revenue.Their main argument, that price controls will result in lenders canceling accounts for many card customers, has resonated with several Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson. Most banking analysts believe that Trump would need legislation to enact a nationwide cap on card rates.'A great idea'Dimon then said he had a \"great idea\" to help quell disagreement over the proposed card cap, suggesting that the U.S. government impose the pricing controls on Americans in just two states.Vermont and Massachusetts are the home states of Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, respectively, both of whom support a bill capping card rates at 10% for five years. Dimon didn't mention the lawmakers by name Wednesday.The U.S. government \"should force all the banks to do it in two states, Vermont and Massachusetts, and see what happens,\" Dimon said, drawing laughter from the audience.Dimon said \"the left\" and people who argue for price controls \"will learn a real lesson, and the people crying the most won't be the credit card companies,\" he said.\"It'll be the restaurants, the retailers, the travel companies, the schools, the municipalities, because people miss their water payments,\" he said. \"It would be something else to watch.\"The office of Sanders didn't immediately return calls for comment.Warren had a response which read, in part: \"It's January 21, and unsurprisingly, there is no self-imposed interest rate cap on credit cards by the big banks,\" Warren said. \"But Jamie Dimon and the world's richest people did fly their private jets to a ski resort in Switzerland to complain about how bipartisan action to cap credit card interest rates would destroy life as we know it... It's time to pass a law and get this done.\"Dimon added that JPMorgan was planning on giving the Trump administration its analysis on what would happen under a national credit card rate cap.\"I think it's wrong for the government to get involved extensively in pricing of stuff, but I got to deal with the world I got,\" Dimon said.— CNBC's Stephanie Dhue contributed to this story.watch now",

    "body": "Jeff Bezos holds the aviation glasses that belonged to Amelia Earhart as he speaks during a press conference about his flight on Blue Origin’s New Shepard into space, in Van Horn, Texas, July 20, 2021.Joe Raedle | Getty ImagesJeff Bezos' space venture Blue Origin announced Wednesday it plans to deploy 5,408 satellites into space for a communications network that will take on SpaceX and Amazon.The network, called TeraWave, is targeted for enterprise, data center and government users. The company said it will provide data speeds of \"up to 6 terabits per second\" from satellites positioned in low Earth orbit and medium Earth orbit, regions of space that are between 100 miles and 21,000 miles from the Earth's surface. Blue Origin said it expects to begin deploying its constellation in the fourth quarter of 2027. Bezos is entering an increasingly crowded satellite internet market that's currently dominated by Starlink, a service operated by Elon Musk's SpaceX. Starlink has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers.

The service recently rebranded from Project Kuiper to Leo. The company has sent up 180 satellites since last April through a series of rocket launches handled by partners such as United Launch Alliance and SpaceX. Several future deployments are expected to be handled by Blue Origin. Amazon aims to build a constellation of 3,236 low Earth satellites that will serve businesses, governments and consumers. Last November, the company opened up an \"enterprise preview\" to select users ahead of a broader commercial launch.  Bezos predicted in 2024 that Blue Origin would one day be a bigger company than Amazon. He founded Blue Origin in 2000, and Dave Limp, Amazon's former devices boss, serves as its CEO. \"I think it's going to be the best business that I've ever been involved in, but it's going to take a while,\" Bezos said in a 2024 interview at The New York Times' DealBook Summit.Blue Origin is primarily a rocket launch company, flying tourists and research to the edge of space on short trips. Last January, the startup notched a major milestone when it successfully launched its towering New Glenn rocket for the first time, though it was unable to return the rocket's booster back to a barge for reuse. Blue Origin nailed the landing of its New Glenn rocket booster last November following the successful launch of a pair of NASA spacecraft. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Wednesday urged U.S. lawmakers to pass legislation to limit credit card rates to 10%, following his social media post this month ordering banks to voluntarily lower their rates.\"I'm asking Congress to cap credit card interest rates at 10% for one year, and this will help millions of Americans save for a home,\" Trump said from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"They charge Americans interest rates of 28%, 30%, 31%, 32%,\" Trump said. \"Whatever happened to usury?\"Shares of banks climbed after the comments. The KBW Bank Index rose 2.2% in morning trading. Capital One, which relies on cards for most of its revenue, advanced 1.9%.Among the options that the Trump administration had for applying pressure to American banks over card rates, the legislative path may be the least threatening to the industry. Sens. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., introduced a bill last year that would limit card APRs at 10% for five years, but that proposal has stalled in Congress.Analysts including Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW have said it is unlikely that a card bill will have enough bipartisan support to become law. Lawmakers from Trump's own Republican Party, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have expressed caution when it comes to card price controls. \"If this is the path, the odds of implementation are low,\" Sakhrani said in an interview. \"There is a lot of Republican leadership that opposes the idea\" and other industries, including airlines and retailers, would be hurt by the policy.It's unclear whether pressure from Trump — who holds massive sway among GOP lawmakers — will improve the plan's chances of passing.Breaking 'the law?'The episode may show the limits of Trump's ability to cajole the financial industry into voluntarily giving up billions of dollars in revenue to support his election year affordability push.After Trump's Jan. 9 Truth Social post on the rate cap, banks said on earnings conference calls that such a limit would have unintended consequences, including that lenders would simply cancel accounts for many card customers, especially those with lower credit scores.The president told reporters that lenders who didn't comply on rates will be \"in violation of the law,\" but behind closed doors, bankers countered that they were already compliant with the law. Privately, bankers and their lobbyists told CNBC they hoped to fend off the president's request, given the difficulty of passing legislation. Several large credit card lenders contacted by CNBC on Tuesday said they had made no changes to their interest rates, but they all declined to be identified. KBW's Sakhrani said he wasn't aware of any major card player that cut its rates.On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told a Davos audience that the U.S. government should test out the rate cap in just two states, Vermont and Massachusetts. Those are the home states of Sanders and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who have both championed interest rate caps.Doing so would teach \"a real lesson\" to those in favor of price controls, Dimon said.\"It would be an economic disaster,\" Dimon said. \"In the worst case, you'd have a drastic reduction of the credit card business\" for 80% of Americans, he said.watch now",

    "body": "Warren Buffett will no longer write the letters that accompany his firm, Berkshire Hathaway's annual reports, nor will he field questions at the company's annual shareholder meeting, he wrote in a letter published on Monday.\"As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet,'\" he wrote. \"Sort of.\"Even after Greg Abel takes the reins as Berkshire CEO at yearend, Buffett will continue to share a Thanksgiving message with shareholders — and anyone interested in reading.Interest will no doubt abound. Over his 95 years, Buffett has earned a reputation not only as a legendary investor, but as someone with the secrets to living a better life.In his most recent letter, Buffett took a second to look back and assure his fans that they still have time to do and get the things they want.\"I'm happy to say I feel better about the second half of my life than the first,\" he wrote. \"My advice: Don't beat yourself up over past mistakes — learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.\"Buffett's advice for living wellIn his letter, Buffett riffed on one his longstanding pieces of life advice: Consider your legacy, and work backward.Buffett recalled the story of Alfred Nobel, who reportedly read a mistakenly printed obituary and was horrified at what he saw. The move prompted him to \"change his behavior,\" Buffett wrote — Nobel, previously famous for, among other things, inventing dynamite, came to be associated with his eponymous prize.\"Don't count on a newsroom mix-up: Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it,\" Buffet wrote.One route, Buffett said, is to imitate those people you most admire: \"Choose your heroes very carefully and then emulate them. You will never be perfect, but you can always be better,\" he wrote.Another way is to refocus your ambitions.\"Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government,\" Buffett wrote. \"When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless.\"Regardless of your aims, Buffett wrote, you're unlikely to go wrong following the \"golden rule\" by treating other people, regardless of their station, the way you would want to be treated.\"Keep in mind that the cleaning lady is as much a human being as the Chairman,\" he wrote.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

    "body": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) speaks to reporters outside the Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol Building on Oct. 1, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesDemocratic senators on Monday blamed the White House push to fast track artificial intelligence data centers and its attacks on renewable energy for rising electricity prices in certain parts of the U.S.Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others demanded that the White House and Commerce Department detail what actions they have taken to shield consumers from the impact of massive data centers in a letter sent Monday.Voters are increasingly feeling the pinch of rising electricity prices. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger campaigned on the issue in the New Jersey and Virgina governors' races, which they won in landslides last week.The senators took aim at the White House's relationship with companies like Meta, Alphabet, Oracle, and OpenAI, and the support the administration has shown for the companies' data center plans.The Trump administration \"has already failed to prevent those new data centers from driving up electricity prices from a surge of new commercial demand,\" the senators wrote. They accused the White House of making the problem worse by opposing the expansion of solar and wind power.The White House blamed the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices in a statement.President Donald Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said.The tech sector's AI plans have ballooned in size. OpenAI and Nvidia, for example, struck a deal in September to build 10 gigawatts of data centers to train and run AI applications. This is equivalent to New York City's peak baseline summer demand in 2024.The scale of these plans have raised questions about whether enough power is available to meet the demand and who will pay for the new generation that is needed. Renewable energy, particularly solar and energy storage, is the power source that can be deployed the quickest right now to meet demand.Retail electricity prices in the U.S. increased about 6% on average through August 2025 compared with the same period in 2024, according to the Energy Information Administration. Prices, however, can vary widely by region.Download the full letter here. ",

    "body": "Stephen Miran, governor of the US Federal Reserve, at the Nomura Research Forum during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Fall meetings in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 15, 2025. Samuel Corum | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran on Monday advocated for further interest rate cuts as a way stave off a potential economic softening ahead.In a CNBC interview, the central bank official held to his belief that the Fed should be moving at an even more rapid pace than its traditional quarter percentage point reductions.He advocated, as he has at the previous two Federal Open Market Committee meetings, for a 50 basis point, or half percentage point, reduction, though he said there at least should be a quarter-point easing.\"Nothing is certain. We could get data that would make me change my mind between now and then,\" Miran said. \"But failing new information that's made me update my forecasts, looking out in time, yeah, I would think that 50 is appropriate, as I have in the past, but at a minimum 25.\"Despite Miran's urging for bigger moves, the FOMC in both September and October opted for quarter-point cuts. Miran voted against both those moves but was not joined by any of his colleagues. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid voted \"no\" in October, but only because he wanted to no cuts.Though there were only two votes against the October cut, public statements from multiple officials have indicated a wide dispersion of opinion among officials.Fed Chair Jerome Powell alluded to the disagreements at his most recent news conference, in which he indicated that another cut in December is not a foregone conclusion. Some policymakers have expressed hesitancy to but based on data showing inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target, while others in favor of lowering rates fear further labor market deterioration.Miran said not continuing to ease would be short-sighted.\"If you're making data for what, if you're making policy for what the data are now, you are backward looking, because it will take 12 to 18 months for that to hit the economy. So you need to make policy now based on where you think the economy is going to be a year to a year and a half from now.\"Policymakers have been handcuffed by a lack of official economic data during the government lockdown. Miran said the data that is available has showed softening in both inflation and the labor market, which itself should make the Fed at least incrementally more dovish than its collective forecast in September indicating a total three cuts this year.Markets are pricing in about a 63% chance of a third reduction in December, though that has been falling gradually since the October Fed meeting, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.",

    "body": "WASHINGTON, DC - NOVEMBER 10: U.S. President Donald Trump shakes hands with U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, during his swearing-in ceremony in the Oval Office of the White House on November 10, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump faces a fresh test of his political diplomacy with India as longtime loyalist Sergio Gor takes up his post as ambassador in New Delhi, amid tension over trade and Russian oil imports, which have weighed on the two countries' strategic ties.At Gor's swearing-in ceremony on Monday, Trump said Washington may soon lower tariffs on Indian goods, suggesting both sides are moving closer to a trade deal.\"The tariffs on India are really high because of the Russian oil [imports], but they have now substantially reduced Russian oil [imports], so we will be bringing the tariffs down,\" Trump said.However, data from market research firm Kpler showed that India's imports of Russian crude were largely unchanged in October at 1.59 million barrels per day (mbd) from September.\"So far, 1.73 mbd of October Russian exports have been signaled to India, with another 302 kbd (thousand barrels per day) not yet showing a final destination (a portion of which could also end up in India),\" the tank tracker said, adding \"it's still too early to draw a clear picture for November\".Trump said Gor's priorities would include promoting investment in key U.S. Industries, increasing American energy exports and expanding security cooperation.\"I am looking at Sergio to strengthen one of most important relationships and that is the strategic partnership with the Republic of India,\" Trump said.Gor, whose nomination as U.S. ambassador to India was confirmed by the Senate on Oct. 7, arrived in New Delhi a few days later and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss defense, trade and technology. \"We also discussed the importance of critical minerals to both of our nations,\" Gor said in a statement.Gor represents the White House's push for faster, more direct communication with New Delhi, bypassing the usual diplomatic bureaucracy, said Alexandra Hermann of Oxford Economics.\"[This] suggests a desire to reach a trade deal sooner rather than later,\" Hermann said.\"A 'political' ambassador rather than a 'traditional' diplomat may indeed speed things up, but it also raises the risk that if opinion in either country sours, they are less insulated and ties can become even more volatile,\" she added.India's tiltSteep tariffs, a $100,000 fee for H1B visas, and Trump's repeated claims of brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan are among issues that have led to the deterioration of strategic ties between New Delhi and Washington in recent months, according to experts.\"It can't be that you are the most tariffed country in the world, more than even China, and then talk about military friendship and joint maneuvers,\"  former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan said at a Nov. 6 event organized by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.The last time Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger tilted the U.S. towards Pakistan during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, it pushed India closer to the Soviet Union for the next 25 years, warned Rajan, now a professor of Finance at the University of Chicago Booth.Shortly after the U.S. imposed 50% tariffs on Indian exports in August, Modi attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Summit in Tianjin, where a viral clip showed him laughing with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.The New York Times described the moment as a \"smiling manifestation of a troika that Moscow had recently said it hoped to revive,\" noting the optics of closeness between Modi and Putin, who even shared a ride to a meeting on the sidelines.India's outreach to Russia has continued. This week, a delegation of 20 Indian companies participated in this year's Moscow International Tool Expo, the Federation of Indian Export Organizations (FIEO), a body under India's Ministry of Commerce & Industry, said in a statement Monday.\"Our engineering exports to Russia is growing rapidly and expected to reach $1.75 billion this year,\" FIEO President S C Ralhan said in the statement, adding that the participation in the exhibition will \"deepen commercial ties\" and help in boosting bilateral trade between the two nations.But experts say that Russia remains a limited partner compared with the U.S.India exported $4.88 billion to Russia and imported $63.84 billion in fiscal 2025, according to the Indian Brand Equity Foundation. By contrast, the U.S. accounted for 18% of India's exports, compared with only 1% for Russia, said Hermann of Oxford Economics.",

    "body": "Paramount Global and Skydance logos are seen in this illustration taken December 17, 2024. Dado Ruvic | ReutersParamount Skydance said on Monday it expects $1 billion more in merger savings than it previously forecast as it outlines CEO David Ellison's ambitions for the company.The update came in Paramount's third-quarter earnings report — the company's first since its merger closed in early August. Ellison has been investing heavily in streaming and content, including live sports rights, and paying for it in part with cuts to other parts of the business.Paramount on Monday announced a new round of layoffs, affecting roughly 1,600 employees, tied to divestitures of assets in Argentina and Chile. Those cuts come weeks after Paramount began the process to lay off approximately 1,000 employees.At the same time, Paramount said it plans to increase prices for its flagship streaming service, Paramount+, in the first quarter of next year as it looks to beef up its content slate and improve its the technology of the platform.Paramount last raised its streaming prices in June 2024, after a previous hike in early 2023.Shares of the company were up about 6% in extended trading Monday.Cutting to growIn Monday's letter to shareholders, Ellison mapped out the combined company's initiatives, which he referred to as Paramount Skydance's \"North Star priorities.\" Those include investing in its growth businesses, growing its streaming business globally and identifying savings that would lead to \"long-term free cash flow generation.\"While Paramount Skydance management told investors in August they planned $2 billion in cost savings, that was upped to \"at least $3 billion in run-rate efficiencies\" as of Monday's report. More than $1.4 billion of those savings will be done by the end of the year and an additional $1 billion by the end of 2026, according to the letter.The company has been shedding staff. Less than a month after the merger was completed, the company alerted employees that it would be mandating a five-day work week beginning in January and would offer employees a buyout if they didn't want to make the transition. According to Monday's letter, about 600 employees chose to exit the company rather than return to an office full-time.The company also identified parts of its South American business to cut and said Monday it divested Television Federal, the operator of TV stations in Buenos Aires and other markets in Argentina. It's also in the process of exiting Chilevision in Chile, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2026.These divestitures, which were deemed \"non-core\" to the company's future growth, according to the letter, would result in the 1,600 workforce reductions.Streaming, content in focusParamount Skydance CEO David Ellison speaks during the Bloomberg Screentime conference in Los Angeles on October 9, 2025. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesWhile Paramount Skydance's restructuring efforts, layoffs and cost savings have been a top priority for the company, Ellison has also wasted no time in making acquisitions to build up its content slate.Most notably, the company has reportedly been looking to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery in a deal that would see it gain the Warner Bros. film studio, the HBO Max streaming service, and a portfolio of cable TV networks including CNN and TNT Sports. Warner Bros. Discovery recently put itself up for sale, and has rebuffed three offers from Ellison in recent weeks, CNBC reported.Ellison wouldn't comment on his aspirations for WBD on Monday, but said the company was in build mode, which may or may not include mergers and acquisitions.\"I think it's important to know there's no must-haves for us,\" he said. \"We really look at this as buy versus build, and we absolutely have the ability to build to get to where we want to go.\" On the sports front, Paramount Skydance has added TKO Group's UFC to its slate in a 7-year, $7.7 billion deal. Paramount+ also became the exclusive long-term home for Zuffa Boxing, a new professional boxing promotion formed by TKO and the Saudi-backed Sela, in the U.S., Canada and Latin America.The company also inked a deal with Activision to develop content off of its Call of Duty video game franchise; signed a 5-year exclusive agreement with the creators of \"South Park;\" and brought on Matt and Ross Duffer, the creative team behind Netflix's hit \"Stranger Things,\" beginning in mid-2026.The additions to its content slate are geared at boosting Paramount+ streaming subscribers. Paramount Skydance President Jeff Shell said during a call with investors that the service had experienced notable customer losses over the summer, but they returned in the fall at the start of the NFL season.On Monday, the company said Paramount+ had more than 79 million global subscribers.

David Ake | Getty ImagesThe Federal Aviation Administration on Monday will \"effectively prohibit business aviation\" at a dozen major U.S. airports, adding to flight restrictions for commercial airlines as air traffic controller shortages snarl travel in the government shutdown, a trade group said.Last week, the Trump administration ordered U.S. commercial airlines to cut their schedules to ease strains on air traffic controllers who are working without their regular paychecks in the shutdown. Government officials at first didn't curb private flights the same way they did for commercial aviation, though the air traffic controller staffing shortages have slowed travel broadly.The first commercial airline flight cuts of 4% went into affect on Friday and are set to rise to 10% of flights by this coming Friday.More than 4,500 commercial flights were canceled over the weekend and over 17,000 were delayed as staffing shortages worsened around the country, according to FlightAware. Aviation industry members applauded the Senate's progress toward ending the shutdown late Sunday, though a solution for the longest-ever such impasse hasn't been finalized.\"Safety is the cornerstone of business aviation, and NBAA is fully committed to ensuring the safety of the NAS,\" said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen in a statement late Sunday. \"Among the ways we will do that is to ensure business aviation operators have an understanding of these restrictions and their implications.\"Most business jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the NBAA. The FAA didn't immediately comment.Here are the airports included in the new restrictions, according to the NBAA:Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD)Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)Denver International Airport (DEN)General Edward Lawrence Logan International Airport (BOS)George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH)Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL)John F.

    "body": "Cooling towers at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Middletown, Pennsylvania, Oct. 30, 2024.Danielle DeVries | CNBCNuclear power will receive most of the money from the Energy Department's loan office as the Trump administration pushes to quickly break ground on new reactors, Secretary Chris Wright said on Monday.\"We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,\" the Secretary of Energy said at a conference hosted by the American Nuclear Society in Washington D.C. \"By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.\"President Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to break ground on 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms and Microsoft are investing billions of dollars to restart old nuclear plants, upgrade existing ones, and deploy new reactor technology to meet the electricity demand from artificial intelligence data centers.Wright said he expects electricity demand from AI to attract billions of dollars in equity capital to build new nuclear capacity from \"very creditworthy providers.\" The Energy Department could match those private dollars by as much as four to one with low cost debt financing from the loan office, he said.\"When we leave office three years and three months from now, I want to see hopefully dozens of nuclear plants under construction,\" Wright said.Westinghouse dealThe Trump administration struck a deal last month with the owners of Westinghouse to invest $80 billion to build nuclear plants across the U.S. Westinghouse is owned by uranium miner Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management.Westinghouse has designed a modern reactor called the AP1000 that can power more than 750,000 homes. CEO Dan Sumner said in July that Westinghouse would meet Trump's call to build large new plants with the AP1000 design.Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac said last week that the U.S. government has a number of options available to facilitate the financing of Westinghouse reactors, including the Energy Department's loan office.\"We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,\" Isaac told investors on Cameco's third-quarter earnings call.Under the terms of the October deal, Westinghouse could spin out as a separate, publicly-traded company with the U.S. government as a shareholder.But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to build the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.Two AP1000 reactors entered service at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024, years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget. The South Carolina project was cancelled.",

Oura says it has sold more than 2.5 million rings since June 2024.Oura has been an \"AI-forward company from the get-go,\" Hale said, but he is even more bullish on the company's adoption of AI going forward as the company eyes a range of preventative healthcare features.  \"One of the things that Oura does particularly well is it generates insights — basically text — for you that helps you understand your metrics,\" he said. The company uses AI to translate those data points into advice and coaching. It has also its own chatbot, the Oura Advisor, which is like a \"doctor in your pocket\" that can be asked questions, Hale added.In 2022, Oura struck a partnership with Natural Cycles, an FDA-cleared birth control app, to add fertility features to its offering. It introduced glucose monitoring earlier this year, via a partnership with Dexcom, and in October announced blood pressure research. \"One the things that we really believe is that we can become like this sort of guardian angel, right, that's with you all the time and is starting to give you these predictions about your longer-term health,\" Hale said.  Despite Oura's ambitions, there is \"no news on an IPO,\" he added. — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, speaks during the 2025 Annual Shareholder Meeting on Nov. 6, 2025.Courtesy: TeslaTesla shareholders voted last week to give CEO Elon Musk a record pay package, one that could net him about $1 trillion in company stock over the next decade. But Musk received less support than he did for an earlier pay plan in 2018.Setting aside holdings owned by board members and executives, about 66.9% of shares tabulated in the vote were in favor of the package, according to a filing on Friday. When shareholders voted on the 2018 plan, that number was 73%, according to an analysis by Andrew Droste, head of corporate governance at investment firm Columbia Threadneedle.In announcing the preliminary results on Thursday at the company's annual shareholders meeting, Tesla said the plan received 75% support among voting shares. The company count included insiders like Musk, who held around a 15% stake in Tesla going into the proxy and was allowed to vote his shares.The decline from the prior vote follows a tumultuous stretch for Musk and Tesla. Sales slumped in the first half of the year, in part because of Musk's inflammatory political rhetoric and his work for the Trump administration, slashing the size of the federal government. Tesla's brand value has also deteriorated.Still, Droste said in an email that even at just under 70%, the vote represents \"broad support for Elon among Tesla's shareholder base.\" Most investors recognize that Tesla and Elon Musk are \"inextricably linked,\" he wrote, and were \"unwilling to risk his potential departure by allowing this vote to fail.\"Board members recommended shareholders approve the pay plan, which they introduced in September. Top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS had recommended that investors vote against it.The pay package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. The first tranche of stock gets paid out if Tesla hits a market capitalization of $2 trillion, about $500 billion more than the current valuation. Awards tied to market cap gains are paired with operational achievements.Musk could still collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the more attainable goals laid out for him by the board in the new pay plan. There are also a list of \"covered events\" in the award terms that would allow him to earn his shares without meeting required operational milestones.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Correction: A prior version of this story had an incorrect figure for the vote in support of the pay package.WATCH: Key milestones behind Musk's pay packagewatch now",

But we want Switzerland to remain successful,\" he added, saying the country had been a \"very good ally.\"The tariff on Swiss exports could be cut to 15%, matching the rate that was imposed on EU exports to the U.S., according to various media reports citing sources close to the talks. Bloomberg reported that a deal could be finalized within weeks.\"We are not commenting on the ongoing discussions,\" a spokesperson at Switzerland's economy ministry told CNBC, adding that Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin \"is in regular contact with the relevant authorities in the U.S., including USTR Jamieson Greer.\"CNBC has contacted the White House for further comment and is awaiting a response. The duty was met with consternation in Switzerland, whose key exports include watches, jewelry, machinery, chocolate, electronics and chemical and pharmaceutical products. Shares of Swiss firms Swatch Group and Richemont traded higher at the market open on Tuesday.High-profile Swiss businesses have been outspoken on the damage the tariff was wreaking, with the CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling telling CNBC that the duty was \"horrible\" for Switzerland.watch nowThe 39% tariff was among the highest duties that Trump levied in his sweep of global tariffs this year, with the president angered by trade imbalances with the Swiss, and multiple other countries.According to the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. goods trade deficit with Switzerland amounted to $38.5 billion last year. The Swiss government said that the trade relationship between the two was \"relatively balanced,\" according to a CNBC translation.\"The U.S. has a surplus of services exports and Switzerland does for goods exports,\" the government said in August, adding that its goods surplus is not rooted in unfair trade practices and that over 99% of U.S. goods can be imported to Switzerland without being subject to tariffs.",

    "body": "Police officers stand guard outside the Supreme Court on November 5, 2025 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Monday morning that it still wants a block on a Rhode Island federal judge's order mandating that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits for November.The message came a day after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, for a second time, flatly rejected a request by the Trump administration to stay that order pending its full appeal of the decision.That judge's order remains temporarily paused as a result of a prior ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.But Jackson on Monday told the Trump administration to inform the Supreme Court by 11 a.m. ET whether it intends to continue to seek a stay of the order. The administration quickly did so, and said it would comply with her directive to file a supplemental brief on the request by 4 p.m. Monday. Plaintiffs in the case were told to respond by 8 a.m. on Tuesday.Separately on Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order blocking the Trump administration's memo over the weekend telling states that they had to \"undo\" any full SNAP benefits payments to recipients, or face financial penalties.The ruling Sunday night by a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued that memo.And it came hours after the Senate narrowly passed the first step of a bipartisan deal that might reopen the government within days, and fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through next September.\"In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,\" wrote Circuit Court Judge Julie Rikelman in the panel's decision Sunday. \"As the district court found, 'this is a problem that could have been avoided.'\"\"The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,\" Rikelman wrote.\"In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 [temporary restraining order] after the government had failed to comply with it.\"The Trump administration on Oct. 24 broke decades of precedent when it said it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because Congress had not appropriated money for the program, or any other government program, past the date the shutdown began, Oct. 1. Past administrations had paid SNAP benefits in full during other shutdowns.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe administration rejected the idea of using the remaining $4.6 billion in a contingency fund that Congress had specifically allocated to backstop SNAP.A group of plaintiffs, comprised of nonprofits, local governments, a union and a food retailer, sued the administration in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island seeking a judicial order forcing the administration to use the contingency fund and other pools of money to fully fund SNAP benefits.Judge Jack McConnell, who is overseeing the case, ordered the administration to make at least partial benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund, and to investigate if other money could be used.McConnell on Thursday ordered that the administration pay full benefits, days after the administration told him it would pay only partial benefits — but that it would take some time to do so — and told him that it had ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds.McConnell ordered that the administration use Section 32 funds to make up the difference between the 65% of benefits the administration planned to pay by using the contingency fund and the full value of the benefits. SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion each month.The administration then asked the 1st Circuit for a temporary stay of McConnell's order on an emergency basis, which the appeals court rejected Friday.But the appeals court at the same time also said it was still considering the \"government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] ... and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.\"On Friday night, Jackson, acting on a request by the administration, paused McConnell's order from taking effect and told the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the request for the stay pending appeal.Jackson's order paused for 48 hours any ruling by the 1st Circuit from taking effect.",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSony Group on Tuesday posted a stronger-than-expected rise in second-quarter operating profit and announced a share buyback of up to 100 billion Japanese yen ($648 million).Here are Sony's second-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: Revenue: 3.108 trillion Japanese yen ($20.14 billion) vs. 2.985 trillion yen expectedOperating profit: 429 billion yen vs. 398.44 billion yen expectedOperating profit climbed 10% from a year earlier, while revenues were up 5%. Sony shares jumped more than 6% after the earnings release.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Japanese technology giant raised its full-year outlook, expecting operating profit to climb by 100 billion yen, or 8% from its previous forecast, led by its imaging and sensing solutions and music segments. The company also lifted its annual revenue projection by 300 billion yen, or 3%, while trimming its estimated losses from U.S. tariffs to 50 billion yen from 70 billion yen.While Sony has been affected by U.S. President Donald Trump's global tariff regime launched in April, Tokyo reached a trade deal with Washington in July that lowered duties on Japanese exports to 15% from the 25% initially proposed. The reduced tariffs took effect Aug. 7.Music and imaging boostProfit from Sony's music business increased 27.65% year over year to 115.4 billion yen, while operating profit from its imaging business jumped nearly 50% to 138.3 billion yen, making it the company's most profitable segment in the quarter.Sony's imaging and sensing solutions segment develops and manufactures advanced semiconductor products for a wide range of applications, from smartphones to automotive and industrial systems.The company also reported strong sales in its game and network services division, which houses its popular PlayStation home console brand. The segment represents Sony's top revenue driver, but posted a decrease in profits in the September quarter, falling 13.26% to 120.4 billion yen.Game and network services have performed well in recent quarters thanks to a shift to digital game purchases and the PlayStation Plus subscription service. Growth in hardware shipments has been comparably muted.KPop Demon HuntersDespite Sony's strong earnings showing, profit from its picture business shrank nearly 25% year over year. That was despite Sony Pictures Animation being behind this year's smash hit production, KPop Demon Hunters, which premiered on June 20. The film, which was produced by Sony, has reportedly become the most popular Netflix film ever, and continues to break streaming records, even for its original soundtrack. Despite the success, Sony has missed much of this upside due to selling the film's exclusive rights to Netflix.While the exact details of the deal are unknown, it was reported that Sony made an initial $25 million profit from producing the film for Netflix.Netflix saw K-pop Demon Hunters drive significant viewership and even contributed to its 17% revenue jump in its September quarter.However, in a bright spot for Sony, a sequel to the movie has already been confirmed, with Netflix reportedly providing the Japanese company a $15 million cash bonus for the first film's performance. ",

    "body": "U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) speaks to reporters as he walks to the Senate floor, more than a month into the longest U.S. government shutdown in Washington, D.C., U.S., November 10, 2025. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersThe Senate on Monday night passed a bill to fund the federal government through January and end the longest shutdown in U.S. history.The bill, which passed 60-40 with support from a handful of Democratic senators and nearly all Republicans, will be sent to the House of Representatives.If it passes the House, the bill will head to President Donald Trump to be signed into law.Trump earlier Monday said that he supports the funding deal, which was negotiated between Republicans and a gang of moderate Senate Democrats nearly six weeks after the shutdown began on Oct. 1.House Speaker Mike Johnson told his Republican conference earlier Monday that he wanted GOP House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., for a vote on the deal.US Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, Republican from Louisiana, speaks during a news conference on day 41 of the federal government shutdown, at the US Capitol on November 10, 2025, in Washington, DC. Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty ImagesHouse members were told that votes on the deal could begin by 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday.Before the Senate vote, Johnson refused to commit to the deal's key guarantee to Democrats: that Congress will hold a separate vote in December on potentially extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. That vote would be on a bill of the Democrats' choosing, according to the Senate agreement.\"I'm not committing to it or not committing to it,\" Johnson, R-La., said on CNN.Those subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of December, help reduce the cost of individual health insurance plans for more than 20 million Americans.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesUntil Sunday night, when the Senate passed the first stage of the newly negotiated deal, Democratic senators almost without exception refused to vote to reopen the government because the original House Republican bill did not extend the ACA tax credits.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., angrily condemned the deal on Sunday night for not ensuring that the subsidies will survive into 2026, as many Americans will face much higher insurance prices without them.The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdown, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay \"at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"— CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.",

    "body": "The logo of Japanese company SoftBank Group is seen outside the company's headquarters in Tokyo on January 22, 2025. Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesSoftBank's continued push into AI with investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI and PayPay helped the Japanese giant post a $19 billion gain on its Vision Fund in its fiscal second quarter.The broader Vision Fund segment factors in non-investment performance such as administrative expenses and gains and losses attributable to third-party investors. The value of the fund had risen $4.8 billion in the company's fiscal first quarter.Softbank is ploughing ahead with its push into artificial intelligence, investing and acquiring firms that will bolster its presence in robots and Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI).AI revenues reached \"new highs\" in the quarter ended Sept. 30 with 93% of annualized growth, Softbank said in a investor briefing on the results. Gains from the company's investment in OpenAI totaled 2.2 trillion yen ($14.3 billion) in the quarter.\"The reason we were able to have this result is because of September last year, that was the first time we invested in OpenAI,\" said SoftBank's Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto during an investor presentation. He added, in comments translated by the company, that OpenAI's latest valuation milestone of $500 billion marks one of the largest valuations in the world, according to fair value.The company also said Tuesday that it will conduct a four-for-one stock split at the end of the year in a bid to make its shares more accessible to investors and to further expand its shareholder base.\"Our share price recently has been going up and down dynamically… we want to provide as many invest opportunities as possible,\" said Goto.Here's how SoftBank fared in the fiscal second quarter:Profit more than doubled to 2.5 trillion yen in the quarter, versus 206.89 billion yen expected, according to LSEG consensus estimates. It also compares to 1.18 trillion yen profit a year earlier.Revenue was 1.92 trillion in the quarter, in line with an LSEG estimate of 1.9 trillion yen.AI jittersThe Japanese conglomerate's stock has slumped in the past week as concerns of an AI bubble sent jitters through global markets. Nearly $50 billion in market cap was wiped out from the stock last week, marking its worst weekly loss since March 2020. However, shares are up over 140% this year as its tech investment arm has showed signs of recovery.Last month Softbank reportedly approved its final tranche of funding to complete its $30 billion investment in OpenAI. The Japanese firm's investment in the ChatGPT maker came with a caveat — that its total investment could be slashed to as low as $20 billion if OpenAI didn't restructure into a for-profit entity by Dec. 31.The AI startup recently completed its recapitalization, cementing its structure as a nonprofit with a controlling stake in its for-profit business, which is now a public benefit corporation called OpenAI Group PBC.Softbank said in its earning statement Tuesday that it will invest an additional $22.5 billion in OpenAI through its Vision Fund 2 in December.— CNBC's Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.",

The firm said in its earnings statement that it sold 32.1 million Nvidia shares in October. It also disclosed that it sold part of its T-Mobile stake for $9.17 billion.\"We want to provide a lot of investment opportunities for investors, while we can still maintain financial strength,\" said SoftBank's Chief Financial Officer Yoshimitsu Goto during an investor presentation. \"So through those options and tools we make sure that we are ready for funding in a very safe manner,\" he said in comments translated by the company, adding that the stake sales were part of the firm's strategy for \"asset monetization.\"Nvidia shares dipped 0.95% in premarket trade on Tuesday.While the Nvidia exit may come as a surprise to some investors, it's not the first time SoftBank has cashed out of the American AI chip darling.SoftBank's Vision Fund was an early backer of Nvidia, reportedly amassing a $4 billion stake in 2017 before selling all of its holdings in January 2019.

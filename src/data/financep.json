    "body": "PayPal CEO Alex Chriss speaks at the Global Fintech Fest in Mumbai, India, on Oct. 7, 2025.Indranil Aditya | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPayPal said Monday that it has applied for approval to form PayPal Bank, which would be able to offer loans to small businesses.\"Establishing PayPal Bank will strengthen our business and improve our efficiency, enabling us to better support small business growth and economic opportunities across the U.S.,\" PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said in a statement.The U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will review an application proposing the establishment of PayPal Bank, along with Utah's Department of Financial Institutions, PayPal said. The company, which owns popular payment app Venmo, hopes to also offer interest-bearing savings accounts to its customers, the statement said. PayPal already makes credit lines available to consumers and has been trying to expand its roster of banking-like services as it competes with a growing number of fintech companies that are aiming to take business from traditional brick-and-mortar banks.Shares of PayPal rose 1.5% in extended trading following the announcement. In October, PayPal said quarterly revenue increased 7% year over year to $8.42 billion, more than analysts had expected. But in 2025 the stock has slumped about 29%, while the S&P 500 index has gained almost 16% in the same period.WATCH: E-commerce consumption could bump 20% because of agentic AI, says Mizuho's Dan Dolevwatch now",

    "body": "President Donald Trump smiles from the field before the 126th America's Game between the Army Black Knights and the Navy Midshipmen at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore, Dec. 13, 2025.Patrick Smith | Getty ImagesThe United States has collected more than $200 billion in tariffs this year as a result of new duties imposed by President Donald Trump since the beginning of 2025, the Customs and Border Protection agency said Monday.The tally comes as the Supreme Court considers arguments that the new tariffs are illegal. The $200 billion tally is only for the new tariffs, not for tariffs imposed during Trump's first term in the White House. Those earlier tariffs do not face legal challenges, as the new tariffs do.Trump earlier this year unilaterally imposed, without congressional authorization, what he calls reciprocal tariffs on imports from most of the world's nations. He also imposed \"fentanyl tariffs\" on products from Canada, China and Mexico, in retaliation for what he said was those countries' failure to stem the flow of that deadly narcotic into the United States.A container ship at the Port of Long Beach in California, Sept. 9, 2025.Apu Gomes | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"Between Jan. 20 and Dec. 15, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection collected more than $200 billion in tariffs thanks to more than 40 executive orders put in place by President Donald Trump's Administration,\" CBP said, in a statement. \"This figure underscores CBP's effectiveness in promoting secure, fair, and compliant trade, strengthening America's national and economic security.\"In November, tariff collections declined for the first time since Trump announced his broad new tariffs in April. The government collected $30.75 billion in tariffs last month, a slight drop from the $31.15 billion collected in October.Read more CNBC politics coverageTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

American officials said any such assurance from the U.S. would require congressional approval.\"We believe the Russians, in a final deal, will accept all these things, which will allow for a … strong and free Ukraine,\" one official said.

Lee previously led corporate development for Google Cloud and Google DeepMind. He worked on several of Google's high-profile acquisitions, including its $32 billion purchase of the cloud security startup Wiz, which the company announced in March. In his new role, Lee will have broad visibility across OpenAI as the company focuses on strategic investments and M&A in its next phase of growth, the spokesperson said. His hiring signals that OpenAI will continue to hunt for targets that can help it gain an edge over rivals like Google and Anthropic.OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit research lab in 2015, but its valuation has ballooned to $500 billion since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022. The AI lab has made multiple acquisitions this year. Most recently, OpenAI earlier this month announced a definitive agreement to acquire Neptune, a startup that helps with AI model training. The companies did not disclose the terms.OpenAI also bought a small company called Software Applications Incorporated for an undisclosed sum in October, the product development startup Statsig for $1.1 billion in September and former Apple designer Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for more than $6 billion in May.Lee is the latest of several executives to join OpenAI as the company looks to fill out its leadership bench. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced Slack CEO Denise Dresser will serve as its chief revenue officer. In May, the company announced it hired Fidji Simo, who was then CEO of Instacart, as the head of the AI lab's applications business.The Information was first to report Lee's departure from Google.WATCH: OpenAI unveils GPT-5.2, its strongest AI model for professional usewatch now",

Frontier said Biffle would stay on in an \"advisory capacity\" until the end of the year.Biffle had been Frontier's chief executive since March 2016 and has a more than three-decade career in airlines, including at the country's longtime top budget carrier, Spirit, which is currently in its second bankruptcy in less than a year.Frontier lost $190 million in the first nine months of the year, compared with net income of $31 million a year earlier.Frontier had been in talks to merge with Spirit several times since early 2022, but none have solidified thus far.watch nowSmaller budget airlines like Frontier have struggled to produce steady profits in the wake of the pandemic, as higher labor and other costs, consumer tastes shifting to international travel and higher-end seats, and an oversupply of domestic capacity have hurt financial results.Biffle led some of Frontier's initiatives in recent months to cater to customers seeking more space on board. Frontier's shares are down nearly 19% so far this year, while the NYSE Arca Airline Index, which tracks mostly U.S. airlines, is up more than 6%.",

Hannah Mckay | ReutersPresident Donald Trump filed a defamation lawsuit against the BBC in Miami federal court on Monday night, seeking at least $5 billion in damages.The civil complaint accuses the British Broadcasting Corporation of producing a \"false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction of President Trump\" in a Panorama documentary aired one week before the 2024 election.Trump's suit alleges the documentary was produced as part of \"a brazen attempt to interfere in and influence the Election's outcome to President Trump's detriment.\"The suit notes that the documentary, titled \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" was edited to make it appear that during his Jan. 6, 2021, speech outside the White House, Trump had explicitly urged his supporters to attack the U.S. Capitol.\"The Panorama Documentary falsely depicted President Trump telling supporters: 'We're going to walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,' \" the suit says. \"President Trump never uttered this sequence of words.\"In fact, the suit says, the sentence containing the words \"And we fight\" was uttered by Trump nearly 55 minutes after he said the words \"I'll be there with you.\"BBC Chair Samir Shah recently apologized for an \"error of judgment\"  over the edit, and the broadcaster's director general and head of news both resigned.The BBC apologized to Trump on Nov. 13, and promised not to air the documentary again or show it on any of its platforms.\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip  was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation  claim,\" the broadcaster said in a statement on Nov. 13.Read more CNBC politics coverageTSA is giving airline passenger data to ICE for deportation push: NYTTrump's AI order may be 'illegal,' Democrats and consumer advocacy groups claimTrump sued by preservation group seeking to halt White House ballroom projectTrump says 'no big deal' after new Epstein photos showing him releasedPutin can fund war for years, ex-official says as Trump's resolve is testedIndiana redistricting bill that Trump demanded defeated in state SenateHouse passes INVEST Act to ease investment standards, boost capital in marketsDOJ fails again to indict New York AG James, a Trump target: ReportsTrump 'sells out' U.S. national security with Nvidia chip sales to China: WarrenTrump pushes for top prosecutor nominee Halligan after Comey, James cases tossedTrump willing to seize more oil tankers off Venezuela coast: White HouseSeized tanker will go to U.S. port, Trump admin intends 'to seize the oil'GOP lawmakers seek Trump aid for agricultural equipment after tariff pressureTrump says Fed could have 'at least doubled' latest interest rate cut'Spoof' ship: Seized oil tanker hid location, visited Iran and VenezuelaTrump admin touts pulling 9,500 truckers off road for failing English testsSwiss government says new 15% U.S. tariff ceiling retroactive to mid-NovemberHomeland Security Dept. buying Boeing 737s for ICE deportationsTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

The word has previously been used primarily to connote a \"product of little value\" or \"food waste fed to animals\" Mainstream social networks saw a flood of AI-generated content, including what 404 Media described as a \"video of a bizarre creature turning into a spider, turning into a nightmare giraffe inside of a busy mall,\" that the publication reported had been viewed more than 362 million times on Meta apps. In September, Meta launched Vibes, a separate feed for AI-generated videos. Days later, OpenAI released its Sora app. Those services, along with TikTok, YouTube and others, are increasingly rife with AI slop, which can often generate revenue with enough engagement. Spotify said in September that it had to remove over 75 million AI-generated, \"spammy tracks\" from its service, and roll out formal policies to protect artists from AI impersonation and deception. The streaming company faced widespread criticism after The Velvet Sundown racked up 1 million monthly listeners on without initially making it clear they produced their songs with generative AI. The artist later clarified on its bio page that it's a \"synthetic music project.\"According to CNBC's latest All-America Economic Survey, published Dec. 15, fewer respondents have been using AI platforms, such as ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini, in the last two to three months compared to the summer months. Just 48% of those surveyed said they had used AI platforms recently, down from 53% in August. WATCH: OpenAI's Sora 2 sparks AI 'slop' backlashwatch now",

John Lamparski | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump slammed Rob Reiner on Monday morning, a day after the famed Hollywood director and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found brutally slain in their Los Angeles home.Trump's social-media screed against Reiner, who was a staunch critic of the president, came as the Reiners' 32-year-old son Nick was arrested and held on $4 million bond, according to LA County Sheriff's Department jail records. Nick Reiner was booked on suspicion of murder.Trump suggested that the couple was killed because of \"the anger\" Rob Reiner caused in other people due to his opposition to the Republican president. However, there is no evidence to suggest that this is the case, and the police have not provided any motive.Trump, during comments to reporters later, doubled down and expanded on criticism of Reiner, even after a number of Republicans said that he was wrong to do so.\"He was a deranged person as far as Trump is concerned,\" Trump said.The president accused Reiner of promoting \"the Russian hoax,\" saying \"that I was a friend of Russia, controlled by Russia.\"\"He was one of the people behind it,\" Trump said. \"So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner at all in any way, shape, or form.

I challenge anyone to defend it,\" he added.Massie has been targeted by Trump for months after co-sponsoring a petition in the House that led to passage of a law directing the Justice Department to release its investigative files about notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.

There will be committee chairs  who will be able to hold meetings, and this is the last thing he  wants.\"Reiner's movies included \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally,\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"He first gained fame as playing the son-in-law of Archie Bunker on the classic television show \"All in the Family.\"",

    "body": "watch nowDETROIT — Ford Motor expects to record about $19.5 billion in special items related to a restructuring of its business priorities and a pullback in its all-electric vehicle investments, the company announced Monday.The Detroit automaker said most of those charges will occur during the fourth quarter. That will be followed by $5.5 billion in cash to be charged through 2027, and the majority of that chunk will be paid next year, Ford said.The charges will impact the automaker's net results but not its adjusted earnings. The automaker said Monday it was increasing its guidance of adjusted earnings before interest and taxes to about $7 billion in 2025. That's in line with a target from earlier this year, before the company lowered expectations to between $6 billion and $6.5 billion in adjusted EBIT in October.The charges announced Monday, including $8.5 billion in write-downs of EV assets, are connected to major changes to Ford's business plans. The new plans include refocusing investments on hybrid vehicles, including plug-in models rather than pure EVs; canceling a next generation of large all-electric trucks in exchange for smaller, more affordable EVs; and a rebalancing of its investments in core products such as trucks and SUVs.The changes are the latest under Ford CEO Jim Farley and his \"Ford+\" restructuring plan that has taken on many different forms since he initially announced it as an EV growth plan in 2021. \"We evaluated the market, and we made the call,\" Farley told CNBC's \"Closing Bell Overtime\" on Monday. \"We're following customers to where the market is, not where people thought it was going to be, but where it is today.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconFord, GM and Stellantis stocks.The EV segment has experienced a sales slump domestically after the Trump administration put an early end in September to a $7,500 federal tax credit previously available for EV buyers in the U.S. Farley said on CNBC that policy \"wasn't the only reason why we made this choice,\" but he acknowledged it did play a role. Ford also said Monday that its all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup will transition to an extended-range EV, or EREV, that includes an electric powertrain as well as a gas-powered generator, and it announced plans to use battery plants in Kentucky and Michigan for a new stationary energy storage business.\"The last couple of months have been really clear to us,\" Farley told CNBC's Phil LeBeau. \"The very high-end EVs — the $50,000, $70,000, $80,000 vehicles — they just weren't selling.\"Ford said the changes are expected to provide \"a path to profitability\" for its Model e electric vehicle business by 2029, targeting annual improvements beginning in 2026. The automaker also said it expects the changes to improve profits in its traditional Ford Blue unit and Ford Pro commercial and fleet business \"over time with early signs of benefits in 2026.\"The automaker said it expects approximately 50% of its global volume by 2030 will be hybrids, EREVs and fully electric vehicles, up from 17% in 2025.\"These are big decisions that we believe will pay off for years to come for our customers, our employees, American jobs and manufacturing,\" Andrew Frick, president of the Model e and Blue businesses, said Monday during a media call. \"Ford is following the customer. We are looking at the market as it is today, not just as everyone predicted it to be five years ago.\"Ford said it will concentrate its North American electric vehicle development on its new, low-cost, flexible Universal EV Platform that's expected to underpin a \"high-volume family of smaller, highly efficient and affordable electric vehicles.\"The first vehicle from the new platform will be a \"fully connected midsize pickup truck\" assembled at the company's Louisville Assembly Plant starting in 2027.The company also expects its new storage business to be producing and shipping units by 2027 for things such as \"data centers, the electric gird and much more,\" Frick said.\"This is a compelling opportunity. It's a market with huge potential and strong demand,\" he said. \"We will have 20 gigawatt hours of annual capacity for this market.\"Ford stock rose about 2% in after-hours trading Monday.Shares of Ford closed Monday at $13.65, down less than 1%. Ford stock as of Monday's close was up nearly 40% this year.",

Siders spent more than 12 years at Palantir, where he most recently served as chief information officer, overseeing global IT operations, business applications and infrastructure. He began his career at the company as an IT helpdesk engineer. Palantir has been one of the best performers on the stock market during the artificial intelligence boom, jumping by almost thirtyfold since the end 2022.Thrive, founded by Josh Kushner, launched Thrive Holdings in April, creating a division to own and operate companies that it believes could benefit from technological transformations. Shield was launched in June by Thrive Holdings and investment firm ZBS Partners, with over $100 million in initial funding. Shield buys ownership stakes in IT services companies and tries to help them grow by giving them access to cutting-edge AI technology and engineering capabilities. \"If we're doing this right, we're going to see a lot of value created all the way up the chain, from end customer all the way through to us here at Shield,\" Siders told CNBC in an interview. \"These are great businesses, and they're going to be rising up even more.\"As of December, Shield works with seven companies and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue this year, Thrive said.

To help align incentives and encourage companies to participate, the IT services organizations that Shield backs retain equity in their companies.Siders kicks off his tenure as Shield CEO on Monday, and he said his initial focus will be on understanding its existing partners and searching for potential targets. He said Shield will be ambitious in the next few quarters.   \"There's a whole industry out there, people who've spent their careers trying to deliver this value for everybody's benefit,\" Siders said. \"This is a unique and special thing to attack that.\"Correction: A prior version of this story mischaracterized part of the agreement between Shield and the organizations it backs.

    "body": "Broadcom CEO Hock Tan.Lucas Jackson | ReutersIn at least one corner of the artificial intelligence market, sentiment has turned decidedly negative. Broadcom, CoreWeave and Oracle, three companies intimately tied to the AI infrastructure buildout, all had another rough day on Wall Street on Monday after selling off sharply last week. While the three stocks are all still solidly up for the year — CoreWeave held its market debut in March — the most recent trend suggests that investors are concerned about whether the returns on investment will ever justify the level of spending taking place. \"It definitely requires the ROI to be there to keep funding this AI investment,\" Matt Witheiler, head of late-stage growth at Wellington Management, told CNBC's \"Money Movers\" on Monday. \"From what we've seen so far that ROI is there.\"Witheiler said the bullish side of the story is that, \"every single AI company on the planet is saying if you give me more compute I can make more revenue.\"Still, the market was displeased last week with quarterly earnings reports from chipmaker Broadcom and cloud infrastructure supplier Oracle, even though both companies beat on revenue and issued forecasts showing that AI demand is soaring.watch nowOracle, which is now heavily reliant on the debt markets to fund its data center development, provided scant details about how it will continue to finance its commitments. The company said it would ramp up capital expenditures in the current fiscal year to $50 billion from an earlier forecast of $35 billion because of new contracts from the likes of Meta and Nvidia.It's also ratcheting up leases. As of Nov. 30, Oracle had $248 billion in lease commitments for data centers and cloud capacity commitments that will run for 15 to 19 years. That's up 148% from the end of August.Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said he expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, driven by both custom chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking.However, as the company spends heavily on more parts to produce server racks, investors are going to have to stomach a hit to profits. CFO Kirsten Spears said on Broadcom's earnings call that \"gross margins will be lower\" for some of the company's AI chip systems.Broadcom shares fell 5.6% on Monday following an 11% slump on Friday, leaving them 18% below their record high reached on Wednesday.Oracle dropped  2.7% on Monday and is now down 17% in the past three trading days. The company has lost 46% of its value since Sept. 10, when the stock had its best day since 1992 following disclosure of a massive AI backlog.  Venture capitalist Tomasz Tunguz, who focuses on enterprise software and AI, wrote in a Monday blog that Oracle's recent fundraising binge has left it with a debt-to-equity ratio of 500%, \"dwarfing its cloud computing peers.\" Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google all have ratios between 7% and 23%, he wrote. Tunguz, founder of Theory Ventures, said the other company with a notably high ratio, at 120%, is CoreWeave, which provides cloud computing services built largely around Nvidia's graphics processing units. CoreWeave shares fell about 8% on Monday after dropping 11% last week. The company has lost more than 60% of its value from its high in June. WATCH: Oracle financing in questionwatch now",

    "body": "The stock market graphic of Zillow Group is displayed on a smartphone with the logo of Zillow in the background on Feb. 21, 2021.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesZillow shares plunged more than 9% on Monday on worries that the online real estate platform could have a big new competitor: Google Search. Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results. Over the weekend, real estate tech strategist Mike DelPrete published mobile phone screenshots of Google Search results showing real estate listings, which appeared to be powered by real estate data company HouseCanary. The listings enabled users to view the full details of a property's page, request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com's online marketplace portal. Google's home searches appear to work only in select markets and on mobile devices as testing is underway.The decline in Zillow signals investors are bracing for the eventual impact of Google's foray into the real estate market. The company, which saw shares drop more than 11% at one point during Monday's session, lost about $1.6 billion in market cap. Zillow's market cap now sits at about $16.26 billion.However, Wall Street analysts were quick to point out that Zillow's exposure to organic search is fairly small, limiting potential downside at least in the near term as more details around Google's product come to light. Wells Fargo analyst Alec Brondolo, who has an equal weight rating on Zillow, said he would not \"expect a meaningful financial impact from listings on Google shifting from organic to paid\" — given that Zillow is not overly dependent on organic search results for traffic.\"The listings product appears similar to Google Hotel Metasearch results; introduction could increase traffic cost to Zillow, but disintermediation unlikely,\" Brondolo said in a Monday note to clients. \"In the hotel category, Google merchandises hotel rooms in search results as a metasearch ad product for OTAs. We would expect a similar approach in real estate, with Zillow, Homes.com, Realtor.com, etc. bidding for home listing ad units rather than Google attempting to monetize directly with an ad product sold to agents.\"Stock Chart IconStock chart iconZillow stock over the past year.But some analysts see Google's testing as a longer-term headwind to Zillow and other online real estate portals.Goldman Sachs' Michael Ng wrote in a note to clients that he believes the search engine's real estate listings, which he said are an advertising format for buy-side agents, directly compete with Zillow's Premier Agent program by \"facilitating lead generation\" for agents from prospective buyers.\"While we don't expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow's business, given that most of Zillow's traffic is direct (e.g., Zillow.com, StreetEasy.com, mobile apps) and Google's new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers, we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,\" Ng, who remains neutral on Zillow, wrote in a note to clients. Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer said that Google's expansion into real estate could impact the number of consumers going to Zillow.com — which was 228 million in the third quarter — and therefore could take a hit on the company's ability to monetize its platform. \"The impact would likely take years to play out and would need to be rolled out across the US to meaningfully impact real estate portal traffic,\" Helfstein said in a recent note.Zillow shares are down more than 8% year to date. Neither Google nor Zillow responded immediately to CNBC's request for comment. watch now",

    "body": "A vehicle Tesla is using for robotaxi testing purposes on Oltorf Street in Austin, Texas, US, on Sunday, June 22, 2025. The launch of Tesla Inc.'s driverless taxi service Sunday is set to begin modestly, with a handful of vehicles in limited areas of the city. Photographer: Tim Goessman/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesTim Goessman | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesNearly six months after launching a limited Robotaxi service in Austin, Texas with safety drivers in the car, the company says it's testing driverless vehicles in the city without humans on board.\"Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,\" CEO Elon Musk wrote in a post on his social network X over the weekend.  Shares of Tesla rose 3.6% to $475.31 at the close of trading on Monday. The stock is now up 18% for the year, and is about 1% off its record reached in December 2024. For more than a decade, Musk has been promising Tesla investors and customers that the company's electric vehicles will soon be upgradable to self-driving cars, capable of serving as unmanned robotaxis, or of completing a cross-country trip without any human intervention.While that still hasn't happened, the company unveiled a Robotaxi-branded ridehail app and service in Austin in June, and a separate car service in the San Francisco Bay Area soon after. On Sunday, Tesla's official account wrote in a pair of posts on X, \"The fleet will wake up via over-the-air software update,\" and \"Slowly then all at once.\" \"And so it begins!\" wrote Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of AI software, in a post on X, in response to a video that had been posted by someone else of what appeared to be driverless vehicle in Austin.Tesla hasn't said when it will be able to operate a ride-hailing service without human safety supervisors or drivers on board. But it may have still have a long way to go.Elon Musk interviews on CNBC from the Tesla Headquarters in Texas. CNBCTesla reported that, as of mid-October, seven collisions had occurred in the vehicles in its Austin fleet. The cars include ADS, or automated driving systems, which are not yet widely available, and human safety supervisors in the passenger seat or behind the steering wheel. The self-reported data Tesla filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration indicate that the collisions were not severe.Philip Koopman, emeritus professor at Carnegie Mellon University and an autonomous systems safety researcher, said in an email that with such a small fleet, there should have been fewer than seven reportable accidents, \"especially considering that there is a safety supervisor in each one whose job is to prevent crashes.\" Tesla's Robotaxi fleet in Austin was comprised of 30 or fewer vehicles as of October. Musk has said the company intends to double that to 60 by the end of 2025.Koopman noted that Tesla has chosen to hide the \"narrative description\" of all their crashes in the reports to NHTSA, so there's no way for the public to know what transpired with each collision. Tesla didn't respond to a request for further information. In Texas, autonomous vehicle makers are currently permitted to test or use their cars on public roads as long as they comply with traffic laws under the state's transportation code. The Texas Department of Motor Vehicles told CNBC in an email that it \"does not have direct authority related to autonomous vehicle regulation and therefore cannot speak to current activities\" regarding Tesla. Regulatory requirements in Texas will change in 2026 with the implementation of its Senate Bill 2807, which the Texas legislature passed earlier this year. As of May 28, 2026, autonomous vehicle operators in Texas will require an authorization from the DMV for commercial use of their self-driving vehicles on Texas roads. California's DMV and Public Utilities Commissions confirmed that Tesla has not yet applied for permits needed to conduct driverless testing in the state without a human at the wheel, or to operate a commercial robotaxi service.In the autonomous vehicles market, Tesla lags behind Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S., and Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide in Asia. Those companies are all operating commercial ridehailing robotaxi services in major markets.Correction: A prior version of this story had an incorrect closing price for Tesla's stock.

    "body": "Colin Angle, co-founder and CEO of iRobot Corp., speaks during a Prime Air delivery drone reveal event in Las Vegas, June 5, 2019.Joe Buglewicz | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesColin Angle, co-founder and former CEO of iRobot, on Monday said the company's move to declare bankruptcy was \"profoundly disappointing\" and \"nothing short of a tragedy for consumers.\"The robotic vacuum pioneer announced Sunday that it filed for bankruptcy and will be taken private by Shenzhen Picea Robotics, a lender and key supplier, following years of financial struggles.\"Today's outcome is profoundly disappointing — and it was avoidable,\" Angle told CNBC in a statement. \"This is nothing short of a tragedy for consumers, the robotics industry and America's innovation economy.\"In a Sunday court filing, iRobot said it had between $100 million and $500 million of assets and liabilities. The company said it owes almost $100 million to its new owner Picea, more than $5.8 million to GXO Logistics and roughly $3.4 million to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for unpaid tariffs, among other liabilities.Shares of iRobot plunged more than 72% on Monday.watch nowFounded in 1990 by Angle and two other researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, iRobot got its start making military and defense tech for the government before launching its flagship Roomba product in 2002 that cemented it as an early leader in the robotic vacuum cleaner market. The company's future has remained uncertain after Amazon abandoned its planned $1.7 billion acquisition of the company in January 2024, citing regulatory scrutiny from the European Union and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Afterward, iRobot laid off 31% of staff and Angle announced he would step down as CEO and board chair. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called regulators' efforts to block the deal a \"sad story\" and said it would've given iRobot a competitive boost against rivals. The Amazon acquisition was \"the most viable path\" for iRobot to compete globally, Angle said Monday. He added that iRobot's bankruptcy serves as a \"warning\" for competition watchdogs. Helen Greiner, one of iRobot's co-founders, said in a Monday LinkedIn post that the company's restructuring plan under a Chinese owner isn't good for \"consumers, employees, stockholders, Massachusetts or the USA.\" The company had been facing growing competition from cheaper, rapidly growing rivals, such as China-based Anker, Ecovacs and Roborock. Supply chain constraints in recent years added further strain to iRobot's business, as it struggled to navigate shipping and inventory delays, which dented its revenue.Its financial outlook darkened significantly after the Amazon deal fell apart, and in October, iRobot said it would be forced to seek bankruptcy protection if it failed to secure more capital or find a buyer.Gary Cohen, iRobot CEO, said in a statement Monday that the restructuring plan would help secure the company's \"long-term future.\" The bankruptcy proceedings aren't expected to disrupt its products' functionality or customer support, iRobot said. The company's third-quarter sales came in at $145.8 million, down almost 25% from $193.4 million one year earlier, and iRobot has about $190 million in debt. ",

Those actions included sending a congratulatory gift to Ivanka Trump and having the company donate $100,000 to Trump's inaugural fund, while seeking meetings with high-level administration associates, according to the lawsuit.Khanna accuses Instacart of violating rules against blocking employee's political activities, and of wrongfully firing her \"in violation of the fundamental public policy of the State of California.\"She is asking for a jury trial and seeks both punitive and compensatory damages, \"including emotional distress damages and economic damages.\"She is also asking a judge to order Instacart to \"provide mandatory and meaningful training to all executives, managers, and employees regarding the laws prohibiting interference with and retaliation against employees for their political actions and political activities.\"",

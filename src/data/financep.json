    "body": "In September, The Economist released its third annual \"Carrie Bradshaw index,\" named after the protagonist of the hit TV show \"Sex and the City.\" The report ranks the U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live alone.The index was named after the character because, on the show, she lives in a studio apartment in the West Village and it is highly unlikely that she could afford it on a writer's salary now, Lizzy Peet, a data researcher at The Economist, tells CNBC Make It.\"It all came about from a sort of snappy way to sum up the aspiration, a sort of quality of living by yourself in a big city for the first time. How much would you have to earn to afford that? And how much is that a realist prospect?\" she says.To rank the U.S. cities, The Economist used the rule that a tenant should spend no more than 30% of their gross income on rent. That, in combination with using rental prices from Zumper, led to the calculation of the salary needed to afford a typical studio in each city. Each city was given a \"Bradshaw score\" where a value more than one means an average studio apartment is affordable and less than one means housing is unaffordable.\"Cities that build a lot or maybe that have less demand or maybe have less population demand on rent are the kind of cities that are looking more affordable,\" Peet says.One big change in this year's index is that some cities that were affordable last year have slid into the unaffordable category this year, Peet adds.A lot of cities in Texas, like Dallas, Houston, and Austin, moved from what was deemed affordable to what is now deemed unaffordable.\"There are loads of factors at work here. It's important to know that rental markets can be quite random, but they can fluctuate a lot in a very short space of time,\" Peet says. \"It's pretty well documented that Texas has seen this influx of middle-class workers, and that would drive rent up.\"In this year's index, 41 cities were unaffordable, up from 38 cities last year.Wichita, KansasCweimer4 | E+ | Getty Images10 U.S. cities where Americans can afford to live aloneWichita, Kan.Baton Rouge, La.Lincoln, Neb.Des Moines, IowaAkron, OhioTucson, Ariz.Tulsa, Okla.St. Louis, Mo.Albuquerque, N.M.Aurora, Colo.Wichita, Kansas, is the most affordable city in the index. It has a Bradshaw score of around 1.75, which means that median wages in the city are 75% higher than needed to afford an average studio apartment.The average monthly rent for studio apartments in Wichita is $580, up 1.64% from last month, but down 10.54% year-over-year, according to Zumper.Residents of Wichita need to earn $26,400 a year to afford a studio, which is $20,250 less than the median wage.\"I'm not that surprised Wichita is the most affordable. A lot of the cities in the bottom 10 are off the beaten track and not huge economic powerhouses. It's an interesting dynamic,\" Peet says.\"There are still some perhaps less desirable cities that are surprisingly unaffordable and vice versa.\"Want to earn more and grow your money? Save 30% with this earnings-boosting bundle of our top courses.Plus, sign up for CNBC Make It's newsletter to get tips and tricks for success at work, with money and in life, and request to join our exclusive community on LinkedIn to connect with experts and peers.",

    "body": "The Zion Bank main office in Salt Lake City, Utah, US, on Friday, April 7, 2023. George Frey | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesZions Bancorporation lost $1 billion of its valuation in a single day on Thursday after disclosing $60 million worth of loans it had made that were unlikely to be repaid.What led to that point was a messy, tangled web of loans that Zions said were surreptitiously subordinated by the borrowers all while the collateral was effectively eliminated.Shares of regional banks tumbled on Thursday as fears mounted around the health of their lending businesses. Zions' 13% share plunge ended up sparking worries about possible broader issues with lending for the regional bank sector, knocking the whole U.S. stock market on Thursday with the Dow Jones Industrial average finishing lower by 300 points.Zions' subsidiary, California Bank & Trust, is suing Andrew Stupin and Gerald Marcil – the until now, relatively unknown managers of several funds utilizing the name \"Cantor Group,\" along with their associate Deba Shyam.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County on Wednesday, alleges, a \"sweeping betrayal of trust by sophisticated financial borrowers who abused CB&T's confidence, manipulated loan structures for their own enrichment, and systematically eliminated the collateral protections that were supposed to secure the bank's loans.\"Zions and a lawyer representing the defendants didn't respond to CNBC's multiple requests seeking comment. The relationship in question stemmed from about $60 million in financing that Zions' CB&T made in 2016 and 2017 to two related investment vehicles, Cantor Group II and Cantor Group IV.The credit facilities were to be used by the funds to purchase distressed residential and commercial mortgage loans.Zions said they had an underwritten agreement guaranteeing them first-priority interest, meaning the bank's claim on collateral was superior to other creditors' claims in the event of a default.However, the deeds that were supposed to secure the loans were ultimately subordinated without CB&T's knowledge, Zions said in the lawsuit.Those underlying properties were transferred to other entities or were in foreclosure, meaning the collateral was \"irretrievably lost,\" Zions claimed.And the new senior lenders, who replaced CB&T, were the same managers of the Cantor funds or those affiliated with the group, according to the suit. \"In effect, CB&T's losses became Defendants' gains,\" Zions said in the lawsuit. \"Acting through a web of affiliated companies, the borrowers and guarantors orchestrated a scheme that enriched themselves while stripping CB&T of its collateral, all while keeping the bank in the dark for years about the true status of its securities interests…\"The way that Zions found out about this was after a related Cantor fund, managed by the same leadership, was sued for fraud by Western Alliance.That caused CB&T to initiate its own investigation. Zions subsequently put out an 8-K on Wednesday, saying \"based on currently available information,\" it decided to take a provision for the $60 million outstanding loans and charge off $50 million, which will be reflected in third-quarter earnings when the company reports Monday.Western Alliance said in a separate 8-K following the Zions one that it had initiated its own lawsuit against Cantor, alleging fraud by the borrower for \"failing to provide collateral loans in the first position, among other claims.\" However, Western Alliance said it believes the existing collateral covers the obligation and affirmed its guidance. Western Alliance reports earnings on Tuesday.",

Cleveland Works steel mill in Cleveland, Ohio, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 17, 2022.Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCleveland-Cliffs is looking into building a rare earths mining business, CEO Lourenco Goncalves told investors Monday.The steelmaker has two sites in Michigan and Minnesota where geological surveys have found indications of rare earths, Goncalves said in a statement on Cleveland-Cliffs' third-quarter earnings.\"We are working with the geologists to assess whether these deposits could become commercially viable — that's where we are at,\" Goncalves told analysts on the company's earnings call later Monday morning. \"We are a mining company, this isn't new territory for us.\"Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs closed more than 20% higher at $16.18. The Cleveland headquartered steelmaker is experienced in mining iron ore.Rare earths are used to manufacture magnets that are key inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, electric vehicles, semiconductor fabrication, robotics and other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain and the U.S. is dependent on Beijing for imports. China announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, provoking President Donald Trump to threaten 100% tariffs in retaliation.The U.S. has only one commercial rare earths mine. The Defense Department struck a deal in July with the mine's owner, MP Materials, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors have been speculating that the Trump administration will strike similar deals with other U.S. companies that are trying to stand up domestic rare earths mines and processing facilities.Cleveland-Cliffs' sites in Michigan and Minnesota, if successful, would align the company with the administration's \"broader national strategy for critical mineral independence,\" Goncalves said.\"American manufacturing shouldn't rely on China or any foreign nation for essential minerals, and Cliffs intends to be part of the solution,\" the CEO said.",

    "body": "Shares of U.S.-listed companies related to the rare earth supply chain climbed on Monday as investors continued to weigh the impact of Chinese export restrictions on domestic producers.  Rare earths are minerals that are essential to many aspects of modern life, particularly for the technology sector and the energy transition, as they are used in everything from semiconductors, fighter jets to the motors of electric vehicles.Prime Minister Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed an agreement on Monday to invest in joint ventures to stand up a critical mineral and rare earth supply chain that is not dependent on China.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC in an exclusive interview last week that the Trump administration will set a price floors for a range of industries, including rare earths, to combat market manipulation by China. Shares of rare earth and critical mineral miners have rallied over the past several sessions as investors consider which firms might be future targets for the government's industrial policy.NioCorp led the sector's gains with an increase of nearly 20%. Energy Fuels rose about 7% while USA Rare Earth rallied nearly 14% and Perpetua Resources advanced more than 7%. MP Materials was also in the green, moving more than 2% higher. Canada's Lithium Americas increased nearly 3%The moves come as the Trump administration is working to build up its own domestic rare earth supply chain.The Defense Department struck a deal in July with MP Materials, which is the largest U.S. rare earth miner, that included an equity stake, a price floor and an offtake agreement.Investors are anticipating that the administration will back additional miners. William Blair initiated coverage of USA Rare Earth on Monday with an outperform rating on the expectation that the Trump administration \"could soon take a material stake in the company.\"Michael Silver, the CEO and chairman of rare earths distributor American Elements told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" last week that the U.S. has enough heavy rare metals for its military applications, but the supply chain squeeze could impact EVs, lasers, and \"quite a lot of commercial technology.\" watch nowGetting mines up and running should be \"treated as national priorities,\" Silver said, adding that there will likely be government involvement and subsidies.  Under new rules that were announced earlier this month, foreign companies now need Beijing's approval to export rare earths and are required to explain what they will be used for.  - CNBC's Spencer Kimball contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowTop White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett on Monday predicted the government shutdown is \"likely to end sometime this week.\"But if that does not happen, the Trump administration may impose \"stronger measures\" to force Democrats to cooperate, Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"The comments came deep into the third week of the shutdown, which is dragging on with no clear end in sight amid a partisan fight in the Senate over federal funding priorities.Republicans want to pass a short-term resolution to resume funding at current levels. Democrats demand that any stopgap bill include additional spending on health-care protections, including an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are due to expire at year's end.The GOP-backed bill failed to pass the Senate for the 11th time on Monday evening. The 50-43 vote fell mostly along party lines.watch nowHassett said on CNBC that he has heard from the Senate that Democrats thought it would be \"bad optics\" to vote to reopen the government before this weekend's massive nationwide \"No Kings\" protests against President Donald Trump.\"Now there's a shot that this week, things will come together, and very quickly,\" Hassett said. \"The moderate Democrats will move forward and get us an open government, at which point we could negotiate whatever policies they want to negotiate with regular order.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageBill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteGovernment shutdown: Senate bill fails for 10th time, Kelly tells Trump to get involvedJudge blocks Trump from firing federal workers during government shutdown for nowKristi Noem's shutdown airport video may violate Hatch Act, Sen.

But with numerous polls showing more voters blame Trump and Republicans for the impasse — and indicating strong support for extending the ACA health insurance subsidies — Democrats mostly haven't budged.\"Every day gets better for us,\" Schumer told Punchbowl News earlier this month, \"because we've thought about this long in advance and we knew that health care would be the focal point on Sept. 30 and we prepared for it.\"Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said last week that he has offered Democratic leaders a vote on extending the Obamacare tax credits in exchange for opening the government.But top Democrats appear to be rejecting Thune's entreaty. Instead, some Democrats are calling on Trump to participate in negotiations himself.Hassett said Monday that Trump \"has been very active throughout this process, but it's also his position that this is a thing that the Senate needs to work out.\"",

Microsoft is a key OpenAI investor and partner. Hoffman was also an early investor in OpenAI, Anthropic's larger rival, and remains a shareholder. He revealed on Monday that Greylock, where he's a partner, has invested in Anthropic.Greylock and Anthropic didn't respond to requests for comment.In a series of posts, Hoffman said he tries to avoid commenting directly about companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, but that \"in all industries, especially in AI, it's important to back the good guys.\"Read more CNBC tech news$500 purple cables put this little-known company in the middle of the AI boomNearly half of Kalshi's users saw glitches, delays during Saturday college football gamesSalesforce CEO apologizes for saying Trump should send National Guard to San FranciscoProxy advisor ISS recommends Tesla shareholders oppose Musk's $1 trillion pay planHoffman and Sacks were both early employees at PayPal, joining in 1999 and assuming major roles at the payments company. Along with Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, Max Levchin and a group of other high-profile techies, they were part of what became known as the PayPal mafia because of the number of successful companies they went on to build.But Hoffman and Sacks have been public antagonists recently, due mostly to their political differences. Hoffman is a major Democratic donor, contributing millions of dollars to Kamala Harris' unsuccessful presidential bid. Sacks emerged as a vocal Trump supporter ahead of the 2024 election before joining the administration. He hosted a fundraiser for Trump at his San Francisco mansion. Politics of AIAI has become an intensely political issue, mostly due to disagreements about safety issues and how it should be regulated.Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives and researchers who left the company over concerns about safety. Jack Clark, one of the startup's co-founders and its current head of policy, added fuel to the debate about regulation last week, publishing an essay called \"Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear.\"David Sacks, U.S. President Donald Trump's \"AI and Crypto Czar\", speaks to President Trump as he signs a series of executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 23, 2025 in Washington, DC.Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesSacks criticized the essay and, in a post on X, accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.\" He said the company is \"principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.\"Anthropic has repeatedly pushed back against efforts by the federal government to hinder state-level regulation of AI, including a Trump-backed provision that would have blocked those rules for 10 years.After Hoffman shared his thoughts about Anthropic on Monday, Sacks and Musk, who owns a competing AI company called xAI and was also a major early figure in the second Trump administration, were quick to respond.\"The leading funder of lawfare and dirty tricks against President Trump wants you to know that 'Anthropic is one of the good guys,'\" Sacks wrote in response to Hoffman on Monday. \"Thanks for clarifying that. All we needed to know.\"\"Indeed,\" Musk said in a reply.The chirping went back and forth on Monday.\"Shows you didn't read the post (not shocked),\" Hoffman wrote. \"When you are ready to have a professional conversation about AI's impact on America, I'm here to chat.\"Jason Calacanis, who co-hosts the All-In podcast, along with Sacks and two other tech friends, wrote in response to Hoffman that he should \"come on the pod,\" inviting him this week. Hoffman previously joined for an episode at the end of August, roughly two months before the presidential election.Hoffman wrote that he is \"open to coming back on\" but that \"this week is packed.\"— CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos contributed to this reportWATCH: Anthropic’s Mike Krieger on new model release and the race to build real-world AI agentswatch now",

The indictment was returned less than a week before a five-year statute of limitations was set to expire.",

Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of some of Australia's largest critical metals and rare earths companies surged on Tuesday following the announcement of a massive minerals deal between Washington and Canberra worth up to $8.5 billion.The agreement — signed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday — includes funding for multiple projects aimed at boosting the supply of key materials used in defense manufacturing and energy security.Lynas Rare Earths, Australia's largest rare earths producer by market capitalization, jumped about 4.7% in early Asia trading. Mineral sand miner Iluka Resources advanced more than 9% while lithium producer Pilbara Minerals added roughly 5%.Other smaller rare earth miners also made gains, with VHM soaring around 30%, while Northern Minerals popped over 16%. Meanwhile, Latrobe Magnesium, Australia's primary producer of the critical metal magnesium, rose nearly 47%. NYSE-listed Alcoa, which is developing a project in Western Australia to recover and refine the critical metal gallium, was identified as one of the two priority projects under the new minerals deal. Washington will make an equity investment in the initiative.Shares of Alcoa, also traded on the Australian Securities Exchange through depositary receipts, rose nearly 10%.Rare earths and critical metals are essential for high-tech products such as electric vehicles, semiconductors and defense equipment. China, the global leader in the production of rare earths and many other critical minerals, has tightened export controls on the materials amid a trade war with the U.S., accelerating international efforts to diversify global supply chains. Albanese said the two countries will each contribute $1 billion over the next six months for projects that are \"immediately available.\"However, a White House fact sheet later stated that Washington and Canberra will invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the same period, describing the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, potentially unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.",

Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump is stepping up his calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco at the very moment that the city is undergoing a post-pandemic resurgence, propelled by artificial intelligence.Crime rates are down 30% from 2024, homicide levels hit their lowest levels in 70 years and car break-ins haven't been this low in 22 years. Meanwhile, event bookings and tourism are on the rise, residential real estate is becoming more scarce and the office market is heating up.Business momentum in the city is largely built on the AI boom.New data from CBRE show venture capital funding in 2025 is expected to surpass the record high of $276 billion hit in 2021. The bulk of that investment has been in San Francisco and Silicon Valley, where 80% of AI venture funding through the third quarter has been targeted to the tune of $115 billion.By the end of the September, the San Francisco Bay Area was already 35% above its previous annual investment peak, according to CBRE's VC Funding analysis.\"San Franciscans are feeling positive about the direction of our city once again,\" Daniel Lurie, the city's Democratic mayor said in a statement last week released by Governor Gavin Newsom's office. \"And we are going to continue working every single day to build on this progress and keep our city safe 365 days a year.\"The statement was meant to tout the successful efforts of local law enforcement ahead of Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference last week. The issue became particularly controversial after Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told the New York Times that he'd support Trump's call for federal troops to be sent to San Francisco. His sentiments were publicly supported by Elon Musk and David Sacks, high-profile techies with close ties to the Trump Administration.On Friday, facing mounting criticism, Benioff backtracked, posting on X that, \"Having listened closely to my fellow San Franciscans and our local officials, and after the largest and safest Dreamforce in our history, I do not believe the National Guard is needed to address safety in San Francisco.\"watch nowThe Trump administration recently deployed the National Guard to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, sparking protests and lawsuits. Over the weekend, President Trump repeated his plans to send troops to San Francisco, telling Fox News' Maria Bartiromo that, \"the difference is I think they want us in San Francisco.\"The White House didn't immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on the President's plans.In a statement late Monday, Lurie said San Francisco law enforcement has partnerships with federal agencies to deal with drug crimes and additional troops aren't necessary. \"I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers — and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,\" Lurie said. Lurie previously cheered the safety of events that took place in the last week including Dreamforce and No Kings Protests over the weekend. In contrast to Newsom, Lurie has taken a far less combative approach to Trump since taking office in January.\"San Francisco is on the rise,\" Lurie wrote in a post on X on Oct. 12, a couple days before Dreamforce was set to begin.The data support that view.Tourism spending is expected to increase modestly this year to $9.35 billion, up from $9.26 billion, according to the San Francisco Travel Association. Conferences, sporting events such as NBA All-Star weekend, and music festivals like Outside Lands have contributed to the growth.The commercial real estate market is also recovering as Covid-era work from home policies get slowly unwound.Tech companies increased their share of leasing activity by square footage to 53% in 2025, the highest since 2019, CBRE said. Apartment rental prices are surging as well. Multifamily rentals increased 6% in August, much more than the 3.75% jump in Chicago, the city with the second-steepest climb, according to CoStar.Ted Egan, chief economist for San Francisco, told CNBC in an interview that \"housing is probably as cheap as it's going to get for a while.\"There remains plenty of room for improvement. The city has lost key tenants in its downtown shopping district in recent years, including its flagship Nordstrom store. The Nordstrom location was part of San Francisco City Centre, which was the city's largest mall but is now effectively empty.Office vacancies remained high at 33.6% in the third quarter, according to Cushman and Wakefield. Homelessness and open drug use are longstanding issues, heavily concentrated in certain parts of the city.But Egan said that, in addition to the data, he's noticed a significant change in the city's health.\"It seems cleaner and safer now than it's ever been in any of the time that I've been here,\" said Egan, who's worked in San Francisco for more than 20 years. \"I still think it's a great place to move to because it's got tons of economic opportunity. It's got tons of long-term economic strengths for people starting out in their career.\"WATCH: Salesforce CEO faces pushback over support for potential National Guard deploymentwatch now",

Some warehouse workers were instructed to stand by in break rooms and loading areas during their shift, while they couldn't load Amazon's Anytime Pay app, which lets employees access a portion of their paycheck immediately.Seller Central, the hub used by Amazon's third-party sellers to manage their businesses, was also knocked offline by the outage.Reddit, too, is \"working on scaling Reddit back to 100 percent as we speak,\" a spokesperson told CNBC.Some United and Delta Air Lines customers reported on social media that they couldn't find their reservations online, check in or drop bags.A T-Mobile spokesperson said its customers had issues when trying to use other sites or services due to the AWS disruption, but that there \"was no outage or service disruption\" at the carrier.Canvas, an online teaching platform used to host course information and submit assignments, said it was also hit by the \"ongoing AWS incident.\"Other social media users cited disruption across cloud-based games, including Roblox and Fortnite, while crypto exchange Coinbase said many users were unable to access the service due to the outage.Graphic design tool Canva said it was \"experiencing significantly increased error rates which are impacting functionality on Canva. There is a major issue with our underlying cloud provider.\"Generative artificial intelligence search tool Perplexity was also affected. \"The root cause is an AWS issue. We're working on resolving it,\" CEO Aravind Srinivas said in a post on X.Centralized softwareIt's not the first time in recent history that major companies have been affected by a technical issue. In July 2024, a faulty software upgrade by cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike revealed the fragility of global technology infrastructure when it caused Microsoft Windows systems to go dark, creating millions of dollars worth of chaos and grounding thousands of flights in the process. It also affected hospitals and banks.AWS has also experienced other outages in recent years. A disruption in 2023 knocked many websites offline for several hours, while a more severe outage in 2021 affected websites and services across the globe, including some of Amazon's own delivery operations, which were briefly brought to a standstill.Amazon, Microsoft and Google have long jockeyed to claim enterprise customers. After an outage of Microsoft's suite of productivity software earlier this month, Google sought to capitalize on the service lapse by pitching its own tools and a business continuity plan that runs its Workspace service in parallel with Microsoft 365.In a blog post last week, Google wrote, \"Just because Microsoft 365 goes down -- and it's a question of when and for how long, not if -- doesn't mean that your teams need to go back to using pen and paper.\"Google's cloud services went down for an extended period in June, disrupting several major service providers like OpenAI and Shopify. The company said the outage was caused by multiple layers of flawed recent updates.Monday's AWS outage doesn't appear to have been caused by a cyberattack, but is more likely a \"technical fault affecting one of Amazon's main data centres,\" Rob Jardin, chief digital officer at cybersecurity company NymVPN, said in a statement.\"These issues can happen when systems become overloaded or a key part of the network goes down, and because so many websites and apps rely on AWS, the impact spreads quickly,\" he added.An Amazon spokesperson pointed to AWS' service health dashboard when reached for comment.Indeed, \"DynamoDB isn't a term that most consumers know,\" Mike Chapple, IT professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business and former computer scientist with the National Security Agency, said in a statement. However, it \"is one of the record-keepers of the modern Internet.\"\"We'll learn more in the hours and days ahead but early reports indicate that this wasn't actually a problem with the database itself. The data appears to be safe. Instead, something went wrong with the records that tell other systems where to find their data,\" he added.\"This episode serves as a reminder of how dependent the world is on a handful of major cloud service providers: Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. When a major cloud provider sneezes, the Internet catches a cold.\"— CNBC's Leslie Josephs and Jennifer Elias contributed to this report.Clarification: This article has been updated to clarify that there was no service disruption at T-Mobile.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump meets Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in the Cabinet Room at the White House, in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 20, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Monday signed an agreement on critical minerals and rare earths that Albanese said includes plans for projects worth a total of up to $8.5 billion.Albanese, during a meeting with Trump at the White House, said, \"There will be $1 billion contributed from Australia and the United States over the next six months with projects that are immediately available.\"But the White House subsequently issued a fact sheet that said the countries would invest more than $3 billion in critical mineral projects over the next six months. It described the agreement as a \"framework.\"The White House also said that the Export-Import Bank of the United States will issue seven letters of interest for more than $2.2 billion in financing, unlocking up to $5 billion in total investment.CNBC has asked the White House and the Australian prime minister's office for clarification on the discrepancy between what Albanese said and what the fact sheet said.The framework agreement between Australia and the U.S. comes as the Trump administration is seeking to establish a critical mineral and rare earths supply chain that is not dependent on China.Rare earths are a subset of critical minerals. They are used to produce magnets that are crucial inputs in U.S. weapons platforms, semiconductor manufacturing, robotics and electric vehicles among other applications.China dominates the global rare earths supply chain, particularly refining and processing. The U.S. is dependent on Beijing for rare earths imports. Australia, a close U.S. ally, is one of the few countries in the world other than China that processes rare earths.Pentagon investment in AustraliaAlbanese said there will be three groups of joint projects between the two countries, which will include companies such as Alcoa. The U.S. will invest in rare earths processing in Australia, the prime minister said. One project is a joint venture between Australia, the U.S. and Japan, he said.\"What we're trying to do here is to take the opportunities which are there,\" Albanese told reporters.The Pentagon will invest in building a gallium refinery in western Australia with a capacity of 100 metric tons per year, according to the White House. Alcoa announced in August that it is exploring the feasability of a gallium project with Japan at one of the company's alumina refineries in western Australia.\"In about a year from now, we'll have so much critical mineral and rare earths that you won't know what to do with them,\" Trump told reporters. The U.S. is also working with other nations to build a supply chain that isn't dependent on China, the president said.China-U.S. tensionsChina announced strict export controls on rare earths earlier this month, pushing Beijing and Washington to the brink of a renewed trade war. Trump has threatened 100% tariffs on Chinese goods starting Nov. 1 or sooner if Beijing does not back down.\"They threatened us with rare earths, and I threatened them with tariffs, but I could also threaten them with many other things, like airplanes,\" Trump said Monday.Trump confirmed he will meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month. The U.S. president said he will visit China early next year.\"We had presidents that allowed China and other countries get away with murder,\" Trump said. \"We're not going to allow that, but we're going to have a fair deal. I want to be good to China. I love my relationship with President Xi. We have a great relationship.\"",

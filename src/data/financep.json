    "body": "If your portfolio is invested in exchange-traded funds, you may have had a very good 2025. The S&P 500 — the index tracked by the three largest ETFs on the market, per ETF Database – returned about 16% in 2025.But in theory, depending on which funds you held, you could have done quite a bit better. The MicroSectors Gold Miners 3X Leveraged ETN, a fund which tracks the price of a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, finished the year up 796% — the best of any U.S. traded ETF, according to data from FactSet analyzed by CNBC. You could have also earned a huge return had you bought other ETFs focused on metal mining or Korean stocks. While it can be fun to fantasize about what your returns could have looked like had you chosen one of last year's big winners, you should think twice before choosing one as a major building block of your investing strategy, says Jeff Ptak, managing director for Morningstar Research Services. \"They should play very little, if any, role in your portfolio,\" he says. \"Most of what you see at the top of these lists is niche, hyper-volatile, gimmicky. These aren't words I would associate with prudent, long-term investing.\"Beware of the big winnersPrudent, long-term investing is generally the name of the game if you're hoping to build wealth, investing experts say. So what makes some of the 2025 winners unsuitable? Leveraged fundsOne common theme on the list is the use of leverage, the practice of buying or selling derivatives to amplify a fund's return. Rather than seeking to track the return of an index, funds with 2X or 3X in the name aim to deliver multiples of that same return. This makes them highly volatile, and likely candidates for year-end best-of — or worst-of — lists, says Roxanna Islam, head of sector and industry research at TMX VettaFi, an investment research firm and index provider.\"I don't think it's surprising to see leverage at the top,\" she says. \"With two or three times [returns] they're most likely going to be in the top at some point.\"The problem with these funds, for long-term investors, is that they aim to produce 200% to 300% of the index's return on a daily basis, resetting for each trading day. In other words, they're for day traders, not investors, says Islam. \"These are basically used as short-term trading instruments. They're intended to be held for one day,\" she says. \"They're not something to hold for a whole year, even though you see a high [2025] return.\"Volatile areas of the marketAnother common theme among winning 2025 ETFs: precious metals mining funds. It's no surprise that some companies that mine for the shiny stuff did well last year. Gold prices spiked by about 65% in 2025 and silver rose by more than 140%. These firms, some of which have more well-established mining operations than others, benefit from rising precious metals prices. While owning precious metals — often as a portfolio diversifier or an inflation hedge — is a common investment strategy, says Ptak, investing in miners is \"a whole other kettle of fish.\"That's because, in addition to fluctuations in metal prices, these firms' stock prices move based on changes to the underlying business, which can be volatile and highly indebted, says Ptak. \"[Mining ETFs] are only slightly less speculative than something that's got 2X or 3X in the name,\" he says. Make smarter movesOverall, when considering adding any high-performing fund to your portfolio, you'd be wise to consider its long-term track record as well as how its objectives fit within your investment strategy, says Islam. It may be wise to do this with the help of a financial professional. And when browsing year-end lists, remember that you're looking for consistent, long-term returns rather than short-term wins, says Islam. \"Past performance does not equal future performance, especially when you're looking at a lot of these smaller themes, smaller ETFs,\" she says. \"A lot of them don't tend to show significant outperformance year after year, the same way holding a broad stock market ETF would.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A pedestrian passes in front of the Saks Fifth Avenue at Brookfield Place in New York.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSaks Global named a new CEO on Friday as the retailer is reportedly on the cusp of filing for bankruptcy protection.The parent of high-end department store chain Saks Fifth Avenue, which is privately held, will now be led by Richard Baker, the company's executive chairman, Saks said in a news release. He will continue to hold the executive chairman role.With the shake-up, three-decade long Saks executive Marc Metrick will leave the company. The news release said Metrick's is departing \"to pursue new opportunities.\"In a statement, Baker said he will work \"to secure a strong and stable future for our company.\"\"Across Saks Global, with our deep industry expertise, well-established relationships within the luxury sector, and talented employees, we will strengthen our position so that we can capitalize on the many opportunities we see for our company in the luxury market,\" he said.Saks is preparing to file for bankruptcy after missing a debt payment related to its 2024 acquisition of department store chain Neiman Marcus, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.It's the latest twist in the luxury department store operator's effort to regain its financial footing. Saks Global was created in 2024 after Saks Fifth Avenue parent company Hudson's Bay Co. acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.65 billion. By marrying the two luxury chains, it sought to better compete with other retailers and department stores including Nordstrom and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's.The deal turned Saks Global into a larger player, which included Saks Fifth Avenue, its off-price chain Saks Off 5th, Neiman Marcus' namesake department store chain and Bergdorf Goodman. Yet the company has taken clear steps to raise cash and shore up its finances, including the recent sale of Neiman Marcus' Beverly Hills flagship and Saks Global's debt restructuring in August 2025.In his biography on Saks Global's website, the company credited Baker for leading the acquisition of Neiman Marcus and described his strong real estate background. Baker is an owner of National Realty & Development Corp., one of the largest real estate development companies in the United States, and he previously served as the chairman of the board of directors for Retail Opportunity Investments Corp., which he also converted into a real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq.

Citadel's fundamental equity strategy returned 14.5%, while its global fixed income fund advanced 9.4%.Citadel declined to comment. The S&P 500 locked in a 16.4% gain for the year, its third straight double-digit annual advance. That marks an impressive recovery from the rout seen in early April following President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. At one point, the S&P 500 was even on the cusp of closing in bear market territory.The hedge fund plans to return about $5 billion of profits earned this year to clients in an effort to limit capital growth, CNBC's Leslie Picker previously reported. The move is expected to reduce assets under management to about $67 billion from roughly $72 billion.Wellington's long-term track record remains strong as the fund has generated an annualized return of 19% since its inception in 1990, the person said.",

In a statement published Thursday, BYD said sales of its battery-powered cars rose nearly 28% to 2.26 million units.Musk openly laughed at the mention of BYD while being interviewed on Bloomberg TV in October 2011. He said he did not see the company as a competitor to Tesla, adding: \"I don't think they have a great product.\"Meanwhile, Tesla said Friday it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, in line with a company-compiled estimate of 1.6 million vehicle deliveries. The annual figure is roughly an 8% drop from 2024, the company's second straight annual drop. Deliveries for Q4 2025 were about 16% lower than the fourth quarter of 2024, when Musk's EV company reported 495,570 deliveries. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company's shareholder communications. Read moreTesla has endured a roller-coaster ride this year. The company saw shares collapse in the first quarter of 2025 amid stiff competition, particularly from Chinese EV manufacturers, and reputational fallout from Musk's incendiary political rhetoric.The stock price has come roaring back in recent weeks, however, notching an all-time closing high of $489.88 last month, after Musk said the company had been testing driverless vehicles in Austin, Texas, with no occupants on board, almost six months after launching a pilot program with safety drivers. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this report.",

Instead, the duties on upholstered furniture will remain at 25% — the level Trump set in September.Before Trump's 11th-hour reversal, the levies for this furniture type were slated to rise 30% with the start of 2026. He pointed to ongoing trade discussions as the reason for pushing back tariff increases.Trump called tariffs an \"overwhelming benefit\" to the U.S. and said in a Friday morning social media post that the country losing its ability to place duties on others would be a \"terrible blow.\" His comments come as the White House awaits a decision from the Supreme Court about the legality of many of Trump's new levies.Furniture suppliers have been under Wall Street's scrutiny as Trump's focus on broad and steep levies on imports has raised concerns about rising costs. But stocks in the sector fared vastly differently as investors determined how trade policy changes and other variables would affect each business.Wayfair surged more than 125% in 2025 as value-focused retailers gained traction among consumers. On the other hand, West Elm and Pottery Barn parent Williams-Sonoma slid more than 3% last year. RH — whose chief executive garnered attention in April as he reacted live to the stock tanking — ended the year down more than 50%.\"Oh, sh--,\" RH CEO Gary Friedman said on the California-based company's earnings call in April.\"It got hit when, I think, the tariffs came out,\" Friedman added. \"Everybody can see in our 10-K where we're sourcing from, so it's not a secret, and we're not trying to disguise it by putting everything in an Asia bucket.\"",

    "body": "Trader Peter Tuchman wears \"2026\" glasses as traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the opening bell on Dec. 31, 2025.Timothy A. Clary | Afp | Getty ImagesThe new year is starting off with the stock market looking as split as it did last year. The first trading day of 2026 kicked off Friday, with the stock market as bifurcated as it had been in recent months. Though the S&P 500 started the session higher, carried aloft by semiconductors, it has since sputtered and turned lower as the day wore on. The broad market index was last down by 0.1%. A look inside the S&P 500 shows a major division. Five sectors in the broad market index are higher, led by industrials, energy and utilities that were each higher by more than 1%. Six sectors were lower, led by consumer discretionary and communication services. The day's trading is a continuation of a theme that has gained strength in recent months. While the bull market rally of the last three years has been defined by artificial intelligence, traders, nervous tech stocks will find an uphill climb more difficult in 2026, started rotating into other groups. Indeed, the Nasdaq Composite, known for its heavy exposure toward tech companies, ended last year with two straight months of losses.  Many strategists called for a broadening out of the stock market, with companies more sensitive to the economic cycle taking the mantle from tech to lead the market in 2026. They viewed that as a healthy development to extend the bull market.But that could mean an advance for the overall index is harder to come by. Broadly speaking, according to the 2026 CNBC Market Strategist Survey, Wall Street expects the S&P 500 will climb by roughly 11% in 2026 — a respectable rise that nevertheless falls short of the advance of the last three.Others on the Street are more nervous. On Wednesday, Bank of America strategist Savita Subramanian noted the S&P 500 is expensive, meaning \"risks to the index abound in 2026.\" The strategist's 7,100 year-end target for the S&P 500 is among the lowest of those surveyed. Elsewhere, Adam Parker, founder of Trivariate Research, told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" this past week that the level of optimism on the Street has him nervous for 2026. \"I think the consensus is pretty bullish,\" Parker said. \"You're betting on strong earnings growth, and I don't know if that's as likely.\" Within the tech trade, chip stocks were the lone bright spot. As of midday trading, Nvidia was the only name among the Magnificent Seven companies to rise, up by 1.5%. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF gained nearly 3%. Micron rallied more than 7%, while AMD rose more than 3%. ",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the U.S. Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Kevin Lamarque | ReutersThe Federal Reserve heads into 2026 facing a slew of political and policy challenges, headlined by a new chair and an economy fed by both tailwinds and headwinds that will make policymakers' choices all the more important.Coming off three consecutive interest rate cuts, the central bank is expected to follow a more tepid path for the year ahead in which additional cuts could be hard to come by considering expectations for solid growth and ongoing inflation pressures.One thing does seem certain: After a year of extraordinary upheaval surrounding the Fed, 2026 looks to offer more of the same.\"I do think there'll be a big spotlight. There'll be lots of intrigue,\" said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. \"There's still a lot of uncertainty that keeps the Fed in the spotlight, and probably in the hot seat too.\"The previous year saw the Fed come under that spotlight in ways that it never had before.As he started his second term at the White House, President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not being quicker to push for interest rate cuts. Around mid-year, the Fed came under fire again, this time for cost overruns at a renovation project it had undertaken at its Washington headquarters.In between, Trump tried to remove Governor Lisa Cook over allegations — as yet unproven and not even brought as formal charges — that she committed mortgage fraud. That all came against a backdrop of who would succeed Powell as chair when his term expires in May, with as many as 11 candidates considered during an interview process led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. If all that sounds exhausting, consider that 2026 begins with a Supreme Court hearing scheduled for Jan. 21 to decide whether Trump has the authority to remove Cook. A week later, the Federal Open Market Committee holds its interest rate vote. At some point during the month, Trump is expected to unveil his choice for Fed chair. And Powell, cagey on the issue so far, also will have to disclose whether he plans on serving out his term on the Board of Governors that runs until January 2028.There also have been multiple dissents at recent rate votes, and new regional presidents set to come on board at the FOMC have a hawkish bent, meaning they're likely to resist additional cuts.\"It's still a tough spot for the Fed,\" Bostjancic said.Focus on policyStill, when it comes to policy, most on Wall Street expect the Fed to put the noise in the background and continue down the road of lowering its benchmark interest rate just a bit more until it gets closer to a neutral level around 3%. Neutral is considered a spot that neither boosts nor holds back economic activity, and the funds rate is just half a percentage point above where most on the FOMC see the rate landing over the long term.\"Chair Powell helped orchestrate three 25-basis-point rate cuts in a row. It's not as if he was standing in the way of the FOMC cutting rates,\" Bostjancic said. As far as further cuts go, \"For us, it's [about] the economic data.\"Bostjancic sees the data pointing to two cuts this year, one around mid-year and another toward the end. The Fed's \"dot plot\" grid of expectations indicates just one cut, while outliers such as Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi and Citigroup seeing labor market weakness pointing to three.Powell and his colleagues have stood by the notion that they won't be bullied into cuts and indeed will be guided by data.Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, thinks the economy will be too strong for the Fed to cut much more, seeing just one reduction ahead.\"The issue is that the winds are really changing for the U.S. economy,\" Slok said during a CNBC interview Friday.Whereas 2025 saw headwinds of tariffs, inflation and a general air of uncertainty, fiscal stimulus and a stabilizing labor market will be pushing on growth, he said.\"It is, in my view, looking like more that the tailwinds are beginning to accumulate and making it more difficult for the Fed to cut rates this year,\" Slok added.The role of AIOne wildcard will be the role that artificial intelligence plays on economic growth.Seen as both a productivity enhancer and a potential impediment to hiring, assessing the impact AI is having on the economy will be paramount for the Fed, said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM.\"The Fed this year has got a real challenge in terms of communicating their strategy,\" Brusuelas said. \"We have this massive investment flowing into very sophisticated technologies, and the Federal Reserve is going to need to communicate their basic view on what this means.\"After sputtering at the beginning of 2026, the economy grew rapidly in the middle two quarters and is on pace to accelerate at a 3% pace in the fourth quarter, according to preliminary data from the Atlanta Fed.In addition to helping push along the broader economy, AI-related stocks were a key highlight of another stellar year on Wall Street that saw major averages post double-digit increases.Calibrating monetary policy in that kind of environment will be tough, Brusuelas said.\"They're going to need to provide strategic direction for the central bank at a time when the economy is clearly pivoting towards the integration of this sophisticated technology in the production of goods and provision of services,\" he said. \"This is a really big potential pivot around policy that needs to happen.\"",

    "body": "A turbine blade is lifted onto a rack near tower sections at the Revolution Wind project assembly site at State Pier in New London, Connecticut, US, on Friday, Oct. 24, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDanish renewables giant Orsted, the world's largest developer of offshore wind farms, said on Friday that it had launched legal action against the Trump administration over the suspension of its $5 billion Revolution Wind project. Shares of the Copenhagen-listed company rose more than 4% on the news, putting the stock among the top performers of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.  Orsted said in a statement that it would seek a court injunction against the U.S. government's decision to halt its Revolution Wind project, located about 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast.\"As was the case with the August 2025 stop-work order, the Revolution Wind Project … faces substantial harm from a continuation of the lease suspension order. As a result, litigation is a necessary step to protect the rights of the Project,\" Orsted said. \"Revolution Wind has spent and committed billions of dollars in reliance upon, and has met the requests of, a thorough review process,\" the company added.The pro-fossil fuel Trump administration suspended leases on Dec. 22 for five large offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, citing national security concerns identified by the Pentagon. The move marked the latest in a string of blows against offshore wind developers, with U.S. President Donald Trump having previously described wind turbines as \"ugly\" and an economic and environmental \"disaster.\" Revolution Wind is a 50/50 joint venture between Orsted and Global Infrastructure Partners' Skyborn Renewables. In a filing last year, Orsted and Skyborn Renewables said they had already spent approximately $5 billion on the project.",

    "body": "It's one of the most important questions surrounding the Federal Reserve in 2026, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been pointedly mum.\"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair,\" Powell said at the December press conference. \"I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"The question: whether Powell will remain on the Fed once his chairmanship ends in May. He will have two years left on his term as governor and Powell himself has invited the speculation by repeatedly refusing to answer the question.It's a question being asked on Wall Street as Fed watchers try to game out the makeup of the rate-setting Open Market Committee and whether appointees of President Donald Trump will have control of the Fed's powerful Board of Governors. And it's being asked in the Treasury Department and the White House, where they are trying to figure out how many slots on the board Trump will have to fill this year, who might fill them and when those slots will be available.It's a question that has not been asked in decades because prior chairs, like Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, slid quietly off the board into other government positions, retirement or the private sector with time remaining on their governor terms. That the question about Powell is even unclear is a sign of the times with a president who, in unprecedented ways, openly seeks control of Fed policy and a Fed chair who has defiantly resisted that encroachment and tried to protect the Fed's independence.Fed observers interviewed by CNBC said they see it as a wrenching decision for Powell that pits the personal against the professional. A golfer, avid guitar player and relatively new grandfather, Powell is thought to be more than ready for civilian life after 13 years at the Fed, including eight as chair. For much of those eight years, Powell endured withering public criticism from the president, who named him as chair.But after that lengthy tenure, Powell also holds deep loyalty to the institution and concern about its fate under the challenges posed by a president who has virtually eliminated the independence of multiple government entities. Trump has repeatedly pressured the Fed to lower rates and made clear that his nominee needs to agree with him or they \"will never be Fed Chairman.\"Most of those interviewed by CNBC, who said they had no personal knowledge of what Powell would decide, said they believe Powell will likely leave the Fed when his term as chair ends in May. None, however, would rule out some possibility that Powell would decide to stay, perhaps for a short time. Only former Fed Chair Marriner Eccles stayed on as a governor when his 14-year tenure as chair ended in 1948. As a governor, Eccles was instrumental in striking the 1951 Treasury-Fed accord that ended the Fed's obligation to keep rates low and helped establish the modern notion of Fed independence. The Trump administration wants to lower rates, in part, to reduce the cost of servicing the U.S. debt.On one level, the decision for Powell is a simple one of math. Three Trump appointees currently sit on the seven-member board of governors. If Powell leaves that would immediately hand the president the majority of the board. If they voted as a bloc — an uncertain assumption — it could go a long way toward delivering the president his call for ultra-low interest rates.Of more concern, the Federal Reserve Act appears to give the board's majority the ability to fire individual bank presidents who oppose rate cuts. There is some doubt about whether the firing could be done without cause, but Powell's continued presence on the board, even if he were in the minority, could help stave off such extreme outcomes.Among those interviewed by CNBC, some suggested the outcome of Fed Gov. Lisa Cook's case could weigh on Powell's decision. Trump fired Cook amid an allegation of mortgage fraud, which she has denied. Courts have stayed the firing and allowed Cook to remain in office. The Justice Department has not brought charges against Cook.But the Supreme Court will hear the case on January 21 with a decision sometime after that. If Cook is removed, that would immediately give Trump the majority. The question is whether it comes with broad authority from the Supreme Court for the president to remove other board members. In that case, Powell would likely be next on the president's attack list.Much of the concern, however, assumes a worst-case scenario that might not be warranted. There is no guarantee that governors appointed by the president will do his bidding. For example, all three Trump-appointed governors just voted to reappoint all 12 district bank presidents to new five-year terms, though the board would still have the power to remove them individually.One area of speculation is whether Powell is attempting to exercise leverage over the administration. By not revealing his choice, Powell could be sending a message that he would stay if the president nominates extreme candidates but would go if he deems them reasonable. There is no evidence that Powell is actually thinking that way. Powell has remained generally apolitical on fiscal issues during his tenure and has not responded publicly to the president's frequent insults.All of which leads several Fed observers to believe Powell will ultimately leave when his tenure as chair is up. Staying would be on overtly political move, one that would buck recent institutional tradition and open the Fed to even greater political criticism. Powell would then be undermining the very institution he was trying to preserve by staying.Another theory: Powell's refusal now to say what he will do could be considered a simple, symbolic exercise of independence, reiterating that it's his legal right to decide when he leaves and he will announce his intentions when he's ready.",

Both founders list their start dates at HieFo as May 2024 on LinkedIn, when the acquisition closed.The company claimed it had inherited more than 40 years of optoelectronic innovation in indium phosphide chip manufacturing.Emcore manufactures navigation equipment such as gyroscopes and sensors used in commercial, industrial and defense applications, including autonomous navigation and weapons systems, according to its website.The company was delisted from Nasdaq in early 2025 following its merger with aerospace manufacturing holding company Velocity One LP in November 2024.",

Legal determinations about AI-generated images, like those produced by Grok, can hinge on specific details of the content created and shared, he said.In a paper he co-authored called \"Generative ML and CSAM: Implications and Mitigations,\" Stanford researchers noted that \"the appearance of a child being abused has been sufficient for prosecution,\" in precedent-setting cases in the US.While other chatbots have faced similar issues, xAI has repeatedly landed in hot water for misuse or apparent flaws in Grok's design or underlying technology. \"There are a number of things companies could do to prevent their AI tools being used in this manner,\" Thiel said, \"The most important in this case would be to remove the ability to alter user-uploaded images. Allowing users to alter uploaded imagery is a recipe for NCII. Nudification has historically been the primary use case of such mechanisms.\"NCII refers to non-consensual intimate images.In May, X faced a backlash after Grok generated unsolicited comments about \"white genocide\" in South Africa. Two months later, Grok posted antisemitic comments and praised Adolf Hitler. Despite the stumbles, xAI has continued to land partnerships and deals.The Department of Defense added Grok to its AI agents platform last month, and the tool is the main chatbot for prediction betting platforms Polymarket and Kalshi. watch now",

    "body": "watch nowDemocratic Socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders and right-wing Gov. Ron DeSantis agree on virtually nothing. But they found common ground this year as leading skeptics of the artificial intelligence industry's data center boom. The alignment of two national figures on the left and right signals that a political reckoning is brewing over the AI industry's impact on electricity prices, grid stability and the labor market. The opposition could slow the industry's development plans if it reaches a broad bipartisan consensus. Sanders, I-VT, has called for a national moratorium on data center construction. \"Frankly, I think you've got to slow this process down,\" Sanders told CNN in a Dec. 28 interview. \"It's not good enough for the oligarchs to tell us it's coming — you adapt. What are they talking about? They're going to guarantee healthcare to all people? What are they going to do when people have no jobs?\"Florida Gov. DeSantis unveiled an AI bill of rights on Dec. 4 that would protect local communities' right to block data center construction among other provisions. The staunch Republican's proposal could run afoul of the White House, which is pushing to scale up AI as quickly as possible. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Dec. 11 to prevent \"excessive state regulation\" of AI.\"We have a limited grid. You do not have enough grid capacity in the United States to do what they're trying to do,\" DeSantis said of the AI industry's data center plans at an event in The Villages, Florida. \"As more and more information has gotten out, do you want a hyperscale data center in The Villages? Yes or no,\" the governor asked. \"I think most people would say they don't want it.\" DeSantis is finishing out his second term as Florida's governor and his future political ambitions are unclear. Sanders has said his fourth term as Vermont's senator will likely be his last. Florida and Vermont are not major data center states. But rising utility bills played a key role in the landslide victory of Democrat Abigail Spanberger in the governor's race this year in Virginia, the world's largest data center market. Residential electricity prices are forecast to rise another 4% on average nationwide in 2026 after increasing about 5% in 2025, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. With cost of living at the center of American politics, the impact of data centers on local communities will likely play a role in the mid-term elections next November. \"We have gone from a period where data centers were sort of seen as an unmitigated good and as an engine of growth by a lot of elected officials and policymakers to people now recognizing that we're short,\" said Abe Silverman, who served as general counsel for the public utility board in New Jersey from 2019 until 2023 under Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy. \"We do not have enough generation to reliably serve existing customers and data centers,\" Silverman said. Crisis on the biggest gridThe shortage is most acute on the nation's largest grid, PJM Interconnection, where data center demand is pushing the system to a tipping point. The grid will be six gigawatts short of its reliability requirement by 2027, according to PJM. The power shortage is nearly equivalent to the electricity demand of Philadelphia, Silverman said. This makes blackouts more likely, he said. \"Instead of a blackout happening every one in 10 years, we're looking at something more often,\" the analyst said. \"It's at a crisis stage right now. PJM has never been this short,\" said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, which serves as the independent market monitor for PJM.  PJM Interconnection serves more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. It includes pivotal swing states for the mid-term elections like Pennsylvania and Virginia. The price to secure power capacity in PJM has exploded in recent years with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. Those costs are ultimately passed on to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.  \"I don't think we've seen the end of the political repercussions,\" said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm. \"And with a lot more elections in 2026 than 2025, we'll see a lot of implications,\" Gramlich said. \"Every politician is going to be saying that they have the answer to affordability and their opponents' policies would raise rates.\" The shortage will be exacerbated by Trump's recent decision to pause all offshore wind farms under construction off the East Coast, Silverman said. This includes Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, a massive 2.6 gigawatt project that would help supply the huge data center market in northern Virginia.\"By stopping a project that had line of sight to coming online in the very near future, you are directly increasing the prices that we all pay for electricity and not by a little bit,\" Silverman said. \"That's a huge, huge additional hole that we now have to dig out of.\"Data centers are facing pushback on multiple fronts now. The PJM watchdog has called for the grid to reject data centers that it does not have the power to serve or require them to bring their own generation. Virginia's utility regulator is now requiring data centers to pay a majority of the cost of new transmission and generation that serves them beginning in 2027. Data center developers next year will likely start moving to build more power plants onsite, called co-location, as they struggle to secure supply on the grid quickly, said Brian Fitzsimons, CEO of GridUnity, a company that uses software to help utilities navigate connection requests. But Silverman said \"co-location\" has problems that will also face political scrutiny.  \"Co-location is effectively taking a generator off the market,\" he said. \"It would be unethical to end up with a situation where data centers are able to buy private power plants that expose the rest of us to a greater chance of blackouts.\" ",

Israel's Mossad spy agency issued a direct call on December 31, 2025,urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them \"on the ground\" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.  Protests began on December 28, 2025, with Tehran shopkeepers rallying against Iran's worsening economy have spread to other cities, drawing in students as well. (Photo by ATTA KENARE / AFP via Getty Images)Atta Kenare | Afp | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump said Friday that if Iran \"violently\" intervenes with peaceful protests, then the U.S. will \"come to their rescue.\"Unrest has been growing in Iran since last week, as protests erupted over the government's handling of a sharp fall in the nation's currency and soaring prices. Annual inflation hit 42.2% in December, with food prices jumping 72%. The protests turned violent this week as local media reported the death of at least six civilians.\"If Iran shots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Friday.\"We are locked and loaded and ready to go,\" he added.Iran's supreme leader adviser Ali Larijani responded by saying that U.S. interference in Iran's protests was equivalent to chaos across the entire region on Friday, in comments reported by Reuters.watch nowSuzanne Maloney, vice president and director of foreign policy at the Brookings Institution, previously said that the Iranian people were calling for not just a fix to the economy, but for regime change. She added that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been in power for 36 years.\"We're hearing cries of Death to the dictator. We're hearing slogans that juxtapose the regime's support for militia groups across the region with the real interests and demands of the Iranian people,\" Maloney told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Wednesday.Iran's economy has struggled since Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed sanctions on the country. Last year in June, U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites escalated tensions, pulling Washington into Israel's war with its longtime regional rival.Earlier this week, Trump threatened additional military action against Iran if the country attempts to build up its reserves of ballistic weapons and reestablish its nuclear program.\"Now, I hear that Iran is trying to build up again, and if they are we're going to have to knock them down. We'll knock them down. We'll knock the hell out of them. But hopefully that's not happening,\" Trump said on Monday.Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian responded on Tuesday in a post on X, saying that the response of the Islamic Republic of Iran to any \"oppressive aggression will be harsh and regrettable.\"  Foreign policy has dominated Trump's schedule in recent weeks. On Tuesday, the U.S. announced sanctions on a group of 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela that are allegedly linked to the weapons trade between the two countries.— CNBC's Justin Papp contributed to this report.",

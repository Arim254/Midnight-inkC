    "body": "The Tether (USDT) stablecoin logo.Costfoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesAmid the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, locals rushed to secure their savings by converting their bolívares to dollar-pegged digital tokens called USDT. The timing of the attack may have been surprising to some, but Venezuelans subsequent embrace of stablecoins wasn't. From the Middle East to Latin America, ordinary people are turning to USDT to hide and preserve their wealth from authoritative regimes and shield themselves against hyperinflation. And now, with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene in local affairs in Colombia and Iran, that survival strategy could gain even greater traction. \"Stablecoins are better dollars, but the reason people get them is out of necessity and out of self-preservation,\" Mauricio Di Bartolomeo, co-founder of digital asset lender Ledn, told CNBC.  \"Wherever they have limitations around dollars flowing freely, stablecoins are going to bust through the door.\"Since 2014, the digital currency issued by stablecoin giant Tether has become increasingly common in Russia, Iran and other emerging economies, particularly in times of heightened political instability, according to Di Bartolomeo. Using USDT, people can send and receive remittances, protect their money from local currency debasement and pay for goods and services. Not so stable? Although USDT may sound like a perfect solution to using \"virtually worthless\" fiat such as the Iranian rial and the Venezuelan bolívar, the token — like most things — isn't perfect, Di Bartolomeo noted. While stablecoins like USDT are designed to always be equal to $1, their prices don't always remain stable, particularly when demand rises. Earlier this month, demand for USDT surged due to the U.S. attack on Venezuela, causing the token to trade as high as roughly $1.40 on some peer-to-peer exchanges. That fluctuation in cost underscores ongoing liquidity issues in the cryptocurrency market that have hindered mass digital assets adoption. However, it also speaks to the extent to which virtual currencies are looked to as an \"escape valve\" among individuals living under extreme political and economic conditions, Haonan Li, co-founder and CEO of stablecoin infrastructure firm Codex, told CNBC.  \"This was a violent repricing driven by fear,\" Li said. \"As confidence in the bolívar collapsed, demand for dollars via Tether exploded, pushing the peer-to-peer USDT price in Venezuela up roughly 40% almost overnight.\"He added that the event wasn't caused by speculative activity among retail traders. Rather, \"they were trying to get out of fiat as fast as possible,\" in an emergency situation, Li said. \"That surge in demand created arbitrage opportunities, but more importantly it highlighted how stablecoins function as a real-time safety rail in emerging markets when traditional systems crack,\" he added.The situation temporarily hurt some Venezuelans attempting to secure their savings via a digital, dollarized solution, forcing them to pay a premium to convert their bolívares to USDT. And, that's one of just a few potential risks stablecoins could pose.  Converting high volumes of fiat to dollar-pegged stablecoins leads to high capital outflows, which could contribute to local currency depreciation, Zero Knowledge Consulting CEO Austin Campbell told CNBC.\"If you have a very repressive regime that's been, to put it bluntly, being s--- to all of its citizens, giving everybody a way to get their money out from under the regime so they can do whatever the hell they want could cause the local currency to collapse,\" said Campbell, who is also an adjunct professor at NYU.  However, that kind of situation isn't always a bad thing, the stablecoin expert noted. Local currency depreciation can also serve the purpose of \"put[ting] pressure on the regime and caus[ing] them problems. So, that may be a feature, not a bug,\" Campbell said.And, to be sure, any risk incurred by using stablecoins under authoritative regimes is surely worth the reward, he noted. \"When the only other option is the government steals all your money, [USDT] is still the better option,\" Campbell said.

Jason Henry | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell plans to attend oral arguments on Wednesday at the Supreme Court in a case challenging the power of President Donald Trump to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC on Monday.Powell's planned attendance comes as the Fed chairman is under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., in connection with a multi-billion-dollar renovation of the central bank's headquarters and his testimony to Congress about that project.The Associated Press first reported on Powell's plans.For Powell to personally attend oral arguments in such a case is unusual.But the question of whether a president can fire a Fed governor in the manner that Trump has attempted is viewed within the central bank as having potentially existential consequences.Powell, in an extraordinary public statement on Jan. 11, revealed that he was under criminal investigation, and called its purported grounds a pretext for its real reason: the refusal of the Fed's Board of Governors, which includes him and Cook as members, to lower interest rates as quickly as Trump demanded last year. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said.Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

A federal appeals court soon after upheld that order.The Department of Justice, in filings with the Supreme Court, has called the lower court orders barring Cook's removal \"yet another case of improper judicial interference with the President's removal authority — here, interference with the President's authority to  remove members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for cause.\"",

South Korea's Kospi fell 0.41%, while the small-cap Kosdaq traded flat.Yields on Japan's 40-year government bond rose to 4% for the first time. Japan's ruling coalition holds a one-seat Lower House majority following its formation in October, when Takaichi became prime minister after her predecessor resigned. While the snap election would raise near-term political uncertainty, it could bring greater policy clarity if a government emerges with a stronger mandate, Fitch Group said in a note.Fitch expects government debt to remain elevated over the medium term, but to gradually decline as stronger nominal GDP growth offsets wider fiscal deficits and higher borrowing costs. Consolidated general government debt is projected to ease to the mid-190% range of GDP by fiscal 2029, from an estimated 199.5% in fiscal 2025 and a peak of 222% in fiscal 2020.

    "body": "Scott Bessent, US treasury secretary, during an Economic Club of Minnesota event in Golden Valley, Minnesota, US, on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2026. Ben Brewer | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said it's \"very unlikely\" that the Supreme Court will overturn President Donald Trump's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs, with a potential decision from the court looming as early as this week. \"I believe that it is very unlikely that the Supreme Court will overrule a president's signature economic policy,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"They did not overrule Obamacare, I believe that the Supreme Court does not want to create chaos.\" In June, the Supreme Court upheld a key Affordable Care Act provision that set up a panel to recommend preventive care services that insurers must provide at no cost to patients.Bessent's comments come one day after Trump said he would impose a new slate of tariffs on goods coming from Europe until \"a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland.\" Trump did not specify in his Truth Social post which statute he was invoking to impose the tariffs, though the move appears to mirror the \"liberation day\" duties he has imposed on dozens of nations under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will begin at 10% on Feb. 1, Trump said. They will then escalate to 25% on June 1, Trump said. The Supreme Court is set to rule on Trump's use of the IEEPA to impose tariffs before the end of its term, but a decision could come as soon as this week. IEEPA gives the president wide latitude to use economic tools in response to an \"unusual and extraordinary threat.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

Leaders in Greenland, Denmark and across Europe have widely rejected Trump's demands to take over the island. European leaders of countries targeted by the new tariffs responded on Sunday. \"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\" the leaders of Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom said in a joint statement.\"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" the statement read.Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Vivian Motzfeldt at the White House last week in a meeting that Rasmussen described as \"frank but constructive.\"After the meeting, the group said the U.S. and Denmark would establish a high-level working group to chart Greenland's future.The Trump administration claims that a U.S. acquisition of Greenland is critical to national security to counter the expansion of Russia and China in the region.

    "body": "Shipping containers and gantry cranes beyond a fishing boat near the Yangshan Deepwater Port in Shanghai, China, on Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChina's stock market rally is drawing closer regulatory scrutiny after trading activity surged to unprecedented levels, prompting officials to move to curb leverage even as many investors argue the bull run is still in its early stages.Daily turnover across the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing stock exchanges climbed to successive record highs Monday through Wednesday last week, according to Wind Information, a financial data service focused on China. Trading volume peaked at 3.99 trillion yuan ($556 billion) on Wednesday, surpassing the previous record of 3.48 trillion yuan set in October 2024.Earlier this year, the benchmark CSI 300 hit a four-year high. This comes after the index posted its best yearly gain since 2020.The surge has revived memories of past market excesses, particularly the boom-and-bust cycle of 2015, market veterans told CNBC.China's regulators have responded by tightening margin financing rules, including raising collateral requirements on new margin trades.Under the updated rules, which took effect on Monday, the margin requirement for credit purchases was lifted to 100% from 80% across the three bourses. This means that investors must now pay the entire cost of shares upfront, while keeping the trades under existing margin financing rules, effectively eliminating borrowing on new margin trades.The regulatory tightening suggests an \"overheating\" of activity and sentiment in onshore markets, said Morgan Stanley, referring to stocks traded in mainland China, or A-shares, in yuan and by domestic and approved foreign investors.The investment bank's weighted A-share Market Sentiment Activity Index surged to 91% in recent days, the first reading above the 90% threshold since September 2024, driven largely by the spike in trading volumes. Recently, the trading volume in the mainland has been exploding to an all-time high. Margin financing has reached a high level as well.Hao HongGrow Investment Group\"Regulatory tightening took place as our sentiment indicator surged to an overheated level with record high turnover,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note. However, they expect added liquidity support for both A-shares and Hong Kong equities to persist through the first quarter.Foreign investors have stepped up their activity, with net inflows exceeding $50 billion in recent months, a sharp increase from previous years, according to data provided by Skybound Capital. Still, foreign participation remains small relative to the overall size and turnover of the A-share market. Domestic investors continue to drive the rally, said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.Retail investors account for about 90% of daily turnover in China's onshore stock markets, according to data from HSBC. That contrasts sharply with major overseas markets, where institutions dominate trading and retail investors make up only around 20% to 25% of volumes on the New York Stock Exchange.Engineering a slower bull?The dominance of onshore capital has shaped regulators' approach to leverage. In China's equity market, leverage primarily comes from margin financing, in which investors borrow from brokers to buy shares, amplifying both gains and losses. When leverage builds in such an environment, rallies can accelerate quickly but are also more vulnerable to abrupt reversals if sentiment shifts.\"Recently, the trading volume in the mainland has been exploding to an all-time high. Margin financing has reached a high level as well,\" said Hao Hong, chief economist at Grow Investment Group. \"So the regulators have attempted to tweak the leverage so that they could engineer a 'slow bull'.\"Other market veterans said the latest margin-financing adjustments appear to be calibrated to temper speculative excess and promote this \"slow bull\" market, rather than signaling concern about systemic risk.\"The situation is better described as 'structural overheating,' concentrated in specific sectors such as AI-related and technology stocks, many of which are recent listings that have attracted intense speculative interest.\"Shou also pointed to the growing divergence across China's exchanges as evidence that enthusiasm remains selective. The ChiNext board has surged nearly 50% over the past six months, far outpacing the more modest gains in the Shanghai Composite Index.",

Moonshot AI had not responded to a request for comment as this article went live.The sources added that the company could be valued even higher in subsequent rounds that could follow, due to a surge of interest in Chinese AI IPO candidates.Chinese AI companies have particularly boomed as U.S. AI chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, aren't officially available in mainland China.Beijing restricts access to many U.S.-based internet services, while American companies have faced growing restrictions from the White House on doing business with China.The previous funding round was announced on Dec. 31. IDG, Alibaba and Tencent participated in it, according to Chinese financial news outlet LatePost.Moonshot AI has not commented on any plans for an IPO.Zhipu, listed under the name Knowledge Atlas, had a market value of $13 billion as of Monday's close, according to Wind Information data.

His comments come shortly after Nielsen joined protesters in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, over the weekend, where people marched to demonstrate against Trump's push to take control of the self-governing Danish territory.On Saturday, the U.S. president threatened to impose a rising wave of tariffs against eight European countries for their opposition to his campaign.European political leaders called the proposed tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to stand behind Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.In a social media post, Greenland's Nielsen said the recent demonstrations in Greenland and in Denmark had shown \"a strong and dignified unity.\"He also welcomed support from other European leaders, saying it shows a \"clear recognition\" that Greenland had the right to make its own decisions.\"The latest statements from the US, including threats of tariffs, do not change that line. We will not be pressured. We stand firm on dialogue, on respect and on international law,\" Nielsen said in a Facebook post, according to a Google translation.watch nowTrump, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., renewed his interest in the vast and mineral-rich territory following an audacious U.S. military operation in Venezuela on Jan. 3.The U.S. president has said that the U.S. needs the sparsely populated island for national security reasons, citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence and recently telling reporters that Washington would acquire the self-governing Danish territory \"one way or the other.\"As part of this push, Trump has pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1 if they oppose his bid to buy Greenland.The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said.European leaders are expected to meet in the coming days as they consider their response, which reportedly could include retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

    "body": "Courtesy of Disney Enterprises Inc.Blue aliens, a family of superheroes and a city of talking animals boosted the Walt Disney Company to the top of the domestic box office in 2025.Full-year ticket sales in the United States and Canada rose about 4% from 2024 to $9.05 billion. Disney accounted for the highest share of that haul with $2.49 billion in ticket sales, or 27.5%, according to data from Comscore.It's closest competitors were Warner Bros. Discovery, which tallied $1.9 billion domestically, or 21%, and Universal, which took in $1.7 billion, or 19.7%. Together, these three studios accounted for nearly 70% of the domestic box office market share.No other studio surpassed $1 billion in domestic ticket sales or accounted for more than 7% of the total box office haul.\"[Warner Bros., Disney and Universal] have the advantage of having at least two or more distinct and successful sub-brands labels — such as Marvel under Disney, New Line under WB and Illumination under Universal  — under their corporate umbrella that enables these studios to dominate at least in terms of the overall box office and percentage of the marketplace that they control,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Disney's standout performance came on the backs of already popular intellectual property. Four of its films were part of the top 10 highest-grossing domestic releases of the year, including the live-action remake of \"Lilo & Stitch,\" a sequel to 2016's \"Zootopia,\" another entrant in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with \"Fantastic Four: First Steps\" and a third \"Avatar\" film.\"Most years at the box office are dominated by known IP and non-original content; films that have the baked in brand name recognition that theoretically gives those films a leg up in terms of marketing and potential box office success,\" Dergarabedian said.In fact, nine of the 10 biggest movies at the domestic box offices were from existing IP. Warner Bros.' \"Sinners\" was the only original title to make the list.\"In 2025 there were some big budget originals that did incredibly well ... but lest anyone think that trend is going away, 2026 looks to eclipse 2025 in terms of the number of high-profile sequels and known IP on the slate for the year,\" Dergarabedian said. That's especially true for Disney.The studio is set to release its first Star Wars film in theaters since 2019 called \"The Mandalorian and Grogu\" after the popular characters of its \"The Mandalorian\" series on Disney+; \"Toy Story 5\" is will hit theaters in June followed by a live-action \"Moana\" in July; then the hotly anticipated \"Avengers: Doomsday\" arrives in December.A new Spider-Man film will also sling into theaters in 2026, but as part of a deal with Sony to have the character as part of Disney's MCU, Sony keeps the majority of box office profits while Disney gets merchandise sales.The box office will also get a boost from Warner Bros.' \"Supergirl\" and \"Dune: Part Three,\" Universal's \"Minions 3,\" \"The Super Mario Galaxy Movie\" and \"The Odyssey,\" Lionsgate's \"Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping\" and Sony's third \"Jumanji\" film. \"As we look into 2026, there's plenty of optimism to go around,\" said Shawn Robbins, director of analytics at Fandango and founder of Box Office Theory \"The slate is packed with top-tier franchises, some fan-driven and others family-oriented, alongside filmmaker-driven tentpoles ... plus an inevitable crop of strong or potentially surprising performers out of horror, comedy, indie, and other genres.\"Disclosure: Versant is the parent company of CNBC and Fandango.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to members of the press before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Jan. 16, 2026 in Washington, DC.Tom Brenner | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened a rising wave of tariffs on several European allies, raising the alarm for industries and businesses across the region.Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, a part of the United States. The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said. European political leaders are set to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response, with retaliatory measures and broader punitive economic policies reportedly on the table. CNBC takes a look at some of the sectors expected to be the most exposed to Trump's tariff threats.AutosEurope's car giants, which were hit hard by Trump's back-and-forth trade policies last year, are considered to be highly exposed once again.The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group were all trading more than 2.5% lower on Monday morning, with Milan-listed Stellantis last seen down by around 2.1%.watch nowMohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, said Trump's tariffs clearly represent a negative development for Germany's economic outlook, a country traditionally seen as Europe's growth engine.\"If we do get tariffs, and, of course, we have to see how the geopolitical situation pans out, then … the chemicals, industrials, autos sectors, these will be the most impacted, which directly feeds to German growth,\" Kumar told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Monday. Of the eight European countries threatened by Trump's Greenland tariffs, Germany, by far, enjoys the greatest trade surplus with the U.S., followed by France and the U.K., according to data from Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.LuxuryLuxury stocks were seen as largely sheltered from U.S.-EU trade tensions in the first quarter of last year, given their robust pricing power and ability to pass on added costs to consumers. Analysts warned at the time, however, that the prospect of tariffs ushering in a broader economic downturn could have spillover effects, even for the wealthiest shoppers. A Christian Dior luxury store in Paris on July 22, 2025.Cyril Marcilhacy/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesAlongside seven other European countries, Trump's proposed tariffs single out France, which is home to the likes of industry bellwether LVMH and Kering. Shares of LVMH and Kering fell around 3.5% and 2.6% on Monday morning. Luxury groups, including Switzerland's Richemont, Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, and Britain's Burberry, were also trading lower. Pharma Europe's pharma sector could face a significant impact from the proposed U.S. tariffs, given that medicines and pharma products represent the EU's largest export to the U.S. EU exports of pharma products to the U.S. came in at 84.4 billion euros ($98.1 billion) during the first three quarters of last year, ahead of machinery and mechanical parts (68.3 billion euros) and organic chemicals (66.3 billion euros) over the same period, according to Eurostat data. Read moreSome of the sector's biggest European names fell slightly on Trump's latest tariff threats on Monday morning.  Denmark's Novo Nordisk was 2.1% lower, Switzerland's Roche dipped 0.3% lower, and France's Sanofi fell 0.9% during early deals. Swiss-based Novartis, meanwhile, traded 0.3% higher.  Energy  Europe's oil and gas stocks could also be indirectly impacted by Trump's latest tariff threats, due to factors such as weaker global demand, lower crude prices and increased supply chain costs.Oil prices were last seen trading slightly lower amid heightened concerns of a trade war between the U.S. and Europe — and what this could mean for global demand.Norway's Equinor was among the energy stocks leading the sector's losses on Monday, down around 3.4%. France's TotalEnergies, Britain's Shell, and BP fell between 1% and 1.5%, respectively.Storage tanks at the Northern Lights carbon capture and storage project, controlled by Equinor ASA, Shell Plc and TotalEnergies SE, at Blomoyna, Norway, on Friday, Jan. 19, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOzan Özkural, founder and managing partner at Tanto Capital, said Trump's latest tariff threats should not have been unexpected, warning of a broad impact for European sectors.\"Welcome to 2026. I think this is going to be the sort of year that we are going to talk a lot more about what it means not to have the U.S. play ball with the traditional allies,\" Özkural told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Monday.\"It's going to have an impact on oil prices, commodity prices, equity markets, debt markets, private credit. You name it, we have it,\" Özkural said.",

    "body": "Sarah Friar, CFO of OpenAI, appears on CNBC's Squawk Box on August 20, 2025. CNBCOpenAI will make 2026 its year of \"practical adoption,\" the artificial intelligence startup's finance chief said in a blog Sunday. \"The priority is closing the gap between what AI now makes possible and how people, companies, and countries are using it day to day,\" OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar wrote. \"The opportunity is large and immediate, especially in health, science, and enterprise, where better intelligence translates directly into better outcomes.\"In the blog, Friar laid out how OpenAI views its strategy for driving monetization of its services, like ChatGPT, while securing the compute necessary to power those products, saying that the AI lab's revenue directly tracks with the availability of its technical infrastructure. OpenAI's compute grew from 0.2 gigawatts in 2023 to about 1.9 GW in 2025, while the company's annual revenue run rate grew similarly from $2 billion in 2023 to more than $20 billion last year, Friar said. \"This is never-before-seen growth at such scale,\" she wrote. \"And we firmly believe that more compute in these periods would have led to faster customer adoption and monetization.\"Friar's blog comes as OpenAI and the tech industry's focus on AI comes under scrutiny for the massive investments necessary to build out the data centers and secure the energy and components required to power this cutting-edge technology that has yet to deliver much revenue returns for investors. Among those key deals is an agreement between OpenAI and AI chipmaker Nvidia announced in September. Under that agreement, Nvidia said it would commit $100 billion to support the AI startup as it builds and deploys at least 10 GW of Nvidia's systems.A gigawatt is a measure of power, and 10 GW is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 8 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration.But in November, Nvidia told investors there was \"no assurance\" that its agreement with OpenAI would progress beyond an announcement and to an official contract stage. \"Securing world-class compute requires commitments made years in advance, and growth does not move in a perfectly smooth line,\" wrote Friar, adding that the system requires discipline. Three years ago, OpenAI relied on a single compute provider, but now it works with a diversified ecosystem, Friar said. \"We can plan, finance, and deploy capacity with confidence in a market where access to compute defines who can scale,\" she wrote. OpenAI's business model should scale with its services, Friar said. \"As intelligence moves into scientific research, drug discovery, energy systems, and financial modeling, new economic models will emerge,\" she wrote. The blog comes after OpenAI last week said that it planned to begin testing ads for some ChatGPT users in the U.S. That move comes as OpenAI gears up for a potential public debut this year. \"Monetization should feel native to the experience,\" Friar wrote. \"If it does not add value, it does not belong.\"WATCH: OpenAI Investor Letter: Weekly and daily active user figures 'continue to produce all-time highs'watch now",

Contributor | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesRussian President Vladimir Putin has received an invitation to join the U.S.' \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza, the Kremlin said Monday.Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow would study the details of the proposal to join the peace council created by U.S. President Donald Trump late last year. The \"Board of Peace\" is seen as a vehicle for maintaining a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and to oversee the reconstruction of Gaza after their protracted conflict.\"President Putin has indeed received an offer through diplomatic channels to join this Board of Peace. We are currently studying all the details of this proposal,\" Peskov told Russian state news agency TASS. \"We hope to contact the U.S. side to clarify all the details,\" he added.Trump has reportedly invited a number of world leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Argentine President Javier Milei, to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, which will be part of the larger Board of Peace, Bloomberg reported Saturday.Several other nations, including Hungary, India, Jordan, Greece, Cyprus, and Pakistan confirmed Board of Peace invitations, AP News reported on Sunday.However, the Trump administration reportedly wants nations to pay $1 billion to remain on the board in perpetuity, Bloomberg noted, citing a draft charter for the proposed group.If confirmed, Putin's invitation to join the peace council would raise eyebrows given his oversight of an ongoing war against Russia's neighbor Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died in the war, which is approaching its four-year anniversary in February.CNBC has contacted the White House for confirmation of Putin's invitation.On Saturday, the U.S. also released the names of those who will sit on a \"founding Executive Board\" of the council, with the list including former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, among several others.Israel is unhappy with how the \"Board of Peace\" is unfolding, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office releasing a statement on Friday commenting, \"the announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy.\"— CNBC'S Kate Dore contributed reporting to this story.",

    "body": "A protester takes part in a demonstration to show support for Greenland in Copenhagen, Denmark, on Jan. 17, 2026.Tom Little | ReutersEuropean states are reportedly considering retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S. after President Donald Trump threatened fresh export levies, deepening a rift over Greenland.Trump announced Saturday that eight European countries would face increasing tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal is not reached allowing Washington to acquire Greenland, the mineral-rich island which is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.The proposed tariffs would target Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the U.K, the Netherlands and Finland. The duties would come on top of existing export tariffs to the U.S., currently standing at 10% for the U.K. and 15% for the EU. Regional diplomats held an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday afternoon to discuss their response to Trump's threat to escalate tariffs, with France reportedly pushing for the EU to use its strongest economic counter-threat to the U.S., known as the \"Anti-Coercion Instrument\" (ACI).Protesters wave Greenland flags during a demonstration under the slogans 'hands off Greenland' and 'Greenland for Greenlanders' in front of the US embassy in Copenhagen, Denmark, on January 17, 2026. Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe much-vaunted instrument is seen as a nuclear option when it comes to economic counter-measures as it could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services and putting potential limits on foreign direct investment in the region.Despite being seen as a \"big bazooka\" against Trump's tariffs playbook, it has not been used before, and regional leaders have already said they want to pursue dialogue with the U.S. in the coming days to resolve the rift over Greenland.The Financial Times reported that the EU was contemplating imposing 93 billion euros ($108 billion) worth of tariffs, as well as considering the use of the ACI. Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the European Parliament will likely now suspend its work on the EU-U.S. trade deal struck last July. The assembly had been due to vote on removing many EU import duties on U.S. goods on Jan. 26-27, but that approval could now be delayed, Reuters reported.Read moreFrench Finance Minister Roland Lescure said Monday that the EU \"must be prepared\" to use its anti-coercion mechanism, in comments translated by Reuters.While France is more gung-ho about the ACI, Germany is among the countries that have tended to shy away from using it before.\"The key question to watch is whether the EU will try to keep the confrontation confined to such a more \"classic\" trade war, or whether calls for a harsher line prevail,\" Carsten Nickel, deputy director of Research at Teneo, said in emailed comments. \"Representing the latter camp, France has called on its partners to formally invoke the EU's so-called anti-coercion instrument ... [but] other EU member states, including Germany, will likely remain careful.\" The reasons for this divide are multifaceted, Nickel noted, including factors such as France traditionally advocating for a more independent European role in continental security, and it being less export-dependent than other nations like Germany.Months of wrangling ahead?European leaders were quick to react to Trump's surprise tariff threat, with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer commenting Saturday that \"applying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\" while French President Emmanuel Macron described them as \"unacceptable.\"Nonetheless, leaders are expected to use the World Economic Forum taking place in Davos, Switzerland, this week, as an opportunity to try to talk to Trump, who is addressing the forum on Wednesday.watch nowEconomists warn that, much like last year when months of wrangling took place before a trade deal was signed between the U.S. and EU, this spring will likely be dominated by similarly thorny discussions over Greenland.\"My base case is that the Feb. 1 [tariffs] deadline is going to be postponed as diplomatic measures are implemented,\" Mohit Kumar, chief European economist at Jefferies, told CNBC Monday.President Donald Trump attends a bilateral meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 21, 2020. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters\"That said, I think this is different from the usual TACO [Trump Always Chickens Out] trade. For Greenland, the position for Europe is very clear: it's not for sale, and they will not tolerate aggression ... But what Trump has shown is that he wants Greenland. I don't see how the issue is going to go away that soon. So we are looking at months, or potentially quarters, of uncertainty over tariffs.\"\"For Europe it's a negative. Growth will be reduced,\" he warned, ahead of what could be a frantic market day for European bourses on Monday, with regional indexes looking set to slump at the open.",

(Photo by Zhu Dayong/VCG via Getty Images)Zhu Dayong | Visual China Group | Getty ImagesChina's birthrate fell to a record low last year, underscoring a deepening demographic crisis as Beijing struggles to reverse a shrinking and aging population. Births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023, marking the lowest level on record, according to data compiled by Wind Information going back to the 1950s.About 7.9 million babies were born last year, sharply fewer than 9.5 million a year before, data from the statistics bureau showed Monday, despite Beijing's efforts to encourage larger families through widening subsidies and expanded parental leave. Even though the country began easing its stringent one-child policy nearly a decade ago, the birth rate continued to plummet — except for a brief spike in 2024, when it climbed to 6.77 per 1,000 people. The increase was widely attributed to the Year of the Dragon, which is traditionally considered an auspicious time to have children. \"The pace of the decline is striking, particularly in the absence of  major shocks,\" said Yue Su, principal economist at Economist Intelligence Unit.She added that the boost from fertility stimulus measures has faded, while young people are delaying marriage and child-bearing plans due to growing economic pressures and intensifying competition in workplaces.Policymakers have rolled out various incentives, including cash rewards and tax breaks for households with children under age 3. Beijing has also extended the maternity leave to 158 days, from 98 days in 2024. China has faced a looming population crisis as its elderly population grew. The share of the population aged 60 and above rose to 23% in 2025, up from 22% in 2024.  The population fell for a fourth year, declining by 3.4 million to 1.405 billion last year, according to the statistics bureau.Economists warned that a shrinking workforce and an ageing population pose major economic risks. Fewer babies mean a shrinking workforce in the future to support a rapidly growing cohort of retirees, piling pressure on the already-stretched pension system. It could also force higher social security contributions, squeezing disposable income for younger workers.  \"A shrinking population implies a smaller consumer base in the future, increasing the risk of wider supply-demand imbalances,\" Su noted, calling for a more forceful policy response on fertility.  World Bank data showed that the fertility rate, defined as births per woman, fell to 1 in China in 2023, the most recent year available, below the global average level of 2.2.  watch now",

Etienne Laurent | AFP | Getty ImagesDETROIT — Five years after the transatlantic automaker Stellantis was formed through a merger, the business hasn't necessarily panned out as investors hoped.U.S. shares of the company — created through a $52 billion combination of Italian American automaker Fiat Chrysler and France-based Groupe PSA on Jan. 16, 2021 — are down roughly 43% in the past five years. Italian-listed shares also are off roughly 40%.Since the combined company's stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Jan. 19, 2021, days after the merger was completed, shares of the automaker were largely in the black — up as high as 74% in March 2024 — until Stellantis reported troubling financial results that year amid cost-cutting efforts meant to support higher profits and its multibillion-dollar push into electric vehicles.Many of those plans are being altered or eliminated under new Stellantis CEO Antonio Filosa, who succeeded Carlos Tavares last summer. Tavares, a longtime automotive executive, was largely credited with forming the company, but abruptly left Stellantis in December 2024.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconStellantis shares listed in the U.S. and Italy.Filosa is executing a sales turnaround plan for the automaker and is particularly focused on its Jeep and Ram brands regaining U.S. market share following yearslong sales declines.\"The strategy that we have in front of us is a strong one and will lead us to growth if we execute well,\" he told reporters Wednesday during the Detroit Auto Show. \"So, I believe it's a year of execution.\"Filosa did not rule out the possibility of regionally refocusing or shrinking the company's vast portfolio of brands that also includes Italian nameplates Fiat and Alfa Romeo, which have not performed well domestically.He said he believes the company should \"stay together\" following some speculation, including from Tavares, that it would be better to sell off assets or brands.Filosa said the next step in the company's plans will come during a meeting this month with more than 200 company executives that will focus on an upcoming capital markets day as well as company culture and 2026 execution.PSA CEO Carlos Tavares and FCA CEO Mike Manley shake hands after signing a combination agreement that will lead to the creation of the world's fourth-largest global automaker in terms of annual sales (8.7 million vehicles).FCAInvestors have been eager to hear a new strategy for Stellantis after Tavares' exit. He left amid troubling sales and financial results as the company strived to achieve 10% or greater profit margins and doubling net revenues under his \"Dare Forward 2030\" business plan.U.S. shares of Stellantis since Filosa began as CEO on June 23 are up 2%. They closed Friday at $9.60 per share, down 4.2%. Filosa this week declined to discuss the company's past mistakes, but company executives previously told CNBC that Tavares' fixation on cost reductions and profits hurt business, as well as the company's products, employees and relationships with suppliers, unions and dealers.Filosa has spent much of his time attempting to repair those bonds, especially with the company's distraught U.S. franchised retailers. He's also approved drastic changes to the company's product plans, including reducing prices and reprioritizing products away from electrified vehicles.\"In the six months, I see the changes that we will make we need to make to create the bright future that we need,\" he said regarding his tenure thus far as CEO.

    "body": "The logo of the German car manufacturer Volkswagen can be seen on a vehicle in front of a VW dealership.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesShares of some of Europe's biggest carmakers fell sharply on Monday morning, following U.S. President Donald Trump's pledge to impose tariffs on several European countries over Greenland.Europe's Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index traded 2% lower at around 1:02 p.m. London time (8:02 a.m. ET), paring losses from earlier in the session.Germany's Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz Group stood between 2.5% to 3% lower, while Milan-listed shares of Ferrari dipped around 2.2%, notching a 52-week low. Germany's Porsche fell 3.2% on the news.Milan-listed shares of Stellantis, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler, and Peugeot, were last seen 1.8% lower. The moves come shortly after Trump on Saturday pledged to impose 10% tariffs on the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland by Feb. 1, ramping up his push to make Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, part of the United States.The levy on these countries will rise to 25% from June 1, Trump said.European political leaders are expected to hold emergency talks over the coming days as they consider their response. The automotive sector is widely regarded as acutely vulnerable to levies, particularly given the high globalization of supply chains and the heavy reliance on manufacturing operations across North America. watch now\"Our view is that ultimately tariffs are a blunt tool that seldom really works for any sort of length of time. Mostly because it's a very global economy these days and people find a way around it even if they can't talk themselves out of them,\" Rob Brewis, director and investment manager at Aubrey Capital Management, told CNBC's \"Europe Early Edition\" on Monday.\"Clearly, the tariffs created a huge stir back in April last year but ever since then, their impact diminishes with time and with repeated use, I guess,\" he added.Asked which European sectors were likely most exposed to Trump's latest tariff threats, Brewis singled out the automotive industry.\"My focus is more on emerging markets, so I spend less time on Europe, but I think it's unhelpful for sectors like the car sector, which is already facing huge threats from the Chinese players,\" he added.",

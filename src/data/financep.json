    "body": "Kraft Heinz in September 2025 announced plans to split into two separately traded companies, reversing its 2015 megamerger, which was orchestrated by billionaire investor Warren Buffett.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesKraft Heinz on Wednesday said it is pausing work on its previously announced plans to split the company. CEO Steve Cahillane, who joined Kraft Heinz in January, said in a statement that many of the company's issues are \"fixable and within our control.\"\"My number one priority is returning the business to profitable growth, which will require ensuring all resources are fully focused on the execution of our operating plan,\" he said. \"As a result, we believe it is prudent to pause work related to the separation and we will no longer incur related dis-synergies this year.\"Kraft Heinz also plans to invest $600 million to fuel a turnaround of its U.S. business. The company plans to spend the money on its marketing, sales, and research and development. The investment will also go toward \"product superiority and select pricing,\" according to Cahillane.In September, the company announced plans to break up, reversing much of the blockbuster $46 billion merger from a decade ago that created one of the biggest food companies in the world. While investors originally cheered the merger, the luster faded as the combined company's U.S. sales slipped, and it wrote down many of its iconic brands, like Oscar Mayer and Maxwell House. For at least six years, Kraft Heinz has been in turnaround mode, trying to revive its U.S. business.Warren Buffett, who helped mastermind the deal, said he was disappointed in the decision to split. Berkshire Hathaway, under new CEO Greg Abel, has since taken a formal step toward unwinding its 28% stake in Kraft Heinz.\"We support CEO Steve Cahillane and the Kraft Heinz Board of Directors' decision, under Steve's new leadership, to pause work on the company's previously planned separation. As a result, management can commit to strengthening Kraft Heinz's ability to compete and serve customers,\" Abel said in a statement. For years, Kraft Heinz has underinvested in its brands, and executives appeared unwilling to change that strategy, Piper Sandler analyst Michael Lavery wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. \"This appears to have changed with the hiring Steve Cahillane, who has reshaped KHC's 2026 plans (and proposed split) much more significantly than we had expected in just the six weeks since he started as KHC's CEO,\" Lavery said. \"We still believe this remains a 'show me' story, and that this is only the first step in getting KHC in a position for sustainable growth, which still looks unlikely to come soon.\"Kraft Heinz announced Cahillane's hiring in December. He previously led Kellogg through its own breakup and then headed Kellanova, itself a spinoff, until its sale to Mars. Not everyone on Wall Street was sold on the reversal Wednesday. Shares of Kraft Heinz fell as much as 5% in early trading before rebounding to trade essentially flat. \"Investors will view this negatively because it indicates that the businesses are not in strong enough condition to operate on a standalone basis, and it is uncertain when they will,\" TD Cowen analyst Robert Moskow wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.The announcement Wednesday came alongside Kraft Heinz's quarterly earnings release. The company's earnings topped Wall Street's estimates, but its revenue fell short of analysts' projections.",

Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., will be considered a day after a procedural vote on a rule that would have barred House challenges to Trump's tariffs failed with the support of three Republican members.\"The Speaker continues to abdicate his responsibilities, ceding Congress's Article I authority to Donald Trump,\" Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement posted to X on Tuesday. \"Republicans now face a clear choice: go on the record and join Democrats in ending these cost-raising tariffs, or keep forcing American families to pay for them.\"A vote on Trump's tariffs will force House Republicans to choose between loyalty to the president and striking down economic policy that many in the GOP conference do not like.Reps. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Kevin Kiley, R-Calif., and Don Bacon, R-Neb., bucked Trump and GOP leaders on Tuesday by voting with every Democrat to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July 31.\"I don't like putting the important work of the House on pause, but Congress needs to be able to debate on tariffs. Tariffs have been a 'net negative' for the economy and are a significant tax that American consumers, manufacturers, and farmers are paying,\" Bacon posted to X after the Tuesday vote.Because of the razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Johnson can afford to lose only one Republican vote if all Democrats are present and vote in favor of the resolution to end Trump's Canada tariff.Still, the effort is likely symbolic. Even if the Senate approved Meeks' resolution, Trump would likely veto the legislation.\"This is life with a razor-thin majority,\" Johnson said in a Wednesday morning appearance on Fox Business. \"I think it's a big mistake. I don't think we need to go down the road of trying to limit the president's power while he is in the midst of negotiating America-first trade agreements with nations around the world.\"",

    "body": "Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar.CNBCNovo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar on Wednesday said the company is aiming to capture around 15 million new patients, at least initially, when Medicare starts covering obesity treatments for the first time later this year.Around 67 million Americans are covered by Medicare, but \"when you take a look at specifically our products and the target group, I think around 15 million people would be a good number to target,\" he told CNBC in an interview. Medicare is slated to start covering obesity medicines for the first time later this year under the landmark \"most favored nation\" drug pricing deals that Novo and its chief rival Eli Lilly struck with President Donald Trump in November. Health experts say the long-awaited coverage could broaden the market for the medicines and spur more private insurers to cover them. Some experts estimate that 20 million to 30 million Medicare patients are suffering from obesity and related conditions.Doustdar said Medicare coverage, along with the launch of Novo's new obesity pill and other factors, should help the company gradually boost prescription volumes and offset lower prices in the U.S. following that agreement with Trump. But he said he doesn't expect Medicare access to obesity treatments to open up overnight. \"Now, it would be great if we could find a way to get access very, very fast. But I think that would be a bit naive,\" Doustdar said, pointing to the slow adoption seen among eligible patients with commercial insurance. It's a slightly more conservative tone on the initial impact of Medicare coverage compared to Lilly, which has cited that coverage as a key tailwind to its guidance this year. Last week, Lilly said it expects Medicare coverage to come online by July. Meanwhile, Doustdar said Novo is in the midst of negotiations with the government on \"exactly which month, which week that is going to be opening.\" Closing the market share gapNovo is under pressure to claw back market share in the booming GLP-1 space from Lilly and cheaper, compounded copycats. Last week, Lilly said its share of the U.S. obesity and diabetes drug market increased to 60.5% in the fourth quarter, while Novo's was 39.1%.Novo has also highlighted a gap in the \"preference share\" for its weight loss treatment Wegovy versus Lilly's rival injections. In the U.S., Novo estimates that between 7 and 8 patients out of 10 go to Lilly. When asked how Novo plans to close that gap, Doustdar said one way to do so is \"to do better on the pill.\" The company's Wegovy obesity pill has a head start compared to Lilly's upcoming oral drug, orforglipron, which is expected to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration during the second quarter. Mike Doustdar, left, CEO of Novo Nordisk, and David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, listen as President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office during an event about weight-loss drugs on Nov. 6, 2025.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | Afp | Getty ImagesDoustdar said Novo's pill is slightly more effective than Lilly's based on separate clinical trials, showing 16.6% weight loss compared to 12.4% with Lilly's oral drug. \"If you use these two numbers, basically you have a 40% difference between the efficacy of these pills,\" he said. \"I think this is going to be a very main, main selling point of the pill.\" But Doustdar also pointed to the upcoming approval and launch of a higher dose – 7.2 milligram – of Wegovy that could help win market share from Lilly's obesity treatment Zepbound. That higher dose helps patients lose around 21% of their weight, which is \"very much on par\" with the highest dose of Zepbound, he said. Zepbound's higher efficacy has been a key factor in driving more patients and prescribers away from choosing Wegovy, which has shown around 15% weight loss on average in clinical trials. \"When that comes to the market, my thought, my wish, my hope is that people will realize, OK, now we have two products with similar efficacy,\" he said.

    "body": "watch nowDETROIT – Ford Motor reported its largest quarterly earnings miss in four years in its fourth-quarter results released Tuesday, while guiding for 2026 to be a rebound year for the automaker.Ford's 2026 guidance includes adjusted EBIT of between $8 billion and $10 billion, up from $6.8 billion last year; adjusted free cash flow of between $5 billion and $6 billion, up from $3.5 billion in 2025; and capital expenditures of $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion, up from $8.8 billion.Here's how the company performed in the fourth quarter compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 13 cents adjusted vs. 19 cents expectedAutomotive revenue: $42.4 billion vs. $41.83 billion expectedThe EPS coming in 32% below consensus was the company's first quarterly miss since 2024 and its worst since a 42% difference when reporting its 2021 fourth-quarter results, according to LSEG.The earnings miss was largely due to unexpected tariff costs of roughly $900 million related to credits for auto parts not taking effect as early as expected, the company said. Ford, as of Dec. 15, had confirmed $7.7 billion in earnings before interest and taxes for the fourth quarter, but the additional costs dropped that to $6.8 billion.Ford CFO Sherry House said the lower-than-expected earnings were also related to additional impacts from fires at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant last year in New York, which now isn't expected to be fully operational until the middle of this year. The plant supplies Ford's lucrative F-Series pickup trucks.\"We will see a billion-dollar benefit roughly in 2026; however, this year, due to the Novelis impact, we're going to have tariffs increasing in order to secure aluminum that is roughly the same amount of that savings,\" House told reporters.Ford's net tariff impact is expected to be roughly flat year-over-year at $2 billion in 2026, she said. The Novelis fire had an impact of $2 billion during the second half of the year for Ford, she added.House and Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company's 2025 results continue to demonstrate the company's underlying business is improving despite the special items impacting results.The company's 2025 revenue was a record $187.3 billion, up 1% from $185 billion a year earlier. That includes $45.9 billion during the fourth quarter, down 5% from a year before.On a business unit level, the automaker's traditional and fleet operations are expected to offset an expected $4 billion to $4.5 billion in losses this year for its \"Model e\" electric vehicle unit. Pre-tax earnings from its \"Ford Pro\" fleet business are expected to be between $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion, followed by $4 billion to $4.5 billion for its traditional \"Blue\" business.On an unadjusted basis, the company's net loss of $8.2 billion last year was its largest since the Great Recession in 2008, according to FactSet. That included $15.5 billion in special charges during the fourth quarter largely related to a pre-announced pullback in its all-electric vehicle plans.Automakers commonly exclude \"special items\" or one-time charges from their adjusted financial results to provide investors with a clearer picture of their core, ongoing business operations.Ford reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $11.1 billion, or a loss of $2.77 per share, compared with net income of $1.8 billion, or 45 cents per share, in the same period in 2024. Adjusted for the one-time charges, the company reported earnings of 13 cents per share.",

    "body": "Amazon Leo Satellite Connectivity signage is displayed during the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada on January 6, 2026. Patrick T. Fallon | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Federal Communications Commission said Tuesday it approved Amazon's request to deploy 4,500 satellites, expanding the company's planned constellation as it vies to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX.The FCC's approval brings the size of Amazon's planned constellation of low Earth orbit satellites to roughly 7,700 satellites. The company has sent up more than 150 satellites since April using a variety of rocket launch providers. Amazon has said its goal is to begin providing satellite internet through its service called Leo later this year. The project was announced in 2019.  Amazon's next set of satellites are its second generation of the orbital systems and they will operate at altitudes of up to about 400 miles, according to the notice. The additional satellites would add support for more frequency bands and extend Leo's geographic regions.  The FCC said Amazon must launch 50% of the approved satellites by Feb. 10, 2032 and the remaining half by Feb. 10, 2035. Amazon is working to meet a separate deadline imposed by the FCC to deploy 1,600 of its first generation satellites before July 2026. Late last month, the company asked the agency to extend the cutoff to July 2028 or to waive the deadline altogether. The FCC hasn't ruled yet on the request. The company blamed delays beyond its control, including a near-term shortage of rockets to lift the satellites into orbit, on its likely inability to meet the deadline. Leo is \"producing satellites considerably faster than others can launch them,\" the company wrote. The company has invested $10 billion to stand up its internet-from-space service. Leo is poised to rival SpaceX's Starlink, which has more than 9,000 satellites in orbit and roughly 9 million customers. Amazon expects to spend $1 billion more on its Leo constellation this year as it deploys more satellites, the company said last week in its latest quarterly report. Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky said the company has more than 20 launches planned in 2026 and more than 30 in 2027. The next Leo mission is set for Thursday, when an Arianespace rocket will fling another 32 satellites into orbit. Amazon has booked 17 other missions with the French company.

Rides totaled 243.5 million for the period, missing estimates of 256.6 million.Risher highlighted Lyft teen accounts and the company's acquisition of European taxi app FreeNow as future growth drivers for the company. Lyft's launch of teen accounts on Monday came more than two years after rival Uber.Lyft issued soft first-quarter guidance, expecting bookings to fall between $4.86 billion and $5 billion, versus a FactSet estimate of $4.93 billion. The company projected an adjusted EBTIDA of $120 million to $140 million, compared to a FactSet consensus of $139.8 million.As robotaxis continue to expand, Risher noted Lyft's planned autonomous vehicle rollout.\"We're positioned super well. We've got great partnerships with Waymo, with Baidu, with others,\" Risher said. \"We'll be starting to bring some of their technology, some of their self-driving cars onto the roads in places like Nashville in 2026.\"Lyft's fourth-quarter revenue fell in line with expectations at an adjusted $1.76 billion. The company reported an adjusted 16 cents in earnings per share, beating expectations of 12 cents. Both revenue and earnings per share had several exclusions and adjustments. Risher also drew attention to Lyft demand during the Super Bowl, which he said had 13 to 15% volume growth year over year, with faster pickups and lower surge pricing than competitors.Read more CNBC tech news'Impossible': Taiwan pushes back against Washington's 40% chip supply relocation goalAlphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-outTesla exec Raj Jegannathan leaves automaker after 13 yearsShort seller CapitalWatch apologizes, retracts report on AppLovin shareholder",

    "body": "Cheng Xin | Getty ImagesBitcoin's short-lived bounce faded on Wednesday as the volatility in the world's largest cryptocurrency continued.Bitcoin was trading at around $66,166 at 10:21 a.m. ET on Wednesday, down roughly 4% on the day. The digital coin has been on a downward trajectory since hitting an all-time high above $126,000 in October with the sell-off intensifying over the last month. Bitcoin dropped below $70,000 on Feb. 5 and slid to hold just above $60,000, which is seen as a key level.Bitcoin then recovered from those lows and was back above $70,000, but has struggled to push higher from that, remaining in the range of $66,000 and $72,000.On Thursday, bitcoin was around 47% lower than its record high.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBitcoin price over the past monthSeveral factors have weighed on crypto markets, including volatility in technology stocks in the U.S., with which crypto assets often move in tandem with. Meanwhile, the Feb. 5 sell-off was triggered by a wave of liquidations — when traders are forced to close positions if the price of bitcoin hits a certain point. This has a cascading effect, which can exacerbate selling. Those liqudiations have since slowed down.Investors are also considering whether there will be a shift in U.S. monetary policy following U.S. President Donald Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for Fed chair late last month. watch nowSelling from issuers of bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, which are large holders of the digital coin,  led to outflows from these ETFs. That added to the pressure on the digital coin. However, in the last three days, bitcoin ETFs have recorded net inflows.Bitcoin cycle back in focusMarket participants are looking at whether bitcoin's typical cycle is intact. This refers to the historical pattern after an event known as halving, which often leads to new all-time highs for the cryptocurrency and a subsequent crash before new highs.Bitcoin's halving — an event written into its code that happens every four years —reduces the rewards given to bitcoin miners and effectively slows down the supply of bitcoin on the market. The supply squeeze typically precedes rallies to fresh record highs for bitcoin. The most recent halving took place in April 2024. There has been a debate as to whether the typical bitcoin cycle is over or if the patterns are breaking. But investors and analysts suggest the cycle is very much intact. watch now\"2026 I expect to be a bear leg to the four-year cycle,\" Steven McClurg, CEO of Canary Capital, told CNBC on Wednesday. \"We have experienced several four-year cycles since bitcoin has launched and this is no different than any other.\" McClurg added that he expects bitcoin to fall to as low as $50,000 in the summer before \"things turn around in the fall.\" Markus Thielen of 10X Research told CNBC last week that bitcoin could fall to the $50,000 level.

    "body": "A McDonald's logo is displayed on a sign outside their restaurant on Nov. 17, 2025 in San Diego, CA.Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesThe restaurant sector has spent the past 18 months trying to figure out how to reach consumers in a hypercompetitive and uneven economy. McDonald's, which is set to report earnings after the bell Wednesday, has doubled down on value messaging to customers via Extra Value Meals and Snack Wraps, which will likely help to boost sales this quarter.But the focus on value has caused frustrations at times among parts of the chain's operator base. The company rolled out new franchise standards for McDonald's operators on Jan. 1, including assessing locations on how their prices deliver value. McDonald's said its owners are still able to set their own prices, but the standards nonetheless shape and define how franchisees — which operate 95% of McDonald's restaurants — run their stores. A cohort of operators is standing ground in their ability to continue to independently set prices. The National Owners Association, an independent franchisee advocate group, adopted a Franchisee Bill of Rights in August and circulated it in an email to members last month as the standards took effect, according to a copy of the message viewed by CNBC.The last of the bill's rights is the \"right to set prices without fear of recourse,\" which says, \"Franchisees, as independent Owner/Operators, have the right to set menu prices for their restaurants based on their own business judgment and market conditions. This right exists irrespective of the pricing decisions of any national, regional, or local co-op or franchisor initiative. Franchisees must be free to manage their pricing strategy without fear of intimidation, or diminished support from McDonald's or its affiliated entities.\"It also lists the \"right to renewal and transfer,\" giving owners the \"absolute right to a fair and reasonable opportunity to renew franchise agreements … subject only to objective, clearly stated standards of approval.\"In December, McDonald's told operators it would begin value assessments as part of its updates to franchising standards. Continued noncompliance could result in penalties or even termination. At the time, the company said its new standards would provide \"greater clarity ... to ensure every restaurant delivers consistent, reliable value across the full customer experience,\" according to a memo reviewed by CNBC.In a statement, McDonald's told CNBC that the business model creates the opportunity for entrepreneurs to be in business \"for themselves, but never by themselves,\" adding, \"As franchisor, we have a responsibility to protect the strength and integrity of the brand and ensure every Owner/Operator upholds the standards that make McDonald's so successful, for the benefit of all. This includes showing up for customers with great value – a core expectation the majority of our franchisees understand and proudly deliver.\" Some operators bristled at the changes in recent Wall Street research. In a two-part survey of 20 McDonald's operators released last month, Kalinowski Equity Research wrote that it asked franchisee contacts if they were in favor of the changes to national franchising standards. For context, McDonald's said it has some 2,000 owner/operators in the U.S. franchise system.\"As it turns out, every single one of the franchisees who responded to this question said 'No.' This is the first time in the 20+ year history of our McDonald's Franchisee Survey that all respondents to a Yes-or-No question have all provided the exact same answer,\" Kalinowski wrote.Kalinowski also had operators quantify their relationship with McDonald's corporate arm on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent. The average response received was 1.37,  a \"pretty noticeable step down from the October 2025 average response of 1.71,\" the survey said.It's not the first time some operators and McDonald's have butted heads. Tensions have surfaced in recent years over a restaurant grading system that took effect and changes made to how restaurant agreements are renewed.Still, McDonald's stock was one of the better performers in an abysmal year for the restaurant sector in 2025, rising 5%.Kalinowski's respondents also rated their business outlook for the next six months on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5, excellent. The average response was 2.58, the best in the 11 quarters. Last quarter, CEO Chris Kempczinski said full-year cash flow was set to be solid for operators at the same time value investments were being made. \"Throughout the quarter, McDonald's seems to be doing a better general job of promoting value to quick-service consumers, or at least it's doing so notably better than some other large, quick-service burger concepts are,\" Kalinowski wrote.Likewise, fellow firm BTIG recently upgraded the stock. \"We expect the change in value strategy and perception to lead to the most meaningful earnings growth for the company since 2023,\" BTIG wrote.",

    "body": "Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) listens during a House Rules Committee meeting on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act at the U.S. Capitol on May 21, 2025.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe House will vote Wednesday afternoon on an election bill backed by President Donald Trump that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and require photo identification at the ballot box. The SAVE America Act, introduced by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, has been the focus of a pressure campaign from the White House, hard-line congressional Republicans and online influencers like Elon Musk. Democrats and voting rights groups, meanwhile, say the legislation would disenfranchise millions of Americans, make it harder to register to vote, and put more power in the hands of Trump and the federal government ahead of what is expected to be a difficult midterm election for the GOP.\"It's the president's wishes that elections be turned over to him and his administration,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle, D-N.Y., referring to Trump's recent comments about nationalizing American elections. \"He wants to do it because Republicans know that if the midterm election go off as they expect they should … he will lose the majority of the House, probably lose the majority in the Senate,\" Morelle, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections, told reporters on Tuesday.Under the U.S. Constitution, states are granted control of most aspects of elections.An amended version of the SAVE America Act advanced out of the House Rules Committee on Tuesday. The House is scheduled to take a procedural vote on the measure early Wednesday afternoon, then vote on the underlying bill later in the day.If the legislation passes the House, it faces an uphill climb in the Senate, where Democratic leaders have vowed to block the measure, which needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. At least one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, has come out in opposition. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., a supporter of the legislation, on Tuesday threw cold water on a push to change the filibuster rule in the Senate to clear the way for passage, further undermining the bill's odds of becoming law.\"There aren't anywhere close to the votes, not even close, to nuking the filibuster,\" Thune said at a press conference on Tuesday. \"So that idea is something, although it continues to be put out there. … That doesn't have a future.\"But the House is pressing on.Speaker Mike Johnson during a Wednesday appearance on Fox Business called it a top priority for both the House GOP and the president and echoed Trump's unfounded claims about noncitizen voters deciding federal elections.\"They want illegals to vote. That's why they opened the border wide for four years under [President Joe} Biden and [Vice President Kamala] Harris and allowed in all these dangerous people. It was a means to an end. The end is maintaining their own power,\" Johnson said.\"They've got to cheat, frankly. That's it. They've got to allow illegals to participate in elections so that they can continue to win,\" he continued.It is already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and documented cases are rare.  According to the Brennan Center for Justice and the University of Maryland's Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement, 21 million Americans do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available and 2.6 million Americans lack government-issued photo ID of any kind. Young voters and voters of color could be disproportionately impacted and women whose married names are not on their birth certificates could face additional barriers to register, the Brennan Center warned.The latest push for a GOP-led election reform bill comes nearly a year after the House advanced similar legislation, dubbed the SAVE Act, with the support of four Democrats. The earlier iteration of the bill, also introduced by Roy, required proof of citizenship to register to vote, but did not have the voter-ID provision. It never got a vote on the Senate floor.",

    "body": "watch nowJob growth was stronger than expected to start 2026, providing some relief to concerns about the state of the U.S. labor market.Nonfarm payrolls increased by 130,000 for January, above the Dow Jones consensus estimate for 55,000, according to seasonally adjusted figures the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Wednesday. The total also was an improvement over December, which saw a gain of 48,000 after a slight downward revision.The unemployment rate edged lower to 4.3%, below the forecast to stay unchanged at 4.4% from the prior month. A more encompassing measure that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons slipped to 8%, down 0.4 percentage point from December.Markets rose following the news, with stock market futures ticking higher. Treasury yields also posted strong gains.The report, delayed nearly a week by the partial government shutdown that ended Feb. 3, held consistent with a labor market in a low-growth mode, though with only scattered signs of increasing layoffs. January was the best month for payroll growth since December 2024, following a year in which job creation averaged just 15,000 a month.President Donald Trump touted the numbers as the sign of a strong economy, and again called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.\"GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR GREATER THAN EXPECTED!\" Trump posted on Truth Social. \"The United States of America should be paying MUCH LESS on its Borrowings (BONDS!). We are again the strongest Country in the World, and should therefore be paying the LOWEST INTEREST RATE, by far.\"In addition to the monthly numbers, the BLS released final benchmark revisions for the period of April 2024 to March 2025. Those numbers saw the initial counts revised lower by a total 898,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis. That was a bit lower than the 911,000 figure for the initial estimate last September but around Wall Street expectations.As has often been the case for the U.S. labor market, health care led job gains in December, adding 82,000 positions. Social assistance also rose, up 42,000 as the two categories were responsible for almost all the net job creation. Construction saw a gain of 33,000 following a year in which the sector saw little increase.Several categories posted losses.Federal government jobs fell by 34,000 as some of those laid off last year through Department of Government Efficiency cuts but accepted deferred resignations fell off the payroll count, the BLS said. Financial activities saw a decline of 22,000. \"It was a January job surge,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"The surprisingly strong job gains in January were driven mainly by health care and social assistance. But it is enough to stabilize the job market and send the unemployment rate slightly lower. This is still a largely frozen job market, but it is stabilizing. That's an encouraging sign to start the year, especially after the hiring recession in 2025.\"On wages, average hourly earnings increased 0.4% for the month, 0.1 percentage point higher than expected, and 3.7% annually, in line with the forecast.Wall Street expectations were muted for the report, following a series of other releases showing slow private sector gains, elevated layoff plans and shrinking job openings. Even White House officials, such as National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, had been tamping down expectations.\"After a long period of prognosticators offering a tepid outlook for the economy based on a weakening labor market, this print provides a solid datapoint on the side of robust economic growth, an improving labor market and wage growth that can support consumer spending,\" said Brad Smith, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson InvestorsThe prior year featured consistently modest gains and several months of negative growth for payrolls. Every month in 2025 saw negative revisions, even after President Donald Trump sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer in early August after he criticized large downward adjustments to the job totals. November also saw a downward revision that took the final number down to 41,000, a cut of 15,000 from the prior estimate.Amid the labor market slowness, a White House crackdown on illegal immigration helped dampen labor demand, while a general climate of uncertainty over tariffs and inflation also pushed businesses into tabling plans for workforce growth.However, the December numbers provide some reason for optimism.While the establishment survey showed more jobs than expected, the household survey was even stronger. Used to calculate the unemployment rate, the survey showed a gain of 528,000 workers for the month as the labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.5%.The data likely solidifies the Federal Reserve staying on hold with interest rates. Futures traders raised bets that the Fed would hold the line at its March meeting, though the expectation is still titled toward a cut in June, according to the CME Group's FedWatch gauge.",

    "body": "Elon Musk announced his new company xAI which he says has the goal to understand the true nature of the universe. Jaap Arriens | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesElon Musk's xAI has lost its second co-founder in two days.Influential researcher Jimmy Ba on Tuesday announced his departure in a post on X, thanking Musk and writing that he was, \"Grateful to have helped cofound at the start.\"Ba's departure comes just one day after fellow co-founder Tony Wu announced his own exit from xAI, which merged with Musk's aerospace company SpaceX earlier this month. The xAI co-founder exodus comes as SpaceX prepares to go public sometime this year. A University of Toronto professor, Ba was credited for critical research that influenced the company's Grok version 4 AI models. Besides Ba and Wu, other co-founders including Igor Babuschkin, Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy, have also departed Musk's artificial intelligence venture. Greg Yang announced last month that he would be stepping back from his role to focus on his battle with Lyme disease.The record-setting, all-stock deal valued SpaceX at $1 trillion and xAI at $250 billion, according to documents viewed by CNBC. Musk previously used xAI to acquire his social network X, formerly Twitter, in another all-stock transaction announced in March 2025.The departures also come as xAI faces regulatory probes in multiple jurisdictions across Europe, Asia and the U.S. The probes were initiated after the company's Grok AI chatbot and image generator allowed mass-creation and syndication of non-consensual, explicit images, colloquially known as deepfake porn. The images were based on photos of real people, including children.Musk launched xAI in 2023 alongside 11 other people in an effort to compete against OpenAI and Google. The company's stated goal was to \"understand the true nature of the universe,\" according to its website at the time.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.watch now",

    "body": "Homes in Crockett, California, US, on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2026. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMortgage rates for conventional loans didn't budge last week, and neither did overall demand, but borrowers are actively seeking other loan products that offer bigger savings. Total mortgage application volume increased 0.3% last week compared with the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $832,750 or less, remained unchanged at 6.21%, with points staying unchanged at 0.56, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment. Applications to refinance a home loan rose 1% for the week and were 101% higher than the same week one year ago. Mortgage rates were 74 basis points higher a year ago. Most lenders say if a borrower can save 75 basis points, then the cost of the refinance is worthwhile.

Homebuyers are still facing a pricey market, and supply is starting to fall again after rising for much of last year. \"FHA purchase and refinance applications increased, helped partially by the FHA rate declining and remaining 20 basis points lower than the conforming 30-year fixed rate,\" said Joel Kan, vice president and deputy chief economist at the MBA. \"Borrowers are increasingly utilizing FHA loans as affordability challenges remain, despite recent improvements.\"In addition, the adjustable-rate mortgage share of total applications increased to 8%, a seven-week high. ARM rates last week were almost a full percentage point lower than fixed rates. Mortgage rates dropped slightly on Tuesday, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily. That followed a weaker-than-expected retail sales report. All eyes are now on the monthly employment report set for release Wednesday. \"Several recent rate rallies have been slightly larger than they otherwise might have been because the market may be positioning for a downbeat jobs number,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. \"If it is weaker than expected, there's certainly room for the rate rally to continue, but if the report shows resilience, rates would likely bounce back higher.\"",

    "body": "FILE PHOTO: E.W. Scripps Co. signage is displayed on a monitor on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., on Friday, June 3, 2016. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesE.W. Scripps is setting into motion what it calls a transformation plan for the broadcast station company — intended to generate growth for both earnings and its local TV stations. The company announced Wednesday that it's targeting growth of between $125 million and $150 million in annual enterprise earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2028. In order to get there, Scripps will go through a number of cost savings and revenue growth measures that lean on technology, namely artificial intelligence, CNBC can exclusively report. \"This will essentially be a reorienting of the entire company ... with a much more agile and efficient cost structure,\" CEO Adam Symson said in an interview with CNBC. \"We have to act like a media startup. We've got to act like the company E.W. founded, because the marketplace cannot bear the legacy pace or legacy thinking.\"The company plans to outline more details about its efforts during its next earnings call with investors on Feb. 26, but Symson described making changes to the newsroom to alleviate journalists from administrative tasks and to focus more on gathering and reporting the news. The company declined to comment on specific impacts to staffing as a result of the cost cutting, saying potential effects to jobs would be determined over the next several months. \"Everything is on the table, but our goal is to always preserve the journalism and the sales, the two things that make up our customer relationship,\" said Symson. Scripps owns more than 60 local affiliate broadcast stations across 40 markets, including Ion, which has become a broadcaster of the WNBA and other pro sports games. The company's stock has dropped 70% in the last five years, a decline not unlike many of its media peers. The revitalization for the almost 150-year-old Scripps comes as the company — as well as the broadcast industry at large — finds itself at a historically challenging moment. The broadcast station industry — which also includes publicly traded companies like Nexstar Media Group, Tegna, Sinclair and Gray Media — faces the same challenges as its cable and content studio peers, namely the defection of pay TV bundle subscribers for streaming alternatives. As a result, the industry has been in pursuit of consolidation as it awaits key regulatory changes. Scripps itself has been an M&A target, with Sinclair recently making a hostile approach to merge with the company. Scripps has rejected such overtures. Meanwhile, media outlets across print, digital and TV have been in the midst of massive layoffs in the last year. Paramount Skydance has cut thousands of jobs across the company, including at its CBS News, and most recently The Washington Post reportedly told staffers it would eliminate a third of its newsroom jobs. The rise of AI has also fueled fears about mass layoffs, especially in newsrooms. In 2024 Scripps announced the creation of an AI team that would report to Laura Tomlin, Scripps' chief transformation officer. Symson said her first order of business has been to \"consolidate technology from across the company.\" Symson said Scripps' move to implement new technology is not meant to replace journalism jobs with AI, but instead help newsrooms work more efficiently and ensure a long runway for local news. \"This cannot be a cost-cutting exercise in service to incrementally trying to improve margins from cutting product. That has proven to be the beginning of the end,\" said Symson. \"This really has to be about starting with our consumer understanding, what it is they need out of us, both from our news product as well as our sales product.\"Transformation effortsThis week, Symson gathered 200 leaders from across the company at Scripps' headquarters in Cincinnati to outline the latest plan, which will be announced more broadly on Wednesday to Scripps employees and investors. The company will also reaffirm its most recent earnings guidance, noting it expects its 2026 financial performance to be lifted by midterm elections — local broadcast stations rely heavily on political advertising — as well as the airing of the Winter Olympics and upcoming World Cup on its affiliates this year.

REUTERS/Jonathan ErnstJonathan Ernst | ReutersThis transformation, with the vision tagline, \"We Create Connection,\" is the latest step in recent years for Scripps to find new avenues of revenue growth. \"Scripps' transformation effort is not unique, per se. Everyone in the space is cutting costs,\" said analyst Dan Kurnos of Benchmark in a recent interview. \"Last we checked, broadcast TV wasn't the most rapidly growing segment of the media ecosystem. It's just not as bad as cable.\" During a November earnings call with investors, Symson teased further initiatives the team has been working on, calling out its focus on \"expense management.\"For the local media division, Scripps said its third-quarter expenses had decreased more than 4% year over year and the networks business saw expenses drop 7.5%, both due in part to \"lower employee-related costs.\" Yet Kurnos said that Scripps has deviated from its peers with other moves, such as growing Scripps Sports with local media rights. Scripps' networks now have the rights to air WNBA games, and the company has also been picking up the rights to NHL teams exiting their regional sports networks. \"I think Scripps has been forced to reinvent themselves a few times,\" Kurnos told CNBC.

Scripps Company, Adam Symson poses for a photo with WNBA Commissioner, Cathy Engelbert.Courtesy: ScrippsWhile Scripps has rejected a merger with Sinclair, the company has been doing smaller deals on its own, such as offloading stations and a station swap with Gray Media, which is still pending approval. This week the company also agreed to sell its Court TV network for less than $125 million, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be identified speaking about internal matters.Symson acknowledged the need for consolidation as the industry forges ahead into a new era. But he fell short of saying it was a necessity, at least for Scripps, as some of his peers have said on recent public calls. \"Responsible consolidation is important for the industry, without question. But make no mistake about it, it is financial engineering,\" said Symson. \"It will create a tail wind for our business that investors should appreciate, and we will go after it, but it will not create the organic growth that we are talking about here.\"  Symson's history at Scripps runs deep and began in the newsroom. He started at the company as an executive producer of investigations and special projects at a Scripps-owned affiliate in Phoenix before joining the corporate parent in 2003 and taking over as CEO in 2017. The latest transformation efforts follow similar shifts in 2023, when Scripps eliminated some anchor roles, added reporters in smaller markets and increased reporters' wages, among other changes. \"It is very personal to me. I think at this point, I'm the only CEO of a broadcast company that comes from a journalism background and from the newsroom,\" said Symson. \"What we do is too important for us to not go on the offense and aggressively transform the company in order to ensure that we're a company that continues to thrive.\"Disclosure: CNBC parent Versant is carrying NBC Sports-produced Olympic coverage on its networks, including USA Network and CNBC.",

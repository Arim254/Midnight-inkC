    "body": "Every job, when you boil it down, is simply people talking to other people. As a career coach, I've advised professionals at all career stages. From what I've seen, the people who get ahead the fastest know how to communicate in a way that truly gets people to listen. You may not realize it, but the language you use could be standing between you and what you want. Here are five simple language swaps that can help you succeed, forge meaningful relationships, and demand more respect at work.1. Swap closed asks for open asks You're always going to face moments where you have a question you're not quite sure how to ask. Maybe you want to work from home, take a sabbatical, or get an extra week of vacation for your honeymoon. Because these are high-stakes situations, most people walk into the conversation radiating anxiety, cornering their opponent, or blurting out a closed-ended, yes-or-no question.But making an open-ended ask can take the pressure off both parties and invite a dialogue about a process, priority or norm. It makes you look thoughtful, rather than entitled. Instead of \"Can you write me a recommendation?\" try \"What does your typical process for writing recommendations look like?\"Instead of \"Can I leave early Friday?\" try \"How does the team typically handle flexibility on Fridays?\"Instead of \"Can I get a promotion?\" try \"What would you say should be my priorities if I want to get promoted this year?\"2. Swap apologies for gratitudeWhether it's a typo in a Slack message or you're running 15 minutes late to an important meeting, missteps happen. Genuine apologies are necessary at times, but over-apologizing often backfires. Research has found that habitual, unnecessary apologizing can erode how others perceive your competence and confidence. But it can also feel awkward not to acknowledge small mistakes, so I recommend replacing unnecessary apologies with gratitude. Instead of \"Sorry I'm a minute late!\" try \"Thank you so much for waiting. Let's get started.\"Instead of \"Sorry for all the questions,\" try \"I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through this.\"Instead of \"Sorry, I know this is last-minute,\" try \"Thanks for being flexible with the timeline. I know this is last-minute.\"3. Swap your 'buts' for 'ands' The word \"but\" often negates everything that comes before it. Whenever you're stating two things that are equally valid, I encourage you to replace \"but\" with \"and.\" Instead of \"I love my job, but I need a raise,\" try \"I love my job, and I need a raise.\"Instead of \"This was a great quarter, but we need to improve retention,\" try \"This was a great quarter, and we need to improve retention.\"Instead of \"I appreciate the feedback, but I disagree,\" try \"I appreciate the feedback, and I see it a bit differently.\"The \"and\" version of these examples doesn't minimize either statement. It allows two things to be true at once, promoting greater nuance and clarity. 4. Swap 'I feel like…' for 'I noticed that'\"I feel like\" can come across as gentle, soft, and humble, which are all wonderful things to be. But in a professional setting, it can soften your message to the point where it can be easily dismissed. It frames your professional observations as personal emotions. In a work environment where data and clarity carry weight, that framing can work against you. Here's what you can say instead:Instead of \"I feel like we're behind schedule,\" try \"I've noticed we're falling behind schedule.\"Instead of \"I feel like we should go with option two,\" try \"My recommendation is to move forward with option two.\"Instead of \"I feel like we aren't on the same page,\" try \"It seems like we're not aligned on this.\"5. Swap 'why' with 'how' or 'what'Questions that begin with \"why\" can put people on the defensive. Even if unintended, \"why\" often implies judgment, asking someone to justify their choices or thinking.When someone feels like they need to defend themselves, the conversation stops being collaborative and starts being adversarial. Instead, invite your conversation partner to walk you through their thought process, rather than demanding they explain themselves.Instead of \"Why do you think launching a week earlier would be smart?\" try \"How do you think launching a week earlier would benefit the campaign?\"Instead of \"Why are you doing it like that?\" try \"What technique are you using?\"Instead of \"Why did you move the meeting?\" try \"What was the reason for moving the meeting?\"Instead of \"Why did you assume it wouldn't work?\" try \"How did you come to that conclusion?\"Ultimately, when you make these shifts, the person you're talking to will feel more heard and respected — and will be more willing to have an honest conversation with you as a result. Erin McGoff is the founder of AdviceWithErin and author of \"The Secret Language of Work.\" Follow her @AdviceWithErin.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work? Take CNBC's new online course, Master Your Body Language To Boost Your Influence.

    "body": "watch nowWarner Bros. Discovery on Tuesday said it will reopen deal talks with Paramount Skydance under a seven-day waiver from Netflix to explore \"deficiencies\" in Paramount's offer to buy the entirety of WBD. The legacy media company has a pending transaction with Netflix for its streaming and studio businesses. Paramount launched a hostile tender offer straight to WBD shareholders at $30 per share after losing out to Netflix in a bidding war. \"Netflix has provided WBD a limited waiver under the terms of WBD's merger agreement with Netflix, permitting WBD to engage in discussions with Paramount Skydance (\"PSKY\") (NASDAQ: PSKY) for a seven-day period ending on February 23, 2026 to seek clarity for WBD stockholders and provide PSKY the ability to make its best and final offer,\" Warner Bros. Discovery said in a release. \"During this period, WBD will engage with PSKY to discuss the deficiencies that remain unresolved and clarify certain terms of PSKY's proposed merger agreement,\" it said. Paramount leadership has repeatedly said its $30 per share, all-cash offer is not its \"best and final.\" Last week the company sweetened its offer with additional \"enhancements,\" but stopped short of raising the per-share value. Warner Bros. Discovery said Tuesday that a senior Paramount representative informed a WBD board member that it would pay $31 per share if deal talks were to reopen. After the limited waiver period, Netflix will retain its matching rights provided by the merger agreement, WBD said. \"Throughout the entire process, our sole focus has been on maximizing value and certainty for WBD shareholders,\" said WBD CEO David Zaslav in a statement. \"Every step of the way, we have provided PSKY with clear direction on the deficiencies in their offers and opportunities to address them. We are engaging with PSKY now to determine whether they can deliver an actionable, binding proposal that provides superior value and certainty for WBD shareholders through their best and final offer.\"WBD also on Tuesday announced a special meeting of shareholders will be held on March 20 and said its board continues to unanimously recommend the Netflix deal over Paramount's offer. Netflix said in a statement the shareholder meeting date marked an \"important milestone for our transaction with WBD.\" \"While we are confident that our transaction provides superior value and certainty, we recognize the ongoing distraction for WBD stockholders and the broader entertainment industry caused by PSKY's antics,\" Netflix said. \"Accordingly, we granted WBD a narrow seven-day waiver of certain obligations under our merger agreement to allow them to engage with PSKY to fully and finally resolve this matter.\" Shares of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery were each up roughly 3% in premarket trading Tuesday. ",

(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images)Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesApple on Monday announced that it will bring a new integrated video podcast experience to Apple Podcasts this spring.The move comes as video viewership continues to reshape podcasting. About 37% of people over age 12 watch video podcasts monthly, according to Edison Research.The update brings Apple Podcasts more in-line with its competitors Spotify, YouTube and now Netflix, which have increasingly leaned into video podcasting.\"Twenty years ago, Apple helped take podcasting mainstream by adding podcasts to iTunes, and more than a decade ago, we introduced the dedicated Apple Podcasts app,\" said Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Services, in a statement. \"By bringing a category-leading video experience to Apple Podcasts, we're putting creators in full control of their content and how they build their businesses, while making it easier than ever for audiences to listen to or watch podcasts.\"Within the Apple Podcasts app, users will be able to switch seamlessly between watching and listening to shows from the same feed. They can also use picture-in-picture mode and download video episodes for offline viewing.While Apple Podcasts has supported video through RSS since 2005, those feeds were kept separate from audio versions of the same show. The new update introduces support for HLS, or HTTP Live Streaming, a streaming protocol developed by Apple that enables adaptive video playback and greater controls within the app.The new HLS format also introduces dynamic video ad insertion. Creators who distribute through participating hosting providers and ad networks will be able to insert video ads, including host-read spots, into episodes.Apple said it will not charge creators or hosting providers to distribute content. However, it will charge participating ad networks an impression-based fee for delivering dynamic video ads through HLS.These launch podcast hosting partners include Acast, Amazon-owned ART19, Triton's Omny Studio and SiriusXM who will all be supporting HLS video.The announcement comes as competitors continue investing in podcast video. YouTube said last year it has more than 1 billion monthly active viewers of podcast content on its platform. Spotify has also expanded its video podcast offerings and said it paid more than $100 million to podcasters in the first quarter of last year.Netflix has also entered the video podcast space. The streaming platform inked a deal with Spotify last year to bring video podcasts to Netflix and has begun investing in original video podcast programming, including \"The Pete Davidson Show,\" which launched in January.Apple does not break out revenue specifically for Apple Podcasts, but its Services segment, which includes digital content and subscription businesses, generated $30 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter.In January, the company acquired Israeli artificial intelligence startup Q.ai for an undisclosed amount. The company has not released details of the acquisition, though Q.ai's website indicated it was working on audio-focused AI tools.",

    "body": "Pedestrians stand in front of an electronic quotation board displaying the numbers of the Nikkei Stock Average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Tokyo on Feb. 3, 2026.Kazuhiro Nogi | Afp | Getty ImagesJapan's economy grew 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months, narrowly avoiding a technical recession.While it was a reversal of the 0.7% contraction in the third quarter, the gross domestic product missed expectations of a 0.4% expansion by economists polled by Reuters.A technical recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. On an annualized basis, output rose 0.2%, compared with forecasts of 1.6%, following a 2.3% decline in the previous quarter.Compared with a year earlier, fourth-quarter GDP expanded 0.1%, slowing from 0.6% in the third quarter. Private consumption drove the modest expansion, offsetting weakness in exports and public spending, according to data from Japan's Cabinet Office.Following the data release, the Nikkei 225 opened up 0.12%, but the yen weakened 0.25% to 153.06 against the dollar.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconThe Bank of Japan in January raised its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2026 to 0.9% from 0.7%. It also lifted its fiscal 2026 outlook to 1% from 0.7%.The central bank said it expects moderate expansion as other countries return to growth. The BOJ also said it sees a virtuous cycle of rising prices and wages, supported by the government's economic measures and accommodative financial conditions.The data also comes as Japan works with the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, on a $550 billion investment pledge under its trade deal with Washington.Public broadcaster NHK reported last Friday that Tokyo and Washington have yet to agree on the first projects tied to the pledge. Japan Economy Minister Ryosei Akazawa was quoted as saying he hoped the initial projects would be finalized before Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi meets U.S. President Donald Trump.Trump had announced the meeting with Takaichi just before the Feb. 8 Lower House election, which saw Takaichi lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide victory.After her victory, Takaichi said last Monday that she would support economic growth by boosting investment through \"proactive\" fiscal policy, although she did not elaborate. She had earlier pledged to suspend food taxes for two years and boost defence spending to 2% of the country's GDP.Defense will be the next major catalyst driving Japanese equities higher, said Bruce Kirk, Chief Japan Equity Strategist and managing director at Goldman Sachs. Speaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" Kirk pointed to Takaichi's upcoming meeting with Trump, saying he expects a \"flurry of announcements\" involving Japanese and U.S. companies across areas such as industrialization, factory automation, and shipbuilding. Kirk also highlighted a document released by the Trump administration over the weekend that called for the restoration of U.S. maritime dominance and touted cooperation with Japan and South Korea in revitalizing shipbuilding.Before the election, Takaichi had announced a record 122 trillion yen budget for the fiscal year starting April 1, marking a second straight year of record spending and vowing to support households with cost-of-living pressures. Japan's inflation had slowed sharply to 2.1% in January, its lowest level since March 2022. Still, prices have remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 45 consecutive months.— CNBC's Martin Soong contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Qwen3 is Alibaba's latest large language model, which it says combines traditional LLM capabilities with \"advanced, dynamic reasoning.\"Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesAlibaba Group has released its newest AI model series, featuring enhanced capabilities, as it faces intensifying competition in China's AI space with several models launched in the past week. The Qwen3.5 AI model comes in an open-weight version, which allows users to download, run, fine-tune, and deploy it on their own infrastructure. Alibaba also released a \"hosted version,\" meaning the model can run on Alibaba's own servers.  Both models were made available on Monday, the eve of the Chinese New Year, and come just a week after Alibaba released a new AI model designed for robots. The company highlighted that Qwen3.5 offers improvements in performance and cost and was built with \"native multimodal capabilities,\" enabling the models to understand text, images and video simultaneously within one system.Leaning into a major AI trend this year, the model also supports new coding and agentic capabilities and is compatible with open-source AI agents like those from OpenClaw, which recently surged in popularity. AI agents are systems that can independently take actions and complete multi-step tasks on a user's behalf with minimal supervision. These agents and their abilities have garnered a lot of attention in recent weeks, after American AI company Anthropic released new agent tools. The potential for these agents to replace the work of software as a service companies, amongst others, has rocked markets. Alibaba's local competitors such as ByteDance and Zhipu AI also released upgraded models in the past week aimed at supporting more agent capabilities.Marc Einstein, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC that artificial intelligence companies are preparing for the possibility that AI agents could \"upend traditional Internet business models.\"\"If this happens the consequences for those who are not prepared will be severe and [Chinese AI companies] are aware of this,\" he said. Alibaba said that its new Qwen3.5 open-weight model comes with 397 billion parameters — variables that shape how an AI system learns and reasons. While less than its previous flagship model, the company said the latest model showed significant improvement based on self-reported benchmark evaluations.Alibaba provided benchmark tests showing that Qwen3.5's performance was on par with leading models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google DeepMind, though the comparisons were self-reported. Meanwhile, it also released a \"hosted model\" called the Qwen-3.5-Plus through its cloud platform Model Studio. Alibaba said this version also demonstrated performance on par with leading competitors. CNBC could not independently verify those claims.The new Qwen3.5 models also support 201 languages and dialects, up from the previous generation's 82. Counterpoint's Einstein said this feature reflects Alibaba's global ambitions.The company is expected to release more open-weight models during this Chinese New Year, Lin Junyang, technical lead of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team said in a social media post.Following the release of Anthropic's latest Claude AI agent tools, other American AI giants have been accelerating the development of agentic capabilities. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Sunday that the creator of the OpenClaw would be joining the company. Last month, Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis told CNBC that Chinese AI models were just \"months\" behind Western rivals.",

Jesse Jackson, a civil rights icon, Baptist minister and two-time Democratic presidential candidate, died Tuesday at age 84.The Jackson family confirmed his passing in a statement on Tuesday morning.\"Our father was a servant leader — not only to our family, but to the oppressed, the voiceless, and the overlooked around the world,\" his family said.\"We shared him with the world, and in return, the world became part of our extended family. His unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions, and we ask you to honor his memory by continuing the fight for the values he lived by.\" He died peacefully surrounded by his family on Tuesday morning, the family said in their statement. Jackson is survived by his wife, Jacqueline, six children and multiple grandchildren.The civil rights leader spent decades in the public eye fighting to end racial and class divisions in America.A protégé of Martin Luther King Jr., Jackson fought on the front lines of the battle against Jim Crow segregation laws as a college student. He stood out for his rousing speeches, radical ideas and passion for racial equality. Jackson would become a key figure in the civil rights movement that pressed for broader economic opportunities for Black people through the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, or SCLC, and more recently, his organization the Rainbow PUSH coalition. Mahalia Jackson, left, sings \"We Shall Overcome\" with civil rights leaders the Rev. Martin Luther King, third left, Jesse Jackson, second from right, and Albert Raby, right, on Aug. 4, 1966.Ray Foster | Tribune News Service | Getty ImagesJackson eventually transitioned into politics. In 1984 and 1988, he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, winning multiple primaries and surpassing expectations each time. He based his campaigns on expanded equality for various racial minority groups, the working class and women.Later, Jackson served as U.S. special envoy to Africa in the 1990s. He also acted as \"shadow senator\" for Washington, D.C., a role in which he lobbied for the district's statehood.During the 1980s and 1990s, Jackson also negotiated the release of dozens of international hostages and prisoners, and became a vocal supporter of voting and LGBTQ rights. Participants carry a banner during the Gay Rights March April 25, 1993 in Washington, DC.

During the 1984 presidential primary, he referred to Jews with the slur \"Hymies\" and called New York \"Hymietown\" in remarks he at first denied and later apologized for. \"Saturday Night Live\" lampooned the incident in a sketch featuring Eddie Murphy playing Jackson. And, in a testament to his stature in American political and popular culture, Jackson himself hosted \"SNL\" later that year.In 2001, he admitted to having an extramarital affair that led to the birth of a daughter.Jackson had been fighting Parkinson's disease since November 2017. In August 2021, he and his wife were hospitalized with Covid-19 at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He was discharged in September after receiving successful treatment for the virus and Parkinson's disease. While Jackson had largely been absent from the political and civil rights main stage in recent years, he had taken every opportunity to renew pushes for equality. Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes (L) and Reverend Jesse Jackson, national head of Operation Breadbasket, chat together before Mayor Stokes delivered an address in connection with the Black Expo in Chicago. Mayor Stokes called for a \"black political strategy for 1972\" which \"may mean the actual running of a black person for president.\"Bettmann | Getty Images\"If we played the big game, and the rules are not fair, and goals not clear and public, we would protest, but in politics we seem to make it alright, it's not alright,\" said Jackson in a 2018 podcast appearance. \"We want a system that's fair, and fairly applied. Americans want and deserve an even playing field with equal protection under the law, equal access and fairness.\"His family said Tuesday that it was his \"unwavering commitment to justice, equality and human rights\" that helped shape \"a global movement for freedom and dignity.\"\"A tireless change agent, he elevated the voices of the voiceless—from his Presidential campaigns in the 1980s to mobilizing millions to register to vote—leaving an indelible mark on history,\" the statement said.Roots of Jackson's activism Jesse Louis Jackson was born Oct. 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, to Helen Burns and Noah Louis Robinson, a married man and former professional boxer. A year after Jackson was born, his mother married Charles Henry Jackson, a post office worker who later adopted him when he was 15.Jackson grew up being taunted by other school children for his out-of-wedlock birth, which he said ultimately became his motivation to succeed. The Reverend Jesse Jackson speaking to crowd in Chicago in Sept. 1969.Bettmann | Getty Images''It is where I get the drive to think I could change the South through the civil rights movement and run for President,'' Jackson told The New York Times in 1997. As a child, Jackson would know the harsh reality of the Jim Crow era, growing up at a time when racial segregation was in full force across the U.S. He attended all-Black public schools and was taught to sit at the back of buses and use \"colored\" restrooms and drinking fountains. After graduating from Greenville's Sterling High School in 1959, Jackson spent a year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He then transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College, or A&T, a historically Black school in Greensboro, North Carolina. It was during his time at A&T that he first became active in the civil rights movement. Jackson joined the local Congress of Racial Equality chapter in Greensboro and participated in local protests and sit-ins against segregated public facilities. \"I came out of Greensboro,\" Jackson told the Greensboro News & Record in 2015. \"It was my launching pad. All that I subsequently became in the movement came out of the lessons I learned in Greensboro.\"After being barred from accessing books at the public library and placed in jail for trying to use the same library for class work, Jackson said he felt the \"insult of segregation\" and the \"liberating power of going to jail for dignity,\" according to the News & Record. While home from college, he became a part of the Greenville Eight, a group of Black students who in 1960 protested the South Carolina city's segregated library system. Jackson and seven Black high school students refused to leave the whites-only Hughes Main Library and were arrested for \"disorderly conduct.\"Following their staged sit-in, the library system of the city became racially integrated.It marked the beginning of what would become a lifetime career of civil rights activism. Fighting for Civil Rights in the SCLC After graduating from A&T in 1964, Jackson pursued divinity studies at the Chicago Theological Seminary and began to organize student support for Martin Luther King Jr. Crowds in Memphis, Tennessee, following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr in the city, 8th April 1968. In the centre, from left to right are singer Harry Belafonte, Coretta Scott King with Jesse Jackson behind, Reverend Ralph Abernathy and Reverend Andrew Young.Santi Visalli | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesOn March 7, 1965, a day that would become known as Bloody Sunday, Jackson watched on television as club-wielding Alabama state troopers fired tear gas and charged at hundreds of nonviolent demonstrators who had just crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The demonstrators were part of the historic marches from Selma to the Alabama capital of Montgomery to fight for Black civil and voting rights. A day after witnessing the violence on television, Jackson organized a caravan of seminary students to drive down to Alabama and join King in the Selma-to-Montgomery marches.Jackson appeared at several commemorations of the marches, including an event hosted by former President Bill Clinton on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 2000.  Reverend Jesse Jackson (2nd L), Coretta Scott King (3rd L), US President Bill Clinton (4th L) and US Rep.

My first-born son Jesse Jr. was born when we were marching here, I almost named him Selma.\" \"In Selma, America was reborn, democracy redefined, human rights redefined. The fruits of Selma are bountiful. And so today, we say to all of America, America won. One flag, one nation,\" Jackson said, drawing roaring applause. \"Not the flag of sedition and slavery and segregation. But one America, one flag.\"Impressed by Jackson's passion and organizational abilities during the marches, King gave him a staff position at the SCLC, the civil rights organization that King led until his death. Just three courses short of finishing his studies at the seminary, Jackson dropped out to pursue a full-time career in civil rights. Though he still became an ordained Baptist minister in 1968. In 1966, he was placed in charge of the Chicago branch of Operation Breadbasket, an SCLC initiative that monitored white companies' treatment of Black people and organized boycotts calling for fair hiring practices. While Jackson was seen by some in the SCLC as a \"loose cannon\" that worked too independently of others in the organization, his leadership was integral to the Chicago branch's success. Under Jackson, the Operation Breadbasket branch won 2,000 new jobs worth $15 million a year in new income to the Black community. He was promoted to national director of Operation Breadbasket in 1968, the same year King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. Jackson was a floor below King when he was shot dead at the Lorraine Motel on April 4, though he told reporters that the civil rights leader died in his arms, a claim that several King aides have disputed. Rev.

Every time, the trauma of the incident. His lying there. Blood everywhere. It hurts all the time,\" Jackson said in a 2018 interview with CNN. Jackson was embroiled in controversy after the assassination, with other SCLC leaders accusing him of using the organization and King's death for self-promotion. Ralph Abernathy, King's successor as chairman of the SCLC, told the New York Times in 1977, \"I hope God has forgiven [Jackson.]\"In 1971, Jackson formally resigned from the SCLC and founded Operation PUSH, or People United to Serve Humanity — his own Chicago-based civil rights organization that aimed to improve the economic conditions of Black communities across the U.S. Twenty five years later, it would merge with the National Rainbow Coalition, Jackson's other civil rights organization that sought equal rights for the working class, women and racial minority groups. The Reverend Jesse Jackson Sr. delivers remarks 15 January 2008 on Dr. Martin Luther King's approaching birthday and recent comments by US democratic presidential candidates at the National Press Club in Washington, DC.Paul J. Richards | AFP | Getty ImagesSince its establishment, Jackson has served as president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, which aims to \"protect, defend, and gain civil rights by leveling the economic and educational playing fields,\" according to its website. Entering the political fieldJackson's fame would escalate in 1984 when he ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, becoming the second Black American to launch a nationwide campaign for president. While pundits dismissed his candidacy, Jackson had a surprisingly strong run. Politician Jesse Jackson delivers a speech during his 1984 presidential campaign in Chicago, Illinois.David Hume Kennerly | Hulton Archive | Getty ImagesHe came in third in the competitive race for the Democratic nomination as Walter Mondale became the nominee, and would exceed expectations again when he ran for president a second time. In 1988, Jackson came in second behind nominee Michael Dukakis. But his unsuccessful presidential campaigns were not the end of his political career. In 1991, Jackson won election to an unpaid office of \"statehood senator,\" popularly known as \"shadow senator,\" to lobby the U.S. Congress for statehood for the District of Columbia. ″Why D.C. statehood? Why not mayor?″ Jackson asked at a gathering of Democratic women in July 1990, The Associated Press reported. ″Because my life commitment is to expand democracy. My quest is not employment. It's empowerment.″US President Bill Clinton (R) presents the Rev. Jesse Jackson (L) with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the East Room of the White House 09 August, 2000 in Washington, DC.Tim Sloan | AFP | Getty ImagesHe would serve as a \"shadow senator\" until getting tapped by then-President Clinton to become the U.S. special envoy to Africa in 1997. \"What joy, what privilege, what responsibility,\" Jackson said at his swearing-in ceremony. \"I called my mother; we prayed.\"\"It is quite a journey from Haynie Street in Greenville, South Carolina. A happy home, but an environment of such low expectations, where our family was denied the right to vote, even though my father was an honorably discharged veteran of the army,\" Jackson said. \"From that to an assignment by the President and Secretary of State, to in some small measure, to help shape our foreign policy by building bridges between the U.S. and Africa.\"On several occasions, Jackson also worked independently to secure the release of prisoners held by anti-American regimes. Jesse Jackson (left), Baptist minister and candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984, attends a press conference with Cuban dictator Fidel Castro during Jackson's visit to Cuba.Jacques M. Chenet | Corbis Historical | Getty ImagesHe frustrated President Ronald Reagan's administration by traveling to Syria in 1983 to fight for the release of a U.S. fighter pilot who had been held hostage by the Syrian government. That same year, he negotiated the release of 48 American and Cuban prisoners held hostage by the communist Cuban government. And in 1991, Jackson worked to free several hundred citizens hiding in Iraq and Kuwait before the Persian Gulf War. Jackson also advocated for the LGBTQ community when few prominent Democrats dared to do so, becoming the first speaker at a Democratic National Convention to mention gay and lesbian Americans.He has been a long champion of voting rights as well. In August, he and others were arrested outside the U.S. Capitol during a demonstration calling for the end to the filibuster. \"Black and Brown people are the base of the party. We're not the bottom. We're the foundation,\" Jackson told the crowd, according to The Washington Post. \"If we lose, they lose. If we lose, democracy loses. If we lose, Democrats lose. If we lose, the nation loses.\"Reverend Jesse Jackson delivers a speech as Americans shout slogans and hold banners during a demonstration against the death of eighteen-year-old unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on August 16, 2014.Bilgin Sasmaz | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images",

The minister did not name any specific platforms or companies that the Indian government is talking to.Any crackdown in India, a country of over 1.4 billion people, could have a major impact on companies from Meta to Google, which have hundreds of millions of users in the nation. While India has not yet decided on such a move, the comments are among the first publicly from a top official in government. India now joins a growing chorus of governments that are debating whether to restrict children from certain platforms, following Australia's move in December to ban users under the age of 16 from accessing major social media platforms. Read moreAustralia became the world's first country to enact such a rule, with other countries now looking to follow suit. Denmark late last year approved a new rule to block under-15s from social media platforms, while Spain this month said it would ban under-16s from social media. Meta's Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram platforms are estimated to be among the most popular apps in India while there is also a big audience for Google's YouTube.  ",

Discovery's board is considering reopening sales talks with Paramount Skydance after recently receiving an amended offer with sweetened deal terms, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.Warner Bros. in December agreed to sell both its film studio and HBO Max streaming service to Netflix for $27.75 per share. Paramount, which owns CBS and MTV, in December launched a hostile bid for Warner Bros., promising its shareholders $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Last week, Paramount upped the ante, saying it would add a ticking fee of 25 cents a share to its offer for any delay in regulatory approval of the deal. The ticking fee would be approximately $650 million in cash value per quarter for every quarter the deal has not closed by Dec. 31, 2026, CNBC.com previously reported.Paramount also said it will cover a $2.8 billion termination fee paid to Netflix if the Warner Bros. deal is terminated. Paramount also said it will eliminate $1.5 billion in possible debt refinancing costs. Both Paramount and Netflix have said they would be willing to raise their bids to secure the Warner Bros. deal, Bloomberg reported. However, this is the first time Warner Bros. has considered whether Paramount's offer could either result in a better deal or prompt Netflix to offer better deal terms, according to the report.Read the complete Bloomberg report here.WATCH: Chadwick: This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Paramountwatch now",

    "body": "Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap Inc., attends the annual Allen and Co. Sun Valley Media and Technology Conference at the Sun Valley Resort in Sun Valley, Idaho, July 9, 2025.David A. Grogan | CNBCSnap is introducing a subscription feature that will allow creators to earn recurring income directly from their most engaged fans, as the social media company works to diversify beyond advertising.The Los Angeles company will begin testing \"Creator Subscriptions,\" as the feature is called, on Monday, starting with a small cohort of Snapchat creators, the company told CNBC exclusively. With user growth moderating, Snap's expansion into paid creator subscriptions emphasizes the company's initiative to grow income beyond advertising and build more predictable revenue streams. \"In the year ahead, growth in subscribers will be a critical input metric to track our progress,\" Snap CEO Evan Spiegel wrote earlier this month as part of the company's fourth-quarter results. Snap's existing subscription offerings, Snapchat+ and Memories Storage Plans, grew 71% year over year to reach 24 million users in the period. However, the company reported 474 million daily active users, down 3 million from the previous quarter. With the upcoming feature, Snapchat users will be able to pay to subscribe to their favorite creators and receive exclusive content, including direct photos or videos, as well as access a subscriber-only Story and send text-based replies that can be featured at the top of a creator's public Story.\"We want the next step in our long-term creator monetization journey to be one that's really rooted in real relationships,\" said Jim Shepherd, Snap's head of content partnerships, in an interview with CNBC. \"And help creators expand the ways that they make money in a way that's predictable and they can make money from their most engaged fans.\"watch nowSnap is entering an increasingly crowded market for direct-to-fan subscriptions. Platforms like Patreon, Substack and OnlyFans are built around paid memberships, while major social media companies have introduced their own in-app subscription tools. In 2018, Google's YouTube started offering Channel Memberships, where creators receive 70% of membership revenue after taxes and fees are deducted, with transaction costs covered by the company. In 2020 and 2022, respectively, Meta's Facebook and Instagram began allowing creators to offer subscriptions, and Meta currently lets them keep 100% of subscription revenue after fees, according to company's website.On Snapchat, creators will be able to set their own subscription price within a range of $4.99 to $19.99 per month. After platform fees, creators will receive approximately 60% of subscription revenue. Snap said it will provide creators with performance data to help guide pricing decisions as the product evolves beyond its initial test phase.Snap's initial group includes 15 creators to start, with roughly 10 more expected in the U.S. during the early test phase. The company said outreach is also underway in Canada, the U.K. and France. Participants include popular creators like David Dobrik, Catherine Paiz, Harry Jowsey, Jeremiah Brown and Skai Jackson.\"We've built a place where their income feels really rewarding, consistent, sustainable,\" Shepherd said. Creators \"consistently say that it's a great place where they can make a living by being themselves.\"Creators on Snapchat currently earn revenue through ads in Stories and Spotlight under the company's Unified Monetization Program as well as through brand partnerships.Shepherd said that Snap's advantage lies in distribution and discovery through the company's Spotlight feature, which shows users short-form videos from other users on the app.\"We have a built-in distribution engine where so many creators are building fandoms,\" Shepherd said. Over the coming weeks, the feature will be available for users in eligible countries using Apple iOS devices. Creators Subscriptions will not be available for Android users initially, and the company did not say when that will change. WATCH: CNBC's full interview with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel",

Due to the passage of President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act last year, Parent PLUS borrowers will no longer qualify for IDR plans starting in July. IDR plans cap eligible borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income and culminate in student loan forgiveness.\"Our concern is that thousands of Parent PLUS borrowers who would otherwise be eligible for IDR plans and forgiveness post-July 2026 will not take the required action and be stuck with paying loans back in a plan they cannot afford,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.

The typical parent balance is around $32,000. Here's what parent borrowers need to know about preserving their relief options. How parent repayment options are changingStarting July 1, Parent PLUS borrowers will have only one option to repay their debt: the new Standard Repayment Plan. Under Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the Standard Plan will spread a borrower's debt into fixed payments over one of four time frames, depending on what they owe. In its current form, the plan comes with a 10-year term for all borrowers.Under the revised plan, only borrowers with balances up to $24,999 will retain a 10-year repayment term. Those who owe between $25,000 and $49,999 will repay over 15 years; balances ranging from $50,000 to $99,999 will be repaid over 20 years; and debts of $100,000 or more will have a 25-year repayment term. Due to longer repayment timelines, borrowers stand to pay significantly more in interest under the new program. Often, parents risk jeopardizing their own financial futures by borrowing for their children's education, Boyd said. Having only a single repayment option could worsen the problem. \"A Standard amortizing payment can be very hard to absorb, especially if they're nearing retirement,\" she said. Consolidate before April to ensure IDR accessMomo Productions | Digitalvision | Getty ImagesIf borrowers consolidate their Parent PLUS loans into a so-called Direct Consolidation Loan now, they can maintain access to IDR options, Nierman said.  The consolidation process, which involves packaging your federal loans into a new one, usually takes between four and six weeks, so Nierman recommends borrowers submit their request at Studentaid.gov no later than March 31. If you've already consolidated your Parent PLUS loans, you now have a Direct Consolidation Loan and therefore more repayment flexibility, \"so you are generally not in a group with any deadline pressure,\" Boyd said. During the consolidation application process, parents must select the Income-Contingent Repayment plan and make at least one payment under that program, she added. After that, you should be able to move into the Income-Based Repayment plan, which will likely result in the lowest monthly payment, Nierman said. This is the process the Department of Education requires from its interpretation of the new law.If you're in default on a Parent PLUS loan, requesting a consolidation should bring you back into a current status and preserve your IDR plan and loan forgiveness options, she said. Current parent borrowers should plan ahead Parent borrowers with a student currently in college will need to think ahead. If you take out any new Parent PLUS loans on or after July 1, 2026, you forfeit IDR access and must repay your student debt in the new Standard program. Consolidating will not help you after that date. Parent PLUS borrowers will also face a new annual loan limit of $20,000 starting in July, with a $65,000 lifetime cap. Currently, parents can borrow up to the cost of attendance for their children, minus any other aid, and there is no aggregate limit.",

Among the key attendees are OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai. Anthropic boss Dario Amodei and Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis are also slated to be there. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, who was earlier expected to attend, reportedly withdrew on Saturday due to \"unforeseen circumstances.\"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will roll out of the red carpet which tech CEOs will happily walk down as the country presents a lucrative market of young, tech-forward consumers and a huge pool of talent which could be key to continued development of AI. \"The summit ... is a huge validation of the potential of the market. Everyone's coming in because they realize that this is the place to be in and India just cannot be ignored,\" Lalit Ahuja, CEO of ANSR, a company that helps businesses run offshore teams in India.The AI Impact Summit also comes amid a reset in relations between India and the U.S. as the two nations push toward a trade deal. India strives to be a major tech hubModi's government has made its intentions clear in the last few years — it wants India to be one of the world's tech superpowers. India has approved $18 billion worth of semiconductor projects as it looks to build a domestic supply chain. The government has pushed major companies, including Apple, to manufacture more of its goods in India.Venture capital investors are betting on India's startups while the country's stock exchanges are seeing a surge in initial public offerings. Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research said government support for tech \"is a red carpet for multinational companies to set up, expand and diversify their global operations.\"And with the door open, major firms are likely to announce big investments this week in India, while New Delhi will talk up the opportunities in the country. AI focusAI, unsurprisingly, is going to be a big focus from three angles: infrastructure, users and talent.There is likely to be big infrastructure investment deals announced around AI data centers as demand continues to rise and tech companies thirst for more computing power. In December, Amazon, Microsoft and Intel made commitments to building AI infrastructure and chips in India. India is one of OpenAI's top markets for ChatGPT and alongside rivals like Perplexity are offering their products for free in a race to gain users and potentially lucrative data for further training. There is no major domestic rival to these U.S. chatbots, providing a good opportunity to gain users with a tech-savvy user base. And access to talent is also attractive. India is an \"AI talent factory,\" Sham Arora, chief technology officer at Tech Mahindra, told CNBC's \"Inside India\" last week. watch nowThere is an increasing number of so-called Global Capability Centers (GCCs) that are being created in India. These are effectively offshore hubs which are set up on behalf of international companies. More than 60% of GCCs established in the last 2 years are focused on AI, data, digital engineering, or product development, according to ANSR, which helps companies set up GCCs. More than 80% of GCCs expected to be set up in the next six-to-eight months are projected to be AI-led, ANSR said.But not only are tech giants looking to India for engineering talent, an increasing number of firms are also banking on the country for senior leadership roles. ANSR's Ahuja said the role of \"chief AI officer\" is becoming more common.\"And the fact that there's talent available ... those positions are now being created in India,\" Ahuja said. ",

    "body": "White House trade advisor Peter Navarro speaks to members of the media near the West Wing of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., August 21, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersPresident Donald Trump's trade and manufacturing adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Sunday that the White House may force data center builders to absorb their costs as voters continue to sour on the economy and utility prices soar. \"All of these data center builders, Meta on down, need to pay for all, all of the costs,\" Navarro said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"They need to pay, not only pay for the electricity that they're using on the grid, but they have to pay for the resiliency that they're affecting as well. They need to pay for the water. So there's activity, action here going forward, where we force them to internalize the cost.\" Navarro did not detail what the White House's plan to force data center builders to internalize costs would look like. CNBC has reached out to the White House for clarification.When asked about Navarro's remarks, a Meta spokesperson said the company already pays for all of its energy usage. \"Meta pays the full costs for energy used by our data centers so they aren't passed onto consumers — and we go beyond that by paying for new and upgraded local infrastructure as well as adding new power to the grid,\" the spokesperson said.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinData centers and their drag on utilities are part of the affordability problem. Electricity prices spiked 6.9% year over year in 2025 and show little sign of easing. Navarro sought to pin the blame for soaring costs on former President Joe Biden, who left office over a year ago. \"I just want to assure people that we're on it, we also feel your pain,\" Navarro said. \"We understand the ravages that inflation took on you because of Joe Biden's irresponsibility, but we are addressing that with economic policy that ultimately will make wages rise faster than the inflation rate, and that's the key to affordability.\" But Americans increasingly blame the Trump administration for rising costs. As the November 2026 midterms approach, polls consistently find Trump underwater on the economy. Democrats are pounding Trump and the Republicans on affordability, arguing that everyday goods and services have grown too expensive. Democrats have taken a 5.2 point lead in the generic ballot ahead of the November midterm elections that could loosen Trump's grip on Washington, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics.While Navarro sought to blame the former president's administration for Americans' struggle with affordability, Trump himself has said he's \"very proud\" of the state of the economy. In an interview with \"NBC Nightly News\" that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday, the president was asked, \"At what point are we in the Trump economy?\" \"I'd say we're there now,\" he replied.The Trump administration has recently taken steps to address the strain on data center electricity and rising utility costs. Several states and the White House signed a pact in January urging the nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to make big technology companies pay for new power plants on the system. PJM operates the grid in some of the most data center-heavy areas in the U.S., including northern Virginia and New Jersey. Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey both romped to victories in their states in 2025 after campaigning to lower electricity costs. The pact called for $15 billion in new generation capacity within PJM, to be financed by tech companies, and urged the operator to hold an emergency auction to procure the power. The move comes as the administration simultaneously fights offshore wind projects in the Northeast, some of which are fully permitted or under construction. \"Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM,\" Energy Secretary Chris Wright said after the announcement. \"That's why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.\"POLITICO last week reported on a draft compact that the White House wants tech companies to sign to ensure data centers don't affect consumers' utility bills.Trump said last month on Truth Social that he had struck a deal with Microsoft \"to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills.\" The president added that his administration was negotiating with other tech giants and that there would be \"More to come soon!\" Microsoft pledged last month not to raise utility costs near its data centers, and to replenish water used by the centers.WATCH: 'Alarm bells are ringing' on AI power demand, says EQT's Toby Ricewatch now",

    "body": "The TikTok Inc. sign in front of the building on Tuesday, Jan. 27, 2026 in Culver City, CA.Kayla Bartkowski | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesTikTok's U.S. joint venture seems to have survived a turbulent rollout with minimal change in usership, as early narratives of a mass user exodus prompted by service outages and censorship concerns now appear overstated, according to new figures.Survey data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show that, despite a surge in deletions following the announcement of TikTok's U.S. joint venture on Jan. 23, the average number of TikTok's daily active users in the U.S. remains around 95% of its usership compared to the week of Jan. 19-25.The joint venture — officially the TikTok USDS Joint Venture  — was established in compliance with U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order mandating the divestiture of TikTok in the U.S. from its Chinese parent company ByteDance.While ByteDance retains a 19.9% stake in TikTok's U.S. operations after the agreement, Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX each own a 15% share, with the remaining shares divvied among several other firms.Following the announcement, users were quick to express discontent over TikTok's new ownership.The deal drew scrutiny, with prominent figures like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) raising concerns about cronyism over Oracle co-founder and Chief Technical Officer Larry Ellison's involvement.Following the joint venture's announcement that Ellison's Oracle would \"retrain, test, and update the content recommendation algorithm on U.S. user data\", online speculation mounted that TikTok would begin mining user data or promoting content supportive of Trump's policy positions.Such concerns spiked on Jan. 25, with users claiming that TikTok was suppressing content critical of controversial Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, and censoring buzzwords like 'Epstein' on the platform.Last month, CNBC confirmed that messages containing the word \"Epstein\" triggered an error message, but was unable to independently verify broader claims of political censorship.Asked about the issues, a spokesperson for the TikTok joint venture told CNBC in January that the platform does not prohibit sharing the name 'Epstein' in messages and that it was investigating why some users are experiencing the problem, among others.CNBC reached out to the White House and TikTok for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Engagement metrics unchangedAlthough TikTok attributed last month's disruptions to power outages, the glitches \"no doubt impact[ed] how and what content was being served, even without any intent or motive,\" according to Jim Johnston, partner at law firm Davis+Gilbert LLP.Yet despite various user pledges to boycott the platform over apparent political suppression, engagement metrics among U.S. users suggest there has been little sign of a mass exodus.The average daily time spent by American users on the platform has since returned to around 80 minutes, after dipping to an average of 77 minutes during the week of the reported disruptions, according to Sensor Tower data.Additionally, while deletions spiked after the reported disruptions, they tapered off the following week, suggesting a temporary surge rather than a sustained boycott of the app.\"It is plausible that the short-lived rise in observed uninstalls was due to an attempt to troubleshoot the app,\" Abraham Yousef, senior insights analyst at Sensor Tower, told CNBC, as the number of uninstalls followed by re-installations on the same day surged more than 70% on Jan. 25 from the day before.While Yousef grants that the data suggests a \"slight impact to overall usage\" in the weeks after the Joint Venture was announced, there is no clear indication of a structural shift in user trends, as many sites touted as alternatives to TikTok have also struggled to sustain interest.According to Sensor Tower, the number of new installs for UpScrolled - a social media platform that offers an algorithm free of automated systems that filter out content from some users known as shadow banning - surged by about 770% from the previous week, with more than 955,000 new U.S. downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1.New UpScrolled downloads, however, fell sharply by about 80% the following week, bringing in only around 191,000 new users. In comparison, TikTok registered 870,000 downloads over the week of Jan. 26 to Feb. 1, and around 800,000 the following week.Similarly, new downloads of other alternative platforms such as Skylight Social and Red Note respectively declined by 96% and 33% week-on-week from the week of Jan. 26.Tenuous evidence of mass exodusSensor Tower's user data more fundamentally seems to suggest that beyond anecdotal claims, users have largely been unable to identify tangible changes in TikTok's American operations, or at least, not enough to meaningfully shift user sentiment.\"The idea of a mass exodus from TikTok now looks overblown,\" Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst from Forrester, told CNBC. \"Anecdotally, most users say the app feels largely the same - the algorithm hasn't meaningfully changed, and the experience is still strong,\" While some American users may have perceived changes in the operation of their TikTok algorithms, \"some changes to content suggestions are bound to occur simply due to the changed data set,\" according to Johnston, referring to the Joint Venture's announcement to retrain the algorithm on U.S. data.But while analysts have been unable to find evidence that TikTok's new American owners have engineered the platform in their favor, this is not a foregone conclusion.According to Johnston, there are at least three notable changes to TikTok's new terms of use, including the platform's ability to collect precise location data from enabled devices, its collection of data on interactions with artificial intelligence tools on the app and its explicit integration with ad networks.Although there has been no hard evidence of its occurrence, it remains technically possible to adjust TikTok's algorithm to enhance or diminish the impact of certain types of content on recommendations, Johnston said.Chickering adds that under its new owners, TikTok has more control over what shows up on American feeds, but this control, according to Chickering, is where TikTok's opportunity - and risk - lies. \"If moderation starts to feel politically slanted or misinformation isn't adequately addressed, the platform could face backlash from users and advertisers alike,\" Chickering said, \"We've seen this play out before: Twitter's shift to X is a recent reminder of how quickly trust can erode.\"For now, however, the discontent from TikTok's American users that marred its first few weeks under new ownership seems to have largely subsided.As Chickering notes, \"we've seen time and time again, if the product works, users tend to stick around regardless of who owns it.\"— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesAn annual cigar festival in Cuba's capital city of Havana, which had been due to take place over five days in late February, has been suspended until further notice due to a worsening economic crisis.The postponement comes as the island nation's communist-run government endures its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Habanos S.A., the cigar fair's organizer, said on Saturday that it had suspended the festival \"with the aim of preserving the highest standards of quality, excellence and experience that characterize this international event.\" The organizing committee said it was working on setting a new date for the fair, without providing further details. The festival has previously welcomed more than 1,000 guests from around 80 countries, with attendees participating in auctions and touring tobacco plantations. Premium Cuban cigars are globally renowned and considered of high economic importance, serving as one of the island's main exports and a major source of foreign currency. They are illegal in the U.S., however, due to a decades-old trade embargo. Last year, Habanos. S.A., a state-run entity that holds a monopoly on global sales of Cuban cigars, reported record sales of $827 million in 2024, reflecting a 16% increase compared to the year prior.

Cuba's government, which has condemned U.S. pressure, has recently adopted measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors. Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" earlier in the month. \"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.",

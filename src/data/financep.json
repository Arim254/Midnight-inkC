    "body": "<div><p>Electronic shelf labels, digital screens that display the price of an item, are replacing traditional paper price tags in grocery stores across America.</p><p>The technology can already be found at <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN/\">Whole Foods</a><span><span></span></span></span>, Amazon Fresh and <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/KR/\">Kroger</a><span><span></span></span></span>, along with<strong> </strong>stores in Canada, Europe, Asia and other regions. Electronic shelf labels are expected to become more common:<strong> </strong>The global market for the products was estimated at $1.85 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $7.54 billion by 2033, according to Grand View Research.</p><p>\"It's definitely an industry that is looking at significant double-digit year-over-year growth for the foreseeable future,\" said Cullen Hendrix, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p>Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, has said it plans to roll out<strong> </strong>electronic shelf labels to 2,300 stores by 2026. The company <a href=\"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/06/06/new-tech-better-outcomes-digital-shelf-labels-are-a-win-for-customers-and-associates\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the technology allows employees to update shelf prices using a mobile app, reducing a price change that typically takes an associate two days to a matter of minutes.</p><p>\"The only impediment to how quickly they can change prices at this point is how long it takes the human in the loop to decide to change the prices,\" said Hendrix.</p><p>But some lawmakers fear that electronic shelf labels could enable grocery stores to raise prices during periods of high demand.</p><p>\"Digital price tags may enable Kroger and other grocery chains to transition to 'dynamic pricing,' in which the price of basic household goods could surge based on the time of day, the weather, or other transitory events — allowing stores to calibrate price increases to extract maximum profits,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and then-Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., wrote in an August 2024 <a href=\"https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/warren_casey_letter_to_kroger_re_electronic_shelving_and_price_gouging.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">letter</a> to Kroger's then-chairman and CEO Rodney McMullen.</p><p>\"To be clear, Kroger does not and has never engaged in 'surge pricing,'\" Kroger said in a response letter.

Cuts from May that affected projects in states that Trump won in the 2024 election were not included in the list, and none of the new cuts were in such states.</p><p>The rescinded awards had been issued by the Energy Department's Offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Grid Deployment, Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, Advanced Research Projects

Bob Ferguson said in a statement to CNBC.</p><p>\"It is outrageous that this administration is using a government shutdown to punish blue states like Washington,\" Ferguson said. \"We're working with the Attorney General's Office to fight this illegal action.\"</p><p>Chris Green, president of the Pacific Hydrogen Association, called the cancellation of federal funds for the hub \"a gut punch.\"</p><p>\"We are, of course, very disappointed in that,\" Green told CNBC, noting that the project could have led to tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><p>He said that companies involved in the hub \"were spending lots of their own money,\" with about 80% of the committed funds being provided by private companies, with federal funds providing the remaining 20% or so of the costs.</p><p>\"Can we still do this project now that we've lost 20% of our planned revenue?\" Green asked. \"It remains to be seen if some of these projects can persevere.\"</p><p>The Colorado Energy Office said that more than 30 grants totalling more than $500 million \"are being illegally terminated in Colorado alone.</p><p>Two of those grants each provide $2.5 million to support reduced energy use and create cost savings through building energy codes and building performance standards through decarbonization, the office said.</p><p>\"Other terminated grants in Colorado range from oil and gas methane reduction projects and investments in grid resilience to support for utility programs in low-income communities,\" the office said.</p><p>\"This clearly politically motivated targeting of grants by the Administration will balloon energy costs, threaten grid reliability, increase pollution, and create instability in our business community,\" the office said.</p><p>In New Mexico, 10 projects had more than $135 million of Energy Department funding cancelled. </p><p>Four of them were under the auspices of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, including one with $42.7 million from the Energy Department to \"develop a storage hub at a commercial scale within San Juan basin to verify these sites can securely store 50 million tons of CO2,\" according to the office of Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M.</p><p>Heinrich, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said Thursday, \"Minutes before the news of these cancelled projects broke, I had just left lunch with [Energy] Secretary [Chris] Wright and he had neither the courtesy nor the care to mention that this was coming, and that it included ten projects in my state — projects that affect real jobs and real families.\"</p><p>\"That tells you everything you need to know about how this Administration operates: in the dark and with no respect for the people hurt by their decisions,\" Heinrich said in a statement.</p><p>\"The American people deserve a government that works for them, not one that plays politics with their lives,\" he said. This Administration is choosing to punish ordinary families just to settle scores — and that is as dangerous as it is un-American.\"</p><p>The Energy Department, in a statement, said that the cancellations followed \" a thorough, individualized financial review,\" which \"determined that these projects did not adequately advance the nation's energy needs, were not economically viable, and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.\"</p><p>Energy Secretary Wright said that many of the awards were \"rushed through in the final months of the Biden administration with inadequate documentation by any reasonable business standard.\"</p><p>\"President Trump promised to protect taxpayer dollars and expand America's supply of affordable, reliable, and secure energy,\" Write said, adding that the cancellations \"deliver on that commitment.\"</p><p>The department said that of the 321 financial awards terminated, \"26% were awarded between Election Day and Inauguration Day,\" with those awards alone valued at more than $3.1 billion.</p><p>But Wells, the NRDC advocate, said that despite the Energy Department's claims, \"there's been a confusing lack of transparency in this process of cancelling\" funding.</p><p>Wells contrasted that to the Biden administration's vetting of the projects before they were approved. He noted that the department itself had not publicly released a list of the cancelled projects.</p><p>The Energy Department did not respond to CNBC's request for that list.</p><p>Wells pointed out that several Democratic members of Congress, including New Mexico's Heinrich, in early September had raised concerns about the influence of political appointees in the Energy Department to cancel funding of projects in May.</p><p>\"This is highly unusual and counter to longstanding DOE precedent,\" Heinrich and two other Democrats, Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, and New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr., wrote in a letter to Wright. \"It also stands in stark contrast to the rigorous, merit-based process that the Department followed in selecting each of the awards.\"</p><p>\"These programs are not optional,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"These programs were enshrined into law by bipartisan majorities and they represent the will of Congress. You have no legal authority to sabotage them.\"</p><p>Ken Lovett, the senior communications advisor on energy and environment for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, said that the funding cuts \"come as no surprise given the Trump administration's full-on assault on clean energy.\"</p><p>\"Whether it's blocking offshore wind, cutting federal incentives for electric vehicles and solar energy, or rolling back clean air and clean water standards, the Trump administration's attempt to rollback the progress we have made puts New Yorkers' well-being and safety at risk,\" Lovett said in a statement.</p><p>\"We will not go back.\"</p><p><em><strong>— CNBC's </strong></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/emily-wilkins/\"><em><strong>Emily Wilkins</strong></em></a><em><strong>, Ashlee Trujillo and </strong></em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/mary-catherine-wellons/\"><em><strong>MC Wellons</strong></em></a><em><strong> contributed to this story.</strong></em></p></div></div>",

That strategy was on full display after China's DeepSeek released a powerful model at the end of last year that was cheaper and faster to build than anything out of Silicon Valley. </p><p>OpenAI responded within weeks, debuting two new <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes\" target=\"_blank\">models</a> in what was widely viewed as a defensive move to preserve its lead.</p><p>But OpenAI has a key advantage: Its growing institutional muscle. </p><p>Once a scrappy research lab in San Francisco's Mission District, the company has since become more structured, enabling it to spin up cross-functional teams more quickly and accelerate the development and deployment cycles for products like Sora.</p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/launching-sora-responsibly/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI said</a> Sora includes multiple layers of safeguards meant to prevent unsafe content from being generated, using prompt filtering and output moderation across video frames and audio transcripts. It bans explicit content, terrorist propaganda, and material promoting self-harm.

It rose to a new intraday high early Thursday.</p><p>Prior to that, the index — which is focused on large-cap U.S. equities — had risen almost 90% since the equity bull market began three years ago, thanks in large part to new AI developments, <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Stanley Wealth Management</a> noted in Sept. 29 research.</p><p>Nevertheless, experts say it may be time to reconsider the set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500-focused strategy, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/09/warren-buffetts-sp-500-bet-paid-off-some-experts-say-it-may-be-time-to-diversify.html\">famously touted</a> by legendary investor Warren Buffett.</p><p>\"The S&P 500 is broken,\" said Michael DeMassa, who is a certified financial planner and chartered financial analyst, and the founder of Forza Wealth Management in Sarasota, Florida.</p><p>Many investors assume investing in the S&P 500 index — through ETF ticker symbols <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/SPY/\">SPY</a><span><span></span></span></span>, <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/VOO/\">VOO</a><span><span></span></span></span> or <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/IVV/\">IVV</a><span><span></span></span></span> — is synonymous with diversification, DeMassa said.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108205169-17591634351759163432-41873519157-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759163434&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"Year-end rally or a reversal ahead?\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Yet that sense of safety is an illusion, he said, since the market capitalization-weighted index means companies with bigger allocations may drag down the fund if their performance suffers. Or the index's heavy concentration in the technology sector may prompt volatility to ripple through the entire index, DeMassa said.</p><p>If you can invest in the S&P 500 index for a long time, you will probably do well, said Deva Panambur, a CFP and CFA, and founder of Sarsi LLC in West New York, New Jersey.</p><p>But occasionally the index suffers long periods of underperformance, he said. For example, between 2000 and 2008, the S&P 500 was down by more than 30%.</p><p>Wall Street <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/22/goldman-sachs-raises-sp-500-target-for-year-end.html\">forecasts</a> generally see the index continuing to go up for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Still, experts say it's best to choose a broader investment mix in case there is a pullback.</p></div><h2><a></a>How to best diversify your investments now</h2><div><p>For investors who are seeking a simple approach, it may make sense to opt for a total market index fund instead of an S&P 500 index fund, according to Brendan McCann, associate manager research analyst at Morningstar.</p><p>Unlike S&P 500 index funds, total market funds also provide exposure to small- and mid-cap stocks in addition to large-cap companies.</p><p>Alternatively, investors may opt to broaden the exposure an S&P 500 index fund already provides in their portfolio. One example may be a fund that tracks a total market index that excludes S&P 500 index stocks, or the Vanguard Extended Market ETF, according to McCann.</p></div><div><p>The trick with that strategy is to buy the funds in the right proportion, McCann said.</p><p>For investors who don't want to worry about changing their asset allocations over time, buying a total market index fund may be a better approach, according to McCann. Switching to a total market index fund strategy may be particularly attractive for investors who don't have to worry about the tax implications of changing funds, such as 401(k) investors, he said.</p><p>Other experts have recommended opting for equal-weighted S&P 500 index funds, which hold an equal proportion of each stock. However, the downside with those strategies is that there may be more transaction costs when rebalancing, McCann said.</p><p>When the S&P 500's returns were down between 2002 and 2009, areas like small cap, value, international and even bonds performed better than stocks, Panambur said.</p><p>Today, the portfolios he creates for clients have allocations to those areas.</p><p>\"When I look at the overall allocation, my goal is to make sure it's more balanced than the S&P 500,\" Panambur said.</p></div><div><p>The set-it-and-forget-it S&P 500 strategy was intended to provide broad market exposure. \"That's no longer the case,\" DeMassa said.</p><p>As investors seek to diversify, it is important to pay attention to the holdings of each of the funds they own, he said.</p><p>If a portfolio has funds tracking both the S&P 500 and Vanguard Growth indexes, for example, the exposure to large-cap technology names will be increased rather than limited, he said.</p></div></div>",

The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.</p><p>In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1973101319222165785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973101319222165785%7Ctwgr%5E6bb1e8bac213d47b901b22d6ba65042b371c9caf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstpost.com%2Fexplainers%2Felon-musk-netflix-boycott-charlie-kirk-controversy-13938760.html\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show's creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said \"mocked\" the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Steele responded to Musk's callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, \"It's probably going to be a very odd day.\" Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called \"Dead End\" a \"brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.\"</p><p>Netflix did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206766-17593554481759355445-41906018363-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759355447&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"‘Fast Money’ traders talk Netflix shares dropping after Elon Musk tells people to cancel\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for.</p><p>Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year.</p><p>Shares are down 4% so far this week.</p><p>\"Is that going to move the needle necessarily? ...

I don't think that that's going to be the reason to sell Netflix here,\" Seymour said Wednesday.</p><p>The calls for a boycott mirror those against <span><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BUD/\">Anheuser-Busch InBev</a><span><span></span></span></span> in 2023 after it <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/14/bud-light-beer-sales-trail-modelo-in-may-following-anti-lgbtq-backlash.html\">released</a> an ad campaign with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.

It also comes at a time in which the conglomerate is sitting on $344 billion in cash, near a record for the company.</p><p>Shares of Occidental fell more than 7% on Thursday following the announcement.</p><p>Berkshire is already a major investor in Occidental, holding a 28.2% stake as of the end of June. Buffett — who is 95 and stepping down as CEO at the end of the year — has said he wouldn't take complete control of the Houston-based oil company.</p><p>OxyChem manufactures water treatment, health care and other commercial chemicals.

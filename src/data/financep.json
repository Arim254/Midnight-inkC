    "body": "watch nowFedEx on Thursday outlined projected revenue growth over the next three fiscal years that it says will be powered by digital innovation and new business lines in Europe. The company said adjusted earnings for its third quarter are expected to exceed Wall Street estimates due to an \"exceptional\" holiday season and that by fiscal year 2029, the company will see higher annual revenue.FedEx announced its latest outlook during the company's investor day held in Memphis, Tennessee. As of Wednesday, Wall Street was forecasting third-quarter earnings per share of $3.99, according to consensus estimates compiled by LSEG.Its outlook for fiscal 2026 projects roughly $93.5 million in revenue, including its freight business, which is on track to be spun off into a separate publicly traded company in June. The shipping company said it's targeting roughly $98 billion in consolidated revenue for fiscal 2029, excluding that freight business. That number represents a 4% compound annual growth rate, the company said. \"If you put it all together, that drives $6 billion in free cash flow, so we're very excited to be at this stage here at FedEx,\" CEO Raj Subramaniam told CNBC on Thursday.The company also said it expects 2029 operating income of $8 billion and operating margin of 8%, up roughly 2 percentage points from projected fiscal year 2026 levels. FedEx is investing in digital intelligence, with Subramaniam saying Thursday that the company's innovations in automation is setting it apart from competitors and contributing to its revenue growth. Internationally, the company is targeting an 8% operating margin with key drivers including improvement in Europe. On Monday, the company announced it reached an agreement to buy European company InPost for 15.60 euros per share (about $18.51 per share). \"At FedEx, we have evolved our vision to make supply chains smarter for everyone, and this is the right time to have that vision,\" Subramaniam told CNBC. \"We are undergoing a tremendous transformation at FedEx.\"Shares of FedEx were largely unchanged on Thursday.‎‏",

    "body": "Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., at left, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.ReutersA federal judge on Thursday barred Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from censuring Sen. Mark Kelly over the Arizona Democrat's participation in a video reminding American military service members of their right to refuse illegal orders.Judge Rich Leon's order in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., also blocks Hegseth, for now, from reducing Kelly's U.S. Navy rank and retirement pay as punishment for his role in the video.Kelly retired from the Navy as a captain.Leon said Hegseth had \"trampled\" on Kelly's First Amendment free speech protections and that the senator is likely to succeed in his lawsuit challenging the Pentagon's effort to punish him. The preliminary injunction that the judge issued preventing that punishment could become permanent if Hegseth loses that case, as Leon strongly suggested will happen.The order came two days after the U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C. tried and failed to get a federal grand jury to indict Kelly and Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., who is a former CIA analyst, on criminal charges of seditious conspiracy related to their participation in the video along with four other members of Congress. The video was released in November.President Donald Trump had condemned the Democrats who appeared on the video, accusing them of \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!\"\"Each one of these traitors to our Country should be ARRESTED AND PUT ON TRIAL,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social then.Leon, in a scathing opinion explaining his order Thursday, noted that Hegseth, in seeking to punish Kelly for his public statements as a member of Congress, relied \"on the well-established doctrine that military service members enjoy less vigorous First Amendment protections given the fundamental obligation for obedience and discipline in the armed forces.\"\"Unfortunately for Secretary Hegseth, no court has ever extended those principles to retired servicemembers, much less a retired servicemember serving in Congress and exercising oversight responsibility over the military,\" Leon wrote.\"This Court will not be the first to do so!\"Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep.

    "body": "Customers shop at Walmart on January 22, 2026 in Little Rock, Arkansas.Will Newton | Getty ImagesInvestors got some good news this week on the state of the labor market and more may be on the way Friday on inflation.The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, is expected to show a 2.5% gain from a year ago, according to the Dow Jones consensus forecast for the January release. If that ends up being accurate, it would bring the widely cited inflation gauge back to its May 2025 level — a month after President Donald Trump enacted his \"liberation day\" tariffs that many economists thought would send prices spiraling higher.The headline, or all-items, CPI was at 2.7% in December and has been on a downward trajectory since peaking just above 3% in September 2025. Excluding food and energy, core CPI stood at 2.6% in December. Both gauges are expected to show 0.3% monthly increases in January.It's also worth noting that CPI has come in below the Wall Street consensus for the past three months. So, a light reading for January could give Federal Reserve policymakers more confidence that they can lower their benchmark borrowing rate without risking another inflation burst.Getting inflation back to 2.5% would be consistent with prices prior to the Covid pandemic and around the average of 2017-19, according to Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors.\"This is 'normal' inflation conditions even with tariff impacts still lingering in these results,\" Lee said in a note. With the fed funds rate, currently targeted between 3.5%-3.75%, well above where it was pre-Covid, \"the Fed has a lot of room to cut,\" he added.As usual, Wall Street economists will pore through the release for details. watch nowGoldman Sachs expects contribution of 0.07 percentage point to core inflation from tariffs, with upward pressure possible on clothing, recreation, household furnishings, education and personal care. However, Goldman sees headline CPI coming in a bit light at 2.4%, which could add to hopes that inflation is moderating.Markets recoiled a bit after Wednesday's strong jobs report, which showed nonfarm payroll gains of 130,000 for January and the unemployment rate dropping to 4.3%, amid speculation that a solid labor market would discourage the Fed from cutting. However, a consensus or below reading on inflation could alleviate those concerns.\"A dovish Fed is supportive of stocks, and this is why in our base case of a '3 phase market,' we see stocks exiting the year strongly,\" Lee said.The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the report Friday at 8 a.m. ET.",

    "body": "watch nowLast Spring, Chantel Williams' position in the federal government was in limbo. Williams, once a General Services Administration employee on its hiring and recruitment team, found herself in a state of confusion and anxiety. The agency she worked for was in a holding pattern as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency began its work to aggressively shrink the size and scope of government agencies at President Donald Trump's direction.The DOGE cuts, a pillar of Trump's second term, were swift and wide reaching across the federal workforce. Some of the most impacted agencies included the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Education. \"As a federal employee, the oath is to the work and to the role, and not the administration,\" Williams said. \"It started off as feeling very startling that the transition wasn't occurring as seamlessly as it had in prior years, because I had been working at GSA through a transition before.\" Williams said she felt, for the first time, real turmoil about working for the federal government. \"It was hard to wake up every day wanting to continue to serve but feel as though your leadership may have a different priority or maybe an opposition of you continuing to move forward in that mission,\" said Williams.In the end, she opted to take deferred resignation, receiving pay to leave her government post. She joined thousands of others in what was the largest reduction of the federal workforce in history, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. At the end of 2025, OPM reported that approximately 352,000 employees exited roles last year, with more than 123,000 taking the deferred resignation offer. In a release late last year, OPM said it was \"in line with President Trump's goal of a smaller, more efficient government.\"Caitlin Lewis, founder and director of Work for America, started her career in local government in New York City. Lewis launched the nonprofit in November of 2024 and has helped placed former federal workers in new roles around the country in the wake of federal workforce reductions over the last year.Megan Leigh Barnard | Work for AmericaAs mass layoffs and resignations hit federal workers like Williams, Caitlin Lewis stepped in to help.Her nonprofit, Work for America, launched in November of 2024 to help local governments recruit talent to fill gaps in staffing. Through its Civic Match platform, the goal is to help former federal workers find new roles at the state and local level. The Work for America team has gone from two people to 15 in the last year, and the vast majority have come from prior careers in state, local and federal government. Four employees came directly from federal government roles.\"We never imagined the volume of need that was going to occur,\" Lewis said. \"What is so unique about this job seeker population is how unexpected the layoffs were for so many of them. Government has long been a place of stability and meaning making, and so much of what we understand the government job to be was really upended in that moment.\"Lewis, the daughter of a forest firefighter and a youth prison counselor growing up in California, said she became civically engaged at a young age. That engagement led her to local government in New York City in the de Blasio administration, first in the mayor's office and then in housing and economic development. Work for America was informed by that experience. \"In a place like New York, it really showed me how when you have the right people in the right roles in government, that the public sector really can move mountains, and when you don't, the basics start to fall apart,\" she said. \"And unfortunately we've seen that occurring in communities across the country where there hasn't been the ability to get the right talent to lean into critical roles.\"Williams quickly landed a job at Work for America after taking deferred resignation. She is now a product and data manager with the non-profit.In the last year, Work for America has placed nearly 200 job seekers, 150 of which are former federal workers, in roles across the country. Over 12,800 jobseekers have signed up for Civic Match since President Trump's election, representing more than 30 federal agencies. \"For many, it's been a year of chaos and confusion. But we saw for our customers– cities and state governments across the country– that there was a true opportunity to capture the incredible talent that was going to be exiting Washington,\" Lewis said.Nate Haight turned to Civic Match as sweeping cuts took place at USAID, where he spent a decade of his career. Haight started out as an intern, then contractor, and by last year had been working as an education advisor and contract and grants specialist in its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau. Last February, he was told his job was under review and would most likely be cut.\"I particularly loved my work in the education sector. It was really meaningful being able to go out and see the impact that the programs were having around the world,\" Haight said. \"I was invested in the work and I saw the difference that it was making.\"He opted to take the deferred resignation offer from the government and found a new role through Work for America's platform, knowing competition would be steep locally given how many other former federal workers were looking for jobs. Today, he's in Indiana with his wife and four children, working as a grants administrator for the city of Indianapolis and Marion County.\"I think the satisfaction and fulfillment that I've been able to find already working in local government, I just want to encourage others to to give it a shot as well.. and to encourage everyone to keep their their head up and know that all of the skills and experiences that they've they've gained, they're going to be able to make a tremendous impact wherever they end up landing,\" Haight said of his fellow former federal workers.In the months to come, Civic Match is rolling out new features including AI-powered match scores for candidates, improved location targeting for jobs, city-specific pages and more. Hope Rahill, a former political appointee in the Biden Administration who left her role as the Trump Administration moved in, is now director of people and culture at Work for America. Rahill said while the group has had success in placing candidates, many former workers are still looking for work and coming up on a year of \"unemployment or underemployment.\"\"There are still so many people looking for work,\" Rahill said.",

    "body": "Sturti | E+ | Getty ImagesEven Americans who are covered by health insurance can emerge from medical emergencies with long-lasting financial scars.In a study published this month in the journal Health Affairs, researchers found that 18 months after being hospitalized for a traumatic injury — such as a car accident or fall — the share of patients with medical debt in collections rose 5.2 percentage points, or a 24% relative increase, compared with before that medical emergency. Over that same period post-injury, the average balance in collections rose by $290, and 1 in 10 indebted patients owed more than $4,480. Bankruptcy filings also increased by 3.2 per 1,000 patients — a 6% relative rise — about 15 months after injury, the researchers found.\"This work grew out of my clinical experience as a trauma surgeon and seeing acutely injured patients shouting at us to stop care because they're worried about the bill,\" said co-author Dr. John Scott, an associate professor of surgery at the University of Washington. The researchers studied nearly 13,000 trauma patients' credit reports from one year before to 18 months after they were hospitalized for an injury. Credit report data spanned 2018-2021. Nearly all the patients in the cohort — or 98% — had health insurance coverage.\"Insurance reduces the risk of financial catastrophe, but the way private plans are currently designed still leaves many people heavily exposed when something serious happens,\" Scott said.

According to a recent poll by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy research group, two-thirds of Americans surveyed, or 66%, are worried about paying for health care — more than other household necessities such as utilities, food and groceries, housing and rent. Legislators let the enhanced subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplace expire at the end of 2025, which is expected to create a surge of uninsured Americans and others with higher deductibles before their health coverage kicks in. \"If people are pushed into thinner coverage or out of coverage entirely, those numbers will only get worse,\" Scott said of the financial impact of sustaining an injury.Patients can incur debt before insurance kicks inWhile the ACA expanded health insurance coverage to millions of Americans, many private plans come with high deductibles that require people pay thousands of dollars before their insurance takes effect, Scott said. In 2026, the average marketplace deductible is $5,304 for a silver plan and $7,186 for a bronze plan, KFF found. \"An unexpected injury can mean thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs before insurance pays a dime,\" Scott said. Caitlin Donovan, senior director at the National Patient Advocate Foundation, said it was disturbing to see, in the study, \"the utter failure of private insurance to protect people from debt and bankruptcy.\" \"This study highlighted the need to build more protections into private insurance, either by limiting deductibles or even building in income-based limitations on out-of-pocket spending,\" she said.Trauma patients on Medicare and Medicaid saw different outcomes, with minimal changes in medical debt and bankruptcy later on, the researchers found. That was likely because Medicaid has minimal out-of-pocket costs, while expenses on Medicare are often capped, Scott said. \"If insurance is supposed to protect you from financial ruin after a health shock, Medicaid did its job,\" Scott said. \"Private insurance, for many people, did not.\"",

    "body": "watch nowSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., on Thursday rejected a proposal aimed at ending the Department of Justice's controversial criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and clearing a path for his successor, Kevin Warsh, to be confirmed.The proposed off-ramp, which has been floated by at least one Republican lawmaker this week, would see the Powell investigation handed off from the DOJ to the Senate Banking Committee. The idea is an attempt to thread a political needle: It would drop the threat of criminal prosecution against Powell – which spurred Tillis, a Banking Committee member, to declare a blockade on Warsh – while still satisfying President Donald Trump, who supports the DOJ probe.But Tillis poured cold water on that proposal Thursday morning.\"I'm not going to have an investigation out there,\" Tillis told reporters on Capitol Hill. \"We have to have an independent Fed.

    "body": "watch nowThe Trump administration on Thursday revoked a landmark scientific finding that serves as the legal foundation for federal regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions, in a devastating blow to efforts to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding, established under President Barack Obama in 2009, classified carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and welfare. It underpins Clean Air Act emissions standards and rules for cars and light trucks, power plants, and oil and gas industry facilities.\"Under the process just completed by the EPA, we are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding,\" President Donald Trump said at the White House with EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.Zeldin said all greenhouse gas emissions standards on light, medium and heavy duty vehicles that followed the endangerment finding have been eliminated. \"No longer will automakers be pressured to shift their fleets towards electric vehicles,\" he said.The endangerment finding emerged from a Supreme Court decision in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act and the EPA must determine whether they pose a threat to public health. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin speaks accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., February 12, 2026. Jonathan Ernst | ReutersZeldin's decision to revoke the finding is the most significant action taken yet in the Trump administration's campaign to dismantle U.S. regulations that address climate change. He described the repeal as the largest de-regulatory action in American history. Obama said in a social media post that the Trump administration's action makes the U.S. \"less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change — all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.\"The Sierra Club, the largest environmental group in the U.S., said Trump has formalized \"climate denialism as official government policy.\" It warned that eliminating greenhouse gas standards not only imperils the public, but will expose industries to a flood of litigation. The Supreme Court ruled in a unanimous decision in 2011 that companies cannot be sued under federal common law over greenhouse emissions because regulation of these emissions had been delegated to the EPA. Trump has sought to unleash fossil fuel production in the U.S. and kill Biden administration efforts to transition to renewable energy and electric vehicles. He withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement and has repealed key tax subsidies for solar, wind and EVs. ",

    "body": "A logo sits illuminated outside the Cisco booth at ISE 2024 on January 30, 2024 in Barcelona, Spain.Cesc Maymo | Getty ImagesCisco Systems shares plunged as much as 12% Thursday as rising memory prices put pressure on the networking company's margins. It's the stock's worst day since 2022.Strong demand for artificial intelligence chips from Nvidia has caused a global shortage of memory, which has caused costs to skyrocket for the component. Large orders for data center memory have limited production capacity for other devices, including smartphones.This has created uncertainty for a number of tech companies, including consumer electronics makers like Apple and Dell as well as chipmakers like Qualcomm, which cited the shortage when it issued weak guidance on Feb. 4. Now, Cisco is feeling the pinch. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins addressed memory price increases across the market on the company's earnings call on Wednesday. Robbins said Cisco will raise prices, revise contracts and negotiate terms to account for the evolving component prices. \"In terms of memory, we're going to control what we can control,\" Cisco finance chief Mark Patterson said on the call.The company reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, but shares dropped about 7% as Cisco issued a mediocre forecast.Product gross margin for the quarter was 66.4%, down 130 bps from the year prior, which Patterson said was \"primarily driven by negative impacts from mix and higher memory costs.\"Read more CNBC tech news'Impossible': Taiwan pushes back against Washington's 40% chip supply relocation goalAlphabet calls out new AI-related risks, as it taps debt market to fund build-outTesla exec Raj Jegannathan leaves automaker after 13 yearsShort seller CapitalWatch apologizes, retracts report on AppLovin shareholder",

    "body": "Cranes unload shipping containers from a ship at the Port of Long Beach Wednesday, Jan. 14, 2026. Allen J. Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA record-breaking number of companies shipping products into the United States are coming up short on a federal government requirement to financially guarantee they can cover the import trade duties triggered by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. And this is leading to a record amount of money paid to the U.S. to cover the shortfalls.U.S. Customs data shared with CNBC shows that what are called customs bond \"insufficiencies\" reached a total of 27,479 in fiscal 2025, with the combined value soaring to almost $3.6 billion. It is the highest number of bond insufficiencies and the highest total value across insufficiencies ever recorded. In fact, it doubles the 2019 level when tariffs enacted by President Trump under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also fueled bond shortfalls. \"Bonds are the primary tool used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to safeguard the revenue of the United States and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations,\" said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.Under U.S. Customs' guidelines, the agency continuously reviews bond adequacy, and a bond is flagged as being insufficient when an importer's duty/tax liability exceeds 100% of their current bond capacity. The record shortfall comes at a time of record tariff revenue for the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.\"In totality, it makes sense that insufficiencies are more than double,\" said Jennifer Diaz, attorney at Diaz Trade Law. \"Many companies take it for granted that a $50,000 bond should be able to cover you for a one-year period,\" she said. \"But it might not. They are not utilizing set calculations, and don't have anyone in their corner telling them that their bond obligation is higher.\"International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million.Importers buy customs bonds, also known as surety bonds, through specialized insurance companies known as surety companies. The bonds are issued approximately 30 days before imports arrive in the U.S. to ensure that Customs collects the requisite tariffs in the event an importer does not pay its obligation. The bonds are held for 314 days by Customs in accounts that bear no interest. During this time, duties that were paid can be reviewed and receive final government sign-off.U.S. importers pay a premium to insure their bonds. The premium is typically 1% of the bond limit, with the price of the bonds covering 10% of the duties and taxes paid over a rolling 12-month period. If tariffs and taxes go up, the customs bond requirement goes up as well.Surety companies have told CNBC they have seen bond increases upwards of 200%. \"In one unusual case, a large auto manufacturing client saw its custom bond amount increase by 550%,\" Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC.If the bond is insufficient, the importer can't get the freight, and it is held by Customs until the bond meets requirements. To address the shortfall, importers need to have another bond issued and that can take at least 10 days.In addition to the bonds, companies rely on related collateral to guarantee trade duty coverage. \"If companies do not increase their collateral, the goods will be stopped at the port,\" Moy said. The collateral is held by the insurance company that issues the bond for the 314-day period dictated by U.S. Customs. Companies have told CNBC that the tariff-triggered bond insufficiencies have created additional strain on their relationships with customs brokers.The Supreme Court could soon rule on President Trump's IEEPA tariffs, deciding if they are legal. Feb. 20 is the next date for a potential decision and U.S. importers may be in line for not only trade tax refunds but also the money laid out for customs bonds and related collateral. If tariffs are refunded, the bond amounts associated with those imports can be used to reduce to levels sufficient to cover the duties, taxes, and fees. Companies will need to petition the insurer that issued the bond for a reduction of the bond and collateral. Trade experts tell CNBC importers should be ready if this happens.Surety companies tell CNBC importers should expect some lag time in receiving these funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowHigh home prices, faltering supply and weaker consumer confidence in the economy all continue to weigh on the U.S. housing market. The chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, Lawrence Yun, is calling it \"a new housing crisis.\"Sales of previously owned homes in January dropped a much wider-than-expected 8.4% from December to a seasonally adjusted, annualized rate of 3.91 million, according to the NAR. Sales were 4.4% lower than January 2025. That is the slowest pace since December 2023 and the biggest monthly drop since February 2022.This count is based on closings, so contracts that were likely signed in November and December, when the average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage didn't move much before dropping slightly in January. That rate is now 6.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily. Regionally, sales fell across the nation month to month but were down the most in the South and West. \"Affordability conditions are improving, with NAR's Housing Affordability Index showing that housing is the most affordable it's been since March 2022,\" Yun said in a release. \"This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago. However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low.\"But he also noted on a call with reporters that potential buyers are \"still struggling,\" and \"renters are not participating in housing wealth.\" He characterized the current market as a crisis because, \"the movement is not happening. Americans are stuck.\"Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Inventory came down in January from December but was still up 3.4% year over year. There were 1.22 million homes for sale at the end of January, which at the current sales pace is a 3.7-month supply. A six-month supply is considered a balanced market between buyer and seller.Tighter supply kept home prices in positive territory. The median price for a home sold in January was $396,800, up 0.9% year over year and the highest January price on record. \"Homeowners are in a financially comfortable position as a result. Since January 2020, a typical homeowner would have accumulated $130,500 in housing wealth,\" Yun added.Homes are taking longer to sell, at 46 days in January versus 41 in January 2025. About 31% of sales were to first-time buyers, up from 28% a year ago. Sales continue to be strongest on the higher end of the market; in fact, the only price segment in the positive from a year ago was the $1 million-plus range. Sales dropped the most for homes priced below $250,000.",

    "body": "watch nowFamilies won't see relief from rising electricity prices anytime soon, as demand from artificial intelligence data centers soars while power supply grows slowly, according to Goldman Sachs.Electricity prices jumped 6.9% in 2025 year over year, more than double the headline inflation rate of 2.9%, Goldman analysts told clients in a research note published Wednesday. Prices will continue to rise through the end of the decade, as data centers make up 40% of electricity demand growth, the analysts said. This will lower disposable income, drag down consumer spending and slightly slow economic growth in the coming years, they said. Households will see electricity prices rise an additional 6% through 2027, the analysts said. Price inflation will then slow to 3% in 2028 on lower natural gas prices, they said. Consumer spending growth will fall 0.2% through 2027 and economic growth will slow 0.1% as a result, according to Goldman.The trajectory of electricity prices, however, will vary widely across the U.S. based on different regional market structures and what regulatory choices are made, the bank said. \"The income and spending drags will likely be larger for lower-income households because electricity accounts for a greater share of their spending,\" Goldman analyst Manuel Abecasis said. Households in regions with more data centers will also take a bigger hit, he said. Higher electricity prices will increase core inflation by 0.1% through 2027 and by 0.05% in 2028 as businesses pass on higher costs to consumers, the Goldman analysts said. watch nowThe rapid growth of data centers is colliding with a constrained electricity supply as regulatory barriers as well as labor and material shortages make it difficult to build new power plants, the analysts said. The tight supply-demand balance will push up wholesale electricity prices, particularly in California, the Midwest and mid-Atlantic, they said. Utilities will spend more on infrastructure to meet the demand and that will also be passed on to consumers, they said. The role that the AI industry is playing in electricity price inflation has turned into a major political flashpoint ahead of the midterm elections this November. Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger won elections for governor of New Jersey and Virginia, respectively, in 2025 in part on promising to bring utility bills under control. President Donald Trump has embraced the AI industry as an engine of economic growth, but he  increasingly sees electricity prices as a threat to the Republican Party's political fortunes. Trump secured a promise from Microsoft in January that it will not allow its data centers to drive up prices.The White House also signed a pact with several states last month that calls for tech companies to pay for new power plants in the nation's largest electric grid, PJM Interconnection. Data centers are playing a particularly disruptive role in the PJM market, which covers 13 states, primarily across the mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The cost to secure power supplies in PJM has exploded in recent years, with $23 billion attributable to data centers, according to watchdog Monitoring Analytics. These costs get passed down to consumers. This amounts to a \"massive wealth transfer,\" the watchdog told PJM in a November letter.",

    "body": "watch nowRestaurant Brands International on Thursday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped expectations, fueled by strong international growth.However, executives said that Burger King's progress on remodeling U.S. restaurants slowed last year in response to higher costs, and the chain will no longer meet its 2028 deadline to modernize 85% of its domestic locations. The news disappointed investors, and shares of the company fell 6% in afternoon trading.Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 96 cents adjusted vs. 95 cents expectedRevenue: $2.47 billion vs. $2.41 billion expectedRestaurant Brands reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $113 million, or 34 cents per share, down from $259 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding transaction costs, restructuring expenses and other items, the company reported adjusted earnings of 96 cents per share.Net sales rose 7.4% to $2.47 billion. Stripping out currency fluctuations and sales from restaurants it plans to refranchise, Restaurant Brands' organic revenue ticked up 6.5%.The company's same-store sales increased 3.1%, fueled by strong international growth. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, Restaurant Brands' same-store sales climbed 6.1%. International Burger King restaurants, which represents the bulk of the segment, saw same-store sales growth of 5.8%. Analysts were projecting international same-store sales growth of just 3.7%, based on StreetAccount estimates.And Restaurant Brands plans to keep growing its business abroad. In November, the company announced its plan to form a joint venture for Burger King China to accelerate expansion. Under the terms of the deal, which closed in late January, CPE, a Chinese alternative asset manager, owns roughly 83% of Burger King China. Restaurant Brands has retained a minority stake of about 17%, along with a seat on the board of directors.Restaurant resultsCanadian coffee chain Tim Hortons reported same-store sales growth of 2.9%, although Wall Street was projecting an increase of 3.8%, according to StreetAccount. Tim Hortons accounted for 46% of Restaurant Brands' overall revenue during the quarter.Burger King reported overall same-store sales growth of 2.7%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 2.4%. The burger chain has leaned into promotions, like the SpongeBob SquarePants menu that launched in December, to fuel traffic growth from families. \"We didn't need to rely on deep discounting to drive top-line results,\" Restaurant Brands Executive Chairman Patrick Doyle said on the company's conference call.The chain offers $5 duo and $7 trio combo meals to reach budget-conscious diners, but it has kept its value offerings consistent, helping Burger King save on marketing dollars, Restaurant Brands CEO Josh Kobza told CNBC.  Burger King has also dealt with higher costs, particularly from rising beef prices. Executives said beef costs climbed 20% in 2025, putting pressure on profits for the chain and its franchisees.Popeyes was the laggard of Restaurant Brands' portfolio. Its same-store sales fell 4.8%, a steeper decline than the 2.4% decrease forecast by Wall Street. But the company has plans to revive the embattled fried chicken chain. To bring back customers, Popeyes needs to focus on its operations and core menu items, like its famous chicken sandwich, Kobza said.In November, Restaurant Brands tapped Burger King veteran Peter Perdue to lead the chain's U.S. and Canadian business; last month, the company also named Popeyes veteran Matt Rubin as the chain's latest chief marketing officer.\"We've been very upfront that sales are not where they should be, and you saw us make leadership changes in 2025 and earlier this year,\" Doyle said. \"As a result, I'm confident that the steps we're taking, particularly the renewed focus on operations, consistency and brand standards, will translate into better performance over time.\"Restaurant Brands plans to share more of its ideas to grow the business at its investor day in Miami on Feb. 26.",

    "body": "A Waymo autonomous vehicle outside the Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, US, on Tuesday, Feb. 3, 2026. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWaymo on Thursday said it has begun using its sixth-generation driverless system to provide robotaxi rides to employees on Ojai vehicles, which use a base model made by Chinese automaker Geely.By upgrading their driverless tech, and adding more vehicles to its fleet, Waymo aims to extend its U.S. lead and lock in loyal riders. The Alphabet-owned company said its sixth-generation Waymo Driver uses more cost-effective parts, and should be able to navigate through harsher weather conditions than previous generations.  The new system will serve \"as the primary engine for our next era of expansion,\" Waymo Vice President of Engineering Satish Jeyachandran said in a statement.  Waymo is offering service on its Ojai vehicles to employees and their guests in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles first, before gradually expanding to new cities, with a goal to open to public riders later this year. The deployment of Waymo's next-generation robotaxi comes as the company pushes to extend its lead in the U.S. while testing and planning for commercial operations abroad. Already, Waymo offers fully autonomous robotaxi service in six U.S. markets with plans to begin service in London later this year. Potential rivals, including Amazon-owned Zoox and Tesla, are testing their driverless systems in the U.S. but do not yet offer driverless ride-hailing services widely.Chinese robotaxi companies, including Baidu-owned Apollo Go and WeRide, have been expanding abroad at a faster clip than Waymo. The global market for driverless ride-hailing has significant potential, likely worth more than $25 billion by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs' estimates in May last year.Waymo's decision to use Chinese electric vehicles in its U.S. fleet has raised GOP lawmakers' concerns. \"We're locked in a race with China, but it seems like you're getting in bed with China,\" Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, said to Waymo safety chief at a committee hearing last week.Spokesperson Sandy Karp told CNBC that Waymo will not provide \"any access to its closely-held autonomous driving technology, sensor data, nor any rider information\" to Zeekr. The Chinese automaker, a subsidiary of Geely, is responsible for providing \"base vehicles,\" and Waymo installs its autonomous driving technology in the cars in the U.S.The company's sixth-generation systems will also work with robotaxis built on the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Waymo's current, Jaguar I-PACE vehicles will continue to run on its fifth-generation systems. \"We have consistently operated mixed fleets for years, including when we transitioned from the 4th-gen Driver on the Pacifica to the 5th-gen Driver on the I-PACE,\" Karp said in an email. The Ojai is a boxier ride, with a lower step and higher ceiling, than Waymo's existing robotaxis, but has about the same footprint as the Jaguar I-PACE.watch nowAlphabet's \"Other Bets\" segment, which includes Waymo, reported $7.51 billion in losses in 2025, up from $4.44 billion in 2024. Last week, Waymo said it raised a $16 billion funding round led by Alphabet that valued the company at $126 billion. Waymo's robotaxi service currently operates in the markets of Austin, the San Francisco Bay Area, Phoenix, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Miami, where it began offering service in January. In 2026, the company plans to open service in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington. It also plans to expand to London, its first international market. As it expands, Waymo's vehicles need to be able to handle harsher weather conditions, particularly in northeastern cities. The company had been testing the sixth-generation system on public roads since it was first announced in 2024. The new system has better vision than its predecessors due to upgraded lidar and radar systems, the company said.\"Our 6th-generation lidar leverages the significant cost reductions the industry has seen over the last five years, especially as affordable lidar increasingly appears in consumer vehicles,\" Jeyachandran said.Its next-gen 17-megapixel imager, which the company called a \"breakthrough in automotive vision technology,\" allows the system to see around the vehicle with fewer cameras. New in-house algorithms help improve performance in rain or snow, Jeyachandran added.\"A vision system that is reliable in inclement weather needs to keep itself clear,\" Jeyachandran said. \"While cameras on conventional cars can struggle with raindrops, road grime, and ice, our system features integrated cleaning systems to maintain visibility.\" ",

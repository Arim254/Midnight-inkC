    "body": "The sun sets behind burning gas flares at the Dora (Daura) Oil Refinery Complex in Baghdad on December 22, 2024.Ahmad Al-rubaye | Afp | Getty ImagesThe Environmental Protection Agency moved to finalize the revocation of a critical scientific finding that undergirds the U.S. government's climate regulations and ability to regulate greenhouse gases, the agency told CNBC. The EPA took a key step to ax the 2009 \"endangerment finding\" over the weekend by submitting the proposed rule to the Office of Management and Budget, the EPA press office told CNBC. The agency initially proposed rescinding it in July last year. \"This week at the White House, President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email to CNBC.The revocation of the endangerment finding would represent the Trump administration's biggest broadside yet against efforts to combat climate change and would be a boon for the fossil fuel industry that has fought against climate regulations for years. The endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases pose a risk to public health and welfare, giving EPA the authority to regulate them. Effectively, the EPA's move would immediately wipe away regulations on emissions from the country's highest polluting sector in transportation. Rescinding the endangerment finding, which was signed during the Obama administration and serves as the basis for troves of U.S. climate policy enacted since, would cause EPA to \"lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for certain motor vehicle emissions,\" the agency said. Since the ruling, the EPA has regulated emissions from automobiles and other vehicles and power plants. Its revocation would open the door to challenging those regulations.Rescinding the endangerment finding would almost certainly face legal challenges from environmental groups, and it could be legally tenuous. The endangerment finding has been upheld in court. In 2007, a Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, cleared the way for the finding to be made. The high court declined to hear an appeal challenging the endangerment finding as recently as 2023. The Wall Street Journal first reported the administration's plans.",

The platform allows users to buy event contracts for outcomes in politics, pop culture, financial markets and sports.\"It was an incredible weekend,\" Mansour told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday. \"Kalshi was the biggest brand of the Super Bowl this year, without running a Super Bowl ad, and the way we achieved that is the product.\"Mansour said the trading volume for halftime performer Bad Bunny's opening song exceeded $100 million, while bets on who would perform with Bad Bunny surpassed $45 million. The platform's Super Bowl contracts were not without bumps, though. Co-founder Luana Lopes Lara posted on social media during the game that some users' deposits were delayed due to high traffic.\"Your money is safe and on the way, it will just take longer to land,\" she wrote. Kalshi has recently come under fire along with other prediction markets as skepticism around the industry builds, with concerns of insider trading. Last week, before the Super Bowl, the platform announced additional efforts to expand its surveillance and enforcement efforts to identify and remove accounts participating in insider trading. \"The insider trading risk is very real for the stock market as well,\" Mansour said on Tuesday.\"As a regulated financial market by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, we have the same rules as the Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange, and we have the same mechanism of enforcement,\" he added.Over the past year, Mansour said the platform has run 200 investigations and frozen the relevant accounts, with some of those referred to law enforcement for prosecution.Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a minority investment.",

We were on family vacation,\" he said.The secretary's admission came as he faces bipartisan calls to resign following the release of records showing that his business and personal relationship with Epstein was more extensive than previously known.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick testifies during a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on February 10, 2026 in Washington, DC. Lutnick is facing bipartisan calls for his resignation after revelations that came to light in the latest release of Epstein files. Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesLutnick previously said that he cut off contact with Epstein after 2005 — years before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to a state-level charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution, which required him to register as a sex offender.But analyses of the latest batch of Epstein files released by the Department of Justice show Lutnick and Epstein were in communication years later.In December 2012, Epstein invited Lutnick to lunch at his private island in the Caribbean, the documents showed. The two men also had business dealings as recently as 2014, CBS News reported.Epstein died by suicide in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex trafficking charges.   In his testimony Tuesday morning before the Appropriations panel's subcommittee on commerce, justice, science and related agencies, Lutnick insisted that he \"barely had anything to do with that person.\"\"I'm glad to be here to make it clear that I met Jeffrey Epstein when he moved, when I moved to a house next door to him in New York,\" the Cabinet secretary testified.\"Over the next 14 years, I met him two other times that I can recall, two times,\" he said. \"So six years later, I met him, and then a year and a half after that, I met him, and never again.\"\"Probably the total — and you've seen all of these documents, of these millions and millions of documents — there may be 10 emails connecting me with him ... Over a 14 year period.\"\"I did not have any relationship with him,\" Lutnick said.Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., the subcommittee's ranking member, replied, \"There's not an indication that you yourself engaged in any wrongdoing with Jeffrey Epstein. It's the fact that you ... misled the country and the Congress based on your earlier statements suggesting that you cut off all contact, when, in fact, you had not.\"Asked by Van Hollen if he saw anything inappropriate during his visit to the island, Lutnick said that he did not.\"The only thing I saw with my wife and my children and the other couple and their children was staff who worked for Mr. Epstein on that island,\" he testified.Van Hollen asked if Lutnick would commit to sharing with Congress his own records relating to Epstein in order to \"ensure that the file is complete.\"\"I will surely talk about that. Hadn't thought about that,\" Lutnick said, adding, \"I have nothing to hide. Absolutely nothing.\"",

The latest document release by the U.S. Department of Justice revealed more messages between Mandelson and Epstein, including after Epstein had pleaded guilty in Florida to a state charge of felony solicitation of prostitution, a case that involved an underage girl.Starmer, who is facing calls to step down, has apologized to the victims of Epstein for believing Mandelson's \"lies.\"Here's the latestStarmer's Cabinet ministers have sought to rally around him, who has faced growing anger from opposition parties and members of his own party over the decision to appoint Mandelson.Two resignations in quick succession had ratcheted up the pressure, with Starmer's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, and communications director, Tim Allan, both stepping down.Downing Street Chief of Staff Morgan McSweeney arrives into Downing Street on October 06, 2025 in London, England.Leon Neal | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe furor led Anas Sarwar, who leads Starmer's Labour Party in Scotland, to call on Starmer to resign. \"The distraction needs to end and the leadership in Downing Street has to change,\" Sarwar said at a press conference on Monday.Starmer held a pivotal meeting with Labour members of parliament afterwards, in which he reportedly said he was \"not prepared to walk away.\"A spokesperson for the Prime Minister's Office was not immediately available for comment.Who is Peter Mandelson?Mandelson has been a key figure for the center-left Labour Party for decades, playing a pivotal role in the so-called \"New Labour\" movement that saw Tony Blair become prime minister after a landslide election victory in 1997.Known as a behind-the-scenes fixer and nicknamed the \"Prince of Darkness,\" Mandelson was a Labour member of parliament from 1992 to 2004 and served in Blair's cabinet.He left parliament to become a European Commissioner before returning to Britain in 2008 to work with then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown, having been appointed to parliament's unelected House of Lords.U.S. President Donald Trump along with Peter Mandelson, then-British Ambassador to the United States, on May 8, 2025 in the White House. Anna Moneymaker | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesAfter becoming prime minister in July 2024, Starmer appointed Mandelson as ambassador in Washington that December, a role he described at the time as \"a great honor.\" The appointment was controversial as Mandelson had twice previously resigned — in 1998 and 2001 — over scandals: one about not declaring a loan and another about allegedly influencing a passport application.Starmer fired Mandelson from the ambassadorship in September, after Downing Street said new information had come to light about the extent of his association with Epstein.The subsequent release of millions of files from the U.S. Department of Justice last week showed further links between Mandelson and Epstein. They prompted accusations that Mandelson had sent market-sensitive government information to Epstein following the 2008 global financial crisis.One exchange appeared to show Mandelson giving Epstein advance notice of an impending 500 billion euro bailout for banks in 2010.In a statement to U.K. broadcaster Sky News last month, Mandelson apologized for remaining friends with Epstein following his 2008 conviction.\"I was not culpable, I was not knowledgeable for what he was doing, and I regret, and will regret to my dying day, the fact that powerless women were not given the protection they were entitled to expect,\" he said.Markets react U.K. government borrowing costs jumped on Monday, amid growing pressure on Starmer. By Tuesday, after many Cabinet ministers rallied around the prime minister, yields on U.K. government bonds, known as gilts, were moving lower. The yield on the benchmark 10-year gilt was 3 basis points lower at 4.496%, while the 30-year gilt yield also fell by 4 basis points to settle at 5.309%.\"Uncertainty over Keir Starmer's future is unhelpful for U.K. bond markets, particularly since inflation is on track to fall quite sharply in the coming months and the Bank of England appears to be gearing up to cut interest rates as soon as March, with one or two further cuts later in the year,\" Charlie Lloyd, head of investments at Shackleton Advisers, said in a Monday note. Starmer's resignation would trigger a contest within the Labour Party to replace him as leader, which \"would almost certainly lead to short-term volatility in U.K. bond markets and an increase in the cost of borrowing through higher yields,\" Lloyd added. \"A prolonged contest could impact the economy if gilt yields traded at a premium to other bond markets for an extended period, not to mention the potential impact on consumer confidence,\" he continued.Who could replace Starmer? Former Deputy Prime Minister of the Labour party, Angela Rayner, delivers a speech during Labour's North West Regional Conference at the Titanic Hotel on January 25, 2026 in Liverpool, England.Ryan Jenkinson | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesIf Starmer resigned, a leadership contest to replace him would start and involve a series of votes whittling down the candidates. If Starmer refused to resign but a challenger gained enough support to trigger a leadership vote, the prime minister and that challenger would be put to the ballot. Either process could take weeks. Among the potential candidates to replace Starmer are left-leaning Angela Rayner, who resigned as deputy prime minister last autumn after a tax scandal, the current health minister, Wes Streeting, and former party leader Ed Miliband.Andy Burnham, the current mayor of Greater Manchester, was recently blocked from standing in a special election that could have seen him return to parliament — paving the way for a potential leadership challenge.Despite Burnham's popularity, investors are wary of a pivot away from efforts by Starmer and his finance minister, Rachel Reeves, to shore up the U.K.'s public finances. Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, said in a note on Tuesday that Burnham \"polls strongly\" but \"whether his successful regional economic policies translate into successful national policies is an open question — his past snipes that the U.K. is 'in hock to the bond markets' have alarmed investors.\"Pickering said the fact that Rayner remained under investigation for her tax affairs \"hurts her chances — and risks the narrative of replacing one scandalised PM with another.\"  But he added: \"Her popularity within the party suggests she may be able to consolidate the left with the moderates.\"",

    "body": "watch nowConsumer activity slowed sharply for the December holiday shopping season amid a spate of rough weather, tariff impact and persistently higher inflation, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.Retail sales were flat on the month following a 0.6% increase in November, according to numbers adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had expected an increase of 0.4%. Excluding autos, sales also were unchanged, against the estimate for a 0.3% increase.On an annual basis, sales rose 2.4%, a considerable step down from the 3.3% pace in November. Sales ex-autos were up 3.3% annually in December. A measure known as the \"control group\" of sales that excludes a number of items and feeds directly into gross domestic product calculations showed a 0.1% drop for the month.The report puts a downbeat end to an otherwise solid year for shopping activity, with higher-end consumers spending briskly through much of 2025, though those on the lower end of the income spectrum were more cautious.The shopping pace failed to keep up with inflation, as the consumer price index for December posted a 2.7% increase.For December, multiple categories posted losses while only a few showed notable gains.watch nowMiscellaneous retailers and furniture stores posted declines of 0.9%, while clothing and accessories stores were off 0.7%, and electronics and appliances saw a drop of 0.4%. Online outlets sales rose just 0.1%, while building materials and garden centers saw the strongest gain, up 1.2%.\"This is a K-shaped economy with strong spending from the top and much more cautious spending from middle- and lower-income consumers,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. \"Retail sales were flat in December, driven by soft spending on autos, home furnishings, appliances and clothing. These items were hard hit by tariffs in 2025 and consumers shifted their spending elsewhere.\"Fourth-quarter economic activity otherwise was strong, with the Atlanta Federal Reserve's data tracker pointing to GDP rising at a 4.2% annualized pace. However, that number could be lowered Tuesday following the retail number. Consumer spending makes up more than two-thirds of all economic activity in the U.S.The report comes a day ahead of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls count for January. Economists expect that to show an increase of just 55,000, following the 50,000 gain in December. However, several prominent Wall Street firms say they are looking for a lower number, with annual revisions due out that also are expected to shrink previous payroll growth.In other economic news Tuesday, the employment cost index posted a seasonally adjusted 0.7% increase for the fourth quarter of 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, below the 0.8% forecast. For the year, total compensation costs rose 3.4%, or a bit above the inflation rate. The quarterly rate was the slowest gain since Q3 of 2020.The BLS also reported that import prices rose 0.1% in December, against a forecast decrease of 0.1%, and were unchanged from a year ago. Export prices increased 0.3% and were up 3.1% annually.",

    "body": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's logo is seen in the background beside a printed circuit board. Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesTaiwan has told Washington that its proposal to move 40% of the island's semiconductor supply chain to the U.S. was \"impossible,\" Taipei's top tariff trade negotiator said in an interview. Speaking on a local television broadcast Sunday, Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said she had made it clear to Washington that the country's semiconductor ecosystem, built over decades, could not simply be relocated. Taiwan's international expansion, including its investments in the U.S., is predicated on the notion that the industry remains' rooted in Taiwan and continues to expand domestic investments, she said in Mandarin, translated by CNBC. The comments push back against onshoring targets outlined by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick in a CNBC interview in January, shortly after the latest U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement. Lutnick said he wanted 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain to shift to the U.S. within President Donald Trump's ongoing term. Under the deal, the Taiwanese government promised $250 billion in direct investments by its tech companies, with an additional $250 billion in credit provided for them to expand their production capacity in the U.S. Washington on its part lowered levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, waived tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically, and promised higher quotas for tariff-free exports of Taiwanese chips to the U.S. watch nowTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, the world's leading contract chipmaker and producer of the most advanced semiconductors, has already been working to better align with U.S. policy interests.The company has committed more than $65 billion to U.S. manufacturing in recent years, with plans to expand that to $165 billion, as it produces chips for American clients Apple and Nvidia. The investments have also leveraged grants under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act. But according to Lutnick, Washington is also looking for hundreds of other smaller companies in the chip supply chain to come to the U.S. \"We're going to build giant semiconductor industrial parks in America ... This is a $500 billion down payment on let's bring those semiconductors home,\" he said in January, adding that Taiwan-based chip companies that don't build in the U.S are likely to face a 100% tariff Trump has threatened against the sector. However, semiconductor analysts broadly agree with Cheng's assessment that Washington's most ambitious onshoring plans are unfeasible, citing the difficulties of relocating such an advanced supply chain.Analysts and industry officials point to Taiwan's deeply integrated semiconductor ecosystem, U.S. labor shortages and elevated costs as some of the key obstacles.Geopolitical analysts have also pointed to the so-called \"Silicon Shield\" theory, which posits that the island's pivotal role in global chip supply makes safeguarding its autonomy a U.S. strategic imperative, deterring a potential Chinese aggression. Beijing claims sovereignty over the democratically governed island.This Silicon Shield could further discourage Taiwan from shifting its supply chains abroad. Taiwanese authorities have already implemented a policy requiring TSMC's overseas plants to operate using technologies at least two generations behind the cutting-edge ones being deployed in Taiwan, a policy often referred to as the N-2 rule. The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cheng's statement. TSMC shares were trading up 2.75% in Taiwan on Tuesday. — CNBC's Matthew Chin contributed to this report.

    "body": "watch nowSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., on Tuesday slammed Democrats for conditioning Homeland Security Department funding on a requirement that federal immigration agents must obtain judicial warrants to carry out key enforcement activities.Johnson, in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box,\" called that proposal \"completely unworkable.\" But it's Democrats' top demand for funding DHS, which is set to lose funding by the week's end if Congress can't pass an appropriations bill.Johnson said he hopes Congress can pass another stopgap measure to buy time, but suggested Democrats have been unreasonable in negotiations so far.\"They want to defund DHS just like they want to defund police,\" Johnson said of his political opponents. DHS includes the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose deportation efforts have grown especially controversial after an aggressive surge in Minnesota stirred national unrest.Democrats \"want to make it almost impossible for ICE to do its job,\" Johnson, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said.\"Of the 10 demands, probably the most obnoxious is they want to require judicial warrants, which is completely unworkable,\" he said. \"Our immigration laws have always been enforced by the executive branch, through administrative law judges. We have, again, literally millions of cases that need to be adjudicated. Our Article Three courts simply can't handle that, and Democrats know it,\" Johnson said.Democrats have rejected arguments that requiring judge-signed warrants to enter private property — as opposed to administrative warrants issued by federal agency officials — would overburden the system.The White House sent a counterproposal to Democrats' demands, but Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in a statement late Monday called it \"incomplete and insufficient.\"Johnson also defended ICE agents wearing masks and obscuring their faces, accusing Democrats of wanting extreme political activists to \"dox\" agents.\"Democrats want to make sure that ICE can't use masks. Why is that? Because they want their activists to be able to dox them and put their families at risk.\"He warned that a shutdown would cause real harm, noting that the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration would be defunded if DHS appropriations lapsed. Other parts of the department are already funded through previous legislation.\"They're really playing with fire here,\" Johnson said.",

Michael M. Santiago | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe world's largest YouTuber by subscriber count, Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has acquired the financial services app Step, marking his company's entry into fintech with a focus on serving younger users.Step is advertised as an all-in-one money app for teens and young adults to manage money, build credit and access financial tools. The app will operate under the umbrella of Donalson's company, Beast Industries. \"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up. That's exactly why we're joining forces with Step,\" MrBeast told his millions of fans on Monday. \"I want to give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had. Lots to share soon.\"Beast Industries did not disclose how much it paid for Step. CNBC contacted the company for comment but did not receive a response by publication.Beast Industries has been fundraising over the past year, including a recent $200 million investment from Bitmine Immersion Technologies, the largest corporate holder of the cryptocurrency Ether and chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee.watch nowStep is backed by fintech giant Stripe, as well as venture capital firms such as Coatue, Collaborative Fund, Crosslink Capital and General Catalyst.The newly acquired Step was founded in 2018 by fintech veterans CJ MacDonald and Alexey Kalinichenko, with a mission of providing the next generation with tools for financial literacy. While it is not a bank, Step partnered with Evolve Bank & Trust, a consumer banking company, for banking services in 2022. The platform also includes a Step Visa Card, an account for saving, spending, sending money and investing, with no monthly fees.Beast Industries said in a press release Step's over 7 million users, technology platform and in-house fintech team would complement its large digital audience and philanthropic initiatives.\"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better,\" Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said in a statement. Beast Industries' other ventures include Feastables, a snack brand, Beast Philanthropy, its non-profit arm, and Beast Games, its reality competition series on Amazon Prime Video.Those ventures leverage Donaldson's YouTube brand, which had over 450 million subscribers and 5 billion monthly views across channels as of early 2026. ",

    "body": "Shares of SoftBank Group Corp jumped over 10% after its telecom arm, SoftBank Corp, raised its full-year profit outlook, while renewed optimism around Arm Holdings added to bullish sentiment toward the group's artificial intelligence exposure.Revenue for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 at SoftBank Corp rose 8% from a year earlier to 5.2 trillion yen, a record for the period, while operating income also climbed 8% to 884 billion yen.Reflecting the momentum, the telecom subsidiary lifted its full-year revenue forecast to 6.95 trillion yen from 6.7 trillion previously, and increased its operating income target to 1.02 trillion yen.SoftBank Corp said the results underscored steady execution toward its fiscal 2025 goals, even as it fine-tunes parts of its consumer business to prioritize long-term profitability over subscriber growth.Revenue in the consumer business posted modest gains of 3%, while segment income rose 6%, even as smartphone subscribers fell by 100,000 in the third quarter after the company tightened its customer-acquisition policy. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconA sharp rally in Arm Holdings also provided a fresh boost for SoftBank Group, given its large stake in the British chip designer, said Andrew Jackson, head of Japan equity strategy at Ortus Advisors. Arm's upside is increasingly driven by AI-linked growth beyond smartphones. \"Our data center royalty revenue has grown more than 100% year-on-year, and we expect in a few years our data center business to be our largest business, larger than mobile,\" Rene Haas, CEO of ARM, said in an earnings call on Wednesday.The company is also aiming to supply half of the central processing units used by the world's largest cloud computing companies, also known as hyperscalers, by year-end.Despite missing Wall Street estimates for licensing revenue, Arm posted record quarterly revenue of $1.242 billion for the last three months of 2025, driven by demand for artificial intelligence. That figure beat LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.",

    "body": "watch nowHouse lawmakers on Monday approved a package of bills aimed at increasing housing affordability by giving builders and local governments incentives to boost construction by reducing regulations around home construction. The legislation gained strong bipartisan support, with the House voting 390-9 in favor. A similar Senate counterpart passed last year, also with bipartisan votes. That, as well as President Donald Trump's focus on housing affordability, means the measure has momentum to become law before the end of the year. \"Nothing's more personal to Americans than their opportunity to have a home,\" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told reporters on Monday. \"When you ask people what is central to their goals in life, mom and dad are working 55 hours a week and overtime and all these other things ... the idea is, how do we get into a house?\"The bill includes numerous provisions, including cutting housing and environmental regulations around constructing homes. Local communities could get grants to make it easier for builders by offering pre-reviewed housing designs, streamlining construction or housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also develop best-practices for zoning guidelines. Definitions around manufactured and modular housing would be updated to encourage more factory-built homes, which can be constructed in a fraction of the time compared to more traditional house-building methods.Community banks would also get a boost through the bill. One change would allow banks to take more custodial and reciprocal deposits, which could help banks provide more mortgages for potential homeowners. Other changes would make it easier to start new banks and change how the FDIC looks at banking mergers. The Senate bill doesn't include many of the provisions on community banks, and would create more programs compared to the House bill. The Senate passed its package last year as part of a larger defense measure, but the bill got significant bipartisan support as a standalone measure, including the backing of both Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.The bills have received an unusually high degree of bipartisan support. The Senate bill was advanced unanimously out of committee with all 24 senators supporting it. A House panel advanced its bill 50 to 1 in December.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who supported the bill, warned the legislation wouldn't be effective if housing programs remain underfunded.\"Policy reforms alone are not enough,\" Waters said. \"These programs must be funded if they are going to work.\"House Financial Services Chair French Hill, R-Ark., said getting a housing bill across the finish line is a \"shared goal\" between him and Scott. Hill said he will work with the Senate to see where they have common ground and get consensus on a bill that can get to Trump's desk. Flood said he is optimistic on getting passage this year. \"We are at a juncture to get something very big done here, and everybody wants to participate,\" he said. \"This isn't like we're pushing an agenda trying to talk people into something. White House has ideas. The Senate has ideas. The House has ideas.\"One thing not in the bill: formalizing Trump's proposed ban on large investors buying homes. Hill noted other lawmakers have introduced bills building on Trump's idea and said it could happen if there is a consensus in the Senate and House. ",

    "body": "watch nowCoca-Cola on Tuesday reported weaker-than-expected quarterly revenue, falling short of Wall Street's projections for the first time in five years.However, demand for its drinks in North America and Latin America is beginning to show signs of improvement.Looking ahead to 2026, the company is projecting organic revenue growth of 4% to 5% and comparable earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% for the full year.\"It's right at the beginning of the year, and I think we've taken a realistic and prudent approach to a number of markets out there, particularly some of the international markets where we want to see conditions improve, and we need to do some things to execute better,\" outgoing CEO James Quincey said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street.\"Here's what the company reported for the period ended Dec. 31 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Adjusted earnings per share: 58 cents vs. 56 cents expectedAdjusted revenue: $11.82 billion vs. $12.03 billion expected The beverage giant reported fourth-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $2.27 billion, or 53 cents per share, up from $2.2 billion, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding transaction gains and other one-time items, Coke earned 58 cents per share.Net sales rose 2% to $11.82 billion. Organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and currency, increased 5% in the quarter.Unit case volume rose 1% in the quarter, marking the second straight quarter of growth for the company. The metric excludes the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand. Like rival PepsiCo, Coke has seen demand for its drinks fall as budget-conscious shoppers try to save more on their grocery bills and dine out less frequently. Coke's overall volume for 2025 was unchanged from the prior year. But there have been some bright spots, like Smartwater and Fairlife, showing that consumers are still willing to pay more for premium drinks. And two key markets for Coke are starting to show signs of improvement. Coke's volume in North America increased 1%, while it rose 2% in Latin America. Worldwide, Coke's water, sports, coffee and tea division outperformed the rest of its portfolio, signaling consumers' willingness to spend on drinks they perceive as healthier options. The segment saw volume grow 3%, thanks to higher demand for brands like Smartwater and Bodyarmor. The company's sparkling soft drinks business reported flat volume. Its namesake soda saw volume rise 1% in the quarter, while Coke Zero Sugar reported that its volume climbed 13%.Coke's juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages division reported that volume fell 3%. Higher demand for Fairlife was offset by the sale of Coke's finished product operations in Nigeria to one of its bottlers.CEO transitionTuesday marks Quincey's last earnings report as CEO. The company announced in December that Chief Operating Officer Henrique Braun will succeed him as chief executive, effective March 31.Braun said on the company's conference call Tuesday that he wants to improve Coke's speed when taking new products to market, better integrate its marketing where customers actually buy its drinks and continue efforts to digitize every step of its system.\"Our system needs to focus on being a little bit better and sharper everywhere to drive transformation and impact,\" Braun said.The company also plans to stay \"flexible and opportunistic\" when it comes to acquisitions, according to CFO John Murphy. While he noted that Coke's track record hasn't been perfect, he added that almost half of the company's 32 billion-dollar brands were the result of deal-making.Executives plan to share more about the company's future priorities during its Feb. 17 presentation at the annual CAGNY conference. As of Tuesday's open Coca-Cola shares have risen roughly 20% over the last year, raising its market value up to more than $330 billion.watch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe Food and Drug Administration said Novo Nordisk's TV advertisement for its newly launched Wegovy pill for obesity included \"false or misleading\" claims about the medicine's abilities and benefits to patients.In a letter to Novo dated Feb. 5, the FDA said the ad misbrands the oral drug, making its distribution a violation of federal law. The agency requested that the drugmaker take immediate action to address the violations, which could include ceasing all ads containing misleading claims. In a statement Monday, Novo Nordisk confirmed that it received the letter and clarified that the ad has been running since the pill's launch, but is not the company's Super Bowl spot. \"We take all regulatory feedback seriously and are in the process of responding to the FDA to address their concerns regarding the advertisement's presentation,\" Liz Skrbkova, Novo's head of U.S. media and stakeholder relations, said in the statement. It adds to the mounting hurdles the Danish drugmaker is facing as it scrambles to win back market share from chief rival Eli Lilly and cheaper compounded copycats in the booming GLP-1 market. The company's Wegovy pill is key to those efforts. It was the first-ever GLP-1 pill for obesity to enter the market in January, and Novo last week said more than 170,000 American patients are already taking the drug. Bloomberg first reported on the FDA letter on Monday. More CNBC health coverageThe Trump administration is changing Covid, childhood vaccine recommendations – here's what it means for youU.S. to impose 100% tariff on branded, patented drugs unless firms build plants locally, Trump saysEli Lilly to build $6.5 billion Texas manufacturing facility for obesity pill, other drugsIn the letter, the FDA said Novo's ad misleadingly suggests its pill offers superior benefits to other approved GLP-1 weight loss drugs. The agency said phrases used in the spot, including \"live lighter\" and \"a way forward,\" imply greater weight loss than other treatments and added benefits beyond that, despite no evidence to support those claims. The ad's statements \"misleadingly imply benefits beyond physical weight loss such as emotional relief, reduced psychological burden, hope, or direction for patients' lives, positioning the drug as a solution to broader life challenges rather than a treatment for a specific condition, when this has also not been demonstrated,\" the FDA said in the letter. The FDA also flagged the ad for failing to properly present risk information in both audio and text, a requirement for television drug advertising. Also on Monday, Novo Nordisk sued Hims & Hers, asking the court to stop the telehealth company from mass marketing compounded versions of its Wegovy pill and injections. ",

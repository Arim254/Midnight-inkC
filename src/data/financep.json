    "body": "When a couple welcomes a child to their family, many may want one parent to stay home with the new addition, rather than returning to work. But that decision comes with a number of tradeoffs. Having one parent stay home may help the family save money on child care, which can cost more than college tuition in more than half of states, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. However, it could negatively impact that parent's salary prospects or career growth if they later decide to return to work.Another factor to consider is if the working parent's income is enough to support the entire family. In Hawaii, a working parent needs to earn at least $102,773 a year to support themself, a non-working partner and a child, according to a recent SmartAsset analysis of Massachusetts Institute of Technology living wage calculator data. The analysis includes estimates for basic living expenses, including rent, groceries and health care. It doesn't account for discretionary costs like travel and entertainment, but includes cost estimates for basic apparel, household supplies and personal care products. In Hawaii, the working parent needs to earn the most of any state to support a three-person household, the analysis found. However, if both parents work, the family needs to earn at least $115,814 a year to afford basic living expenses including child care, SmartAsset found. The median household income in Hawaii is just over $98,000, according to Census Bureau data. Here's how much one parent needs to earn so the other can stay home in every U.S. state.Hidden costs of being a stay-at-home parentLeaving the workforce for a few years can have long-term effects on a parent's career, Emily Green, head of wealth management for Ellevest, previously told CNBC Make It. This often affects more women than men since women represent 82% of stay-at-home parents, according to Pew Research.\"In households where there's a little more financial wiggle room, women often don't think about what they may give up in the long term —  say in 5-10 years — by leaving their jobs now,\" Green said.Leaving the workforce for an extended period of time could mean missing out on steady salary increases, adding gaps to your resume that could make it harder to secure future job opportunities and falling behind on long-term career goals, Green said. Those tradeoffs may be worth it to some parents and necessary for others who don't have other viable child-care options. \"I have seen many women leave their jobs because their salaries don't cover the cost of child care,\" Green said. \"In some households, that math means a career break is inescapable.\"Regardless, they are important factors to consider when thinking about your family's financial situation. Families may want to work with a financial professional to see how various scenarios may impact their long-term goals. Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "Amazon package and Saks Fifth Avenue bag.Getty ImagesAmazon wants a federal judge to reject Saks Global's bankruptcy financing plan, writing in court papers the beleaguered department store \"burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year\" and failed to hold up their agreement. When Saks acquired Neiman Marcus for $2.7 billion in December 2024, Amazon invested $475 million into the venture on the grounds the retailer would start selling its products on Amazon's website and the tech company would offer technology and logistics expertise.\"That equity investment is now presumptively worthless,\" Amazon's attorneys wrote in a Wednesday filing, hours after Saks filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. \"Saks continuously failed to meet its budgets, burned through hundreds of millions of dollars in less than a year, and ran up additional hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices owed to its retail partners.\"As part of the deal, Saks launched a branded \"Saks at Amazon\" storefront on the e-commerce company's website featuring a range of luxury fashion and beauty items. It also agreed to pay a referral fee for Saks-branded goods sold on the platform, guaranteeing at least $900 million in payments to Amazon over eight years. In its filing, Amazon argued that Saks' bankruptcy financing plan harms the company, and other creditors, because it saddles parts of the Saks corporation with new debt that it previously didn't have. It also pushes Amazon further down the pecking order in terms of repayment, which reduces the amount it could potentially be repaid during the proceedings, the e-commerce company said in the filings. Amazon wrote that it \"hopes\" Saks will resolve its concerns, but if it doesn't, it may \"seek more drastic remedies\" including the appointment of an examiner or a trustee. During a hearing on Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston, Judge Alfredo Perez allowed Saks to start tapping into $1.75 billion in new bankruptcy financing after the company argued it would face immediate liquidation without it. He has yet to issue a ruling on Amazon's request. Saks' acquisition of Neiman Marcus brought a slew of new investors, including names from the technology industry. For Amazon, the deal guaranteed Saks' presence on its sprawling webstore, where the company has sought to attract bigger brands and grow its luxury selection, in particular. The Saks deal also raised the possibility that Amazon could deepen its investment in the department store chain. Amazon has been determined to have a bigger presence in physical retail and it's experimented with several concepts over the years, scrapping some along the way.The company has also struck similar investment agreements in the past. In 2022, Amazon took a 2% stake in GrubHub in exchange for the food delivery company adding perks for Prime members. Amazon expanded its stake in the company to up to 18% in 2024.Amazon declined to comment beyond what it stated in the filing. Saks didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Software giant Salesforce also became a minority shareholder in Saks during its acquisition of Neiman Marcus, but it took a smaller stake than Amazon did. It's unclear if it also plans to object to the bankruptcy plan. ",

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street analysts surveyed by LSEG were expecting:Earnings per share: $2.68 vs. $2.44 expected Revenue: $17.89 billion vs. $17.77 billion expectedFourth-quarter net income rose to $4.40 billion, or $2.68 per share, from $3.71 billion, or $2.22 per share, a year ago.

The wealth management unit posted $8.4 billion in net revenue in the most recent quarter, up from $7.5 billion a year earlier. For the full year, the division generated a record $31.8 billion in net revenue. Total client assets in the wealth and investment management business climbed to $9.3 trillion, fueled by more than $350 billion in net new assets.\"Morgan Stanley delivered outstanding performance in 2025,\" Ted Pick, the bank's CEO and chairman, said in a statement. \"Our performance reflects multi-year investments which have contributed to growth and momentum across the Integrated Firm.\"Investment banking was also a standout for the firm. Net revenue for the segment jumped 47% to $2.41 billion from $1.64 billion a year earlier, driven by stronger advisory fees as completed M&A activity increased across all regions.The firm bought back $1.5 billion of its stock during the quarter and $4.6 billion over the full year under its share repurchase program.Morgan Stanley shares have gained more than 43% over the past 12 months.Other banks have mostly posted solid results.

    "body": "TSMC offices in San Jose, California, on April 18, 2024.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company on Thursday reported a 35% increase in fourth-quarter profit, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips remained strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 1.046 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($33.73 billion), vs. NT$1.034 trillion expectedNet income: NT$505.74 billion, vs. NT$478.37 billion expectedThe world's largest contract chipmaker has now posted year-over-year profit growth for eight consecutive quarters.Meanwhile, TSMC's revenue in the December quarter rose by 20.5% from a year ago to surpass NT$1 trillion, also beating forecasts.In an earnings call, TSMC executives guided revenue for the current quarter to hit between $34.6 billion and $35.8 billion, up 4% sequentially, or up 38% year-over-year at the midpoint. \"We expect our business to be supported by continued strong demand for our leading edge process technologies,\" said TSMC's Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang during an earnings call, adding that the company's profit margins have been increasing. TSMC, Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, has benefited greatly from the proliferation of artificial intelligence, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and AMD. Advanced chips The company's high-performance computing division, which includes artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the October-December quarter at 55%. Demand from smartphones made up 32% of sales.TSMC said advanced chips measuring 7-nanometer or smaller made up 77% of total wafer revenue during the quarter. For full-year 2025, those chips made up 74% of revenue, up from 69% in 2024.In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes indicate more compact transistor designs, allowing faster processing speeds and greater energy efficiency. The company is looking to further ramp up its cutting-edge 2 nm offerings this year, after rolling out mass production last quarter. With TSMC further leaning into its advanced products, it said that its capital expenditure was expected to reach between $52 billion and $56 billion in 2026, as compared to $40.9 billion in 2025. \"The demand for AI remains very strong, driving overall chip demand across the entire server industry,\" Counterpoint Research senior analyst Jake Lai told CNBC, predicting that 2026 will be another \"breakout year\" for AI server demand. \"With TSMC's ongoing 2nm capacity expansion and new production contributing to revenue, along with continuous expansion of advanced packaging... TSMC is expected to maintain strong performance in 2026,\" Lai said. However, he added that chip demand tied to consumer electronics such as smartphones and PCs could be affected by the ongoing memory shortage and price hikes.During the earnings call on Thursday, TSMC Chairman and Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei acknowledged the memory shortage but argued that TSMC is focused on high-end smartphones, which are less sensitive to the memory prices. However, Wei flagged global tariff policies as a potential risk factor headed into 2026. Global expansion TSMC has been expanding globally in recent years, with major projects underway in Japan, Europe, and Arizona, where it is accelerating capacity expansion.Chief Executive C.C. Wei said Thursday that the company recently purchased additional land in Arizona to support new facilities. \"We are going to expand many fabs over there, and this gigafab cluster can help us to improve the productivity, to lower the cost and to serve our customers in the U.S. better,\" he added. While these expansions could help lessen the impact of global tariffs in markets such as the U.S., the company has also warned that overseas plants will operate at diluted margins compared to those in Taiwan.

Indonesia and Malaysia have both issued a temporary ban on Grok.Those announcements came amid widespread criticism that Grok had enabled X users to easily generate sexual and violent images based on real photos of people on the social network through simple text-based prompts.In the U.S., three Democratic senators have called on Apple and Google to remove the X and Grok apps from their app stores until the company makes changes to prevent easy creation of nonconsensual explicit images. Musk's company also said, in the post on Wednesday, that image creation editing through Grok on X will only be available to paid subscribers.Earlier on Wednesday, Musk dared his followers on X to \"break Grok image moderation.\" He said that, \"With NSFW enabled, Grok is supposed allow upper body nudity of imaginary adult humans (not real ones),\" and compared such content to what's seen in R-rated movies. Grok settings, he noted, would also \"vary in other regions according to the laws on a country by country basis.\"WATCH: California attorney general launches investigation into xAI, Grokwatch now",

Trump, however, told reporters in the Oval Office: \"We need Greenland for national security.\" The U.S., Denmark and Greenland agreed to establish a high-level working group to discuss the future of the island, although, as had been widely expected, the three countries were unable to find a diplomatic resolution to defuse tensions.(L/R) Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt speak during a news conference at the Danish Embassy in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2026.Oliver Contreras | Afp | Getty ImagesBefore the meeting, Denmark announced plans on Wednesday to beef up its military presence in and around Greenland, saying the exercise activities could include guarding national infrastructure, deploying fighter aircraft and conducting naval operations. Germany's Defense Ministry said it would deploy a \"reconnaissance team\" of 13 personnel to Nuuk, Greenland, at the invitation of Denmark.The mission, which will take place Thursday through Saturday, is designed to explore the framework for possible military contributions to ensure security in the region, the German Defense Ministry said, including maritime surveillance capabilities.'Operation Arctic Endurance'French President Emmanuel Macron said in a social media post that France will also participate in the joint exercises organized by Denmark in Greenland, referring to it as \"Operation Arctic Endurance.\" \"The first French military elements are already on their way. Others will follow,\" Macron said Wednesday on X, according to a Google translation.Read moreSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said several officers from Sweden's armed forces were scheduled to arrive in Greenland from Wednesday.\"They are part of a group from several allied countries. Together, they will prepare for upcoming elements within the framework of the Danish exercise Operation Arctic Endurance,\" Kristersson said via X, according to a translation.Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who has previously warned that a U.S. attack on Greenland would mark the end of NATO, thanked Rasmussen and Greenland's Motzfeldt for countering the American claims at the talks. \"It was not an easy meeting,\" Frederiksen said in a Facebook post Thursday, according to a translation. Greenland residents and political leaders have publicly rejected suggestions by U.S. President Donald Trump that the Arctic island could become part of the United States.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty Images\"A working group is now being established to discuss how security in the Arctic can be strengthened. However, that does not change the fact that there is a fundamental disagreement because the American ambition to take over Greenland is intact,\" Frederiksen said.The Danish prime minister also mentioned that a number of NATO allies were currently contributing to joint exercise activities in and around Greenland. \"The defense and protection of Greenland is a common concern for the entire NATO alliance,\" she added.Denmark: 'We have been stepping up'Opinion polls have shown that Greenlanders overwhelmingly oppose U.S. control, while a strong majority support independence from Denmark.Denmark has pledged to boost health-care spending and infrastructure investments in recent months, while also seeking to defuse tensions with the Trump administration by investing in Arctic defense, including the purchase of 16 additional F-35 fighter jets.watch now\"We have been stepping up. We have allocated almost $15 billion within just the last couple of years to capabilities in the High North. We have been pushing within the Arctic NATO states for bigger NATO engagement,\" Rasmussen said Wednesday.\"We didn't manage to change the American position. It's clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland,\" he continued. \"We made it very, very clear that this is not in the interest of the kingdom.\"",

    "body": "The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday it will pause issuing immigrant visas to citizens of 75 countries over concerns that they may rely on public assistance in the future.In a post on X, the U.S. government said immigrants from the list of countries \"take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates.\" The list, which includes U.S. allies and adversaries, alongside several top destinations for American travelers, was later posted on U.S. State Department's website. The countries, divided by region, include: The Americas- Antigua and Barbuda- Bahamas - Barbados - Belize - Brazil - Colombia - Cuba - Dominica - Grenada - Guatemala - Haiti - Jamaica - Nicaragua - St. Kitts and Nevis - St. Lucia - St. Vincent and the Grenadines - UruguayEurope- Albania - Belarus - Bosnia and Herzegovina - Kosovo - Moldova - Montenegro - North MacedoniaAsia-Pacific- Afghanistan - Armenia - Azerbaijan - Bangladesh - Bhutan - Cambodia- Fiji - Georgia - Iran - Iraq - Jordan - Kazakhstan - Kuwait - Kyrgyzstan - Laos - Lebanon - Mongolia - Myanmar - Nepal - Pakistan - Russia - Syria - Thailand - Uzbekistan- YemenAfrica- Algeria - Cameroon - Cape Verde - Côte d'Ivoire - Democratic Republic of the Congo - Egypt - Eritrea - Ethiopia - Ghana - Guinea - Liberia - Libya - Morocco - Nigeria - Republic of the Congo - Rwanda - Senegal - Sierra Leone - Somalia - South Sudan - Sudan - Tanzania - The Gambia - Togo - Tunisia - UgandaThe freeze, which is set to begin Jan. 21, does not affect tourist visas. It will remain in effect \"until the U.S. can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people,\" according to the U.S. State Department's website.  This latest announcement follows a string of immigration and travel visa restrictions from the Trump Administration, including the pausing of diversity visas in late December. Diversity visas allowed a maximum of 55,000 immigrants from countries with low U.S. immigration rates to enter the United States each year. Current immigration visas The policy does not affect current immigration visas. However, the U.S. government has previously signaled it's reviewing immigration visas granted under the Biden Administration. Joseph Edlow, director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a post on X in November, said he's \"directed a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern,\" at the direction of President Donald Trump.He added that \"the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration's reckless resettlement policies.\"Read moreImmigrant visa holders who are granted permanent resident cards, commonly known as \"Green Cards,\" are eligible for certain types of public assistance, but there is a five-year waiting period after obtaining the status to receive several benefits, including Medicaid, Medicare and the SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program, according to the non-partisan, not-for-profit organization USAFacts.The State Department on Monday announced it revoked more than 100,000 visas in 2025, including tourists who overstayed their visa periods, as well as some 8,000 student and 2,500 specialized worker visa holders for criminal offenses ranging from driving under the influence to theft.",

    "body": "watch nowGoldman Sachs on Thursday topped expectations for fourth-quarter profit as equities trading and asset and wealth management produced nearly $900 million more in revenue than expected.  Here's what the company reported:Earnings: $14.01 per share. That may not compare with the $11.67 LSEG estimate.Revenue:  $13.45 billion. That may not compare with the $13.79 billion LSEG estimate.The company said profit jumped 12% from a year earlier to $4.62 billion, or $14.01 per share, on gains across its capital markets businesses.It's unclear whether the LSEG estimate for earnings per share includes a preannounced 46 cent per share gain from Goldman's sale of its Apple Card business. Either way, Goldman's profit handily topped analyst expectations.The bank's revenue dipped 3% to $13.45 billion in the quarter, which the company said was the result of off-loading the Apple Card loan portfolio to JPMorgan Chase and the early termination of its contract with the tech giant.Goldman Sachs' results show that, even despite the revenue hit from off-loading its credit card business, the firm's Wall Street-centric model is thriving in the current environment. High stock prices, falling interest rates, rising engagement from institutional investors, and continued global turmoil that has roiled markets for commodities and currencies have all proven to be a boost for investment banks. \"We continue to see high levels of client engagement across our franchise and expect momentum to accelerate in 2026, activating a flywheel of activity across our entire firm,\" Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an earnings presentation.Goldman can, in the near term, exceed its firmwide targets of mid-teens returns and an approximate 60% efficiency ratio thanks to the capital markets rebound and industry deregulation, the bank said.Busy equities tradersLike JPMorgan, Goldman's biggest source of outperformance in the quarter was from its equities franchise.Equities trading revenue jumped 25% from a year earlier to $4.31 billion, about $610 million more than the StreetAccount estimate, as Goldman reaped more revenue from financing trades and selling derivatives to hedge funds and other institutional investors.Fixed income trading revenue climbed 12% to $3.11 billion, about $180 million more than expected, on strength in wagers tied to interest rates and commodities. Investment banking fees surged 25% to $2.58 billion, matching the StreetAccount estimate, fueled by gains in mergers advisory and debt underwriting. In a positive sign for the business this year, Goldman said that its backlog of deals grew at year-end compared with the end of the third quarter.The firm's asset and wealth management business saw revenue roughly unchanged from a year earlier at $4.72 billion, though that exceeded the StreetAccount estimate by about $270 million. Rising fees from its growing base of assets under management offset net losses from stakes in public equities and lower gains from private equities, the bank said.In Goldman's smallest business, called platform solutions, the bank posted a $1.68 billion revenue loss for the quarter, compared with $592 million in gains from a year earlier. It cited the company's Apple Card exit for the hit to that unit's results.Shares of the bank rose more than 1.5% in morning trading. This story is developing.

Cost overruns have been a point of contention between the Fed and the White House, with the latest developments pointing to a potential criminal prosecution of Powell.While Goolsbee said he wasn't commenting directly on the legal issues, he expressed support for Powell's statement Sunday that the questions over the construction project could be seen as a pretext toward President Donald Trump getting his way on interest rates.\"I agree with it, with his argument that if you're investigating as a pretext because you disagree with the rate decisions, that's a mess. We should not be in that place,\" he said.Trump has been relentless in his biting, often-personal criticism of the Powell Fed. He repeatedly has called for much lower interest rates and has nicknamed Powell \"Too Late\" even though the Fed has cut its benchmark rate three times since September 2025.Powell's term as chair ends in May, though he could stay on as a governor until 2028.Like other Fed officials, Goolsbee said the independence of the Fed is critical for it to achieve its goals.\"I know that there have been countries that had criminal investigations of their central banks, but those countries are Zimbabwe and Russia and Turkey and a bunch of places that you would not characterize as advanced economies,\" he said.Before taking his position at the Chicago Fed in December 2022, Goolsbee had a long history of involvement in Democratic politics.He chaired the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama and served as an advisor during Joe Biden's campaign in 2020. However, he said Thursday that once \"you've become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the elections business.\"Goolsbee has called Powell a \"first-ballot Hall of Famer\" as a Fed chair for bringing down inflation without causing a recession.watch now",

    "body": "A notification on the Instagram app on a smartphone arranged in Sydney, Australia, on Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesIt's been a month since Australia banned under-16s from social media platforms, and some teens are glad to be free of the distraction, while others have found ways to bypass the law.The Online Safety Amendment Act requires major social media platforms like Meta's Instagram, ByteDance's TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube, Elon Musk's X, and Reddit to implement age verification methods such as facial estimation through selfies, uploaded ID documents, or linked bank details.Tech companies — not parents and teens — face repercussions for any breaches. This includes a fine of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32 million) if they fail to take \"reasonable steps\" to comply.Australia's government argued it would protect teens from the addictive algorithm design that hooks people and mental health harms attributed to social media, such as reduced sleep and increased stress. Opponents of the ban argued it would be ineffective.Here are the top three takeaways on how the ban is going, a month in. The teen viewSome teens are embracing new habits, while others are trying to circumvent the law.Amy, 14, kept a diary since the ban started and told the BBC in a recent report that she feels \"free\" without the pressure of maintaining a presence on Snapchat — one of the affected platforms. \"I often used to call my friends on Snapchat after school, but because I am no longer able to, I went for a run,\" Amy wrote in her diary.The BBC reported that downloads of some apps that were not affected, such as ByteDance-owned Lemon8, Yope, and Discord, surged in the days after the law was implemented.Downloads of VPNs, which hide users' locations to bypass country-specific restrictions, increased before the ban. Downloads have now fallen back to normal and social media platforms are expected to detect VPNs as part of the law.However, the Australian government caught on. Lemon8 has since complied with age restriction requirements after self-assessing that it should be included in the ban, according to The West Australian. The Australian government also asked Yope to self-assess whether it should do so.Tech firms push back While the tech firms are complying, they're urging the Australian government to reconsider. Meta said in January that it blocked over 500,000 under-16 accounts in Australia, but added that age verification needs to extend to the app store. It said that teens use over 40 apps a week, including many are not under the scope of the ban, arguing this means they can still be exposed to harmful content. The tech giant previously warned that the ban would cut off teens from friends and community. Reddit, another banned platform, has taken it further and launched a legal challenge against the Australian government, saying the ban is inefficient and curtails young people's freedom of speech. Reddit previously said in a statement to CNBC that the law could isolate teens \"from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions).\"\"The political views of children inform the electoral choices of many current electors, including their parents and their teachers, as well as others interested in the views of those soon to reach the age of maturity,\" Reddit added. Where next? Australia was the first country to implement such a sweeping social media ban for under-16s as concerns about the negative impacts of platforms have escalated. Now, others might follow suit.Australia blocked teens from using social media in December in a new regulation.George Chan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThere's particular interest among U.K. politicians. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told MPs on Monday that he's alarmed at childrens' screen time and called for an Australian-style ban. There's also interest in the U.S. In a Fox News poll of over 1,000 registered voters, 64% of respondents favored a social media ban for teens and banning cellphones from K-12 classrooms. Two-thirds of parents also were in favour of the ban, with 36% were opposed.",

    "body": "Signage at the Trip.com Group Ltd. headquarters building in Shanghai, China, on Monday, Aug. 28, 2023. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesShares of Chinese online travel services provider Trip.com plunged 19.23% in Hong Kong on Thursday after Beijing opened an antitrust probe into the company, making it the worst performer in the Hang Seng index.The fall also marks the stock's worst day in Hong Kong since it was listed in April 2021. Shares had closed 17% lower on Wednesday in New York. China's State Administration for Market Regulation late Wednesday said it was investigating Trip.com due to \"suspected abuse of its dominant market position and monopolistic practices,\" according to a CNBC translation of the statement in Mandarin.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconTrip.com is the largest online travel provider in Asia by market cap, and one of the biggest globally. The company has stakes in UK flight aggregator Skyscanner, Indian travel company MakeMyTrip, as well as several Chinese travel providers. Trip.com said in a statement it would \"actively cooperate\" with the investigation, and added its business operations were functioning as usual.The case could have long term ramifications for the company, according to Morningstar senior equity analyst Kai Wang. Wang said that \"multiple local tourism associations have complained that Trip.com is committing the same violations as the other two platforms, where it is forcing local merchants to sign exclusive agreements with the platform.\" Trip.com will then increase commissions from the merchants after these agreements are signed.Citing previous high-profile antitrust cases involving Alibaba and Meituan, as well as past government warnings, Wang said that Trip.com could incur a \"hefty fine.\" SAMR investigated Chinese tech giant in Alibaba in 2021, fining the firm a record 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) after it was found guilty of monopolistic practices. \"This is not the first time Trip.com has run afoul with the government for consumer violations, as the company was fined for forced bundling of value-added services back in 2017. This could also infuriate the government even more given its repeat offender status,\" he added.The probe into Trip.com comes as Chinese tourism is expected to surge this year, with travel marketing and technology firm China Trading Desk estimating that mainland Chinese travelers are expected to take about 165 million to 175 million cross-border trips in 2026, up from an estimated 155 million last year. The Chinese New Year holiday, which sees hundreds of millions of people travel back to their hometowns, will be observed between Feb. 15 and Feb. 23.Travel consultancy firm Dragon Trail International said that in 2025, 501 million Chinese traveled domestically during the Chinese New Year holiday period, a 5.9% year-on-year increase. Tourism spending during the period reached 6.77 billion yuan, a 7% increase. ",

    "body": "Sutthichai Supapornpasupad | Moment | Getty ImagesAs consumers contend with higher auto payments, new data from car website Edmunds suggests they may be falling into a cycle of negative equity — where their outstanding auto loan balances are higher than the value of their cars.In the fourth quarter of 2025, 29.3% of trade-ins toward new car purchases were \"underwater,\" or had negative equity, according to Edmunds. That is the highest share since the first quarter of 2021, when 31.9% of trade-ins had negative equity, according to the data.The average amount owed on trade-ins with negative equity rose to $7,214 — an all-time high, according to Edmunds. More than one-quarter of trade-ins had more than $10,000 in negative equity — also a record high.Drivers trading in a car with negative equity typically need to come up with cash to pay that balance, or roll the debt into their new loan.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageOver 800,000 student loan borrowers in backlog for forgiveness, repayment plansUnderwater car trade-ins are on the rise — and drivers owe a record amountThis IRS deadline is a 'chance to catch up' on your 2025 taxes, expert saysWorkers have $2.75 billion saved in state-run retirement accounts — what to knowMore Americans expect to miss a debt payment: What that does to your credit scoreStudent loan borrowers in default may miss Trump's 'largest tax refund season'IRS could see modest budget cut as Congress proposes funding plansAs enhanced ACA subsidies lapse, millions poised to drop health insuranceBigger tax refunds are coming for 2026 — what it could mean for the economyHere's the inflation breakdown for December 2025 — in one chartMore drivers have $1,000-plus car loan payments.

How drivers end up underwater on car loansExperts say cars that are underwater trade-ins today were likely purchased when pandemic-era chip shortages made it more likely that consumers were paying above the manufacturer's suggested retail price, or MSRP. Meanwhile, a shortage of lease options at that time may have prompted consumers to purchase new cars instead, and face high loan balances if they opt to trade them in.Today's car buyers are more likely to get deals closer to MSRP.\"There's some hope in the sense that people are going to get better deals going forward for 2026 on their new car purchase,\" said Ivan Drury, director of insights at Edmunds.\"But the problem is that for the vehicle in their driveway, a lot of vehicles are losing value,\" Drury said.Consumers may otherwise end up underwater on their car loans — even if they have been making payments for years — for a variety of reasons, according to Drury. Those can include getting a higher annual percentage rate on a loan, opting for a longer loan term length or buying a vehicle with a bad resale value.Having negative equity in a car is not only expensive, but it can also become a cycle that's difficult to break.Buyers with negative equity financed $11,453 more on average than other new vehicle buyers, according to Edmunds' data.watch nowBuyers who rolled negative equity in their new loans had an average monthly payment of $916 in the fourth quarter — a record high — versus the $772 average industry monthly payment, according to Edmunds.To lower those monthly payments, car buyers with negative equity may opt to stretch the length of their loans. About 40.7% of new car purchases with negative equity were financed with 84-month loans, Edmunds' data shows. But doing so continues the risk of being underwater, since early payments mostly cover interest, and you aren't making much headway on the principal.What to do if you have negative equity in your carIf you are underwater on your car loan, you first want to try to keep your car for longer, if possible, said Bruce McClary, senior vice president at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling.Even if you start out owing more on the car than it's worth, after years of payments, depreciation on your car will slow and you may be able to reach a point where your loan balance drops below the vehicle's value, McClary said.It also helps to pay more than the minimum monthly payment or to make extra payments if you can, though not everyone may be able to do that, he said.If you do trade in your current car for a new one, try to avoid a rollover offer, where the unpaid balance on your old car goes into the new car loan, McClary said — it can spike your new monthly payment.\"That just cuts further into the amount of available money that you have in your budget each month,\" he said. Instead, try to sell your old car on your own rather than trading it in at the dealer, McClary said. Often, you can get more for your car through a private sale, which can help you pay off more of your loan, he said.Be sure to consider all of your options when selling your car, Drury said, as one dealership that needs the vehicle may offer to pay more. \"Shop it around,\" Drury said — especially if it's just a smaller difference, like $1,500, between positive and negative equity on your trade-in.If you have negative equity, your car dealer may suggest you purchase guaranteed asset protection, or GAP, insurance to cover the difference between your total auto loan and your car's value. If you do decide to purchase GAP insurance, shop around for the best rates, McClary said. Oftentimes, you can purchase GAP insurance through your existing auto insurance provider at a \"significantly more affordable\" price than if you went through an auto dealer, according to McClary. Buyers' financing options may be limited — or possibly even denied by a bank altogether — based on their loan-to-value ratio between the car they currently have and the one they aspire to buy, Drury said.As the vehicles traded in with negative equity are trending older, it may be time to rethink your ownership cycle, particularly if you're signing up for longer loans each time, he said.If you've made it a habit of trading your car when your equity is negative and it's your second or third time doing so, you may want to consider leasing instead, Drury said.",

    "body": "watch nowOil prices fell more than 4% on Thursday, after comments from U.S. President Donald Trump eased market speculation that an American strike on Iran could be imminent. Brent crude oil futures, the global benchmark, lost 4.13%, or $2.75, to $63.77 a barrel. Front-month West Texas Intermediate crude lost $2.65, or 4.27%, to trade at $59.37 a barrel.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Trump said he had been informed by \"very important sources\" in Iran that \"the killing has stopped.\"\"There's no plans for executions, I've been told that on good authority,\" he said, adding that the White House would watch how the situation unfolds. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed after mass unrest in Iran was met with a violent crackdown by the Islamic Republic's security forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if civilians are killed or executed by the state. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBrent crude priceOil prices jumped on Tuesday after Trump canceled meetings with Iranian officials and promised protesters that \"help is on its way,\" and extended gains on Wednesday amid mounting concerns that a U.S. strike on the country was looming. Those fears were fueled by a report from news agency Reuters that some personnel had been directed to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening. The BBC also reported that some British personnel were being moved out of the base. On Tuesday, the U.S. government issued an advisory to American citizens to leave Iran by land to Armenia or Turkey. \"Leave Iran now. Have a plan for departing Iran that does not rely on U.S. government help,\" the U.S. Virtual Embassy in Iran said. \"If you cannot leave, find a secure location within your residence or another safe building. Have a supply of food, water, medications, and other essential items.\"In a note on Thursday morning, Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said Trump's comments about the killing in Iran stopping had been taken by markets as \"a signal that the U.S. might hold off on a potential military response.\"\"[But] there's clearly lingering caution, not least given the unexpected timing of U.S. strikes on Iran in June 2025,\" he noted. \"Brent crude is still clearly above its lows below $60/bbl last week, but Trump's comments had a clear impact.\"\"Bear in mind as well that Iran is a more significant oil producer than Venezuela, producing 4% of the world's total in 2023, so developments there have the potential for wider spillovers in the oil market,\" Reid added.",

    "body": "Starbucks Workers United demonstrates outside of the Empire State Building as the union's strike enters its third week.CNBC | Amelia LucasNEW YORK — Starbucks Workers United held a rally outside the Empire State Building on Thursday as its open-ended strike entered its third week and no signs of an impending resolution.Adding to the crunch of holiday shoppers and tourists, several hundred picketers gathered outside of the famous landmark, which is also the site of a swanky three-floor Starbucks Reserve location and the company's regional headquarters. Members of other unions, like the AFL-CIO and Service Employees International Union, which is affiliated with Workers United, protested alongside baristas, chanting \"No coffee, no contract\" and \"What's disgusting? Union busting\" between speakers.\"Their fight is a fight really for all of us, to workers across the country, to corporations like Starbucks, across the country that workers are fed up with the status quo, and they're not going to take it anymore,\" SEIU President April Verrett told CNBC.Twelve demonstrators were arrested for blocking the building's entrance.Baristas launched the strike on Starbucks Red Cup Day last month, seeking new proposals from the company that address its top issues to finalize a contract. Those include improved hours, higher wages and the resolution of hundreds of unfair labor practice charges levied against Starbucks. Out of the 145 locations involved in the strike, 55 remain closed, according to a company spokesperson. The two parties have not been in active negotiations to reach a contract after talks between them fell apart late last year. The strikes have not changed that fact so far.While the strike has injected uncertainty into Starbucks' busy holiday season, the company has said its sales haven't been affected. CEO Brian Niccol told employees that Red Cup Day was its strongest in history. A successful holiday season will be key to the chain's turnaround under Niccol. Starbucks broke a nearly two-year streak of same-store sales declines in its most recently reported quarter. Past strikes have impacted less than 1% of its stores, the company said.The New York City rally comes after the company paid $38.9 million to settle violations of the city's Fair Workweek Law. Other large restaurant employers, like Chipotle, have previously run afoul of the law, which Starbucks said is \"notoriously challenging\" to navigate.The city's Department of Consumer and Worker Protection found Starbucks committed half a million violations of the law since 2021. The Fair Workweek law requires regular scheduling week to week, mandates schedules be provided 14 days in advance and says hours cannot be reduced by more than 15% without legitimate business reasons. DCWP Commissioner Vilda Vera Mayuga, who spoke at Thursday's rally, said the timing of the record-breaking settlement with the ongoing strike was coincidental.\"While the NYC laws remain unchanged and complex, our focus hasn't shifted – we're committed to creating the best job in retail and to ensuring our practices follow all laws,\" Starbucks said in a statement.The city's current Mayor Eric Adams and Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have rallied behind striking workers. Mamdani joined Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., alongside baristas in Brooklyn earlier this week.Both Starbucks and the union have pointed blame at the other for failing to reach a bargaining agreement and maintain they are ready to speak when the other is. The two parties entered into mediation in February, and hundreds of barista delegates voted down the economic package Starbucks proposed in April. The company has said it is investing $500 million to improve the employee experience as part of its \"Back to Starbucks\" strategy. That investment includes upgrading its scheduling technology and adding more baristas to rosters. \"As we've said, 99% of our 17,000 U.S. locations remain open and welcoming customers —including many the union publicly stated would strike but never closed or have since reopened. Regardless of the union's plans, we do not anticipate any meaningful disruption. When the union is ready to return to the bargaining table, we're ready to talk,\" spokesperson Jaci Anderson said in a statement.",

Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesShares of Moore Threads, a Beijing-based graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer often referred to as \"China's Nvidia,\" soared by more than 400% on its debut in Shanghai following its $1.1 billion listing.The stock is currently trading at 584.98 yuan, over five times its IPO price of 114.28 yuan.Moore Threads' IPO was led by CITIC Securities, which served as the lead underwriter for the offering. The joint book runners on the deal were BOC International Securities, China Merchants Securities, and GF Securities.The company, which is not yet profitable, said in its listing that the IPO proceeds are needed to accelerate several core research and development initiatives, including new-generation self-developed AI training and inference GPU chips. A portion of the funds will also be used to supplement working capital.Moore Thread's successful IPO comes despite it being placed under U.S. sanctions in 2023, which limited its access to advanced chip manufacturing processes and foundries.The firm is representative of a growing cast of Chinese companies developing AI processors amid Beijing's efforts to reduce reliance on American chip designer Nvidia.Other companies in the space include tech giants like Huawei, as well as more specialized players like Cambricon — a firm whose shares on the Shanghai exchange have surged more than 100% year to date.Washington has maintained varying export restrictions on Nvidia for years, preventing it from selling its most advanced AI chips to China. More recently, Beijing has also stepped in to block imports of Nvidia's chips as it tries to encourage domestic alternatives like Moore Threads.Newer players like Enflame Technology and Biren Technology have also entered the space, aiming to capture a share of the billions in GPU demand no longer served by Nvidia. Chinese regulators have also been clearing more semiconductor IPOs in their drive for greater AI independence.This is a developing story, please refresh for updates.",

The company, which provides online loans and other banking services, said in a press release that it will use the proceeds for \"general corporate purposes, including but not limited to enhancing capital position, increasing optionality and enabling further efficiency of capital management, and funding incremental growth and business opportunities.\"The announced offering comes after SoFi's market cap almost doubled so far in 2025. The stock price is up more than sixfold since the end of 2022. A company's share price often drops on a planned share sale as the offering dilutes the value of existing holders' stakes. In its third-quarter earnings release in late October, SoFi reported revenue growth of 38% from a year earlier to $961.6 million, while net income more than doubled to $139.4 million.

    "body": "The New York Times building is seen on September 16, 2025 in New York City. Michael M. Santiago | Getty ImagesThe New York Times on Thursday filed a lawsuit challenging new restrictions on reporters who cover the Pentagon, which the newspaper says violate the U.S Constitution's free press protections.The suit against the Defense Department and Secretary Pete Hegseth comes nearly two months after reporters from The Times and other mainstream news outlets, including CBS, CNN, Fox News, and NBC staged a dramatic walkout of the Pentagon and surrendered their credentials after refusing to comply with the rules. Those outlets have been replaced by reporters who are broadly sympathetic to the Trump administration.The Pentagon in October presented reporters who had desks there a 21-page rulebook that bars journalists from seeking or publishing information that has not been explicitly authorized by the Defense Department, even if the material is unclassified or obtained off Pentagon grounds.Outlets that refused to abide by the rules lost their Pentagon credentials.The Times' lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., asks a judge to block the Pentagon from enforcing the policy, and to declare it unconstitutional. \"The policy, in violation of the First Amendment, seeks to restrict journalists' ability to do what journalists have always done — ask questions of government employees and gather information to report stories that take the public beyond official pronouncements,\" the suit says.The rules \"deprive the public of vital information about the United States military and its leadership,\" the suit says.The complaint also says that the Defense Department gave itself \"unbridled discretion\" to enforce the rules as it sees fit.Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell, who is named as a defendant in the suit, told CNBC that the Defense Department \"is aware of the New York Times lawsuit and [looks] forward to addressing these arguments in court.\" The Times did immediately return a request for comment.The Pentagon's media rules were the latest step in Hegseth's broader push to reshape the press corps. Since arriving at the department in January after a contentious confirmation fight, Hegseth has stripped several national outlets of in-house workspaces, tightened rules on where reporters can move inside the building, and reassigned offices to conservative outlets and pro-Trump media figures willing to sign the agreement.Press-freedom advocates, including the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, say the Pentagon policy goes beyond past fights over individual White House press badges. Rather than targeting one reporter at a time, they argue, the rules bind the entire press corps — giving the Pentagon broad authority to revoke access based on the stories they pursue.\"The Pentagon's press access policy is unlawful because it gives government officials unchecked power over who gets a credential and who doesn't, something the First Amendment prohibits,\" Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Vice President of Policy Gabe Rottman said in a statement Thursday, after the Times filed its suit.",

Jennifer Newstead, Meta's chief legal officer, will become Apple's new general counsel in March, and Jackson's government affairs staff will report to her starting late next year, Apple said. The two executives, who both reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook, are the latest members of senior leadership to exit the company. In recent weeks, Apple's head software designer said he was leaving to join Meta, while Apple said its AI chief was retiring, along with its chief operating officer.Adams joined Apple from Honeywell and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company's privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store's restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company's diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Before that, she spent four years as administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. With her emphasis in areas like social justice and renewable energies, Jackson's job lost relevance during the second Trump administration, which has publicly denounced diversity, equity and inclusion programs and slammed efforts to combat climate change. Apple has faced increased tariffs from the Trump administration, and Cook has met with President Donald Trump several times to tout the company's American manufacturing plans as part of an effort to influence policy. Jackson was instrumental in Apple's launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company's equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report published in 2023.\"At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,\" Jackson wrote in a section of that report. \"We won't delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.\"Jackson also worked on Apple's environmental image. Her job \"focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,\" according to her bio on the company's website. She discussed Apple's plans to become carbon neutral at iPhone launch events.Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners.

Tasos Katopodis | Getty ImagesNewstead, who will become Apple's top lawyer, has overseen Meta's legal and regulatory matters pertaining to its family of apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp since 2019. A Meta spokesperson said Newstead will be staying through the end of the year and that the company is actively searching for her replacement.Prior to Meta, Newstead served as a Trump-appointed legal advisor at the State Department during the president's first administration in 2019.  Before that, she was a partner at Davis Polk & Wardwell and a general counsel of the White House Office of Management and Budget, among other roles in the U.S. government.CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this story.WATCH: Apple AI chief steps downwatch now",

    "body": "U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. looks on as he attends a press conference to discuss health insurance reform, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 23, 2025.Kevin Mohatt | ReutersHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s hand-picked vaccine committee on Thursday deferred crucial votes on hepatitis B vaccines for babies until Friday, saying it will give members more time to review proposed language on the measure. One panel member, Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at the Dartmouth Geisel School of Medicine, brought a motion to defer the votes following confusion amongst the group about the language. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currently recommends that every baby get vaccinated against hepatitis B within 24 hours of birth. It's unclear if the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, could significantly delay or eliminate a so-called birth dose of the shot for babies whose mothers test negative for the virus. The group tabled a vote on the vaccine in September because some members called for a more robust discussion first.But any change could have wide-ranging consequences: Some public health experts say that having fewer newborns vaccinated against the virus could risk an increase in chronic infections among children. Hepatitis B, which can be passed from mother to baby during childbirth, can lead to liver disease and early death. There is no cure. \"We have a vaccine that is highly effective at preventing an incurable disease. We should take full advantage of that,\" Neil Maniar, a public health professor at Northeastern University, told CNBC. The birth dose recommendation was introduced in 1991 and is credited with driving down infections in kids by 99% since then. Maniar called that a \"remarkable success story that we run the risk of reversing\" if the committee changes the recommendation. Decisions by the panel are not legally binding, as it is up to states to mandate immunizations. But ACIP's recommendations have significant implications for whether private insurance plans and government assistance programs cover the vaccines at no cost for eligible children. The panel's upcoming two-day meeting in Atlanta comes after Kennedy earlier this year gutted the committee and appointed 12 new members, including some well-known vaccine critics. During the meeting in September, some advisors raised questions about whether the benefits of the shot outweigh potential safety risks. But the jab is \"an incredibly safe vaccine with minimal risks,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"I never once saw a fever actually associated with hepatitis B vaccine,\" said O'Leary, who practiced for eight years as a general pediatrician and worked in a newborn nursery. The AAP, which publishes its own vaccine schedule, still recommends the universal birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine because \"it saves lives,\" he added. A new review, published Tuesday, of more than 400 studies spanning four decades also found no evidence that delaying the universal hepatitis B vaccine birth dose improves safety or effectiveness. The review also found that the birth dose does not cause any short- or long-term serious adverse events or deaths.A 2024 CDC study showed that the current vaccination schedule has helped prevent more than 6 million hepatitis B infections and nearly 1 million hepatitis B-related hospitalizations.Merck and GSK manufacture the hepatitis B vaccines used starting at birth. Neither of the shots are significant revenue drivers for the companies. But John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive and military pharmacist, said a change to the recommendation could cause vaccine supply disruptions for the companies. \"They have build up their reserves, and they build up their thorough calculations so that they can meet the status quo,\" Grabenstein, who has no remaining financial ties to Merck, told CNBC. \"If you disrupt the status quo without warning, then there would be too much of some things and not enough of other things that could easily create spot shortages.\" Still, he said his first concern from a public health standpoint is that fewer children will get vaccinated on time, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Merck during the panel's September meeting also pushed back on changing the recommendation. \"The reconsideration of the newborn Hepatitis B vaccination on the established schedule poses a grave risk to the health of children and to the public, which could lead to a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases,\" Dr. Richard Haupt, Merck's head of global medical and scientific affairs for vaccines and infectious diseases, said at the time. ",

    "body": "A sign at a NYS Department Of Labor job fair at the Downtown Central Library in Buffalo, New York, US, on Wednesday, Aug. 27, 2025.Lauren Petracca | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAnnounced job cuts from U.S. employers moved further ahead of 1 million for the year in November as corporate restructuring, artificial intelligence and tariffs have helped pare job rolls, consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reported Thursday.The firm said layoff plans totaled 71,321 in November, a step down from the massive cuts announced in October but still enough to bring the 2025 total up to 1.17 million. That total is 54% higher than the same 11-month period a year ago and the highest level since 2020, when the Covid pandemic rocked the global economy.In November, Verizon's announcement that it would slash more than 13,000 jobs helped drive the total. Tech companies, driven by innovations in artificial intelligence, listed 12,377 reductions, pushing the sector's 2025 total up 17% from a year ago. AI itself has been cited for 54,694 layoffs this year.Tariffs were cited as the driver of more than 2,000 cuts in November and nearly 8,000 year to date. The most-cited reason for the month was restructuring, followed by closings and market or economic conditions.\"Layoff plans fell last month, certainly a positive sign. That said, job cuts in November have risen above 70,000 only twice since 2008: in 2022 and in 2008,\" said Andy Challenger, workplace expert and chief revenue officer at Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Challenger also pointed out that since the financial crisis in 2008, companies have shifted away from end-year layoff announcements.\"It was the trend to announce layoff plans toward the end of the year, to align with most companies' fiscal year-ends. It became unpopular after the Great Recession especially, and best practice dictated layoff plans would occur at times other than the holidays,\" said Challenger.November offered some relief from the more than 153,000 cuts announced in October, which was the highest total for the month in 22 years.The numbers come with concerns rising over the state of the U.S. labor market.ADP reported Wednesday that private employers cut 32,000 jobs in November, the biggest decline in more than 2½ years.Hiring prospects have been dim this year as well, according to the Challenger report. Employers have announced 497,151 planned hires, off 35% from the same point in 2024.Despite signs of weakness elsewhere, Labor Department data has yet to reflect a surge in layoffs. The department on Thursday reported that weekly jobless claims unexpectedly tumbled to 191,000, the lowest in more than three years. Official data showed the decline of some 27,000 from the prior week was driven by unusually large drops in California and Texas and likely was influenced by the Thanksgiving holiday.",

    "body": "The FBI on Thursday morning arrested a suspect accused of planting pipe bombs outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington, D.C., prior to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, the Trump administration said.The suspect, Brian Cole Jr., a 30-year-old resident of Woodbridge, Virginia, is charged with \"use of an explosive device,\" U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said at a press briefing Thursday afternoon.The investigation is ongoing and more charges could be filed, Bondi noted, adding that search warrants are currently being executed.A criminal complaint unsealed after the briefing shows Cole facing a charge of transporting an explosive device in interstate commerce with intent to kill, injure or intimidate or unlawfully destroy property. Cole is also charged with \"malicious destruction or attempted malicious destruction by means of fire and explosive materials.\"A surveillance photo released by the FBI shows a person in Washington, U.S., January 6, 2021. The FBI issued a notice, which features this surveillance photo, requesting information on person(s) responsible for pipe bombs left at the Republican National Committee (RNC) and Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters.FBI | ReutersThe arrest is a massive breakthrough in the nearly five-year federal investigation into who placed the bombs, which did not detonate. The devices were planted on the evening of Jan. 5 and discovered around 1 p.m. ET the next day.\"An individual who is now alleged to have placed multiple explosive devices to blow up multiple people and multiple officials [and] innocent civilians is now arrested,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said at the press briefing.MS NOW, which reported the arrest earlier Thursday morning, said police have not yet determined a motive, citing a law enforcement official.But two people briefed on the arrest told MS NOW that the suspect has been linked to statements that show support for an anarchist ideology.Bondi, asked about Cole's motivations at the briefing, would only say that the DOJ's probe is ongoing.Prince William County Police block the street near the house where the FBI made an arrest, in Woodbridge, Va., Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025.Steve Helber | APCole is described as a five-foot-six-inch-tall man who \"wears corrective eyeglasses,\" an unnamed FBI special agent wrote in an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint.He lives with his mother and other family members and \"works in the office of a bail bondsman in northern Virginia,\" the agent wrote.In 2019 and 2020, Cole allegedly bought items that matched the components used to manufacture the pipe bombs, the FBI discovered after obtaining records for his checking account and three of his six credit cards.The agent said those items included: one-inch-by-eight-inch galvanized pipes; black and galvanized \"end caps,\" which were used to seal the pipes; nine-volt battery connectors; white kitchen timers; and 14-gauge red and black electrical wire.The FBI also obtained phone records that showed Cole's cellphone in the area near the Democratic and Republican National Committee buildings on Jan. 5, 2021, according to the affidavit.The same evening, Cole's 2017 Nissan Sentra was observed driving past a license plate reader in D.C. less than half a mile from the spot where the suspect was first observed on foot, the special agent wrote.FBI Director Kash Patel speaks during a news conference on the January 6th pipe bomber at the Department of Justice on December 4, 2025 in Washington, DC.Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesThe discoveries that led to the arrest did not come from new evidence, but rather from the same trove of material that had mostly been gathered in 2021 and 2022, two sources told MS NOW.That means the suspect could feasibly have been arrested years earlier — a fact that could cause embarrassment for the FBI, those sources said.Patel, at Thursday's presser, touted that the FBI under his leadership \"did not discover any new information.\"The agency instead \"reexamined every piece of evidence, sifted through all the data,\" Patel said, claiming that was \"something that the prior administration refused and failed to do.\"As recently as late October, the bureau was offering a $500,000 reward for information that would help authorities identify the Capitol Hill bombing suspect.A suspect in the planting of explosive devices near the Democratic and Republican committee headquarters in Washington is seen walking past the Capitol Hill Club, also known as the National Republican Club of Capitol Hill, in Washington in this still frame taken from video released on March 9, 2021.

Trump, in one of his first acts after retaking the White House in January, pardoned the vast majority of them.When NBC News asked the White House how the administration reconciles its efforts to arrest Cole with Trump's mass pardons for others who committed crimes — some violent in nature — on Jan. 6, a spokesperson called the comparison \"alarming and insulting.\"A poster is displayed during a press conference with Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel about the January 6th pipe bomber at the Department of Justice on December 4, 2025 in Washington, DC.

    "body": "A general view of the Microsoft office building is seen in Cologne, Germany, on November 18, 2025.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesMicrosoft said Thursday that it will increase the prices of Office productivity software subscriptions for commercial and government clients on July 1.The company's Office applications, which include Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, have been facing increased competition in recent years from Google. \"We are continuously investing and innovating our platform for the future,\" Nicole Herskowitz, corporate vice president for Microsoft 365 and Copilot, wrote in a blog post. \"In the last year, we released more than 1,100 features across Microsoft 365, Security, Copilot, and SharePoint.\" The new features have added value to the suites, she wrote.Price hikes for commercial Office subscriptions have been infrequent. In 2022, Microsoft raised prices of its productivity bundles for the first time since launching the original Office 365 subscriptions in 2011. Microsoft changed the name of Office 365 to Microsoft 365 in 2020. In January, Microsoft announced a price hike for consumer Office bundles.Microsoft offers Office 365 subscriptions for commercial use that include access to its productivity applications, along with higher-priced Microsoft 365 subscriptions that also include Windows operating system updates.Here's a breakdown of the commercial price changes:For small and medium-sized businesses, Microsoft 365 Business Basic will cost $7 per person per month, up from $6.Microsoft 365 Business Standard will be available for $14, up from $12.50.Microsoft 365 Business Premium will continue to cost $22.The entry-level Office 365 E1 offering for enterprises will still be sold for $10.Office 365 E3 will jump 13% to $26 from $23.The Microsoft 365 E3 package including Windows for enterprises will rise 8% to $39 from $36.The full-featured Microsoft 365 E5 will increase to $60 from $57.For front-line workers such as cashiers, Microsoft 365 F1 subscriptions will cost $3, up from $2.25.Microsoft 365 F3 will be available for $10, up from $8.The U.S. Defense Department and other government clients will face similar percentage price increases.The various subscriptions all exclude access to the $30 Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on that draws on generative artificial intelligence models. Some companies have started widely rolling out Copilot, while others have held off on expanding their deployments, CNBC reported last week.In many cases, organizations receive discounts off of list prices, but Microsoft has cut back on direct volume deals for some types of customers.Almost 43% of Microsoft's $77.7 billion in fiscal first-quarter revenue came from its Productivity and Businesses Processes segment, which includes Office. In October, the company said revenue from Microsoft 365 commercial cloud services jumped 17%, while seats increased 6%, mainly from products targeting small and medium-sized businesses and front-line workers.WATCH: Microsoft sees 'huge' challenge and great opportunity as global economy enters a new phase, president sayswatch now",

Mustafa Yalcin | Anadolu | Getty ImagesBeta Technologies posted its first quarterly results on Thursday since the stock debuted on the New York Stock Exchange.The electric aircraft maker, which went public last month, reported revenue of $8.9 million, more than double the $3.1 million from a year ago.\"As a newly public company, we remain firmly grounded in what makes BETA unique—our simple, stepwise approach, our vertical integration and our focus on designing and manufacturing the complete electric aviation ecosystem to meet the needs of customers around the world,\" CEO Kyle Clark said in a statement.Net loss widened to $452 million, a loss of $9.83 per share, from a loss of $82.1 million, a loss of $1.81 per share, in the year-ago period.The company said the net loss took a hit from the issuance of convertible preferred stock.Beta forecasted full-year revenue to reach between $29 million and $33 million and adjusted EBITDA to range between a loss of $295 million and a loss of $325 million.The Amazon-backed company is establishing itself as another player alongside rivals Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation in the small but competitive electric vertical take-off and landing, or eVTOL, space.Air taxi manufacturers are vying to gain approval from the Federal Aviation Administration, which launched the eVTOL Integration Pilot Program, or eIPP, in September.Read more CNBC tech newsNvidia has a cash problem -- too much of itMeta faces Europe antitrust investigation over WhatsApp AI policyNvidia CEO Jensen Huang talks chip restrictions with Trump, blasts state-by-state AI regulationsDesign executive behind 'Liquid Glass' is leaving AppleClark told CNBC that the program is a \"massive testament\" to the Trump administration's efforts in accelerating the nascent industry. Beta is applying to the program with state partners, including North Carolina, Michigan and Ohio, to host its commercial aircraft operations as soon as next June.\"We have flown more than twice as many miles than anybody else in this industry,\" Clark said. \"That real-world flying gives us the ability to go into these eIPP opportunities with a mature type of certification product with a ton of reliability.\"The company is currently working on military and cargo operations before focusing on passenger applications. During the quarter, aircraft engine supplier GE Aerospace agreed to invest $300 million in Beta and co-develop a hybrid electric turbogenerator for both defense and civil use.\"The eIPP program is meant to augment America's drone dominance and that is a military interest as well as a civil interest,\" Clark said. \"Partnership with dual-use aircraft like ours, with the military and civil applications, is a big part of this.\"The company also worked with Hartzell Propeller to land certification during the quarter, becoming the first FAA-certified propeller specifically designed for advanced air mobility aircraft. The achievement marks another step closer to obtaining Type Certification, or approval of aircraft design, for Beta's H500A electric engine.\"To take something as big and new as a primary propulsion electric motor that other people are buying, that we're using in our own aircraft — we're flying all over the world in — and be in the final steps to Type Certification is a huge validation point,\" Clark said. Beta announced earlier this week an up to supply deal with air taxi company Eve Air Mobility.Eve agreed to purchase Beta's electric pusher motors, which could potentially equate to as much as $1 billion over 10 years. Clark said during an earnings call that the deal contributed to a component backlog of over $1 billion.",

    "body": "Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., during the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) sports day event in Hsinchu, Taiwan, on Saturday, Nov. 8, 2025.Lam Yik Fei | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWhen Nvidia this week said it would take a $2 billion stake in chip design company Synopsys, it was just the latest in a string of massive investments announced by the chipmaker this year. Nvidia has also said it would take a $1 billion stake in Nokia, invest $5 billion in Intel and $10 billion in Anthropic — $18 billion in investment commitments from those four deals, not counting smaller venture capital investments.That doesn't even include the biggest commitment of all: $100 billion to buy OpenAI shares over a number of years, although there is still no definitive agreement, Nvidia finance chief Colette Kress said Tuesday at the UBS Global Technology and AI conference. It's a lot of money and a lot of deals, but Nvidia's got the cash to write big checks. At the end of October, Nvidia had $60.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. That's up from $13.3 billion in January 2023, just after OpenAI released ChatGPT. That launch three years ago was key to making Nvidia's chips the most valuable tech product.As Nvidia has transformed from a maker of gaming technology into the most valuable U.S. company, its balance sheet has become a fortress, and investors are increasingly wondering what the company will do with its cash. \"No company has grown at the scale that we're talking about,\" said CEO Jensen Huang, when asked what the chipmaker plans to do with all its cash, on Nvidia's earnings call last month.Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to generate $96.85 billion in free cash flow this year alone and $576 billion in free cash flow over the next three years. Some analysts would like to see Nvidia spend more of its cash on share repurchases. \"Nvidia is set to generate over $600B in free cash flow over the next few years and it should have a lot left over for opportunistic buybacks,\" wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes in a note on Monday.The company's board increased its share repurchase authorization in August, adding $60 billion to its total. In the first three quarters of the year, it spent $37 billion on share repurchases and dividends.\"We're going to continue to do stock buybacks,\" Huang said. Nvidia is doing the buybacks, but it's not stopping there. Huang said that Nvidia's balance sheet strength gives its customers and suppliers confidence that orders in the future, which he called offtake, will be filled. \"Our reputation and our credibility is incredible,\" Huang said. \"It takes a really strong balance sheet to do that, to support the level of growth and the rate of growth and the magnitude associated with that.\"Kress, Nvidia's CFO, on Tuesday said the company's \"largest focus\" is making sure it has enough cash to deliver its next-generation products on time. Most of Nvidia's largest suppliers are equipment manufacturers like Foxconn and Dell, which can require that Nvidia provide working capital to manage inventory and build additional manufacturing capacity. Huang called his company's strategic investments \"really important work\" and said that if companies like OpenAI grow, it drives additional consumption of AI and Nvidia's chips. Nvidia has said that it does not require any of its investments to use its products, but they all do anyway. \"All of the investments that we've done so far — all of it, period — is associated with expanding the reach of Cuda, expanding the ecosystem,\" Huang said, referring to the company's artificial intelligence software.In an October filing, Nvidia said it had has already made $8.2 billion in investments in private companies. For Nvidia, those investments have replaced acquisitions. Nvidia's $7 billion acquisition of Mellanox in 2020 is the largest the company has ever made, and it laid the groundwork for its current AI products, which aren't single chips but entire server racks that sell for around an estimated $3 million.But the company faced regulatory issues when it tried to buy chip technology firm Arm for $40 billion in 2020. Nvidia called off the deal before it could be completed after regulators in the U.S. and U.K. raised concerns about its effects on competition in the chip industry. Nvidia has purchased some smaller companies in recent years, to bolster its engineering teams, but it hasn't completed a multibillion acquisition since the Arm deal failed.\"It's hard to think about very significant, large types of M&A,\" Kress this week said, speaking at an investor conference. \"I wish one would come available, but it's not going to be very easy to do so.\"WATCH: Nvidia CEO says he supports export controls ahead of Senate Banking Committee meetingwatch now",

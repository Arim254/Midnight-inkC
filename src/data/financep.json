    "body": "Jason Kim, chief executive officer of Firefly Aerospace, center, during the company's initial public offering at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, US, on Thursday, Aug. 7, 2025. Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesFirefly Aerospace's stock surged 15% on Wednesday after the space technology company issued better-than-expected third-quarter results and lifted its guidance.Revenues in the third quarter jumped nearly 38% to $30.8 million from $22.4 million in the year-ago period and nearly doubled from the previous quarter.Firefly's net loss totaled $140.4 million, or $1.50 per share. The company said net loss included costs tied to its IPO, foreign exchange and executive severanceThe company also lifted its outlook for the year, saying it now expects revenues to range between $150 million and $158 million. That's up from previous guidance in the range of $133 million and $145 million.This is Firefly's second quarterly report as a public company. Last quarter, shares slumped after it posted a bigger loss and lower revenues than analysts were expecting. The Cedar Park, Texas, company went public on the Nasdaq in August during a period of heightened enthusiasm toward space technology. The U.S. government and NASA have leaned on more contracts with companies like Firefly and Elon Musk's SpaceX to support moon missions.But shares of Firefly have lost 70% of their value since their opening day close, and the company's market capitalization has plummeted from about $8.5 billion to about $2.7 billion on Wednesday.In September, Firefly shares sank after a rocket exploded during a ground test at the company's Texas facility, days after receiving clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration over a separate incident. Firefly has since put \"corrective measures\" in place, the company said on Wednesday. Shares dropped 35% in September and are down 24% this month.Firefly in July won a nearly $177 million contract with NASA for an upcoming moon mission, and in October, it announced its acquisition of defense tech firm SciTec to boost its national security portfolio.",

    "body": "For weeks now, it seems like every few days another major company announces a layoff impacting hundreds, if not thousands, of its employees.These big cuts get a lot of attention, but under the surface another problem is brewing: Smaller-scale firings of less than 50 people are now the most common type of layoff throughout the year, making up 51% of WARN Act notices in 2025 compared with just 38% in 2015.Translation: The \"forever layoff\" is here, according to Glassdoor's latest report on 2026 work trends.These smaller but more regular firings could continue to stoke worker anxiety heading into the next year.Layoffs hit company culture for yearsRolling layoffs could help companies stay out of headlines, researchers note, but \"create cultures of anxiety, insecurity and resentment.\"Previous Glassdoor research found that after a layoff, negative sentiments from remaining employees took more than two years to recover, based on their company ratings. Repeated layoffs have double the impact on employee sentiment right after a second round of cuts, with the biggest drops for key talent, managers and new hires.Another sign of workers' dissatisfaction: Glassdoor ratings of senior leaders have been slipping since the second half of 2023 and are now well below their pandemic peaks.Workers in media and communication; management and consulting; and technology saw the biggest drops in confidence in their leadership. Glassdoor researchers point to AI business disruptions, media consolidations and a return to hustle culture ideals in tech as prime reasons for these declines.Meanwhile, a growing share of users mention words like misalignment, distrust, miscommunication, disconnection and hypocrisy since 2024 in Glassdoor reviews that mention their senior leadership or management.Silver lining for young job-seekersOutside of the layoff forecast, there's good news for some: Wage growth is on the upswing for young workers with up to four years' work experience, giving them more spending power in 2026.New grads have struggled over the last year to jumpstart their careers given the low hiring environment and businesses adopting AI, which has led many to open fewer entry-level roles. But for those who can secure a role, the pay will be better.Young workers in some rising cities will see the biggest difference. Provo, Utah; Boise, Idaho; Orlando, Fla.; Charleston, S.C.; and Austin, Texas are among the locations with the highest wage growth since 2020, according to Glassdoor.\"For early career workers considering where to pursue their next career step, these rising cities represent good opportunities to grow your earnings even though they may not offer the highest salaries,\" Glassdoor researchers wrote.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Department of Transportation late Wednesday froze flight cuts it imposed less than a week ago as air travel disruptions eased across the U.S. ahead of a House vote on a funding bill that could end the longest federal government shutdown in history.The House on Wednesday night cleared a procedural hurdle required before a vote could begin on a funding bill that would keep the government open through January. President Donald Trump would sign the bill on Wednesday, the White House said.On Wednesday, 816 U.S. departures were canceled, 3.5% of airlines' schedule, the lowest rate and number of cancellations since last Thursday, according to aviation data firm Cirium.The shutdown again put air travel in the spotlight and heightened strains on air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without receiving their regularly scheduled paychecks. The DOT said Wednesday night in a statement that there was a \"rapid decline\" in callouts from controllers in the last two days.Read more CNBC airline newsBoeing stems cash burn for first time since 2023 but takes $4.9 billion charge on 777X delaysAmerican Airlines is late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?American Airlines hires industry veteran to lead commercial team as profits trail rivalsTrump administration officials on Friday started requiring airlines to trim their schedules, citing safety risks and additional strain on controllers. The required cancellations rose from 4% of domestic flights at U.S. airports to 6% on Tuesday, blaming increased strain on air traffic controllers. They would have increased to 10% by Friday, but DOT froze the increases on Wednesday night.But the cuts weren't enough to avoid further disruptions that were worsened by widespread staffing shortages and bad weather, leading to an influx of cancellations and delays last weekend.Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said Wednesday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that the shutdown will have a financial impact on the carrier but it wouldn't come close to wiping out the airline's profits. He warned that he thinks there will be another shutdown at some point and said air traffic controllers should be paid if that happens.watch nowU.S. airline shares were up broadly on Wednesday before the House vote.Thin air traffic controller staffing has been on the rise during the shutdown that started Oct. 1, leading to thousands of flights being slowed or altogether canceled and disrupting travel plans of 5 million passengers, according to Airlines for America, an industry group that represents the largest U.S. carriers. Some air traffic controllers were forced to take second jobs to make ends meet, the controllers' union and government officials have said.Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and major airlines this week warned that air travel won't immediately snap back to normal even after the shutdown.\"We're going to wait to see the data on our end before we take out the restrictions in travel but it depends on controllers coming back to work,\" Duffy said at a news conference at Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Tuesday.",

    "body": "watch nowAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said Wednesday he will be leaving his position when his term expires in February.Bostic has been in his current role since June 2017 and is the first Black and openly gay regional president. His term, which also was marked by issues relating to personal investments he made, runs until Feb. 28.\"I'm proud of what we accomplished during my tenure to turn the lofty goal of an economy that works for everyone into more of a reality, and I look forward to discovering new ways to advance that bold vision in my next chapter,\" Bostic said in a statement.The announcement comes ahead of a pivotal year for the Fed and its rate-setting body, the Federal Open Market Committee.Regional presidents serve five-year terms that generally run in sync and are designed to expire on years that end in either 1 or 6, which will be the case next year. While the local boards vote on the presidents, they are subject to approval by the Fed's Board of Governors. Normally a routine process, unusual political dynamics on the board could add a new wrinkle to the procedure.In addition to the reappointments of the regional presidents, Jerome Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, though his run as governor goes until 2028.Bostic has been seen as more of a centrist during his run, though he's been more cautious about cutting interest rates this year during a time of elevated inflation and a softening labor market. He is not an FOMC voter this year. Atlanta next will get a vote in 2027.Powell said Bostic's \"perspective has enriched the Federal Open Market Committee's understanding of our dynamic economy. And his steady voice has exemplified the best of public service — grounded in analysis, informed by experience, and guided by purpose.\"Until the board names a successor, Cheryl Venable, the first vice president and chief operating officer at the Atlanta Fed, will handle the role of president.Bostic's term has not been without controversy.In October 2022, the Fed announced it was looking at trades Bostic made during blackout periods near policy meetings. An internal report showed there were 154 trades made on his behalf during those times. However, the report also indicated there was no evidence Bostic traded on insider information or had personal conflicts.There also were other issues raised regarding financial disclosure terms and an improper level of Treasury holdings.For his part, Bostic expressed regret over the discrepancies and said the trades were executed by third-party managers over whom he did not have control.The controversy was part of a larger issue with investments from Fed officials that triggered tighter internal controls and rules over what types of securities they are permitted to hold.",

Lisa Cook on Jan. 21.Trump said on Aug. 25 that he was firing Cook, one of seven Fed governors, citing claims that she committed mortgage fraud in connection with two residences that she owns.Cook, who denies any wrongdoing, filed a lawsuit seeking to block her removal.A federal district court judge in Washington, D.C., in early September ruled that Cook could not be fired from the board while her suit was pending. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia soon after upheld that ruling, leading Trump to ask the Supreme Court to rule on his power to fire her.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsIn the initial ruling blocking Cook's removal, District Court Judge Jia Cobb wrote, \"Cook has made a strong showing that her purported removal was done in violation of the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision.\"\"The best reading\" of that provision is that legal cause for removing a Fed governor is limited to actions related to their \"behavior in office,\" Cobb wrote.The allegations against Cook relate to conduct that predates her serving on the Fed.Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who is representing the Trump administration in the case, has argued in a filing with the Supreme Court that the president should be allowed to remove her while her suit is pending because she does not have \"a Fifth Amendment property interest in her continued service as a Governor of the Federal Reserve System.\"Sauer also wrote that although the Federal Reserve Act rules out removal for \"no reason at all, or for policy disagreement ... so long as the President identifies a cause, the determination of 'some cause relating to the conduct, ability, fitness, or competence of the officer' is within the President's unreviewable discretion.\"Trump tried to fire Cook, who is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed's Board of Governors, after months of unsuccessfully pressuring the board and Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates.",

    "body": "A power substation near the LC1 CloudHQ data center in Ashburn, Virginia, on March 27, 2024.Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesVoter anger at surging electricity prices is fueling political backlash against the artificial intelligence industry's data centers, with Democrats accusing the Trump administration of failing to address the issue as they zero in on affordability ahead of next year's mid-term elections.Abigail Spanberger won last week's governor's race in Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world, after promising to make the industry \"pay their own way and their fair share\" of rising electricity costs.New Jersey governor-elect Mikie Sherrill has promised to declare a state of emergency over electric bills on her first day in office and freeze prices in the Garden State. Two Democrats were elected to Georgia's commission that regulates utilities, breaking total Republican control, with one of the candidates arguing that prices are rising in the Peach State in part due to data centers.On the heels of the election victories, Democratic senators in Washington led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont took aim this week at what they described as the White House's \"sweetheart deals with Big Tech companies,\" accusing the administration of failing to protect consumers from \"being forced to subsidize the cost of data centers.\"\"As a result, everyday Americans are already being forced into bidding wars with trillion-dollar companies to keep the lights on at home,\" the senators wrote Monday in a letter demanding solutions from the White House.President Donald Trump promised to cut families' electric bills by 50% in his first year in office. But residential prices in the U.S. increased about an average 6% in August nationwide compared to the same-period in 2024, according to October data from the Energy Information Administration. Prices soared about 21% in New Jersey, 13% in Virginia and about 5% in Georgia in the same period.The reasons for price hikes vary by state and region, said Abraham Silverman, who served as general counsel for New Jersey's public utility board from 2019 until 2023 under outgoing Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy.But data centers are playing the main role in rising bills on the PJM Interconnection electric grid that serves New Jersey and Virginia, Silverman said. PJM is the largest grid in the U.S., reaching more than 65 million people across 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest and South.\"We are basically adding a Philadelphia's worth of new electricity users to the grid every year, starting in 2025 and showing no signs of slowing,\" Silverman said of the national increase in demand. \"Where is that load growth coming from? The answer is data centers.\"Surging pricesThe conditions that led to surging household electricity prices this year, particularly in the PJM region, took root before the second Trump administration entered office, when investment in AI data centers was just starting to ramp up.The amount PJM agreed to pay in late 2022 to secure capacity from power plants, which ensures they are available when electricity use rises, totaled $2.2 billion. In 2024, the bill soared more than 500% to $14.7 billion. This year, it jumped another 9% to $16.1 billion.The independent watchdog that monitors PJM found the main culprit for soaring capacity prices: data centers.\"The current conditions in the capacity market are almost entirely the result of large load additions from data centers, both actual historical and forecast,\" the watchdog Monitoring Analytics concluded in its independent market monitor report published in June.Those capacity prices are ultimately passed down to household electricity bills, Silverman said. \"It is an extremely large component of the affordability crisis we're experiencing right now.\"New Jersey utility PSE&G, owned by Public Service Enterprise Group, acknowledged the impact of exploding capacity prices in a February letter to consumers warning of a 17% increase in their bills, though it didn't call out data centers.\"Utilities do not earn a profit on the electric supply; these costs are passed through directly to customers,\" the company said.The problem could get worse as the data center build out accelerates — at least for now. Power used by data centers in advanced stages of planning in Pennsylvania, for example, jumped more than 40% to 20.5 gigawatts in the third quarter, up from 14.4 gigawatts previously, according to the utility PPL. That's equivalent to the power consumption of about 17 million U.S. homes.\"I want to be clear that these load additions are real, they are coming fast and furious,\" PPL CEO Vincent Sorgi said on its latest earnings call. \"The bottom line is that we need to start building new generation as soon as possible.\"It is unlikely that residential utility bills will come down this decade as demand is expected to remain high and supplies tight, said Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a power sector consulting firm.Political blame gameThe Democratic senators accused the Trump administration of making the affordability problem worse with its attacks on renewable energy. Trump has tried to halt the expansion of wind power, particularly offshore wind projects, and his signature piece of domestic legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, phases out tax credits for renewable energy.Renewables are the most readily available source of generation to meet new demand, with solar, battery storage and wind making up more than 90% of the projects that are waiting to connect to the grid, according to August data from the consulting firm Enverus. Sherrill and Spanberger campaigned on expanding renewable energy in New Jersey and Virginia not to lower carbon emissions, but to help bring down energy costs.The White House blames the Biden administration and its renewable energy policies for driving up electricity prices. Trump \"declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden's disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas and nuclear power generation,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.The AI industry should pay for the new generation and transmission that is needed to support their data centers, Silverman said. \"If we do that, then we are really going a long way to insulate mom and pop consumers from the higher costs,\" he said.The Data Center Coalition, a lobbying group, said in a statement that \"the industry is committed to paying its full cost of service for the energy it uses.\"",

    "body": "watch nowAs food prices climb, Too Good To Go is launching grocery bags with Whole Foods Market, in a major expansion of its push to lessen food waste and provide affordable meals.Too Good To Go is an app that connects users with stores and restaurants that offer surplus food in \"surprise bags\" at significantly lower prices. Its collaboration with Amazon's Whole Foods will expand to all 536 of the grocer's locations across the U.S., where the two companies said they have already saved 1.6 million meals from going to waste through their partnership.Too Good to Go announced seven new categories of surprise bags with Whole Foods on Wednesday: produce, seafood, meat, dry goods, frozen foods, refrigerated foods and floral. Chris MacAulay, vice president of operations for North America at Too Good to Go, said the collaboration is a win for both consumers and the grocer.\"We have this opportunity to bring incremental foot traffic into the store,\" said MacAulay. \"The consumers that come in are getting tremendous value when they pick up a surprise bag, they don't know what they're going to get, but they do know that they're getting incredible food somewhere between 50% to 70% discounted.\"The move is an expansion of an established partnership between the two companies, which previously included prepared foods bags and bakery bags. Shoppers using Too Good to Go will now be able to get fresh groceries at Whole Foods for the first time. MacAulay said the expansion comes as the company focuses on providing affordable meals while consumers navigate rising prices in the grocery aisles and elsewhere.According to the latest consumer price index report, prices in four of the six major grocery store food groups increased in September. Prices for staples like meats, poultry and eggs rose 5.2% over the year prior to that data release, while fruits and vegetables saw a 1.3% increase. More recent inflation data has been delayed by the government shutdown.Because of the lapse in federal funding, 42 million Americans saw their SNAP benefits paused as a battle played out in the courts about whether the government is required to pay that aid to largely lower-income households.Companies are also seeing a more divided economy, as non-wealthy consumers pull back on their spending on non-essential items and look for ways to save.\"I think we're especially starting to see a great deal of bifurcation around different consumer segments,\" MacAulay said. \"It's hard to put great food on the table, it's getting more expensive, and as a result, finding ways to get some of that food at a better value is really important. And so we're not going to be the only solution – I think we're excited about being a part of a solution to help families who are facing economic challenges.\"The new surprise bags, targeting consumer essentials like produce and poultry, are each valued between $21 and $30, but priced at $6.99 to $9.99.It's part of a larger goal from Whole Foods to deliver on sustainability promises, according to Caitlin Leibert, the grocery chain's vice president of sustainability. She said the company has already seen high demand for its existing Too Good To Go bags and is increasingly seeing customers come in to pick up their bags and make additional purchases on the side because of the overall savings.\"This is really an incredible opportunity and added tool for Americans to stretch every dollar further right now, which we know is so important,\" Leibert said. \"This is one way that you can access higher quality food at a more affordable price.\"Whole Foods isn't immune from the macroeconomic headwinds, either, Leibert said – but the collaboration with Too Good To Go allows the grocery chain to find alternate ways to make its products affordable and accessible for shoppers.Still, both Leibert and MacAulay said the new grocery bags are just one step in a longer path toward promoting sustainability and providing affordable meals.\"We do not 'achieve' sustainability – it is a constant evolution of growth and improvement,\" Leibert said. \"These programs... [are] such a profound way and accessible way to make an impact easily.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) walks surrounded by the media, as members of the U.S. House of Representatives returned to Washington after a 53-day break, for a vote that could bring the longest U.S. government shutdown in history to a close, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., U.S., Nov. 12, 2025. Nathan Howard | ReutersThe House of Representatives on Wednesday night began its final vote on a short-term funding bill that would reopen federal agencies after the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.The House earlier cleared a procedural hurdle required before the vote could begin on a short-term funding bill that would reopen the government until at least the end of January.President Donald Trump has said he would sign the bill.The procedural motion passed 213-to-209.Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageDuffy warns air travel will be ‘reduced to a trickle’ as the shutdown drags onTrump tells Republicans to send health insurance money 'directly to the people'Food banks in ‘disaster response mode’ due to shutdown, SNAP cuts, leaders saySenate Republicans reject Democrat deal to reopen governmentDemocratic leader offers deal to reopen government but Republicans sneerTrump admin asks Supreme Court to block order it pay full SNAP benefitsSNAP benefits must be fully paid by Trump administration by Friday, judge ordersDC sandwich thrower Sean Dunn found not guilty of assaulting federal agentJudge dismisses criminal case against Boeing over Max crashes despite skepticismNancy Pelosi announces retirement from CongressTrump bashes Mamdani after Democrats sweep key electionsSupreme Court justices appear skeptical that Trump tariffs are legalCalifornia voters approve new U.S. House map to boost Democrats in 2026Democrats win big on election night in key racesThe vote came two days after the Senate passed the bill, after the Republican majority in that chamber reached a deal with eight members of the Democratic caucus to end a stalemate that led to the shutdown on Oct. 1.Fourteen prior votes in the Senate failed to pass a Republican-backed House bill that would have funded the government until mid-November.Most Democratic senators refused to vote for the bill because it did not extend enhanced tax credits for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance coverage on Affordable Care Act marketplaces.Under the Senate deal, Republicans agreed to allow Democrats a vote in December on a bill of their choice to extend those boosted subsidies, which are due to expire at the end of that month.Without those tax credits, millions of Americans will see sharp increases in the cost of their Obamacare insurance plans.The Republican deal will reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal government employees and ensure that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries that they would have received if the government had not shut down.The package also funds the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government.CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdowns.The deal was reached over the weekend after days of news headlines about delays in air travel as result of air traffic controllers not showing up for work during the shutdown, and about the Trump administration seeking first to completely end, and then to only partially fund food stamp benefits for 42 million people.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., during remarks on the House floor, said some people will see their monthly insurance premiums \"double or even triple\" because of the lack of protection for the added ACA subsidies and that \"more than 2 million Americans are expected to lose their health plans next year because it is just too expensive.\"DeLauro said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., \"has shown no interest\" in holding a vote on the ACA subsidies, despite Senate Republicans saying that was the plan.House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said, \"We never should have been here.\"\"We tried as Republicans more than a month ago to prevent a government shutdown,\" Scalise said. \"We waited for 42 days where time and time again, Democrats, to appease their most radical base, voted to keep that government shut down.\"Scalise said \"millions of Americans\" have had to endure \"pain and suffering\" because Democrats refused to vote for a funding bill.He accused Democrats of hypocrisy by seeking $200 billion in health spending that would benefit \"illegals,\" while \"advocating to gut the $50 billion Rural Health Care Fund.\"It's insanity,\" Scalise said.This is developing news.

    "body": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt speaks during the daily press briefing in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on Nov. 12, 2025 in Washington, DC. Win McNamee | Getty ImagesKey economic reports for October may not be released at all because of the government shutdown, a senior White House official said Wednesday.With the spending impasse appearing to be near an end, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that part of the fallout could be lasting damage to the government's data collection ability.\"The Democrats may have permanently damaged the Federal Statistical system with October CPI and jobs reports likely never being released,\" Leavitt said. \"All of that economic data released will be permanently impaired, leaving our policymakers at the Fed, flying blind at a critical period.\"Release of important economic data has been at the forefront of Wall Street concerns as the shutdown dragged on for more than six weeks, the longest in history.Among the most important releases are the monthly nonfarm payrolls count and the consumer price index, both of which come from the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics. Other data impacted includes retail sales, import and export data as well as consumer spending and income.Most Wall Street economists have been expecting all of the data to be released, albeit delayed. However, Leavitt's comments cast doubt on whether that will happen.\"The Democrat shutdown made it extraordinarily difficult for economists, investors and policymakers at the Federal Reserve to receive critical government data,\" Leavitt said.Leavitt added that the shutdown could lower fourth-quarter economic growth by up to 2 percentage points. Earlier in the afternoon, Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, said the impasse might shave up to 1.5 percentage points from current-quarter GDP.\"For sure, it's going to have an impact on this quarter,\" Hassett said during an appearance at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.However, most economists expect the impact to be minimal.Goldman Sachs, in fact, raised its estimates for GDP heading into the end of the year. The firm boosted its Q3 outlook slightly to 3.7% and raised its full-year forecast to 1.3%, a change of 0.3 percentage point.On the issue of data collection, Goldman's economists said they expect the shutdown to have \"a limited impact\" on the quality of jobs data.As for timing, Citigroup economists on Wednesday speculated that the September nonfarm payrolls report could be released as early as Friday but more likely in the early part of next week. They said it could take until early December to put together the October count.Jobs report data should be easy to collect belatedly because it involves asking business for hard numbers, according to Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial. In fact, he said the BLS could likely get multiple months' worth of data during one collection period if needed.But he said it's harder to get information from everyday people because it requires asking them about their willingness to work during a period that has already passed.\"It's just the more nuanced qualitative surveys that cannot be replicated,\" Roach said. \"The water has gone under that bridge already.\"Roach said previous shutdowns have mostly only resulted in delays of the release of data that the government had already collected. But he said this closure lasted long enough to also keep agencies closed during what would have been their collection periods for these reports.— CNBC's Alex Harring contributed.",

Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesToyota Motor on Wednesday said it has started production at a new $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina and confirmed plans to invest up to $10 billion more than previously expected over the next five years in the United States.The Japanese automaker did not release details about the increased investment other than Toyota Motor North America CEO Tetsuo Ogawa calling it a \"pivotal moment\" in the company's history along with the new battery plant, according to a release.The facility is Toyota's first in-house battery plant outside of Japan. It was first announced in December 2021 amid the Biden administration's push to onshore production of batteries for hybrids and all-electric vehicles.Since then, market conditions for EVs have soured, while demand for hybrids continues to grow exponentially. Those changes are positive for Toyota, which is the U.S. leader in hybrid sales with a more than 51% market share through the third quarter of this year, according to Motor Intelligence data.It's unclear how much of the investment was already planned but not made previously public, but the announcement follows President Donald Trump last month saying Toyota would invest $10 billion in the U.S.Toyota and the entire automotive industry have been attempting to navigate production plans amid regulatory changes impacting EVs and Trump's litany of tariffs on new vehicles and parts.Toyota's U.S. sales through the third quarter of this year were up 9.9% to more than 1.3 million vehicles sold.",

    "body": "Signage at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, US, on Thursday, Oct. 23, 2025. Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGoogle filed a lawsuit Wednesday against a foreign cybercriminal group behind a massive SMS phishing, or \"smishing,\" operation.Dubbed by some cyber researchers as the \"Smishing Triad,\" the organization, which Google said is largely based out of China, uses a phishing-as-a-service kit named \"Lighthouse\" to create and deploy attacks using fraudulent texts.The crime group has amassed more than a million victims across 120 countries, Google said in a release.\"They were preying on users' trust in reputable brands such as E-ZPass, the U.S. Postal Service, and even us as Google,\" Google general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado told CNBC. \"The 'Lighthouse' enterprise or software creates a bunch of templates in which you create fake websites to pull users' information.\"Google brought claims under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or RICO, Act, the Lanham Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, or CFAA, and is seeking to dismantle the group and the Lighthouse platform.The texts usually contain malicious links to a fake website designed to steal victims' sensitive financial information, including Social Security numbers, banking credentials and more.The messages can often appear in the form of a fake fraud alert, delivery update, unpaid government fee notification, or other seemingly urgent texts.The crime group has stolen approximately between 12.7 million and 115 million credit cards in the U.S. alone, Google said.\"The idea is to prevent its continued proliferation, deter others from doing something similarly, as well as protect both the users and brands that were misused in these websites from future harm,\" DeLaine Prado said.Read more CNBC tech newsAI spending is not all equal.

    "body": "watch nowWaymo robotaxis will now take passengers on freeways in three major U.S. cities, marking a major milestone for the driverless, ride-hailing company.Alphabet-owned Waymo on Wednesday said it will begin offering those types of trips in the San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles markets \"when a freeway route is meaningfully faster.\" The Google sister company will gradually extend freeway trips to more riders and locations over time.Although Waymo's driverless cars have previously taken passengers on smaller highways and side streets, Wednesday's expansion marks the first time the company will take payment from public riders to go on freeways with higher speed limits.\"Freeway driving is one of those things that's very easy to learn, but very hard to master when we're talking about full autonomy without a human driver as a backup, and at scale,\" Waymo co-CEO Dmitri Dolgov said at a press event ahead of the announcement. \"It took time to do it properly.\"Waymo vehicles will generally travel up to a freeway's maximum posted speed limit, which is 65 mph in many cases, the company said. However, a spokesperson confirmed, the robotaxis may sometimes go a few miles over the limit for safety purposes in extraordinary circumstances.Freeway operations required expanded operational protocols, including coordination with safety officials at the California Highway Patrol and the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Waymo said. The company also installed additional infrastructure needed to charge its fleet of electric robotaxis given the freeway expansion.Over the last year, Waymo has offered select Alphabet employees robotaxi freeway rides around San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix in preparation for Wednesday's launch, said Waymo Product Manager Jacopo Sannazzaro.The company has been testing on freeways for more than a decade in total, he added. Besides testing on public roads and closed courses, Waymo also conducts testing in simulation to determine how its vehicles will respond to both typical and hard-to-replicate events, like merging onto freeways, lane-splitting motorcyclists or another car flipping over.CNBC took a freeway test ride in a Waymo in the San Francisco Bay Area, from YouTube's offices in San Bruno to San Mateo and back. The ride went on and off ramps along the California 101 seamlessly, with no incidents.Waymo's continued expansionAfter already launching its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles, Waymo has also announced plans to expand to Miami, San Diego and Washington, D.C., in 2026. The company is also testing its vehicles in New York City, Tokyo and plans to begin offering rides to the public in London next year.Waymo on Wednesday also announced that it's expanding its service footprint in the San Francisco Bay Area to San Jose. That includes rides to and from San Jose Mineta International Airport, marking the company's second international airport destination. The SJC airport plans were first announced in September.In 2023, Waymo launched at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which has become its most popular destination in the Phoenix metropolitan service area.The company expanded its service in March to include an additional 27 square miles of coverage in the region, including cities like Mountain View and Palo Alto. After the Wednesday expansion, Waymo now offers service in about 260 square miles of Silicon Valley.Would-be Waymo competitor Tesla also takes passengers to and from SJC. Customers can hail a ride via Tesla's \"Robotaxi\" app, but that name is not precisely descriptive. Tesla only operates a car service with human drivers on board, not a commercial robotaxi service like Waymo's, due to a mix of technical limits and permit requirements in California.",

    "body": "Susan Collins, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, during a Bloomberg Television interview at the Kansas City Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Moran, Wyoming, US, on Friday, Aug. 22, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBoston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins on Wednesday said she will be reluctant to support further interest rate cuts anytime soon with inflation still high and policymakers hampered by a lack of data due to the government shutdown.\"Given my baseline outlook, it will likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time to balance the inflation and employment risks in this highly uncertain environment,\" the central bank official said in remarks delivered in her home district. \"I see several reasons to have a relatively high bar for additional easing in the near term.\"Collins's comments are notable because she is a voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Her remarks put her on the hawkish side of the rate debate, highlighting a fissure among committee members that led Chair Jerome Powell to say in October that a cut at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion, despite market pricing of a high probability.Collins supported the quarter percentage point rate cut at the October meeting but indicated that further easing could thwart the Fed's efforts to get inflation lower.While Collins said softness in the labor market \"bears watching,\" she added that the risks of inflation staying above the Fed's 2% target warrant caution.\"Against this backdrop, providing additional monetary support to economic activity runs the risk of slowing – or possibly even stalling – the return of inflation to target,\" she said. \"And with resilient demand, the downside risks to employment, while present, do not seem to have increased further since the summer.\"Collins also noted the role that the government shutdown is playing in her decision making. The impasse appears to be over, but White House press secretary said Wednesday that key reports on inflation and employment may not be available at all for October.\"Absent evidence of a notable labor market deterioration, I would be hesitant to ease policy further, especially given the limited information on inflation due to the government shutdown,\" Collins said.The FOMC in October voted 10-2 for the cut. Governor Stephen Miran voted no because he wanted a bigger reduction, while Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid opposed because he favored no cut.",

    "body": "Chuck Robbins, Cisco CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 22, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBCCisco reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for its fiscal first quarter on Wednesday. The stock rose more than 7% in extended trading.Here's how the company did in comparison with consensus estimates from LSEG:Earnings per share: $1 adjusted vs. 98 cents expectedRevenue: $14.88 billion vs. $14.77 billion expectedRevenue increased 8% from $13.84 billion in the same period a year earlier, Cisco said in a statement. Net income climbed to $2.86 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year ago.It's the fourth straight quarter of growth for Cisco following a stretch of four consecutive year-over-year revenue declines, as the company contended with economic uncertainty and delayed spending from government agencies.Cisco's networking business, its biggest unit, saw sales climb 15% to $7.77 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue for that segment of $7.47 billion, according to StreetAccount.Most of the growth in data center spending is focused on artificial intelligence, as companies bolster their investments in servers packed with graphics processing units, primarily from Nvidia. Cisco is trying to tie itself more closely to the AI boom, and last month introduced a new Ethernet switch based on Nvidia silicon.Cisco said that AI infrastructure orders from \"hyperscaler customers\" reached $1.3 billion, \"reflecting a significant acceleration in growth.\"\"Our relevance in AI continues to build,\" CFO Mark Patterson said in the press release. \"We have a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar campus refresh opportunity starting to ramp, with strong demand for our refreshed networking products.\" For the fiscal second quarter, Cisco said it expects revenue of $15 billion to $15.2 billion, topping the $14.6 billion average estimate, according to LSEG. Adjusted earnings will be $1.01 to $1.03 per share, exceeding the 99-cent average estimate.Revenue for the full fiscal year will be between $60.2 billion and $61 billion, with earnings per share of $4.08 to $4.14, Cisco said. Analysts expect sales of $59.7 billion and EPS of $4.04.While networking is growing and performing better than expected, Cisco's other two main segments saw revenue declines and missed Wall Street's expectations.Sales in the company's security unit fell 2% from a year earlier to $1.98 billion, missing the average estimate of $2.16 billion, according to StreetAccount. And collaboration sales slipped 3% to $1.06 billion, trailing the $1.09 billion average estimate.Cisco shares are up 25% this year as of Wednesday's close, topping the 21% gain for the Nasdaq.WATCH: Cisco's product chief on AI agentswatch now",

    "body": "watch nowThe U.S. House of Representatives will vote early Wednesday evening to end the longest government shutdown in history, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., said.\"We'll start the process probably around 4, 5 o'clock. The actual vote on the bill to fund the government will probably come later, around 7 o'clock,\" the House majority leader told CNBC. \"There'll be, I'm sure, a good, thorough debate, but it's so important that this gets done.\"If the spending bill gets through as planned, it will end an impasse that has lasted more than six weeks, resulting in furloughs for government workers, the closing of all federal government activities, the suspension of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and increased delays at airports heading into the holiday travel season.The Senate on Monday approved the package, which would keep the government open until Jan. 30 and provide funding for agriculture, military programs and legislative agencies, while also providing back pay for workers affected by the shutdown.Read more CNBC politics coverageDemocrats win big on Election Night in key racesZohran Mamdani wins New York City mayor's race, NBC News projectsDemocratic candidate Mikie Sherrill wins New Jersey governor's race, NBC News projectsDemocrats win Virginia governor, attorney general races, NBC News projectsSNAP update: Trump admin will pay 50% of food stamp benefits in November amid shutdownTrump says he has 'no idea who' Binance's CZ is after pardoning himTrump backtracks on attending Supreme Court tariffs case argumentsPresident Donald Trump has indicated he will sign the bill into law.Though the majority in the House is expected to be razor thin, Scalise said he expects to peel off enough Democrats to get the package through.\"Some Democrats still want to play games and inflict pain on families across America, but we've got enough,\" he said. \"We may get a few more than that in the House who want to end this madness and just let people get back to their lives.\"Both sides have traded blame over who is responsible for the shutdown. Polls have indicated voters more put the onus on Republicans, though an NBC News poll earlier this month showed Democrats faulted at the highest level in 30 years when compared with previous shutdowns.\"It's madness, but it's going to end today, hopefully, and let's move on,\" Scalise said.",

    "body": "US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer testifies during a US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies hearing on 2026 funding priorities, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, Dec. 9, 2025.Saul Loeb | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday that the deadline for China to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans from American farmers was not the end of December as the White House has said, but the end of the \"growing season.\"Greer's comment at the hearing came on the heels of a report by NBC News showing that the pace of China's purchase of soybeans in recent weeks was well short of reaching the agreed amount by the end of the calendar year.China, which in October agreed to end its monthslong boycott of American soybeans amid a trade war, to date has bought only about 3 million metric tons, the trade representative told members of the  Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies subcommittee.Greer said there was a \"discrepancy\" in what the White House has described as the deadline and the actual deadline for the purchases to be completed.The most recent growing season for soybeans ended in November, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.CNBC has asked Greer's office whether there is a hard or rough deadline for China to reach 12 million metric tons of purchases, as agreed to as part of a trade agreement with President Donald Trump in October.Greer's disclosure came in response to a question by Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.\"There remains anxiety about if and when China will fully follow through on those purchase commitments that were made,\" Fischer said.She noted that the White House fact sheet on the trade deal said China would purchase 12 million metric tons by the end of the calendar year -- contradicting recent comments from Greer.The fact sheet says, \"China will purchase at least 12 million metric tons (MMT) of U.S. soybeans during the last two months of 2025 and also purchase at least 25 MMT of U.S. soybeans in each of 2026, 2027, and 2028.\"Greer told Fischer, \"It is for this growing season, so, thank you for highlighting that.\"'\"We've heard from a couple farmers, they wanted to know about that discrepancy, and it is a discrepancy, it's through the growing season,\" he said.Joe Glauber, a former U.S. Department of Agriculture chief economist during the Obama administration, told CNBC in an interview he doesn't know what the administration means when it refers to the growing season.\"It's not a term that USDA means by any chance,\" Glauber said. \"Does that mean at harvests or does that mean actually the end of the marketing year, which is the more common way?\"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said that he expected China to reach the 12 million metric ton mark by \"the end of the season.\"\"So I think that'll be February 28th,\" Bessent said, during an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin at The New York Times \"Deal Book Summit\" in New York. \"They are in a perfect cadence to complete that goal,\" Bessent said, after Ross Sorkin said data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture as of Nov. 14 showed that China had only purchased 330,000 metric tons.Bessent called the figure Ross Sorkin cited \"bad information.\"",

    "body": "The new Bitcoin token is photographed on U.S. $100 bills.Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesA new exchange-traded fund from Bitwise that began trading Tuesday will give retail investors and financial advisors access to a broad range of cryptocurrencies in one shot, as opposed to the ETFs so far that have mostly just tracked just one or two cryptocurrencies.The Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) holds the following 10 digital assets: Bitcoin, ether, XRP, Solana, Chainlink, Litecoin, Cardano, Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot. The conversion makes BITW the first ETF by a major crypto asset manager to include Avalanche, Sui and Polkadot, Bitwise CEO and co-founder Hunter Horsley told CNBC.\"This really meaningfully expands the audience that can access exposure to these different assets, [and] of course, for assets that don't have spot ETF, all the more,\" Horsley said Monday. The fund offers exposure to crypto-assets for financial advisors as well as other smaller investors who are using funds from an IRA or retirement account \"where their only choice is to use ETFs,\" said the CEO.The ETF was converted from an index fund which held the same coins and it starts trading with more than $1 billion in assets. Along with broader permissions to trade and hold, ETFs offer other advantages over funds that may make them more attractive to some investors, including increased trading flexibility and tax efficiency, as well as lower fees. This move follows the Securities and Exchange Commission's approval of a rash of spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. in January 2024. Since then, asset managers have jockeyed for approvals to launch ETFs tracking a wider range of digital assets, from altcoins like sui and aptos to memecoins such as official Trump and dogecoin. The ETF launches amid a series of recent pullbacks in the crypto market that saw bitcoin trade as low as $85,000 earlier this month,  more than 30% off its record high of just north of $126,000 hit in October. Smaller coins with fewer institutional vehicles were hurt even more during the recent sell-off, exposing a risk this ETF will lead to bigger losses for smaller investors.On the flipside, as the cryptocurrency market matures and the coins began trading more on their own merits, an ETF like this offers the potential for diversification, like a broad index fund such as the S&P 500 does with equities.\"It's the perfect time for a lot of investors who've now been paying attention since the launch of the Bitcoin ETF, but want a more comprehensive solution to allocating to digital assets than having to pick specific assets and size a bunch of different exposures,\" said Horsley.To be sure, the exposure to the smaller coins in the fund is limited. BITW allocates 90% of its holdings to assets that are held by existing single-coin exchange-traded products— Bitcoin, ether, solana and XRP. It caps the combined weight of all other tokens in the fund at 10%. The fund will be rebalanced every month — more frequently than most ETFs, which rebalance quarterly or semi-annually. Bitwise manages more than $15 billion in client assets and has a suite of more than 40 digital asset investment products. BITW, which is technically an exchange-traded product, was 1.5% higher Tuesday on its new home at the NYSE Arca exchange.",

    "body": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, right, speaks alongside President Donald Trump about investing in America, at the White House in Washington, on April 30, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's decision to let U.S. tech giant Nvidia sell more advanced semiconductors to China is getting pushback from some Republicans wary of giving Beijing an edge in the global race to AI dominance.The agreement, which Trump announced in a Truth Social post Monday evening, would allow Nvidia to sell its H200 artificial intelligence chips to China on the condition that the U.S. government gets 25% of the sales.The H200 chips aren't Nvidia's most advanced, but are more powerful than the company's H20s, which were previously developed specifically for the China market.The White House, over the summer, gave approval for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell their less-powerful chips to China in exchange for 15% of sales revenue. Beijing reportedly told companies not to buy those chips.Chinese President Xi Jinping \"responded positively\" to the latest proposal, Trump wrote in the social media post.CNBC has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., for comment.Experts warn that giving China access to the better chips will shrink America's hardware advantage and help Chinese developers vastly improve their AI models and other tech.Some of Trump's Republican allies appear to agree.\"Alarm bells go off in my head here,\" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told CNBC on Tuesday when asked about the chip sales agreement.\"I don't mind doing normal business with China. But if you can prove to me this will accelerate their military capability, I'll oppose it,\" Graham said.\"My general view on this is that China's progress on AI is almost entirely parasitic on our technology, in particular on our hardware,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said on Capitol Hill earlier Tuesday.\"So I don't want China to win the AI race. I want to win the AI race,\" Hawley said. \"But if we want to beat China, I think we need to constrain their ability to leverage our own technology, and I think we would want to reduce their access to our hardware, not increase it.\"Hawley did not directly criticize Trump, and noted that the president is privy to more information about the situation than he is. \"So I think he deserves some deference here,\" Hawley said.\"But I think in the general matter I would want to constrain American hardware going to China,\" he added.Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, asked about the chip agreement, was more succinct. \"I'm concerned,\" he said. Cornyn did not respond to follow-up questions.The U.S. House Select Committee on China, a Republican-led panel formed to focus on the \"threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party,\" echoed Hawley's concerns.\"Right now, China is far behind the United States in chips that power the AI race. Because the H200s are far better than what China can produce domestically, both in capability and scale, @nvidia selling these chips to China could help it catch up to America in total compute,\" the committee said in a statement on X.Beijing will use the H200s, which boast significantly more processing power and memory bandwidth than China's top chips, \"to strengthen its military capabilities and totalitarian surveillance,\" the panel's statement said.\"Finally, Nvidia should be under no illusions – China will rip off its technology, mass produce it themselves, and seek to end Nvidia as a competitor,\" the panel said. \"That is China's playbook and it is using it in every critical industry.\"Asked for comment on the GOP lawmakers' remarks, White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC, \"The Trump administration is committed to ensuring the dominance of the American tech stack – without compromising on national security.\"Not all Republicans are piling on.\"I don't have a real problem with providing them some [chips],\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told CNBC. \"But we've got to know where it is, how they're using it, those sorts of things.\"But there is vocal support among both parties for slowing China's ability to obtain the world's best chips.Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., last week introduced bipartisan legislation that would direct the Trump administration to deny export licenses for advanced chips to China and other foreign adversaries for at least 30 months.\"The best AI chips are made by American companies. Denying Beijing access to these AI chips is essential to our national security,\" Ricketts said in a press release unveiling the bill.Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., one of the bill's co-sponsors, said, \"It's crucial that we protect American AI innovation from Communist China to win the AI race.\"Read more CNBC politics coverageTrump officials move to end student loan payment pause for millions of borrowersJudge unseals Ghislaine Maxwell grand jury materials, citing Epstein files actUkraine at 'critical moment' in war as European allies ramp up pressure on RussiaDemocrats establish AI working group as industry bolsters DC presenceEx-Trump lawyer Habba resigns as NJ U.S. attorney after disqualificationTrump announces $12 billion aid package for farmers caught up in trade warTrump says Netflix, WBD deal could be 'problem' as son-in-law backs Paramount bidSupreme Court to hear case on Trump birthright citizenship orderTrump can fire labor, employment board members without cause: Appeals courtTrump administration views Netflix, Warner Bros. deal with 'heavy skepticism'Costco adds Biden Commerce Sec.

Ryan | Boston Globe | Getty ImagesGrocery delivery app Instacart uses artificial intelligence pricing tools that have caused many U.S. shoppers to pay higher or lower prices for identical products from the same store, according to a new study. The study, released Tuesday by Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, Consumer Reports and news organization More Perfect Union, enlisted 437 shoppers across four cities to add the same items to their carts within the Instacart app from the same store. The researchers ran the experiment at a number of popular grocery retailers that partner with Instacart, including Target, Costco, Albertsons, Kroger and Safeway. Almost 75% of the items tested were offered at different prices to shoppers, the organizations found. In one case, users observed that a carton of a dozen Lucerne eggs was listed at five different price points at a Safeway in Washington, D.C. The total cost for the same basket of goods at a single store varied by about 7%, which could amount to a \"cost swing of about $1,200 per year,\" Groundwork said.Read more CNBC tech newsU.S. uncovers scheme to reroute Nvidia GPUs worth $160 million to China despite export bansICEBlock developer sues U.S. government after DOJ demanded Apple remove app from storePressure builds on Apple and CEO Tim Cook with holiday executive shake-upGoogle to launch the first of its AI glasses in 2026Instacart said in a blog post following the report that a \"small subset\" of its retail partners run limited online pricing tests. The tests don't use personal, demographic or individual-level behavioral data, Instacart said, adding that prices \"never change in real-time, including in response to supply and demand.\"\"These short-term, randomized tests help retail partners understand category-level price sensitivity so they can sustainably invest in lower prices where consumers care most,\" the company wrote.An Instacart spokesperson said in a statement that the company is focused on affordability and that retailers \"control their prices\" on the platform. Instacart, in 2022, acquired Eversight, an AI-powered pricing and promotions platform, for an undisclosed amount.The study comes as regulators, politicians and advocacy groups have zeroed in on the use of AI-driven pricing tools, arguing that it leads to discrepancies in what consumers pay, often without their knowledge. Lawmakers have specifically called out airlines and ride-hailing companies' use of AI to set prices.Last month, New York State enacted a first-of-its-kind law requiring businesses to disclose if they use customers' personal data to algorithmically set prices. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining the issue, initiating a study last year to better understand surveillance pricing tactics used by companies. Senator Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., introduced new legislation on Tuesday that seeks to ban companies from charging different prices to consumers for the same product or service using their personal data.watch now",

    "body": "Cattle detained in the pens of the Chihuahua Regional Livestock Union , at the Jeronimo-Santa Teresa border crossing in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico on November 27, 2024, after the United States stopped imports of Mexican cattle due to the presence of screwworm. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. cattle ranchers will soon have a new way to protect their dwindling herds from the threat of the parasite screwworm, which is decimating cattle in Mexico.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted conditional approval for a drug called EXZOLT CATTLE-CA1, a topical treatment from Merck Animal Health for the prevention and treatment of New World Screwworm. It can also be used as a treatment and control for the cattle fever tick. \"The conversation started in July with the FDA, and because there is an element of human food safety, there was a big data package we had to generate,\" said Holger Lehmann, vice president of pharmaceutical research and development for Merck Animal Health. \"This approval is a significant undertaking. The U.S. has received the product, and Mexico received it in early November, where it is being used,\" Lehmann said. Each dose is effective for 21 days before a new dose would need to be applied. The FDA has approved it with a 98-day withholding period to ensure no residue in meat.Merck Animal Health is prioritizing sending the product first to U.S. distribution partners located in areas along the U.S.-Mexico border that are more likely to have an immediate need, by the end of the year. The treatment will be available more broadly to veterinarians and producers in mid-January 2026. Previously, Merck had said it would be more broadly available Dec. 20.Lehmann cautioned that the drug alone cannot eradicate the parasite any time soon. \"Experts tell us in Mexico that they don't expect that they're going to be able to get rid of the screwworm problem quickly,\" Lehmann said. \"They think it's a multi-year problem to get resolved.\"On December 4, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted conditional approval to Exzolt Cattle-CA1, a fluralaner topical solution from Merck Animal Health, for the use in beef cattle.Merck Animal HealthScrewworm is spread by hatching fly eggs in the open wounds of cattle, which feed on their living tissue. Humans can also get infected. To protect the U.S. cattle herd and to stop the spread of the parasitic fly, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has closed the border to Mexico for imports of live cattle, bison, and horses, on and off, since 2024. The border continues to be closed. Before the closure, Mexico was an exporter of calves to the U.S., with USDA data showing the U.S. imported over one million cattle annually, approximately 3.3% of the U.S. total calf crop.The screwworm outbreak in Mexico is one of the reasons for volatility in the cattle futures market, and behind the high costs of beef, which has become a high-profile issue for the Trump administration among the president's falling poll numbers on the economy.President Trump has blamed meat processors and U.S. cattlemen for the higher costs. Tariffs associated with animal feed and farming equipment have been linked to the rise in beef prices, along with drought impacting herd size.watch nowAccording to USDA data, as of November 2025, the U.S. cattle on feed were 11.7 million head, down 2%, or 260,000 head, from 2024. That represents a U.S. cattle herd at its lowest level since 1951. In November, Tyson Foods announced it was closing its major beef plant in Lexington, Nebraska, and cutting back operations in Amarillo, Texas, because of the cattle shortage.\"As ranchers, we're glad to see the FDA approving new tools like this,\" said sixth-generation Texas rancher James Clement III. \"When we face fever ticks or screwworm outbreaks, having effective medications and treatments on hand isn't optional; it's essential,\" he said. \"These products give producers the ability to respond quickly, protect our herds, and safeguard the broader livestock industry,\" he said, though he added ranchers will have some questions before they move ahead with use of the drug.Because it's winter and the temperatures are cooler, Lehmann said, the likelihood of flies carrying screwworm from Mexico into the U.S. is currently low. \"But there is risk in the spring, so we have enough product available that we could deploy immediately to cattle ranchers for preventative action,\" Lehmann said. \"Based on what we know, this treatment is very effective against screwworm, and you want to contain this. So benefit treatment actually becomes very critical,\" Lehmann added.",

The company announced plans for a $6.5 billion biomanufacturing plant in north Houston. (Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images)Raquel Natalicchio | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesEli Lilly on Tuesday said it will spend $6 billion to build a manufacturing plant in Huntsville, Alabama, to help boost production of its closely watched experimental obesity pill and other drugs. It is the third facility in a string of new planned U.S. investments by the drugmaker. Eli Lilly announced in February that it would spend at least $27 billion to build four new domestic manufacturing plants, adding to $23 billion in previous investments since 2020.The company said it expects construction of the Alabama plant to start in 2026 and for it to be completed in 2032. \"Today's investment continues the onshoring of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production, strengthening supply chain resilience and reliable access to medicines for patients in the U.S.,\" said Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks in a release. That added production capacity for Eli Lilly's obesity pill, orforglipron, is crucial as the company races to file for its approval and tries to maintain its dominance in the booming market for GLP-1s. The company and its chief rival, Novo Nordisk, faced supply shortages for their existing weekly injections after demand skyrocketed in the U.S. in recent years, though they have managed to alleviate those issues.Eli Lily's pill in November won a priority review voucher from the Food and Drug Administration, which will significantly speed up the regulator's assessment of the drug to potentially a few months. Drugmakers have been scrambling to boost their production in the U.S. after threats by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S. But concerns about those potential tariffs have eased following recent drug pricing deals with Trump that exempt companies from the levies.Eli Lilly said the Alabama site will bring 450 jobs to the area, including engineers, scientists, operations personnel and lab technicians, as well as 3,000 construction jobs. ",

Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver remarks on the U.S. economy as he works to sell a message of economic success to a country increasingly concerned about the cost of living.The speech in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, comes as data show Americans feeling squeezed by high prices, which continue to creep up despite Trump's insistence that he has all but conquered inflation.The most recent consumer confidence survey for November found economic sentiment falling to its lowest point in seven months. And while the inflation rate has retreated from its highs during the middle of the Biden administration, it remains on an upward trajectory. The most recent year-over-year consumer price index reading, of 3% in September, is the same level as where it stood in January.Democrats, who hope to retake majority control of at least one chamber of Congress in the 2026 midterms, have focused intently on a message of affordability, while blaming Trump's tariffs and other economic policies for high prices.Trump has chafed at that messaging, asserting that affordability is a \"Democrat hoax\" and that he is cleaning up his predecessor's economic mess.In an interview with Politico on Monday, Trump said he would give his economy a grade of \"A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.\"The domestic trip to a key swing state marks a return to the sort of voter outreach that defined Trump's political campaigns, but has grown rarer during the 79-year-old's first year back in the White House.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.",

    "body": "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla talks during a press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a visit to oversee the production of the Pfizer-BioNtech COVID-19 vaccine at the factory of U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer in Puurs, Belgium April 23, 2021. John Thys | ReutersPfizer on Tuesday said it has struck an up to $2.1 billion licensing deal with YaoPharma to develop and commercialize its obesity pill, furthering the pharmaceutical company's push into the weight loss space. Pfizer will pay YaoPharma, a subsidiary of Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical, an up-front payment of $150 million. YaoPharma could also receive up to $1.94 billion in milestone payments, along with tiered royalties on sales if the drug is approved. YaoPharma's drug works by targeting the same gut hormone, GLP-1, as Novo Nordisk's blockbuster weight loss injection Wegovy. But the pill is still in early-stage development, which means it will take several years to reach patients. The deal will help Pfizer beef up and diversify its obesity drug pipeline after a string of setbacks, including its decisions to scrap two different pills over the past two years. The drugmaker boosted its prospects in the competitive space with its up to $10 billion acquisition of the obesity biotech Metsera last month, following a fierce bidding war with Novo Nordisk. \"We look forward to contributing our expertise and resources to continue the development of this investigational GLP-1 small molecule which complements and strengthens our growing portfolio of novel candidates for treating obesity and its adjacent diseases,\" said Chris Boshoff, Pfizer's chief scientific officer, in a statement. Under the terms of the agreement, YaoPharma will conduct a phase one trial on its drug, while Pfizer will take control of later development. Pfizer also plans to conduct studies combining YaoPharma's treatment with its own drug targeting another gut hormone receptor called GIP, which is currently in mid-stage development.That combination isn't new in the space: Eli Lilly's weight loss injection Zepbound and diabetes drug Mounjaro use a dual approach targeting both GLP-1 and GIP. In a note on Tuesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman said limited information is available on YaoPharma's drug, called YP05002. But Seigerman said he views \"obesity diversification as promising in the short term\" for Pfizer. He added that Pfizer's $150 million up-front payment reflects \"prudent capital conservation in light of the recent Metsera bidding war.\"The opportunity to enter the booming weight loss drug market could be huge for Pfizer. Some analysts expect the weight loss drug space could be worth roughly $100 billion by the 2030s.It's unclear exactly how many people are using GLP-1s in the U.S., especially for obesity in particular. But around 1 in 8 adults said they were taking a GLP-1 drug to lose weight or treat another chronic condition as of November, according to a poll from health policy research organization KFF.",

    "body": "New research shows men and women are equally committed to doing their best at work, but there's a growing ambition gap among women who want to get ahead — and companies rolling back commitments to women's career advancement, sponsorship and stretch opportunities could be to blame.That's according to Lean In and McKinsey & Company's latest Women in the Workplace report, now in its 11th year, which looked at data from 124 U.S. and Canadian companies as well as 9,500 employees to assess talent pipeline data, employee experience surveys, and HR programs and policies. The survey found that 80% of women overall say they want to be promoted to the next level, compared to 86% of men.The ambition gap is highest at the entry level, where just 69% of early-career women want a promotion vs. 80% of their male peers, and at the senior level, where 84% of women want to be promoted vs. 92% of their male colleagues.Stephen Lazina | CNBCIt's part of a larger and \"concerning\" trend of companies rolling back their commitments to women's career advancement at work, says Rachel Thomas, CEO and co-founder of Lean In.\"Only half of companies remain committed to women's career advancement,\" Thomas tells CNBC Make It, citing the report's data. \"Our sense is [women] are feeling that. How couldn't they be?\"Despite the first-time ambition gap, it disappears among women who reported having the same levels of career support, sponsorship and stretch opportunities as their male peers, from entry- to senior-level employees, says Megan McConnell, a partner at McKinsey.Entry-level women face a broken rung to advance early onHistorically, entry-level women under 30 have been among the most ambitious workers who want to be promoted and aspire to be senior leaders, even more so than men under 30, Thomas says. But they also go \"overlooked\" in being supported to go after new opportunities, especially to become first-time managers, which can delay career advancement for years down the line.Only one-third of all entry-level people managers are women, according to the report, and just 31% of entry-level women have a sponsor compared with 45% of entry-level men.Stephen Lazina | CNBC\"Sponsorship is one of the biggest drivers of advancement and also feeling confident and supported at work,\" Thomas says. \"In this year's Women in the Workplace study, employees that have sponsors are twice as likely to get promoted.\"With less support, \"it's hard to imagine that just doesn't impact your optimism, and may actually directly impact how ambitious you feel,\" Thomas says.Support to learn AI and flexibility bias play a roleYoung professional women also receive less support from their manager to use AI at work, which matters when early adopters are rewarded and promoted.\"We know that AI is going to be challenging for jobs, and it's going be the most challenging for the people that don't know how to use those tools,\" Lean In founder and former Meta chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg told CNBC's Julia Boorstin in an interview Tuesday.Encouraging more men than women to use AI early in their careers could exacerbate the broken rung for young professionals. \"We are going to see disproportionate impacts,\" Sandberg said, \"and that would be a real shame for our companies [and] bad for our economy.\"Young women are also more likely to be held back in their careers by the flexibility bias, according to the report: Entry-level women are more likely than men to work remotely offsite, and when they do, their promotion rates lag behind their male counterparts, who are promoted at similar rates regardless of whether they work in an office or remotely.Stephen Lazina | CNBCSenior-level women see a steeper path to the topA lack of support for women's advancement early on can have a compounding effect over time. Senior-level women who say they don't want a promotion are more likely than men to say it's because they've been passed over for a promotion in the past, and they don't see a realistic path to the top.These factors can make it feel like career advancement is out of reach, and so they're less likely to go after it.Other women may be opting out because the higher-level job doesn't offer them the professional development they want or the flexibility they need.Senior-level women are \"significantly more likely to think employees who are more senior than them are burned out or unhappy,\" Thomas says. These women \"see a steeper and less attractive path to the top.\"Women's personal obligations, including shouldering the burden of household and care-giving responsibilities, could play a role in their opting out of promotions. Almost 25% of entry- and senior-level women who don't want a promotion say it's because personal responsibilities make it hard to take on added work, compared to 15% of men at these levels.But it doesn't tell the full story: \"Women who are mothers are just as ambitious as women who are not mothers,\" Thomas says. \"So although it's a factor, I don't think it's the main driver. I think it's much more about what's happening in our culture right now, and I think it's much more about a lack of support from companies.\"When women have career support, they want to advance at workA majority of companies reported that they're prioritizing inclusive cultures (88%) and diversity (67%) this year, according to the survey. But just about half, 54%, say they're committed to programs that support women's career advancement. That falls to just 48% of companies when considering women of color's advancement at work.\"Companies are rolling back programs that we know are particularly beneficial to women,\" Thomas says, including flexible and remote work, formal sponsorship programs, and career development programs with content tailored toward women.While these programs are especially beneficial to women, they also create a more inclusive culture to those who make use of these programs or learn how to work better with others through them, Thomas adds.Effective career support can be as straightforward as having a conversation with your manager about your career aspirations, as well as being put up for promotions or special projects that give you new skills and visibility to senior leaders in the company, McConnell says.One troubling factor could be a continued flattening of middle management, which can have three big impacts. First, managers are now overseeing more reports, which could mean less time and energy in helping women's career advancement. Meanwhile, women may see fewer opportunities to move into middle management, and if they exist, women may not see those leadership positions as attractive given the strain of managing more people with fewer resources.\"Women should always be able to choose the path that makes the most sense to them,\" Thomas says. \"But I don't want it to be because companies are not doing what they should be to support women at all levels, and particularly entry-level women.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? You teach them to read and ride a bike, but often skip money management.

The entire SAVE plan has been blocked since February, when the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Republican-led states that argued former President Joe Biden lacked the authority to establish the student loan relief plan.As of July, the Education Department had identified more than 7.6 million borrowers in the SAVE forbearance.Read more CNBC personal finance coverage53% of investors with a required withdrawal for 2025 still haven't taken it: FidelityWhy jewelry owners may want to check their homeowners insurance coverageWhat another Fed cut could mean for your personal borrowing costsMany student loan borrowers say it's harder to cover basic needs: surveyAlmost all companies with 401(k)s allow Roth savings — who benefits401(k) changes for 2026 —one is 'impactful' for high earners, CFP saysKeeping your 401(k) when you retire is easier.

That's sooner than many advocates and borrowers may have expected: President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" set the SAVE program's expiration date at July 1, 2028.In their lawsuits, the GOP states had argued that Biden, with SAVE, was trying to find a roundabout way to forgive student debt after the Supreme Court blocked his sweeping debt cancellation plan in June 2023. SAVE came with two key provisions that the lawsuits targeted: it had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances.The proposed settlement comes four months after the Education Department resumed charging interest on the loans of borrowers who remained in the SAVE forbearance.Consumer advocates slammed the agreement. Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, said it would \"strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan.\"More than 42 million Americans hold student loans and the outstanding debt exceeds $1.6 trillion, according to the Congressional Research Service. How will the end of the SAVE forbearance impact you?

    "body": "Target has turned its store in New York City's SoHo neighborhood into a unique concept store. Inside of an area that resembles the company's Bullseye logo, the company has \"The Drop,\" a rotating display of seasonal styles and curated items.Courtesy of TargetIn one of New York City's most fashion-forward neighborhoods, Target is unveiling its latest effort to keep up with trends and lead the way on style. The Minneapolis-based retailer, which is in the middle of a turnaround effort and on the cusp of a CEO change, gave a makeover to its big-box store in SoHo at 600 Broadway.The one-of-a-kind concept store, which opens Tuesday, will have rotating merchandise, curated displays chosen by celebrities and influencers, and other kinds of special programming, Chief Guest Experience Officer Cara Sylvester said.The SoHo store is part of a broader push by incoming CEO Michael Fiddelke to win back Target's reputation for style and sharp merchandise. When he was named Target's next leader in August, he said that would be one of his top three priorities, along with improving the customer experience and rolling out technology to make Target faster and more efficient. He will start the role in February, succeeding longtime CEO Brian Cornell.Target is trying to get back to growth after roughly four years of stagnant annual sales due to self-inflicted challenges and a more difficult economic backdrop. Store foot traffic and sales have fallen as shoppers have responded to sloppier stores, out-of-stock and locked-up items, and the company's decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Consumers across the country have also become more selective about buying discretionary merchandise, which has long been Target's sweet spot, as they pay more for necessities like groceries, electricity and housing.At an event previewing the store on Monday night, Fiddelke described the SoHo location as \"a punctuation point\" for Target's sense of style and its plans for the future. In an interview with CNBC, Sylvester said the store's merchandise has completely changed. The location, which opened about seven years ago, drew many shoppers and had strong sales, but sold mostly items found in drug and convenience stores, she said. It didn't carry any of Target's clothing or home decor, which felt both out of step with the neighborhood and like a missed opportunity for Target, she said.\"We said, 'This is the style and fashion capital. We have to be able to showcase the best,'\" she said, recalling the inspiration for the project.Read moreFrom start to finish, the store's redesign took four months as the company raced to get the project done ahead of the holidays, Sylvester said. It has redone the store's first floor and plans to redesign the basement floor in the coming year, she added.The SoHo store is reopening at a time when holiday shoppers and tourists flock to the major shopping district for holiday gifts and party outfits — and as Target chases sales across the country during the critical shopping season. It is one of 42 stores that the retailer has in New York City and nearly 2,000 that is has in the U.S.\"The world looks at New York to see what's new and what's next,\" Sylvester said in remarks at the launch event. \"And we want them to look at Target when they see what's new and what's next.\"A look inside Target's SoHo storeInside of a merchandise area that resembles Target's Bullseye logo, the store will have rotating merchandise that's organized around a theme.Melissa Repko, CNBCWhen customers step inside of Target's SoHo store, they will enter a long, red hallway that resembles the inside of Target's Bullseye logo. The area of the store is called \"The Drop,\" and Target will display merchandise there chosen around themes that feel relevant for the time of year, Sylvester said. Like most of the store, the rotating area will swap out about every four to six weeks, she added.As the store opens, The Drop is themed around the holidays — including outfits and items that a shopper may need for going out, lounging at home or giving a gift to a party host. The store displays range across categories, mixing in clothing, home decor, beauty items and more. For example, The Drop currently includes a table of products that a shopper might want if they're hosting a night at home with friends, such as card games, an espresso martini mix and eye-catching glassware for the cocktails.Sylvester said the company's merchants are already working on the next two themes for The Drop, which will be focused on wellness in January, the season of New Year's resolutions, and Valentine's Day in February.Target's SoHo store has an eye-catching \"Beauty Bar\" that shows off fragrances, makeup items and more.Courtesy of TargetCustomers can step inside of Target's \"Broadway Beauty Bar,\" which is designed for selfies and social media posts. It will have a rotating assortment of Target's beauty merchandise, including fragrance brands like Fine'ry that are exclusive to Target, and trendy mini versions of face washes, lip glosses and more from national brands.At launch, Target is featuring items chosen by celebrity makeup artist Katie Jane Hughes. Along with the \"Beauty Bar,\" the store sells items typically found at the big-box retailer, including large shampoos, body washes and cotton balls.Near the beauty area, shoppers can also press a button and snap a black-and-white selfie.Though the store's layout is new, it shares a similarity with some of Target's other New York City locations — some items are locked behind glasses cases that an employee needs to open.Target will tap celebrities and influencers to pick their favorite Target items for its \"Curated By\" display.Courtesy of TargetIn the back of the store's first floor, Target will have a rotating \"Curated By\" display of items from across the retailer's beauty, fashion and home categories, picked by celebrities and other creators known for their sense of style. Shoppers can browse and buy that person's favorites or scan a QR code to see a list of them.Target's first Curated By features favorites from Megan Stalter, an actress and comedian who is in HBO's \"Hacks.\" Some of her picks include a throw pillow, a pair of hot pink slippers, metallic water bottles and Universal's \"Wicked: For Good\" movie-themed clothing items.Inside of the \"Gifting Gondola,\" Target will show off exclusive merchandise like plushes from its toy brand, Gigglescape, and items themed around its dog mascot, Bullseye, such as special edition Haribo candies.Courtesy of TargetAlso at the store, shoppers can find Target's \"Gifting Gondola,\" which features merchandise exclusive to Target. Currently, the display includes holiday-themed plush penguins, bears and other products from Target's toy brand, Gigglescape. It also includes some giftable items themed around the retailer's bull terrier, Bullseye, including special edition Haribo gummy candies and a Bullseye Pez dispenser.Over time, Sylvester said Target may introduce some items that are unique to the SoHo store and can only be bought there.

    "body": "Dado Ruvic | Reuterswatch nowLook at what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said this year, and what Chinese tech giants and Beijing have done, and you'll see potential hints as to how this lifting of the ban will play out.Why China might push back against the H200The H200 is one of Nvidia's most advanced chips for training and running AI on the market, but China has been on a drive to wean itself off American technology and boost local semiconductor development for AI. \"While this move reopens the door for U.S. revenue, the strategic train has already left the station,\" Neil Shah, partner at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC on Tuesday.Huang said in a Bloomberg interview in May that Chinese tech giant Huawei's semiconductor products for AI are \"probably comparable\" to Nvidia's H200. Alibaba and Baidu, as well as other Chinese startups, are also racing to bring competitive products to Nvidia to the market. Huawei has been ramping up its Ascend line of AI products and using massive clusters of chips to try to get performance that is on par with Nvidia.Huang told CNBC in June that Huawei would have the country's chip needs covered if Nvidia were never allowed to sell there.Meanwhile, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have been using stockpiled Nvidia chips from before the ban, combined with local semiconductors, to develop models that have become advanced.Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., departs following a meeting with members of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Dec. 3, 2025. Huang said he's unsure whether China would accept the company's H200 artificial intelligence chips should the US relax restrictions on sales of the processors, following a meeting Wednesday with President Donald Trump. Photographer: Graeme Sloan/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesWith China's drive to self-sufficiency resulting in advanced products, will Beijing want to allow its local companies to buy American products from Nvidia?\"Capability wise, the Chinese ecosystem is catching up fast from semi to stack with models optimized on the silicon and software for significant local consumption,\" Shah said. He added that China getting \"locked in\" to Nvidia chips is a \"liability with a hanging sword of political uncertainty.\" \"This makes domestic self-sufficiency the only viable long-term strategy for Beijing,\" Shah said. Reasons for China to buy the H200Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping \"responded positively\" to the approval of H200 exports to China.And while China held off on H20 purchases, there are reasons the country's companies could want to purchase the H200 product.The H200 is far more advanced than the H20, which could be tempting for China. Meanwhile, Alibaba CEO Eddie Wu said there were supply shortages across the entire semiconductor supply chain. \"I think there will be demand for H200 as it is a better chip than H20 and there is a shortage of chips in China,\" Ben Barringer, head of technology research at Quilter Cheviot, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"The big Chinese tech companies will want to use Nvidia and AMD if possible.\"China's semiconductor industry remains behind that of the U.S. and elsewhere. In particular, China struggles to manufacture the most advanced chips, putting it behind the world's largest chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. China is also restricted from buying chipmaking tools that could advance its capabilities.Meanwhile, domestic alternatives to Nvidia remain behind in performance. This makes Nvidia's H200 an attractive proposition.\"What is not in China's favor right now is the supply — ramping up advanced AI chips in terms of performance or yields still remains elusive, making it a less economically efficient push,\" Shah said.\"The gap between Nvidia, AMD and Huawei and others is still quite wide when it comes to performance and power efficiency.\"Even if Chinese firms begin buying Nvidia's product, Beijing's longer-term trajectory of self-sufficiency will continue.\"In the long run, for the next five to ten years, China's 'self-reliance' strategy for its own tech and innovation won't change. Jensen Huang of Nvidia has a good time window to sell H200 but it won't be ... forever,\" George Chen, partner and co-chair, digital practice, The Asia Group, told CNBC on Tuesday.\"Xi will not be foolish that today Trump can sell H200, and then China just totally relies on U.S. chips. Huawei, Alibaba and other Chinese tech developers remain strategically important for China's marathon to win the AI race and this will be a long race,\" he added.",

    "body": "Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., February 25, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersUBS' top equity strategist dialed back his view on U.S. stocks, citing mounting risks from a weakening dollar, stretched valuations and policy turbulence in Washington.Andrew Garthwaite, head of global equity strategy at the investment bank, downgraded American equities to \"benchmark\" in a fully invested global equity portfolio, arguing that the factors that powered years of outperformance are starting to fade.The dollar risk is a central concern, Garthwaite wrote. UBS forecasts the euro climbing to $1.22 by the end of the first quarter and sees \"asymmetric structural downside risks\" to the greenback. Historically, when the dollar's trade-weighted index falls 10%, U.S. equities underperform by roughly 4% in unhedged terms, according to the bank. Foreign markets are trouncing the U.S. this year as a weaker dollar and cheaper valuations draw capital overseas. The MSCI World ex-US index has gained about 8% in 2026, compared with the little changed performance for the S&P 500. Japan's Nikkei 225 has rallied 17% year to date, while the Stoxx Europe 600 is up 7%, underscoring a sharp rotation away from American equities. U.S. stocks struggled again Friday as investors fretted over the potential downsides of the artificial intelligence build-out and persistent inflation at home.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500 year to dateAnother pillar of U.S. stock strength — corporate buybacks — is also losing its edge, the bank said. The buyback yield in the U.S. is now only roughly on par with global peers, eroding what had been a key support for earnings per share growth and investor flows, UBS said. The combined shareholder yield from dividends and buybacks in the U.S. is now about half that of Europe, the bank said.\"The buybacks yield is no longer exceptional and this had been an important driver of funds flow, EPS and valuation,\" Garthwaite wrote.Valuations add to the unease. UBS calculates that the sector-adjusted price-earnings ratio for U.S. stocks is 35% above international peers, versus an average premium of about 4% since 2010. Roughly 60% of sectors trade not only at higher multiples than their global counterparts but also above their own historical premium, the strategist wrote.Policy volatility under President Donald Trump is another headwind. This year has brought shifts in tariff policy, proposals to cap credit card interest rates, potential limits on private equity investment in housing, renewed scrutiny of drug pricing, and suggestions to curb dividends and buybacks for defense companies, UBS said.Still, the noted strategist stopped short of turning outright bearish. Garthwaite said the U.S. economy and equities tend to benefit more than peers when markets are in the early phases of a potential bubble. The bank also expects artificial intelligence adoption to outpace most other major regions, with the possible exception of China, helping sustain earnings growth across key industries.UBS strategist Sean Simonds set a year-end target of 7,500 for the S&P 500, compared with an average forecast of 7,629 among 14 top strategists, according to CNBC Pro's strategist survey.

Date and context is unclear.U.S. Department of JusticeFormer President Bill Clinton was set to tell the House Oversight Committee on Friday morning in testimony about Jeffrey Epstein that \"I saw nothing and I did nothing wrong\" during their times flying together or socializing.\"First, I had no idea of the crimes Epstein was committing,\" Clinton planned to say during his closed-door deposition, which was underway in Chappaqua, New York.\"No matter how many photos you show me, I have two things that at the end of the day matter more than your interpretation of those 20-year-old photos. I know what I saw, and more importantly, what I didn't see,\" Clinton said to say.\"I know what I did, and more importantly, what I didn't do,\" he planned to say. \"I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong.\"\"As someone who grew up in a home with domestic abuse, not only would I not have flown on his plane if I had any inkling of what he was doing — I would have turned him in myself and led the call for justice for his crimes, not sweetheart deals,\" Clinton planned to say. \"But even with 20/20 hindsight, I saw nothing that ever gave me pause.\"Clinton also blasted the committee for forcing his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to testify about the notorious sex predator Epstein on Thursday. The committee issued subpoenas to both Clintons demanding their testimony, and threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress if they failed to comply.Hillary Clinton says she has told the panel that she neither recalls ever meeting Epstein, or having knowledge of his sexual abuse of young women and underage girls.\"Before we start, I have to get personal,\" Bill Clinton said, according to prepared testimony that his X account posted.\"You made Hillary come in. She had nothing to do with Jeffrey Epstein. Nothing. She has no memory of even meeting him,\" the former president was set to say. \"She neither traveled with him nor visited any of his properties. Whether you subpoenaed 10 people or 10,000, including her was simply not right.\"The House Oversight Committee has not sought testimony from President Donald Trump about Epstein.The two men were friends for years before falling out in the early 2000s.Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal child sex trafficking charges, during Trump's first presidential administration.Epstein killed himself weeks later in a federal jail in New York City.Trump said that millions of documents related to Epstein that were recently released by the Department of Justice exonerated him of any wrongdoing.Trump for months last year opposed the bill in Congress that would force the DOJ to release those files. He dropped his opposition when it became clear Congress would pass that bill, and then he signed it into law in late November.",

    "body": "An American flag flies at Warner Bros. Studio in Burbank, California, on Sept. 12, 2025.Mario Tama | Getty ImagesThe Warner Bros. Discovery board may have enriched its shareholders Thursday when it chose Paramount Skydance's acquisition offer over Netflix's, but it also terrified a lot of its employees.While some of those people own WBD shares and may prefer the financials of Paramount's $31-per-share bid to Netflix's $27.75-per-share offer, CNBC spoke to 10 WBD employees in a variety of different roles at the company. All 10, who asked not to be named for fear of potential backlash, expressed concerns about potential job losses and questions of who would ultimately run their divisions if Paramount and WBD are eventually merged.\"It's fair to say people are deflated by the news,\" said one long-term WBD executive.Nonetheless, a WBD-Paramount merger \"is not a done deal,\" as California Attorney General Rob Bonta said yesterday. The transaction must gain regulatory approval both in the U.S. and in Europe. WBD CEO David Zaslav acknowledged at an all-hands meeting Friday that the deal may still be blocked and expressed sympathy for those experiencing a sense of whiplash going from Netflix to Paramount, according to people familiar with the matter.\"The deal may not close. If it doesn't close, we get $7 billion, and we get back to work,\" Zaslav said, according to leaked audio provided to Business Insider. watch nowStill, several WBD employees told CNBC they wished Netflix had acquired WBD, citing several factors.While Paramount and WBD both have core competencies in news, sports, theatrical film and streaming TV, Netflix has far less overlap. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos repeatedly said he planned to leave the WBD business alone, keeping its theatrical business separate from Netflix while also keeping HBO Max as a separate, independent streaming service for the foreseeable future. Netflix also wasn't acquiring WBD's linear cable business with its bid. Employees at CNN, TNT Sports and the old Discovery networks would have remained in their jobs to forge a path as a standalone publicly traded company.Now, WBD employees are staring at potentially massive job cuts. Paramount executives have previously stated they plan to cut $6 billion by eliminating \"duplicative operations\" on \"back office, finance, corporate, legal, technology, infrastructure, et cetera,\" according to Chief Strategy Officer Andy Gordon. Both WBD and Paramount have already gone through thousands of job cuts in recent years. There are also questions about culture and leadership. While Mark Thompson currently runs CNN, Bari Weiss is the editor-in-chief at CBS News and could plausibly have CNN added to her purview. The Wall Street Journal reported in December that Paramount CEO David Ellison promised President Donald Trump he'd make sweeping changes at CNN if he gained control of the network. Three CNN employees who spoke with CNBC said there's rampant fear among their colleagues about Weiss making dramatic changes to the cable network's anchors and tone.\"Despite all the speculation you've read during this process, I'd suggest that you don't jump to conclusions about the future until we know more,\" Thompson wrote in a memo to employees Thursday. CNN media reporter Brian Stelter noted CNN \"is a highly profitable business, and it would be foolish for any owner to put that at risk.\"On the entertainment side, WBD employees fear there may be too many proverbial cooks in the kitchen, which could bog down creativity and innovation for both film and TV. One WBD executive noted that Paramount's President Jeff Shell, Chair of Direct to Consumer Cindy Holland and Chair of TV George Cheeks are all used to being senior leaders in their organizations. Shell was CEO of NBCUniversal. Cheeks was co-CEO of Paramount before it merged with Skydance. Holland was a top executive at Netflix, where she worked for 18 years. How that mix meshes with WBD's entertainment leadership group is an open question and could lead to culture clashes.TNT Sports is run by Luis Silberwasser and has largely steered WBD toward younger audiences with its programming decisions and investments, including Bleacher Report and House of Highlights. CBS Sports, meanwhile, is driven by the demographics of those who watch CBS and has historically catered to an older audience. This could lead to culture clash, or the divisions could mesh nicely as complementary assets.While Silberwasser will have to work with CBS Sports President David Berson on employee duplications, like every other department, there's some reason for optimism in the sports division, because WBD and CBS have worked together for many years producing March Madness, the NCAA men's basketball tournament. That's given the units some degree of familiarity with each other. WBD also lost NBA rights last season. Combining with CBS' robust portfolio of sports rights, including the NFL and the Masters, makes WBD a major player again in sports, even if it's as a subsidiary of CBS. One other repeated concern among employees is the $64 billion in debt coming as part of the $111 billion enterprise value for the deal. Several employees said servicing large debt loads has hindered WBD in recent years, and they feared this could lead to more of the same. Two employees noted there's comfort being a part of a giant company like Netflix, with a market capitalization of more than $400 billion. Paramount Skydance's market valuation is just $15 billion. ",

Democrats remain committed to keep fighting for real reforms to rein in ICE and stop the violence,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, said in a statement.The negotiations over DHS funding are heightened after federal immigration agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens during an immigration surge in Minneapolis, though the Trump administration has since said it would wind down the operation. Democrats are demanding changes to DHS' immigration enforcement tactics. They want to bar federal immigration agents from wearing masks, mandate body cameras and require them to obtain judicial warrants to search homes, among other proposed changes. The White House and Republicans have pushed back on the mask ban and judicial warrant requirement.Senate Democrats on Monday for the second time blocked a House-passed DHS funding bill, as negotiations dragged on.\"Yesterday, the White House made another serious counter offer. Democrats need to make a move to end the shutdown before more Americans are harmed by a lack of funding for critical services like disaster relief,\" a White House official said on Friday.Despite the shutdown, most DHS employees are deemed essential and continue to work. Parts of the agency are funded through last year's sprawling tax and spending bill. But some employees, including those at DHS subagencies like the Transportation Security Administration, Coast Guard and Federal Emergency Management Agency, could be forced to work without pay if the shutdown continues.DHS Secretary Kristi Noem is schedule to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday and the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.— CNBC's Dan Mangan and Garrett Downs contributed to this report.",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he was ordering every U.S. government agency to \"immediately cease\" using technology from the artificial intelligence company Anthropic.Trump in a Truth Social post said there would be a six-month phase-out for agencies such as the Defense Department, which \"are using Anthropic's products, at various levels.\"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, soon after Trump's order, said on X that he was ordering the Pentagon to \"designate Anthropic a Supply-Chain Risk to National Security\" after the AI startup refused to comply with demands about the use of its technology.Anthropic said in a statement late on Friday that it is \"deeply saddened by these developments.\" The company said it will challenge any supply chain risk designation in court. \"We believe this designation would both be legally unsound and set a dangerous precedent for any American company that negotiates with the government,\" Anthropic said. Anthropic, which signed a $200 million contract with the Pentagon in July, wanted assurances that its AI models would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or mass domestic surveillance of Americans.The Pentagon, which strongly resisted that request, set a deadline of 5:01 p.m. ET Friday for Anthropic to agree to its demands that the U.S. military be allowed to use the technology for all lawful purposes. That deadline passed without an agreement.\"Anthropic's stance is fundamentally incompatible with American principles,\" Hegseth said in a statement on X.\"Their relationship with the United States Armed Forces and the Federal Government has therefore been permanently altered.\"\"Anthropic will continue to provide the Department of War its services for a period of no more than six months to allow for a seamless transition to a better and more patriotic service,\" the Defense secretary said. \"America's warfighters will never be held hostage by the ideological whims of Big Tech. This decision is final.\"Trump, in his Truth Social post, wrote, \"The Leftwing nut jobs at Anthropic have made a DISASTROUS MISTAKE trying to STRONG-ARM the Department of War, and force them to obey their Terms of Service instead of our Constitution.\"\"Their selfishness is putting AMERICAN LIVES at risk, our Troops in danger, and our National Security in JEOPARDY.\"\"Therefore, I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic's technology,\" Trump wrote.\"We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again!\"Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who is vice chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, condemned Trump's action.\"The president's directive to halt the use of a leading American AI company across the federal government, combined with inflammatory rhetoric attacking that company, raises serious concerns about whether national security decisions are being driven by careful analysis or political considerations,\" Warner said in a statement.\"President Trump and Secretary Hegseth's efforts to intimidate and disparage a leading American company — potentially as the pretext to steer contracts to a preferred vendor whose model a number of federal agencies have already identified as a reliability, safety, and security threat — pose an enormous risk to U.S. defense readiness and the willingness of the U.S. private sector and academia to work with the IC [Intelligence Community] and DoD, consistent with their own values and legal ethics,\" Warner said. Elon Musk, the mega-billionaire who had been Trump's biggest financial backer in the 2024 election,  owns xAI, which aims to compete directly with Anthropic and another major AI company, OpenAI.Musk in recent weeks has repeatedly bashed Anthropic on his social network X, writing on Friday that the company \"hates Western civilization.\"Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said Thursday that his company \"cannot in good conscience\" allow the Pentagon to use its models without limitation.In a statement on Thursday, Amodei said, \"It is the [Defense] Department's prerogative to select contractors most aligned with their vision. But given the substantial value that Anthropic's  technology provides to our armed forces, we hope they reconsider.\"\"Our  strong preference is to continue to serve the Department and our  warfighters — with our two requested safeguards in place,\" Amodei said. \"Should the Department choose to offboard Anthropic, we will work to enable a smooth  transition to another provider, avoiding any disruption to ongoing  military planning, operations, or other critical missions. Our models  will be available on the expansive terms we have proposed for as long as required.\"CEO and Co-Founder of Anthropic Dario Amodei speaks during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Jan. 20, 2026.Denis Balibouse | ReutersOn Friday, another major AI company, OpenAI, said it has the same \"red lines\" as Anthropic regarding the use of its technology by the Pentagon and other customers.\"We have long believed that AI should not be used for mass surveillance or autonomous lethal weapons, and that humans should remain in the loop for high-stakes automated decisions,\" Open AI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a memo seen by CNBC.OpenAI last year signed its own $200 million contract with the Pentagon.OpenAI's contract is for AI models in non-classified use cases, which include everyday office tasks.Anthropic's contract with the Defense Department included classified work.The Defense Department had no comment on Friday other than pointing to Trump's announcement.Hegseth, in a post on X, included a screengrab of Trump's post, and cc:ed Anthropic and Amodei with the message, \"Thank you for your attention to this matter.\"— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed to this article ",

Here's whyCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedAmid consumer concerns about affordability, the Trump administration has emphasized how Trump's \"big beautiful bill\" may impact the size of tax refunds this season. In a late January release, the White House said average tax refunds could increase \"by $1,000 or more,\" citing several media reports that reference early October research from investment bank Piper Sandler. A Feb. 26 report from Oxford Economics estimates that tax refunds will jump by nearly 20% this year, with more benefits flowing to middle- and upper-income households than usual, based on changes enacted via Trump's 2025 tax cuts.However, individual refunds could vary based on 2025 paycheck withholdings and which of Trump's provisions impact their family's situation, experts say.  Average tax refunds typically increase by late February By law, the IRS can't send refunds claiming the earned income tax credit or the refundable part of the child tax credit, known as the additional child tax credit or ACTC, until Feb. 15. That means the agency's first two filing season statistics releases, reflecting data through Feb. 6 and Feb. 13, respectively, did not include the millions of refunds with these credits.\"As we head into late February, the average refund size pops — it gets larger,\" said Andrew Lautz, director of tax policy for the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank. watch nowFrom Feb. 13 to Feb. 20, the average tax refund size jumped from $2,476 to $3,804. But with limited tax filing data, it's too early to make conclusions about average tax refunds this season, experts say.For 2025 returns, the maximum EITC is worth up to $8,046 for filers with three or more qualifying children. For 2024 returns, the average EITC payment was $2,916, according to the IRS. Trump's tax cuts did not change the EITC for 2025.Trump's legislation made permanent a higher child tax credit and boosted the maximum tax break to $2,200. The refundable portion, ACTC, will continue to adjust to inflation, but Trump's cuts did not change the amount from 2024. The ACTC is worth up to $1,700 for 2025.",

Federal income tax changes would require Congressional action.Meanwhile, some policy experts say they are skeptical.\"To put it simply, the math just doesn't work,\" said Alex Durante, a senior economist at the Tax Foundation, a nonprofit tax policy think tank.

Here's whyCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedWhile tariffs were the main source of U.S. revenue during the 19th century, \"the government was much smaller,\" according to Durante. During that period, federal government spending was slightly above 2% of gross domestic product, compared to nearly 23% in 2023, according to the Tax Foundation's 2025 analysis.   White House spokesman Kush Desai told CNBC in an email that \"President Trump did not say that the current tariff regime can replace federal income taxes. He simply reiterated his belief that a robust tariff policy could — as it did for much of American history — fully fund the federal government.\"Trump's remarks came days after the Supreme Court struck down a large chunk of his tariff agenda. The Trump administration Department of Justice faces a big tariff refund court deadline on Friday. But it's unclear whether importers could see refunds from the billions in levies collected via Trump's higher rates. How tariff revenue compares to income taxes\"It's completely implausible that tariffs can replace the modern system of income tax,\" said Kimberly Clausing, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonprofit think tank. \"They're way too small.\" Clausing co-authored a 2024 report on the topic, which compared the tax base from both types of revenue. In 2023, the U.S. imported $3.1 trillion of goods and levied tax on more than $20 trillion in income, she wrote.During fiscal year 2025, the federal government collected roughly $2.66 trillion from individual income taxes, which was nearly 51% of total revenue, according to Treasury data. By comparison, customs duties were about $195 billion the same year, the Treasury reported.As of Jan. 31, the federal government has received about $924 billion in individual income taxes during fiscal year 2026, which began Oct. 1, compared to roughly $118 billion from customs duties, according to the Treasury.Even if Trump's tariffs reached a \"revenue maximizing level\" of more than 40%, the levies would raise less than one-fifth of individual income taxes collected, Clausing told CNBC.Tariffs that high would be \"ruinous for the economy,\" with other negative effects, including fewer imports, which would impact that revenue, she said.watch now",

Earlier in the day, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth designated Anthropic a \"Supply-Chain Risk to National Security\" after weeks of tense negotiations. The label is typically reserved for foreign adversaries, and it would force DoD vendors and contractors to certify that they don't use Anthropic's models.President Trump also directed every federal agency in the U.S. to \"immediately cease\" all use Anthropic's technology. Anthropic was the first lab to deploy its models across the DoD's classified network, and had been trying to negotiate the ongoing terms of its contract with the agency before talks collapsed. The company wanted assurance that its models would not be used for fully autonomous weapons or mass surveillance of Americans, while the DoD wanted Anthropic to agree to let the military use the models across all lawful use cases. watch nowAltman told employees in a Thursday memo that OpenAI shared the same \"red lines\" as Anthropic. He said in his post Friday that the DoD agreed to its restrictions. \"Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems,\" Altman wrote. The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement.It's not immediately clear why the DoD agreed to accommodate OpenAI and not Anthropic, though government officials have for months criticized Anthropic for allegedly being overly concerned with AI safety. Altman said OpenAI will build \"technical safeguards to ensure its models behave as they should,\" and that the company will deploy personnel to \"help with our models and to ensure their safety.\"\"We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies, which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept,\" Altman wrote. \"We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.\"Anthropic said in a statement Friday that it was \"deeply saddened\" by the Pentagon's decision to label the company a supply chain risk.

Both figures are well ahead of the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation goal and suggest that rising prices are still a factor for the U.S. economy.Stock market futures added to losses following the report. Services prices primarily drove the increase, with a 0.8% monthly rise that was the highest since July 2025. By contrast, goods prices actually fell 0.3%, though core goods prices climbed 0.7%.More than 20% of the increase in services came from margins for professional and commercial equipment wholesaling. On the goods side, energy and food prices both fell while metals prices rose 4.8%.Trade services prices surged 2.5%, helping boost pressures on wholesale inflation.The report comes as President Donald Trump has repeatedly insisted that inflation has been tamed. Pipeline pressures as indicated by the PPI figures could keep the Fed cautious as it weighs its next moves on interest rates. Markets largely expect the Fed to stay on the sidelines until the summer, though Trump and other White House officials have pushed for lower rates.Economists have worried that Trump's tariffs will push inflation higher, though Fed officials largely expect the impact to be temporary. There was some evidence of tariffs in the PPI data, with indexes for apparel and other goods such as intermediate components moving higher.Trump lost a key Supreme Court ruling that overturned his move to use emergency measures to implement the tariffs. However, the president has cited other authorities that will allow him to implement the duties anyway.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump stops to speak to the media as he departs on Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House on Feb. 27, 2026 in Washington, DC. Andrew Harnik | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Friday said that \"I'd love not to use\" the U.S. military to attack Iran, \"but sometimes you have to.\"But Trump also said, \"We haven't made a final decision\" on whether to attack Iran.\"We'll see what happens,\" he said. \"We're talking later today. We'll have some additional talks today.\"Trump's comment to reporters outside the White House came after he expressed frustration at Iran's refusal to comply with American demands to curb its nuclear program.\"We're not thrilled with the way they're negotiating,\" Trump said. \"They cannot have nuclear weapons.\"\"I'm not happy that they're not willing to give us what we have to have,\" Trump said, referring to that condition.Asked by a reporter if there could be a long, drawn-out conflict in the Middle East if the United States attacks Iran, Trump said, \"I guess you could say there's always a risk.\"\"It'd be wonderful if they negotiate, really, in good conscience, good faith,\" he said. \"They are not getting there so far.\"Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been mediating negotiations between the U.S. and Iran, met in Washington, D.C., with Vice President JD Vance and other American officials in a bid to avoid war. A statement issued by Oman's government after the meeting put a positive spin on those talks that was not reflected in Trump's blunt comments.\"The meeting examined the indirect US-Iran negotiations sponsored by the Sultanate of Oman, alongside the diplomatic endeavours seeking to culminate in a just and enduring agreement concerning the nuclear file and to guarantee the peaceful character of Iran's nuclear energy program,\" Oman's government said.\"I am grateful for their engagement and look forward to further and decisive progress in the coming days,\" al-Busaidi said in a post on X. \"Peace is within our reach.\"During an interview with MS Now,  when asked if there was a chance of the United States attacking Iran overnight, al-Busaidi said, \"I can't answer that question, because I don't know.\"\"I think President Trump is sincerely passionate for a deal,\" al-Busaidi said. \"He wants to have a deal. He wants to have a diplomatic solution, and this is what we are trying to do.\"But Trump, in a speech later Friday afternoon in Corpus Christi, Texas, said of Iran, \"We have a very big decision.\"\"We have a country that's been 47 years blowing people's legs off, arms off,\" Trump said. They've been knocking out ships, killing people, lots of people, not only Americans, lots of people.\"Trump said he wanted to \"make a deal that's meaningful.\"\"I'd rather do it the peaceful way,\" Trump said, while calling Iran's government \"very difficult people, dangerous people, very difficult people.\"The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem earlier Friday authorized non-emergency U.S. government personnel and their family members to leave Israel \"due to safety risks.\"Also Friday, the massive American aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald Ford, arrived off Israel's coast.Also on Friday, the State Department said that Secretary of State Marco Rubio would visit Israel on Monday and Tuesday to discuss Iran and other regional issues.",

    "body": "Jack Dorsey, co-founder and chief executive officer of Twitter Inc. and Square Inc., speaks during the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, Florida, on Friday, June 4, 2021.Eva Marie Uzcategui | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesBlock CEO Jack Dorsey's move to cut nearly half the company's workforce is shining a spotlight on a growing question for corporate America: whether advances in artificial intelligence will ultimately mean fewer workers.In an earnings call Thursday, Dorsey said Block will cut about 4,000 jobs.Dorsey framed the move as more than a cost-cutting exercise, instead describing a shift in how companies operate as artificial intelligence becomes more central to business decisions.He also suggested other companies will follow suit.\"I don't think we're early to this realization. I think most companies are late,\" he said. \"Within the next year, I believe the majority of companies will reach the same conclusion and make similar structural changes. I'd rather get there honestly and on our own terms than be forced into it reactively.\"Economists, however, question whether such moves signal a broader shift in the labor market or simply reflect company-specific adjustments.\"This is a function of lax judgment during a period of rapid expansion and the retrenchment that follows,\" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. \"It should be understood within the unique context of that firm, and it does not signal risk to the broader U.S. labor market.\"Doubts about jobsThe layoffs come amid broader questions about the employment picture.Though job cuts have remained low and the unemployment rate is a relatively healthy 4.3%, openings have contracted sharply and hiring in 2025 largely flatlined, with average payroll growth of just 15,000.Still, the tech-related picture looks relatively healthy.The information sector, one proxy for the tech industry, saw its unemployment rate fall to 5% in January, down 0.7 percentage point from a year ago. Job openings have declined in the sector, but demand for some roles remains firm: Postings in software development are up 12% from a year ago, according to Indeed.Most economists remain sanguine on the labor market, even in the current \"low-hire, low-fire\" environment. Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors, said Friday on CNBC that while it is \"healthy\" to discuss AI's potential impact, it is important not to overinterpret individual company decisions.\"I would not extrapolate from Block to the whole U.S. economy,\" Sahm said. \"It's important to understand that these AI tools — the direction you go with them really depends on the leadership. Automation, mass layoffs is not necessarily the only path forward.\"AI's broad impactA widely-discussed speech earlier this week by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller also underscored the challenges and opportunities AI presents.While discussing the Fed's internal use of the technology, Waller said AI is more likely to enhance productivity than eliminate jobs outright.\"When ATMs were first introduced, they didn't eliminate bank tellers. Instead, they changed how banking worked,\" he said. \"The real impact wasn't automation alone — it was how institutions reorganized around technology. AI is similar. The biggest gains won't come from simply adding AI to existing processes. They'll come from rethinking workflows, roles and systems.\"But even if layoffs are not yet widespread — and Dorsey's warnings are not necessarily a broad harbinger — companies are beginning to rethink how they allocate resources.Tech jobs account for only about 5% to 7% of the total labor force, but AI technology itself is spreading far beyond the sector.\"Some jobs are apt to be disrupted by AI\" as companies reconsider the balance between labor and technology, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at Indeed Hiring Lab.\"Companies are really shifting their investments toward capital spending and away from labor,\" Ullrich added. \"They're investing in AI with the hope that it can replace jobs.\"",

    "body": "watch nowU.S. Treasury yields fell Friday as investors reacted to a stronger-than-expected January wholesale inflation report, and a tumbling stock market amid rising fears of artificial intelligence hurting the economy. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell more than 5 basis points to 3.962%, while the 30-year Treasury bond yield dropped more than 3 basis points to 4.631%. The 2-year Treasury note yield was lower by more than 5 basis points at 3.389%.One basis point is equal to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.The latest data point on the economy showed core wholesale prices, stripping out food and energy, rose 0.8% in January, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far above the 0.3% increase economists polled by Dow Jones were anticipating. The headline reading, including all price components, increased 0.5% last month, again higher than the expected 0.3% gain, according to a Dow Jones consensus estimate.  \"Markets did not need the bad inflation news this morning and stocks extended their losses,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS. \"Bond yields fell below the psychological 4.00% level before the producer prices report and you can bet your bottom dollar that bond yields are not going to move back above this key level anytime soon.\"Rising fears that artificial intelligence will lead to large job losses, eventually contributing to economic stagflation, in which rising prices are coupled with slowing economic growth, are also hurting economic sentiment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 500 points, or 1.1%, spurring some investors to move to bonds for safety and consequently pushing yields downward. The potential of AI disruption has increasingly weighed on investors this year, with software stocks slammed on concern that agentic AI will make legacy companies obsolete. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) dropped almost 10% just this month, and is nearly 31% off its recent high.  Investors fear layoffs in the sector are looming, especially after Block said Thursday it's laying off more than 4,000 employees, or roughly half its workforce. Further unsettling markets are President Trump's unclear tariff policies and military tensions between the U.S. and Iran. On Friday, Trump said that he'd \"love not to\" attack Iran, \"but sometimes you have to.\"—  CNBC's Pia Singh contributed to this report",

The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Nov. 5 on Trump's request that it overturn lower-court rulings, which found that a president does not have authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose the country-specific tariffs he implemented earlier this year.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Trump's statement.",

    "body": "Shoppers in Walnut Creek, California, US, on Tuesday, Oct. 7, 2025. David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are pushing inflation generally higher as companies are caught between absorbing the costs or passing them onto customers, according to a Federal Reserve report Wednesday.The central bank's periodic Beige Book report, published eight times a year generally at about six-week intervals, categorized overall economic growth as having \"changed little\" since the last report on Sept. 3. Labor markets \"were largely stable\" as demand was \"muted\" for most of the Fed's 12 districts.When it came to prices, though, Trump's duties implemented in April and then staggered through ensuing months showed an impact.\"Prices rose further during the reporting period,\" the report stated. \"Tariff-induced input cost increases were reported across many Districts, but the extent of those higher costs passing through to final prices varied.\"In some cases, firms held prices unchanged to stay competitive and to appease inflation-sensitive clients. However, some businesses said they were \"fully passing higher import costs along to their customers.\"A few districts reported that slowing demand actually pushed prices down for materials.The trade war has escalated in recent days as China has ordered restrictions on coveted rare earths materials, while Trump has retaliated with a threat of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports.The release comes amid a dearth of relevant economic data due to a government shutdown entering its third week. Key providers such as the Labor and Commerce departments are largely closed due to the impasse.However, Bureau of Labor Statistics workers have been called back to release the pivotal consumer price index report used both as an inflation gauge and to index cost of living adjustments for Social Security recipients. The CPI reading, which normally would have been released Wednesday, will come out Oct. 24, the last inflation reading the Fed will get before its policy meeting Oct. 28-29.The Beige Book said consumer spending nudged lower in recent weeks, though it noted \"strong\" spending on luxury items and travel by upper-income earners. Lower and medium earners, meanwhile, pursued discounts and promotions.Future expectations improved in some districts, though Philadelphia reported caution over a prolonged government shutdown.",

Michael Short | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesSalesforce shares rose as much as 5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the software vendor issued new financial targets for the next few years.The company said it now expects revenue of over $60 billion in 2030, above the $58.37 billion consensus among analysts polled by LSEG.The guidance excludes impact from the pending acquisition of data management company Informatica. The $8 billion deal, announced in May, is slated to close in the fiscal fourth quarter or in the first quarter of the 2027 fiscal year.\"We have had some lower-stage growth for a while,\" Robin Washington, Salesforce's chief operating and financial officer, said during an investor briefing at the company's annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. \"That is reaccelerating.\"She company called for an organic year-over-year revenue growth rate above 10% in the 2026 through 2030 fiscal years. The growth rate has been under 10% since mid-2024.Investors have been concerned, in part because of the rise of \"vibe-coding\" tools for automatically generating software with a few words of human input. Industry observers have predicted that artificial intelligence services might threaten longstanding software providers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in April that AI is creating up to 30% of new code at the company.\"There's a certain amount of, let's just say, nonsense that's out there,\" Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said on Wednesday. \"Like, for example, that these products are writing all the software, and that is not what's happening.\"As of Wednesday's close, Salesforce's stock had fallen 29% for the year, while the Nasdaq has gained 17%.To increase revenue, Salesforce is counting on its Agentforce software for automating customer service and other business processes, said Washington, who also sits on Salesforce's board. The company introduced Agentforce last year as a way for brands to add chat-based customer service agents that connect large language models to internal data.\"Investors continue to ask why Agentforce adoption has been slower than anticipated,\" analysts at RBC Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.Salesforce executives are hoping product enhancements will attract more business.The company on Monday released Agentforce Voice, which allows clients to have agents answer customer service calls. On Tuesday, Salesforce announced larger partnerships with AI model developers Anthropic and OpenAI, bringing their latest models to Agentforce.At Dreamforce, Salesforce pointed to Agentforce adoption at FedEx, Pandora, PepsiCo, Williams Sonoma and other companies.WATCH: People don't understand Agentforce is part and parcel of Salesforce, says CEO Marc Benioffwatch now",

Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesOpenAI CEO Sam Altman said Wednesday that the company is \"not the elected moral police of the world\" after receiving backlash over his decision to loosen restrictions and allow content like erotica within its chatbot ChatGPT.The artificial intelligence startup has expanded its safety controls in recent months as it faced mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors.But Altman said Tuesday in a post on X that OpenAI will be able to \"safely relax\" most restrictions now that it has new tools and has been able to mitigate \"serious mental health issues.\"In December, Altman said it will allow more content, including erotica, on ChatGPT for \"verified adults.\"Altman tried to clarify the move in a post on X on Wednesday, saying OpenAI cares \"very much about the principle of treating adult users like adults,\" but it will still not allow \"things that cause harm to others.\"\"In the same way that society differentiates other appropriate boundaries (R-rated movies, for example) we want to do a similar thing here,\" Altman wrote.The posts are at odds with comments Altman made during a podcast appearance in August, where he said he was \"proud\" of OpenAI's ability to resist certain features, like a \"sex bot avatar,\" that could boost engagement on ChatGPT.\"There's a lot of short-term stuff we could do that would really juice growth or revenue and be very misaligned with that long-term goal,\" Altman said. Read more CNBC tech news$1 trillion-worth of AI deals between OpenAI, Nvidia and others, in one chartWaymo plans robotaxi launch in London, marking its European debutASML looks to calm fears over 2026 growth as it warns of China sales declineMeta removes Facebook page allegedly used to target ICE agents after pressure from DOJIn September, the Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry into OpenAI and other tech companies over how chatbots like ChatGPT could negatively affect children and teenagers. OpenAI is also named in a wrongful death lawsuit with a family who blamed ChatGPT for their teenage son's death by suicide.The company has taken several public steps to enhance safety on ChatGPT in the months following the inquiry and the lawsuit. It launched a series of parental controls late last month, and it is building an age prediction system that will automatically apply teen-appropriate settings for users under 18.On Tuesday, OpenAI announced assembled a council of eight experts who will provide insight into how AI impacts users' mental health, emotions and motivation. Altman posted about the company's aim to loosen restrictions that same day, sparking confusion and swift backlash on social media.Altman said it \"blew up\" much more than he was expecting.His post also caught the attention of advocacy groups like the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which called on OpenAI to reverse its decision to allow erotica on ChatGPT.\"Sexualized AI chatbots are inherently risky, generating real mental health harms from synthetic intimacy; all in the context of poorly defined industry safety standards,\" Haley McNamara, NCOSE's executive director, said in a statement on Wednesday.If you are having suicidal thoughts or are in distress, contact the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 for support and assistance from a trained counselorWATCH: AI is not in a bubble, valuations look ‘pretty reasonable’, says BlackRockwatch now",

Ann Wang | ReutersTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on Thursday reported a 39.1% increase in third-quarter profit from last year, beating estimates and hitting a fresh record as demand for artificial intelligence chips stayed strong.Here are the company's results versus LSEG SmartEstimates:Revenue: 989.92 billion New Taiwan dollars ($33.10 billion) vs. NT$977.46 billion expectedNet income: NT$452.3 billion, vs. NT$417.69 billion TSMC's revenue in the September quarter rose 30.3% from a year ago to NT$989.92 billion, also beating estimates. Net income increased 13.7% from last quarter, which had marked a record high at the time.As Asia's largest technology company by market capitalization, TSMC has benefited from the artificial-intelligence boom, producing advanced AI processors for clients such as Nvidia and Apple.\"Recent developments in AI market continue to be very positive,\" TSMC CEO C.C. Wei said in an earnings call, adding that increasing adoption of AI models by consumers has led to more demand for compute, and by extension, semiconductor products. \"Thus, our conviction in the AI mega trend is strengthening,\" he added.Bolstered by this AI strength, Wei said that the company had raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. In July, the company had expected full-year revenue growth of about 30%.TSMC also increased its expected floor for capacity expansion and upgrades to $40 billion for the full year, up from a previous floor of $38 billion.Cutting-edge chipsTSMC's high-performance computing division, which encompasses artificial intelligence and 5G applications, made up the majority of sales in the July-September quarter, accounting for 57% of revenues.TSMC said advanced chips, with sizes 7-nanometer or smaller, accounted for 74% of TSMC's total wafer revenue in the quarter. In semiconductor technology, smaller nanometer sizes signify more compact transistor designs, which lead to greater processing power and efficiency. watch nowGrowth in TSMC's most advanced chips particularly drove revenue gains in the third quarter, according to Counterpoint Research senior analyst William Li.\"TSMC's robust earnings are a direct reflection of the strong traction at 3nm as well as high utilization at 4/5nm – both of which are being driven by ongoing orders from AI GPU and HPC customers and premium smartphone platforms,\" Li told CNBC in a statement. TSMC executives also said Thursday that they were monitoring U.S. tariff developments as Taiwan negotiates for a lower \"reciprocal\" rate and Washington weighs industry-specific duties on semiconductors. However, TSMC is likely to receive some exemptions. \"We understand there are uncertainties and risks from the potential impact of tariff policies, especially in consumer-related and price-sensitive market segments,\" Wei said, adding that the company would continue to monitor and plan for any impact. TSMC has been investing heavily in facilities in the U.S. — spending that could help reduce its exposure to tariff impacts.Shares of TSMC in Taiwan have risen more than 38% so far this year.",

    "body": "Untere Schleuse wooden bridge in Thun, Switzerland.Education Images | Universal Images Group | Getty ImagesSwitzerland's government on Thursday cut its 2026 economic forecast for the country, citing the Trump administration's punitive tariffs as a \"heavy burden\" on its industries.Officials held their forecast for the Swiss economy to expand by 1.3% this year, but noted that this level of economic growth was \"significantly below-average\" for the country. For next year, they are now forecasting gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 0.9% – down from a previous 2026 forecast of 1.2% growth.\"Higher U.S. tariffs have further clouded the outlook for the Swiss economy,\" officials said in a news release on Thursday.Switzerland is an export-driven economy, and the U.S. was the top foreign destination for its goods in 2024. Back in August, Switzerland was hit with 39% tariffs on goods sent to the U.S. after a Swiss delegation failed to secure a deal with U.S. officials — one of the highest country-specific rates imposed by the Trump administration.The country's biggest exports include watches, pharmaceuticals and precious metals — but the country is also renowned for its luxury goods, chocolate and skincare products. Branded and patented pharma products are newly subject to 100% tariffs upon entry to the U.S., unless their manufacturers have or are building production facilities in America.Swiss officials said in Thursday's update that under current trade conditions, global demand for Swiss goods and services is expected to rise \"only modestly\" in the coming quarters.\"The current trade policy environment presents particular challenges for Switzerland,\" they said. \"The additional tariffs are placing a heavy burden on affected sectors and export-oriented companies, with significant ripple effects expected across the broader economy. Moreover, persistent uncertainty is also dampening economic activity.\"The government also warned that most of America's other trading partners had been granted lower tariff rates, placing Swiss exporters at a competitive disadvantage in the U.S. market. White House trade policy held significant influence over the future trajectory of Switzerland's economy, they said.\"If Switzerland were to reach an agreement with the U.S. or if international trade policy were to ease, a more favorable development would be expected,\" they said. \"Overall, however, downside risks currently dominate.\"Beyond Trump's tariffs, demand for the Swiss franc is also adding to Switzerland's economic and diplomatic woes, with the currency – typically seen as a safe haven asset in times of broader volatility – gaining more than 12% this year amid lingering uncertainty. The rising franc has created headwinds for the country's central bank by putting downward pressure on prices as policymakers battle to avoid disinflation and negative interest rates.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconU.S. dollar/Swiss francOfficials said on Thursday that the Swiss franc was continuing to play a role in Switzerland's economic challenges – and cautioned that a further strengthening of the franc was possible.\"A deterioration in the international environment cannot be ruled out,\" they said, noting that risks related to a market correction, global sovereign debt and the geopolitical landscape persisted.\"Should any of these risks materialize, further upward pressure on the Swiss franc would be expected,\" they said.Risks are mountingCharlotte de Montpellier, senior economist, France and Switzerland at ING, told CNBC on Thursday that \"risks for the Swiss economy are mounting.\"\"Its exposure to the US market is big, amounting to 4% of GDP,\" de Montpellier said in an email. \"I estimate a cumulative direct impact of the current increase of US tariffs to 39% on Swiss GDP of about 0.86% in the first two years.\"De Montpellier recently revised her own growth forecast for Switzerland for 2026 down to 0.8% – almost half the growth rate she was forecasting at the beginning of this year.\"I believe that the risk are tilted to the downside and the likelihood of having a quarter of negative growth has strongly increased,\" she said. \"The Swiss economy, long buoyed by pharmaceutical exports, now faces a period of heightened uncertainty that will lead to a sharp deceleration of activity momentum.\"Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said on Thursday that the new forecasts from the Swiss government were in line with her own.\"A fall in goods exports, as indicated by monthly nominal goods trade figures, coupled with falling investment — in light of the surge in uncertainty and despite [Swiss National Bank] rate cuts, which will ultimately feed through to lower interest rates faced by firms — means we expect the Swiss economy to enter recession in the second half of this year,\" she told CNBC via email. \"We think Swiss GDP will fall by 0.2% quarter-to-quarter in both Q3 and Q4.\"'Terrible news' for companiesSpeaking to CNBC's Carolin Roth on Wednesday, Georges Kern, CEO of Swiss luxury watchmaker Breitling, labeled the U.S. tariffs \"terrible news\" for Switzerland.\"39% tariffs is horrible,\" he said. \"Still, I believe it will be solved. Swiss politicians are really understanding how to deal with businesspeople. The Trump administration, these are businesspeople, these are not classic politicians ... But I'm confident that within the next couple of weeks there will be a much better solution than the 39%.\"watch nowKern said that as the tariffs came into effect, Breitling had hiked prices globally to offset the impact, noting that luxury brands had more flexibility in this regard.\"[In] the U.S. we increased prices 4%, but also worldwide to balance the cost of the tariffs because you cannot just increase prices to the consumer by 39%,\" he explained. \"Thank god we have a certain pricing power at our price point, I don't think it will impact us dramatically, actually we're growing.\"",

    "body": "Jamie Dimon, chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., at the Institute of International Finance (IIF) during the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 24, 2024. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe era of artificial intelligence on Wall Street, and its impact on workers, has begun.Big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are unveiling plans to reimagine their businesses around AI, technology that allows for the mass production of knowledge work.That means that even during a blockbuster year for Wall Street as trading and investment banking spins off billions of dollars in excess revenue — not typically a time the industry would be keeping a tight lid on head count — the companies are hiring fewer people.JPMorgan said Tuesday in its third-quarter earnings report that while profit jumped 12% from a year earlier to $14.4 billion, head count rose by just 1%.The bank's managers have been told to avoid hiring people as JPMorgan deploys AI across its businesses, CFO Jeremy Barnum told analysts.JPMorgan is the world's biggest bank by market cap and a juggernaut across Main Street and Wall Street finance. Last month, CNBC was first to report about JPMorgan's plans to inject AI into every client and employee experience and every behind-the-scenes process at the bank.The bank has \"a very strong bias against having the reflexive response to any given need to be to hire more people,\" Barnum said Tuesday. JPMorgan had 318,153 employees as of September.JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told Bloomberg this month that AI will eliminate some jobs, but that the company will retrain those impacted and that its overall head count could grow.'Constrain headcount'At rival investment bank Goldman Sachs, CEO David Solomon on Tuesday issued his own vision statement around how the company would reorganize itself around AI. Goldman is coming off a quarter where profit surged 37% to $4.1 billion.\"To fully benefit from the promise of AI, we need greater speed and agility in all facets of our operations,\" Solomon told employees in a memo this week.\"This doesn't just mean re-tooling our platforms,\" he said. \"It means taking a front-to-back view of how we organize our people, make decisions, and think about productivity and efficiency.\"The upshot for his workers: Goldman would \"constrain headcount growth\" and lay off a limited number of employees this year, Solomon said.Goldman's AI project will take years to implement and will be measured against goals including improving client experiences, higher profitability and productivity, and enriching employee experiences, according to the memo.Even with these plans, which is first looking at reengineering processes like client onboarding and sales, Goldman's overall head count is rising this year, according to bank spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli.Tech inspired?The comments around AI from the largest U.S. banks mirror those from tech giants including Amazon and Microsoft, whose leaders have told their workforces to brace for AI-related disruptions, including hiring freezes and layoffs.Companies across sectors have become more blunt this year about the possible impacts of AI on employees as the technology's underlying models become more capable and as investors reward businesses seen as ahead on AI.In banking, the dominant thinking is that workers in operational roles, sometimes referred to as the back and middle office, are generally most exposed to job disruption from AI.For instance, in May a JPMorgan executive told investors that operations and support staff would fall by at least 10% over the next five years, even while business volumes grew, thanks to AI.At Goldman Sachs, Solomon seemed to warn the firm's 48,300 employees that the next few years might be uncomfortable for some.\"We don't take these decisions lightly, but this process is part of the long-term dynamism our shareholders, clients, and people expect of Goldman Sachs,\" he said in the memo. \"The firm has always been successful by not just adapting to change, but anticipating and embracing it.\"watch now",

Hussein Faleh | AFP | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told him New Delhi will stop buying oil from Russia, though the move will take time.\"[Modi] assured me today that they will not be buying oil from Russia. That's a big stop.\" Trump said at the press briefing in the Oval Office. \"Now we've got to get China to do the same thing.\"He added that Washington was unhappy with New Delhi's purchases of Russian crude because it allowed Moscow to continue waging its \"ridiculous war\" in Ukraine.However, the U.S. president also said that the halt will not be immediate, and there will be \"a little bit of a process,\" without giving a clear timeline.India's external affairs ministry said Friday that the country's oil import decisions are driven by efforts to protect consumers by ensuring stable energy prices and securing supplies.The ministry's priority was to \"safeguard the interests of the Indian consumer in a volatile energy scenario,\" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.He added that India's import policies are guided \"entirely\" by that goal.Jaiswal said that India has sought for years to expand energy trade with the U.S. \"This has steadily progressed in the last decade,\" he said, adding that \"the current Administration has shown interest in deepening energy cooperation with India. Discussions are ongoing.\"India and Russian crudeIndia's imports of Russian oil have been a sticking point in the relationship between Washington and New Delhi. Trump slapped additional tariffs of 25% on India back in August, raising the total levy to 50%, while India has called out the U.S. for its trade with Russia.\"If India doesn't buy [Russian] oil, it makes [ending the war] much easier,\" Trump said. \"They assured me within a short period of time, they will not be buying oil from Russia, and they will go back to Russia after the war is over.\"On Thursday, Brent crude futures climbed 0.82% to $62.43 a barrel by 10:31 p.m. ET, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures climbed 0.89% to $58.79.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconIndia is one of the biggest buyers of Russian oil. Data from research firm Kpler shows Russia exports about 3.35 million barrels of crude per day, with India taking about 1.7 million and China 1.1 million.New Delhi has defended those purchases, with Energy Minister Hardeep Singh Puri telling CNBC in July that New Delhi helped stabilize global energy prices and was encouraged by the U.S. to do so.\"If people or countries had stopped buying at that stage, the price of oil would have gone up to 130 dollars a barrel. That was a situation in which we were advised, including by our friends in the United States, to please buy Russian oil, but within the price cap,\" Puri said.Russian sales of crude oil have been placed under a price cap by the G7 nations and the European Union since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.That price cap, set at $47.6 per barrel, aims to limit Moscow's revenue from oil exports, constricting the country's ability to finance its war in Ukraine.Stock Chart IconStock chart icon",

The airline increased capacity 7% in the third quarter over last year. Unit passenger revenue for the three months ended Sept. 30 fell 3.3% for domestic travel and 7.1% for international. Sales from its lucrative loyalty program rose 9%.In an interview last month, United CEO Scott Kirby defended the airline's growth plan and said the carrier was winning loyal customers through its network, new technology like complimentary inflight Wi-Fi, refreshed cabins and new lounges.\"Those investments over almost a decade, combined with great service from our people, have allowed United to win and retain brand-loyal customers, leading to economic resilience even with macro economic volatility through the first three quarters of the year and significant upside as the economy and demand are improving in the fourth quarter,\" Kirby said in a release Wednesday.Still, for the third quarter, United beat earnings expectations, although its revenue fell short of estimates.Here is what United Airlines reported for the quarter that ended Sept. 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.78 adjusted vs. $2.62 expectedRevenue: $15.23 billion vs. $15.33 billion expectedUnited's third-quarter revenue was $15.23 billion, up 2.6% from $14.84 billion last year. Net income fell 1.7% to $949 million or $2.90 a share. Adjusting for one-time items including debt, among other things, United posted income of $909 million or $2.78 a share.The carrier is vying with Delta Air Lines to win over more affluent travelers who splurge on seats, and it has expanded its global network with far-flung destinations like Greenland and Mongolia. United said in the third quarter, its premium-cabin revenue, which includes first class and other, roomier seats, rose 6%. United's sales from no-frills basic economy 4% year over year.In the spring and early summer, United and other carriers trimmed their earnings forecasts they made at the start of the year, after passenger demand dipped amid on-again, off-again tariffs, and an oversupply of flights weighed on airfare.",

    "body": "Upgrade CEO Renaud Laplanche speaks at a conference in Brooklyn, New York, in 2018.Alex Flynn | Bloomberg via Getty ImagesUpgrade, the online lender started by LendingClub founder Renaud Laplanche, has raised a new round of funding that values the startup at $7.3 billion.The company said in a press release on Thursday that it raised $165 million in a round led by Neuberger Berman, with participation from LuminArx Capital Management. Laplanche, who created Upgrade in 2016, said it's the first time the company has raised money since 2021. \"We've been cash flow positive over the past three years, so we didn't have to do a new round,\" Laplanche said in an interview. Upgrade got its start offering relatively small personal loans, operating in a similar market as LendingClub. The company has since expanded deeper into financial services with checking and savings accounts, a credit card, credit health monitoring and a buy now, pay later offering. In 2023, Upgrade acquired BNPL travel company Uplift for $100 million.Revenue has more than doubled since the company's last fundraise, Laplanche said, and annualized revenue passed $1 billion in May.Laplanche, who took LendingClub public in 2014, said Upgrade is looking to IPO but wanted additional capital for its balance sheet in the meantime. He said the company is also establishing a new valuation as it begins to offer employee liquidity. \"We were probably 12 to 18 months away from an IPO at this stage,\" he said. \"So we wanted to go ahead and make sure everyone could sell a little bit of stock now without having to wait for the IPO.\"Although consumer lending is still dominated by traditional banks like JPMorgan Chase, Laplanche said the majority of Upgrade's customers are migrating from the legacy banks to take advantage of more automated and faster services.\"This year, we're focusing mostly on making the customer experience make sense across multiple products and making sure that the customer who might have joined Upgrade through a BNPL product has a very seamless experience,\" Laplanche said.The company has also been focusing on home improvement and auto financing, areas that surpassed $2 billion and $1 billion, respectively, in total loan originations earlier this year.Competition is rising across the board. Chime, which offers an array of online banking services, went public in June. SoFi has been gaining popularity. And fintech companies including PayPal and Square parent Block have been adding more banking services to their portfolios. Within BNPL, there's Affirm and Klarna, which held its IPO last month. Laplanche said Upgrade's focus in BNPL has been in the travel industry, through relationships with airlines, cruise lines, car rental companies and hotels. \"It's a pretty specific industry that's different from retail, where Klarna and Affirm are stronger,\" he said.WATCH: Trust is the key to unlocking real-time paymentswatch now",

    "body": "Drazen_ | E+ | Getty ImagesA version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank, a weekly guide to the high-net-worth investor and consumer. Sign up to receive future editions, straight to your inbox.Over the next 25 years, more than $120 trillion in wealth will be passed down to inheritors, according to Cerulli Associates.Only 27% of these future beneficiaries — primarily widows and children — plan to keep their benefactor's wealth advisor, per Cerulli's survey of investors with at least $250,000 in financial assets. The share drops to 20% for those who have already inherited their riches, according to the report released in September.However, most heirs aren't firing their benefactors' wealth advisors in favor of self-directed investing and digital products. When asked why they chose another route, half of those surveyed said they already had their own advisor. The second-most popular reason, at 28%, was not having a relationship with their benefactors' advisor. Only 14% said they didn't want to work with a financial advisor at all, and 10% said the advisor didn't meet their specific investment needs. Respondents to the survey could pick multiple reasons.\"Keep in mind, if the parents die in their 70s or 80s, the inheritor is between 40 and 60,\" said John McKenna, research analyst at Cerulli. \"In most of these cases, they have matured into wealth management clients. They have relationships, and they're just going to be adding incrementally to their existing relationships rather than starting a new one with a legacy advisor.\"For their part, benefactors who are planning to pass their wealth down are largely ambivalent about whether their heirs use the same advisors despite saying they are largely satisfied with their service, Cerulli found. While just over a quarter of those surveyed said they wished their inheritors would keep their advisor, more than half said they were unsure or that it was up to their beneficiaries. Seven percent said they did not want their heirs to use their advisor, with the most popular reason being that the parties didn't already have a relationship.The crux of the problem, according to Scott Smith, senior director of advice relationships at Cerulli, is that clients are often reluctant to discuss their estate plans with their families. Even among investors with more than $5 million in financial assets, 20% said they intended for heirs to learn about their wealth after their death. The actual number of procrastinators is likely higher, as 34% of high-net-worth heirs said they were told these details after their benefactor died.\"Benefactors believe that they will talk to their next generation about this stuff before they die,\" said Smith. \"But when we ask the next generation, these conversations didn't happen.\"As a result, advisors may have few opportunities to talk to their client's children and explain what they can offer, Smith said. It's up to the advisor to encourage clients to stop putting off uncomfortable discussions, he said.\"Reinforce it with the primary contact that it's important for the survivor to get involved early on so they have their feet securely on the ground and they aren't panicking as soon as it happens,\" he said. \"It's not just that we're trying to retain the assets. We're trying to make it easier for your survivor when you pass.\"",

    "body": "Eddy Cue, senior vice president of internet software and services at Apple Inc., arrives for a morning session of the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, U.S., on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesApple services chief Eddy Cue said the iPhone maker would like to buy more sports rights, but the company would need to be able to do something \"unique and special\" with the broadcast.\"We don't have to do sports the way that they are. There's plenty of people doing that,\" Cue told CNBC's Alex Sherman at the Autosport Business Exchange NYC.Apple TV, the company's streaming service, currently airs Major League Baseball games on Friday nights and has a package for Major League Soccer that allows subscribers to watch all MLS matches.But Apple hasn't secured rights to major American sports such as the National Football League, which sold its NFL Sunday Ticket package to Google's YouTube, or the National Basketball Association, which has some games appear on Amazon Prime.Apple Original Films released a licensed movie called \"F1\" this summer that made over $550 million at the box office. Cue declined to say if Apple had acquired broadcast rights to the F1 racing league.Cue, who is the senior vice president of services at Apple, said that there were a lot of things about sports broadcasts that he would like to fix, including blackouts, the need to subscribe to multiple services and issues with viewers accessing streams while traveling.He said that the way that Apple TV broadcasts MLS, in which viewers aren't blacked out and can stream games around the world, \"fixed\" some of those issues.\"If we want people to watch games, and we want all of sports to grow, some of these things need to be fixed,\" Cue said, suggesting that leagues could demand all of its broadcast partners work together to enable features like picture-in-picture when multiple games are playing at the same time but on different streaming services.When Apple broadcasts sports, the company is looking to create a \"level of differentiation\" from most broadcasts, said Cue, noting some of the things that Apple TV does with its MLB broadcasts.He said that Apple TV has better video quality than other broadcasters because it doesn't compress its video. He also cited a recent MLB broadcast in which Apple placed an iPhone on a foul pole for an unusual camera angle during the game.Ultimately, Apple would like to do deals with leagues to broadcast their games across international markets, rather than secure packages for individual games, as the company does now with MLB. Cue said that Friday Night Baseball, which debuted in 2022, was a \"test\" for Apple to figure out what it was getting into.\"You had to start somewhere to learn a little bit about what it takes to broadcast before you decide to take on a whole league and broadcast worldwide,\" Cue said.WATCH: Apple's China shipments grow 0.6%watch now",

    "body": "watch nowAs U.S. states start to react to growing constituent concerns around the risks associated with artificial intelligence use, Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn said moving forward with a federal preemption standard is \"imperative.\"Earlier this week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a series of bills focused on those concerns — while also vetoing some strict AI conditions legislators hoped for — requiring safeguards around chatbots, labels around the mental risks of social media apps, and tools that require age verification in device maker app stores.In addition, Utah and Texas have also signed laws implementing AI safeguards for minors, and other states have indicated similar regulations could be on the horizon.\"The reason the states have stepped in, whether it's to protect consumers or protect children, is because the federal government has, to date, not been able to pass any federal preemptive legislation,\" Blackburn said at the CNBC AI Summit on Wednesday in Nashville. \"We have to have the states standing in the gap until such time that Congress will say no to the big tech platforms.\"Blackburn has long been a proponent of legislation around children's online safety and regulation of social media, introducing the Kid's Online Safety Act in 2022 that aims to establish guidelines to protect minors from harmful material on the platforms. The bipartisan legislation has passed the Senate with an overwhelming majority, and Blackburn said while big tech companies have worked to hold up the legislation from passage in both chambers, \"We are hopeful the House is going to take it up and pass it.\"The concerns that the Act was aimed to address as it relates to social media have now cascaded alongside the rise in AI, Blackburn said.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) speaks during a rally organized by Accountable Tech and Design It For Us to hold tech and social media companies accountable for taking steps to protect kids and teens online on January 31, 2024 in Washington, D.C.Jemal Countess | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty Images\"One of the things we've heard from so many people involved in this is that you have to have an online consumer privacy protection bill so that people have the ability to set those firewalls and protect the virtual you, as I call it,\" she said, adding that \"once an LLM scoops [your data and information], then they are using that to train that model.\"Blackburn is also focused on several other ways of safeguarding the information that AI is using, including a bill focused on how AI can use your name, image or likeness without your consent.\"We have to have a way to protect our information in the virtual spaces just as we do in the physical space,\" she said.With the fast advancement of AI, Blackburn acknowledged that regulation would require a focus on \"end-use utilizations and legislate that framework in that manner and not focus on a given delivery system or a given technology.\"That also means reacting to the ways that AI companies change their products. Earlier this week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company will be able to \"safely relax\" most restrictions now that it has been able to mitigate \"serious mental health issues,\" adding that the company is \"not the elected moral police of the world.\"Blackburn said that legislators are increasingly hearing from \"parents who know what is happening to their children and that they can't un-experience or unsee something that they have been through with these chatbots or in the virtual world or the metaverse.\"\"I have talked to so many people who are now saying kids are not going to get cell phones until they're 16, and many parents believe that is just like driving a car,\" she said. \"They're not going to allow their kids to have that because we as a society have to put rules and laws in place that protect children and minors.\"",

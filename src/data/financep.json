    "body": "Going on vacation is a great way for workers to decompress from their busy schedules, but some don't feel comfortable taking even a few days off, according to a new report from FlexJobs.Though the majority have access to PTO, the report found that 23% of employees didn't take a single vacation day in the past year, based on a survey of over 3,000 U.S. workers.There are a few reasons why workers may be reluctant to take time off, according to FlexJobs career expert Keith Spencer.Workload was a major concern for many employees: 43% felt that they had too much work to justify taking vacation, while 30% worried about falling behind, according to the survey.\"I think a lot of teams are being asked to do more with less, so there might just be kind of a lack of coverage if your team is understaffed,\" Spencer says. \"People might be feeling sort of guilty about leaving their team with a burden while they're gone.\"Team culture can also play a role, according to Spencer: 29% of workers feel guilty or \"pressured to appear committed\" at their jobs, which may lead them to avoid taking PTO. Moreover, 25% of workers said that their manager would likely respond in a \"discouraging\" manner if they asked to take a full week off.\"You might be getting negative signals from your manager or leadership in general,\" Spencer says. \"When you request time off, their nonverbals might make it seem like it's kind of a pain and not really accepted.\"Over one third of employees feel that they simply don't have enough PTO to take vacation, the survey found.Still, even workers with unlimited PTO don't always use it due to \"unclear expectations,\" according to Spencer: Workers are left wondering, \"Well, is it really unlimited? When am I allowed to take it?\" he says.The benefits of taking PTOTaking time off can actually make you a better worker, Spencer says.\"People who are getting enough rest are more focused and more creative in their work. They tend to be more resilient when challenges do arise,\" he says.Conversely, if workers don't take time to recharge and decompress, they may be at a greater risk for burnout.\"You see stress levels rise, you see an overall reduced mental well-being, you have lower engagement, lower morale,\" he says.Spencer encourages workers to \"advocate for themselves\" when it comes to using PTO. Employees have the right to take advantage of their workplace benefits, he says.\"Your PTO is part of your compensation package. It's not a favor your organization is doing for you,\" he says. \"You should be willing to advocate for that time you need off, that time you need to rest.\"Spencer advises employees to \"communicate clearly and in advance\" when they're planning to take time off.If your manager isn't pro-PTO, he suggests framing your vacation time in terms of output and productivity, he says.\"If your PTO is coming after a really intense time period in your year, then you could say, 'Hey, I really think I need to recharge a bit before we jump into the next thing,'\" he says.Even if your company doesn't encourage time off, Spencer encourages workers to \"confidently model healthy usage of PTO.\" It might even have a positive effect on your workplace culture, he says.\"It's definitely clear that more rest is not just a benefit to your team, it's a benefit to your entire organization,\" he says.Want to level up your AI skills?

    "body": "Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesBeyond Meat shares slashed gains Wednesday, briefly dipping into negative territory as the meme stock rally faltered.The food company known for its plant-based burgers and sausages rose just 15% in midday trading on Wednesday, after surging 112% at one point in the session. The stock reached a high of $7.69 during the session, after closing Tuesday at $3.62. It was last above $4, up 14%. It's the latest in an extraordinary week for the stock. On Monday, the stock rallied more than 127% after Roundhill Investments, which develops thematic ETFs, added the name to its Roundhill Meme Stock ETF (MEME).That decision appeared to have the added effect of driving a short squeeze in the stock, as investors rushed to cover their positions. According to FactSet data, more than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short.On Tuesday, Beyond Meat soared 146% in its best day ever, after saying it will expand distribution at Walmart's stores.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, year-to-date performanceShares of Beyond Meat have been under pressure for a long time. After making its public debut in 2019, when the stock soared past $230 per share, it has since become a penny stock. The stock has slid in each of the last five years, falling more than 47% in 2021, 81% in 2022, 27% in 2023, and 57% in 2024. It's down more than 3% in 2025.The latest bad news for the stock came last week, when shares tumbled more than 67% to end the week at just 65 cents after Beyond Meat said it has finalized a debt deal.This week's comeback, however, is reminiscent of the height of the pandemic, when retail traders took to on online message boards such as WallStreetBets to coordinate moves behind high-risk, aggressive trades.In 2021, Bank of America said Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock to watch, though it ended that same year with losses.The return of Beyond Meat could be the latest signal of a frothy market, one that is relentlessly climbing higher in spite of concerns around elevated valuations and a possible AI bubble. Indeed, Roundhill shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest. It revived it earlier this month as retail traders dove back into the bull market.In response to someone on Reddit's online forum WallStreetBets saying they bought 10,000 shares of Beyond Meat for $7.50, one commenter wrote Wednesday, \"Youre already down 7k, impressive.\"Another posted: \"You know the economy is cooked when BYND stock is making a comeback.\"",

    "body": "Visitors are caught in the reflection of a store offering 50% off on all items on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica on July 16, 2024. Genaro Molina | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA steady stream of promotions across the fashion industry has left consumers suffering from \"discount burnout\" ahead of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to a new report from consulting firm AlixPartners released Wednesday. The firm surveyed more than 9,000 U.S. consumers on their preferences and priorities across 140 retailers and nine fashion sectors. The report found shoppers see price increases as \"inevitable,\" and cost has become less important to them when they are deciding whether to buy new clothes or accessories.On average, the value of importance respondents assigned to price dropped 13% compared with last year and fell across all sectors except for luxury and beauty, the survey found. Meanwhile, 30% fewer consumers ranked sales and finding the best deal as \"very important\" compared with last year, even in the off-price sector, where deal hunting fell from the top factor respondents were considering to number 19In the aftermath of President Donald Trump's tariff increases on dozens of countries in April, retailers leaned on discounts and promotions to alleviate consumer concerns that prices were rising because of trade policy, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author. But now there's \"fatigue\" around promotions and shoppers are looking for more than just a discount, she said. Consistent pricing between stores and online, value for the money, and quality are among the top things shoppers are prioritizing when spending, she said. They're also looking for a better store experience. While more than 60% of shoppers surveyed plan to make over half of their fashion purchases in stores this holiday, the amount of time shoppers are spending in stores dropped 3% and basket size fell 5% over the last two years, the report found. \"We have higher foot track traffic and lower baskets. Something's missing that they're not converting,\" said Lapinsky. \"So what is it about that experience in-store that's not helping them convert?\"The findings come as the retail industry prepares for a holiday shopping season that could be weaker than previous years amid falling consumer sentiment, an uncertain job market and persistent inflation. The tough economic backdrop coloring the holiday season is putting a renewed focus on execution, quality and brand strength, especially as many retailers raise prices to offset the cost of tariffs. Lapinsky said the survey's findings are a \"warning\" for retailers that discounts won't be enough to drive demand this holiday season. \"They've always had this lever of discount to drive traffic and get folks into the store, but when you're compounding it with tariffs and their need to raise prices … that lever for them is going to become even more risky,\" said Lapinsky. \"It's not necessarily going to work the way it has, because of this fatigue.\" The luxury sector, where price rose in importance for shoppers as a factor when they are spending, provides a cautionary tale for the retail industry, the report said. Over the last few years, brands \"dramatically raised prices,\" the firm said, citing Chanel's decision to increase the price of one of its bags from $5,800 to $11,300 between 2019 and 2025 as an example. The sudden spike led consumers to pull back from the sector and trade down to premium brands \"that felt more rationally priced,\" the report said. \"The same dynamic applies across other sectors,\" the report said. \"Retailers who attempt to hold the line on pricing by reducing quality risk losing credibility.\"",

    "body": "An aerial view of residential homes, many with solar panels, on Sept. 17, 2025 in Fontana, California. Mario Tama | Getty ImagesMortgage rates last week dropped to the lowest level in a month, pushing more borrowers to refinance. Potential homebuyers, however, were not as enthused.The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances, $806,500 or less, decreased last week to 6.37% from 6.42%, with points falling to 0.59 from 0.61, including the origination fee, for loans with a 20% down payment.As a result, applications to refinance a home loan, which are most sensitive to weekly changes in interest rates, rose 4% for the week and were 81% higher than the same week one year ago, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The rate on the 30-year fixed was 15 basis points higher a year ago. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.\"The refinance index increased 4 percent, driven by a 6 percent increase in conventional refinances and a 12 percent increase in FHA refinance applications, as borrowers remain attentive to these opportunities to lower their monthly mortgage payment. VA refinances bucked the trend and were down 12 percent,\" said Joel Kan, an MBA economist, in a release.Kan noted that demand for adjustable-rate mortgages rose again.\"ARM applications increased 16 percent over the week, which pushed the ARM share to 11 percent, with the ARM rate more than 80 basis points lower than the 30-year fixed rate,\" he added.Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.ARM applications usually rise when overall interest rates climb, not when they fall. This increase speaks more to currently high home prices than it does to rates. Buyers are doing everything then can to afford what's available.Applications for a mortgage to purchase a home dropped 5% for the week and were 20% higher than the same week one year ago. Buyers are finding more supply on the market, and prices are starting to soften slightly in some areas, but there are those who are waiting, expecting rates to come down even further.And mortgage rates did come down even more to start this week, according to a separate survey from Mortgage News Daily.\"Some lenders are offering their lowest rates in over a year, and some in over 3 years,\" wrote Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at MND, although there was no particular reason for the drop.",

Construction of that facility, which is being built on a site the size of roughly 1,700 football fields, is expected to finish by 2030.Local utility Entergy told CNBC in June that the new data center could consume about twice as much electricity as the city of New Orleans on a peak day.Meta has been spending heavily on artificial intelligence amid a broader race with other tech giants like Alphabet and ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which are also developing gigantic data centers to power future AI models.OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank in January formed the Stargate joint venture that will see the companies invest $500 billion to develop data centers over the coming years. The first Stargate data center site came online in September 180 miles west of Dallas in Abilene, Texas.Last week, Google said that it would invest $15 billion on a data center project in southern India that will be the search giant's largest AI hub in the world outside of the U.S.WATCH: A rotation out of the US is a bet against the AI trade.watch now",

    "body": "Mary Barra speaks onstage during WSJ's Future of Everything 2025 at The Glasshouse on May 28, 2025 in New York City.Dia Dipasupil | Getty ImagesNEW YORK — General Motors is targeting a suite of new software initiatives for its vehicles over the next three years, including an in-vehicle artificial intelligence assistant from Google and a driver-assistance system that can largely control the vehicle without human interaction or monitoring.GM said the conversational Google Gemini AI will begin launching in its vehicles next year, followed by the new driver-assistance system, which will allow drivers to be hands-free and take their eyes off the road under certain circumstances, in 2028.GM CEO Mary Barra and other executives made the announcements Wednesday as part of a \"GM Forward\" software event that also showcased other initiatives designed to \"transform the car from a mode of transportation into an intelligent assistant,\" the automaker said.The company also announced that it is working on a new centralized computing platform, which is planned to roll out starting with the Escalade IQ in 2028; increased use of collaborative robots, also known as cobots, that can work alongside humans; and expanding availability of products from its GM Energy business.GM displays its plans for a new centralized computing platform during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025, in New York City.Michael Wayland | CNBC\"Today we'll share our vision for our vehicles, our industry and how we're driving the future of transportation forward,\" Barra said to kick off the event in lower Manhattan.'New era of mobility'GM said the announcements are meant to usher in a \"new era of mobility\" for the company, which has struggled to achieve such initiatives in the past. Its previous efforts at moving forward include announcing plans in 2021 to double revenue by 2030, led by many now-defunct growth businesses, as well as growing annual software and services revenue to between $20 billion to $25 billion.In recent years, it also killed an \"Ultra Cruise\" system meant to be able to drive in 95% of circumstances that was initially due to come out in 2023 and folded its Cruise robotaxi business.GM executives on Wednesday declined to discuss revenue potential of the new announcements. CFO Paul Jacobson has previously walked back the doubling revenue goal, but has noted the company's growing revenue, up 9.1% last year to $187.44 billion.GM graphic of the automaker's upcoming centralized computing design that's set to debut in the Cadillac Escalade IQ in 2028.GMGM President Mark Reuss on Wednesday said the company's revenue plans are \"pretty much on track … maybe a year or two different\" as it plans to continue to grow revenue, especially with the technologies announced Wednesday. He also said these initiatives are \"very different\" than prior announcements, as they're tangible products that are entering the market shortly.As of the third quarter of this year, GM recognized $2 billion from software services. That's up from 2021, when the plans were announced, when it took the full year to hit that mark. It also cited $5 billion in deferred revenue, up 90% from a year earlier, to end the third quarter.The event comes a day after GM reported standout third-quarter earnings and upped its guidance, pushing the stock to have its second-best day on record since the automaker's 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.GM stock on Wednesday was trading relatively flat.AIGM said the AI system from Google, which its infotainment system is developed on, will make \"it possible to talk to your car as naturally as you would to a fellow passenger.\"\"Our vision is to create a car that knows you, that looks out for you, and just meets your needs, even before you say,\" Sterling Anderson, GM chief product officer, said during the event.Anderson called the centralized computing a \"foundational piece\" of the company's plans in increasing the capabilities of its vehicles.GM Chief Product Officer Sterling Anderson during the automaker's \"GM Forward\" event on Oct. 22, 2025 in New York City.Michael Wayland / CNBCThe Detroit automaker said it expects to update select vehicles from the 2016 model year to all new models in the U.S. beginning next year with the AI tech.GM also said it plans to develop its own \"AI, custom-built\" technology in the years to come but did not provide an exact timeframe.\"In the future, we will introduce our own AI fine-tuned to your vehicle,\" said David Richardson, a former Apple executive who is now GM vice president of software and services engineering. \"Think of this as an assistant. It's going to anticipate your needs, offer timely help and make every journey more personable and more enjoyable.\"Hands-free, eyes-offGM said it plans for its upgraded advanced driver-assistance system, also known as ADAS, to feature hands-free, \"eyes-off\" driving technology, beginning on the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV, which currently starts around $127,500, in 2028.The automaker then expects to expand the availability of the tech to other models, company executives said.\"Autonomy will make our roads safer. They'll give customers back their most valuable asset: time. It'll be a cornerstone of GM product portfolio going forward,\" Anderson said.Cadillac Escalade IQ with lidarGMThe vehicle will use lidar, or light detection and ranging, systems that allow the vehicle to better detect or \"see\" its surroundings. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has notably been a critic of the technology, and his company's vehicles rely on camera-based systems and computer vision.\"Just be clear, we're developing a self driving product,\" Anderson, a former Tesla executive, told CNBC. \"It's an eyes-off, self-driving system. As it relates to use of lidar in it, your product will be better with multiple modes of sensing, period. Full stop.\"Anderson, calling it an \"ocean that's too big to boil,\" said the system is expected to evolve incrementally to its full potential.GM declined to say whether the new technology will be called \"Super Cruise,\" which is its current system that allows drivers to be hands-free on 600,000 miles of pre-mapped roads in North America.The current Super Cruise system monitors a driver's attentiveness through the use of sensors and eye-detection cameras.GM was the first automaker to offer such a hands-free system in 2016, but it was slow to roll out the technology until recent years.Barra said the roll out of the new system will be significantly faster than the company's initial expansion of Super Cruise.GM EnergyStarting in 2026, GM said it will make its \"Energy Home System\" — which includes bi-directional electric vehicle charging and a stationary home battery — available via leasing, compared with outright purchasing the equipment.The leasing will begin with GM all-electric vehicles owners and later roll out to other homeowners interested in backup power and solar integration, the company said.GM Energy launched in 2022 as one of the automaker's growth initiatives involving EVs. It was started to rival Tesla's home energy systems and provide battery packs, EV chargers and software to help customers optimize charging and ride out electric grid disruptions.GM has not disclosed the size or revenue of its GM Energy business other than a blog by Wade Sheffer, vice president of GM Energy, that said momentum for its services are growing.\"It's really incredible to see all the great things that are right on the horizon, and I know we will deliver for our customers, and that's what matters most,\" Barra said. \"This moment builds on our history and sets the course.\"",

    "body": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMeta will lay off roughly 600 employees within its artificial intelligence unit as the company looks to reduce layers and operate more nimbly, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Wednesday.The company announced the cuts in a memo from its Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang, who was hired in June as part of Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI. Workers across Meta's AI infrastructure units, Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research unit and other product-related positions will be impacted.Axios was first to report the cuts.Meta has been aggressively overhauling its approach to AI in recent months as it works to keep pace with rivals like OpenAI and Google, pouring billions of dollars into infrastructure projects and recruitment.CEO Mark Zuckerberg had grown frustrated with Meta's progress in AI, especially after the release of its Llama 4 AI models in April received a lukewarm response from developers.Following Meta's massive investment in Scale AI, Zuckerberg unveiled a new unit called Meta Superintelligence Labs that's made up of top AI researchers and engineers. The group is led by Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.During the company's second-quarter earnings call in July, Meta said it expects its total expenses for 2025 to come in the range of $114 billion and $118 billion, raising the low end of its previous outlook. That number is only expected to increase, as Meta said its AI initiatives will \"result in a 2026 year-over-year expense growth rate that is above the 2025 expense growth.\"Meta is scheduled to report third-quarter results next week. On Tuesday, Meta announced a $27 billion deal with Blue Owl Capital to fund and develop its massive Hyperion data center in rural Louisiana. The data center is expected to be large enough to cover a \"significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,\" Zuckerberg said in a post in July.--CNBC's Jonathan Vanian contributed to this reportWATCH: Megacap AI talent wars: Meta poaches another top Apple executivewatch now",

    "body": "A man tries on a jacket at a store at Chicago Fashion Outlets in Chicago, the United States, on Nov. 25, 2022.Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesPrices are rising across the fashion industry – with jackets and outerwear seeing the steepest year-over-year increases, according to a new report from consulting firm AlixPartners published Wednesday. The firm analyzed how much prices have climbed between 2024 and 2025 across nine categories, from swimsuits to dresses. Prices in all of the categories it tracked have risen by an average of $17 year over year. Jackets and outerwear saw the largest increase, with prices on average 24% higher, while swimwear saw the smallest hike at 2% on average. As the U.S. starts to cool down and winter approaches, consumers looking for new coats and jackets could be spending a lot more at the register – if they choose to buy. One factor that's weighed on the category is a late start to fall, which typically leads to weak demand for outerwear. Coupled with higher prices, retailers that bet big on outerwear in the fall and winter months might have a harder time moving product, which could lead to inventory challenges in the spring, said Sonia Lapinsky, the head of AlixPartners' global fashion practice and the report's author.\"[Retailers] have a normal discounting cadence that says by late November, early December, you're already starting to put this stuff on sale, on discount, and a consumer may not have even thought about it by then,\" said Lapinsky.\"We've had so many discussions with retailers about the whole flow of their seasons, and some have made decisions to push some product out further because fall is starting to feel more like late summer,\" she added. \"Not all of them have been that reactive. So it's absolutely a cause for concern if they haven't made any adjustments.\"Here's how much prices have risen in the fashion industry by category. ",

    "body": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on October 15, 2025.Alexander Zemlianichenko | Afp | Getty ImagesRussia scrambled on Wednesday to salvage the prospect of in-person talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russia's Vladimir Putin after they were unceremoniously put on hold.Trump said on Tuesday that he didn't want \"to have a wasted meeting\" with Putin, which was set to take place in Hungary in the next few weeks, as it became clear that Russia opposes the idea of an immediate ceasefire with Ukraine.\"I don't want to have a waste of time — so we'll see what happens,\" Trump said following a call on Monday between U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.After the call, Russia's top diplomat told reporters in Moscow that he had told Rubio that \"Russia has not changed its position\" since Trump and Putin met in Alaska in August, and that while Moscow wanted a \"lasting and sustainable peace,\" it was not interested in an \"immediate ceasefire that will lead to nothing.\"After those comments, and with Trump seemingly pouring cold water on the idea of meeting Putin again, the Kremlin appeared to go into damage limitation mode, insisting on Wednesday that the dates for the summit in Budapest \"weren't set\" but that preparations were still underway.\"This is yet to be done. Careful preparation is needed before then. Time is needed for that,\" Dmitry Peskov, Putin's press secretary, told reporters, in comments translated by NBC News.\"There's no news yet; it's clear that all of this is surrounded by a lot of gossip, rumors, and so on. For the most part, they are completely untrue. There's no news yet,\" he added.Another U-turn?The suspension of talks with Russia appears to be yet another U-turn from the U.S. administration, which has seesawed this year over its position on Russia, the Ukraine war and its causes, and its potential resolution.There was more than a whiff of smugness and schadenfreude in Moscow, and Russian state media, last week when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's own in-person talks with Trump last Friday appeared to go badly.Particularly after Russia had effectively undermined the talks by getting in there first, gaining Trump's ear with a \"very productive\" phone call — as Trump described it — that was held with Putin. It was during that call when the leaders agreed to meet in person within a couple of weeks.Trump and his team appeared to vacillate on their support for Ukraine after that call, with Zelenskyy leaving the White House the next day empty handed, with no long-range Tomahawk missiles, as requested, and concerns that it could be pressured to give up occupied territory in eastern Ukraine.US President Donald Trump gestures as he greets Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as he arrives for a meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, on Oct. 17, 2025.Tom Brenner | AFP | Getty ImagesThose fears grew when Trump last weekend called for the partially Russian-occupied region of Donbas, the epicenter of ongoing fighting in the three-and-a half year war, to be \"cut the way it is.\"\"It's cut up right now, I think 78% of the land is already taken by Russia,\" the president said on Air Force One on Sunday. \"They should stop right now at the battle lines. ... Go home, stop killing people and be done.\"Read moreUkraine and a group of European allies pushed back against Trump's position, warning in a joint statement Tuesday that Russia was using \"stalling tactics\" to prolong the war. Wary of alienating Trump, however, they were careful to praise his efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table.\"We strongly support President Trump's position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations. We remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force,\" European leaders noted.Russia blames 'fake news'Now the tables have turned again, Moscow appears to be feeling anxious, with the Kremlin insisting it is serious about ending the war.\"No one wants to waste time. Neither President Trump nor President Putin. These are two presidents who are accustomed to working effectively and efficiently, but effectiveness always requires preparation,\" Peskov stated Wednesday.Various Russian officials in Putin's inner-circle accused media outlets of spreading \"fake news\" about the \"cancellation\" of the Hungary summit in a bid to undermine it.\"Media is twisting comment about the 'immediate future' to undercut the upcoming Summit. Preparations continue,\" Kirill Dmitriev, Putin's investment envoy and CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, commented on the X social network.Russia's President Vladimir Putin (L) and Russian Direct Investment Fund CEO Kirill Dmitriev during a meeting with Russian Direct Investment Fund experts and representatives of international investment community at Konstantin Palace.Mikhail Klimentyev | TASS via Getty ImagesRussian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova also presented a similar argument, telling Radio Sputnik on Wednesday that an \"information circus\" surrounded the Trump-Putin summit.\"This whole information circus which, by the way, they haven't finished yet, it's still going on: Fake leaks, self-corrections, confirmations, denials, exist to once again provide informational support to Zelenskyy,\" she said, in comments translated by NBC News.",

    "body": "watch nowShares of Netflix were down 9% in morning trading Wednesday after the company posted a third-quarter earnings miss after the bell Tuesday, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities for the weaker-than-estimated results.The streamer said the specific expense, stemming from a 10% tax on certain payments made by Brazilian entities to operations outside the country, was not previously in its forecast. The company decided to charge the impact to its third quarter after it became reasonably likely that Netflix would lose a legal challenge over whether it would be assessed the tax, executives said.\"It's not a tax that's specific to Netflix. It's not even specific to streaming,\" Chief Financial Officer Spence Neumann said on the company's earnings call. \"Absent this expense, we would have exceeded our Q325 operating income and operating margin forecast, and we don't expect this matter to have a material impact on our results going forward.\"Revenue for Netflix's third quarter rose 17%, in line with analyst expectations, boosted by membership growth, pricing adjustments and increased ad revenue. For the fourth quarter, Netflix expects revenue to rise 17% year over year as those trends continue.Here's how the company did in the period ended Sept. 30, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $5.87 vs. $6.97, according to LSEGRevenue: $11.51 billion vs. $11.51 billion, according to LSEGNetflix reported third-quarter net income of $2.55 billion, or $5.87 per share, up from $2.36 billion, or $5.40, in the same quarter a year prior.For the full-year, Netflix is projecting $45.1 billion in revenue, a 16% jump from the year prior and in line with previous expectations of revenue growth of between 15% and 16%.The company did alter its operating margin forecast for the year, citing the Brazilian tax matter, and now expects that metric to be 29% instead of the prior projection of 30%.Still, Netflix said it posted its best quarter for advertising sales ever during the period, with co-CEO Greg Peters noting that the company is on track to more than double ad revenue this year.\"Netflix had its best ad sales quarter to date, but still did not provide a figure for how large the ad business is,\" said Ross Benes, senior analyst at EMarketer, in a statement. \"This gives the impression that the sustained revenue growth achieved this quarter, and forecasted for next quarter, will predominantly continue to come from subscription fees.\"Netflix raised its prices in January, including the cost of its ad-supported tier.The streamer's fourth-quarter slate of content contains a number of alluring titles, from the fifth and final season of \"Strangers Things\" and new seasons of \"The Diplomat\" and \"Nobody Wants This\" to Guillermo del Toro's \"Frankenstein\" and Rian Johnson's \"Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives out Mystery.\"Netflix is also still riding the coattails of \"KPop Demon Hunters,\" which was released on the platform back in June. The animated movie has become Netflix's most-watched film with more than 325 million views on the platform.Netflix announced Tuesday it's expanding the animated film's consumer reach with a dual product partnership with leading toy companies Hasbro and Mattel. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" dolls, plush, role-play items and themed games will be available at retail in spring 2026. The company also noted that it is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. \"KPop Demon Hunters\" is returning to theaters once again during the Halloween holiday weekend.",

    "body": "Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, speaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Jan. 22, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBCMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella is getting a big bump in his compensation, as the company's stock price has continued to rally, propelled by the boom in artificial intelligence. Nadella's total pay for fiscal 2025 climbed 22% to $96.5 million from $79.1 million last year, Microsoft said in a proxy filing after the close of regular trading on Tuesday. That includes more than $84 million in stock awards and over $9.5 million in Nadella's cash incentives.The pay plan is largely tied Microsoft's share performance. So far in 2025, Microsoft's stock price has risen by 23%, topping the S&P 500's 15% gain. The shares have more than doubled in valued over the past three years.Microsoft is scheduled to report results for the fiscal first quarter next week. In its fourth-quarter disclosure in July, the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, with sales climbing 18%, the fastest growth in more than three years. Microsoft Azure business is driving expansion as companies' cloud infrastructure needs grow to meet AI demand. In fiscal 2024, Nadella's pay jumped 63% from 48.5 million the prior year, with 90% of his compensation coming from stock awards. Nadella was eligible for a $10.66 million cash incentive last year, but he asked the board's compensation committee to reduce that number to $5.2 million as a result of a series of cyberattacks that the company endured.Despite Microsoft's strong financial and stock performance, the company has seen turmoil among its workforce in recent months. In July, Nadella penned a memo to employees saying that the company's elimination of more than 15,000 employees in 2025 had \"been weighing heavily\" on him.Microsoft has also terminated several activist employees who protested the company's work with the Israeli military.WATCH: Microsoft is trending toward a $5T market cap, says Wedbush's Dan Iveswatch now",

    "body": "The Mattel, Inc. logo is displayed outside the headquarters of the toy company known for products including Barbie and Hot Wheels in El Segundo, California on June 8, 2023.Patrick T. Fallon | AFP | Getty ImagesBarbie-maker Mattel posted third-quarter results after the market close on Tuesday that missed analysts' expectations as ongoing global tariffs continue to hamper the toy manufacturer's sales in North America.Shares of the company fell 4% in after hours trading.Here's what Mattel reported for its third quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 89 cents adjusted vs. $1.07 expectedRevenue: $1.74 billion vs. $1.83 billion expectedFor the quarter ended September 30, the company reported net income of $278 million, or 88 cents per share, down from $372 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Adjusting for one-time items, including costs associated with restructuring and certain product recalls, per-share profit was 89 cents.Net sales fell 6% to $1.74 billion, coming in short of Wall Street's expectations.This is the first time in three quarters that the toy giant has missed on both earnings and revenue expectations.In May, Mattel pulled its annual financial targets and said it would increase prices for some products in the U.S. to counter higher input costs due to the Trump administration's tariffs on key trading partners. On Tuesday the company issued full-year guidance that calls for net sales to increase between 1% and 3% and for earnings per share to come in between $1.54 and $1.66.\"While our U.S. business was challenged in the third quarter by industry-wide shifts in retailer ordering patterns, the fundamentals of our business are strong,\" Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz said in a release. \"Since the beginning of the fourth quarter, orders from retailers in the US have accelerated significantly.\"Tariffs have put pressure on toy manufacturers industry-wide. Approximately half of Mattel's global toy sales come from the U.S., and by the end of the year, less than 40% of Mattel's product will be sourced from China, Kreiz noted on CNBC in May.During the third quarter, sales in North America fell 12%, with the largest year over year declines in the company's infant, toddler and preschool category. International sales meanwhile climbed 3%.Overall, sales for two of Mattel's largest toy brands saw declining sales: Global Barbie sales fell 17% from the same quarter a year earlier, and Fisher-Price sales dropped 19%. The company's global Hot Wheels sales ticked up 8%.Moving forward, Mattel has focused on expanding its entertainment offerings and employing new technology. On Tuesday, Mattel and Hasbro partnered with Netflix to capitalize on the success of the movie \"KPop Demon Hunters\" to offer dolls and other consumer products tied to the film.Mattel is producing dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets and currently is taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.Correction: Mattel reported net income of $278 million. A previous version of this article misstated the figure. ",

    "body": "Customers check out at a supermarket on August 12, 2025 in New York City. Liao Pan | China News Service | Getty ImagesThe September consumer price index report coming out Friday will command full attention from financial markets, even as some investors will view the data with a skeptical eye.With the Bureau of Labor Statistics already under scrutiny this year for its broad menu of data releases, the government shutdown gripping Washington, D.C., will only raise concerns from parts of Wall Street about whether the inflation reading will present a full picture.\"Skeptics like me are going to be focused on how clean is this data,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"What were the accommodations made for the lack of full personnel staff showing up? What adjustments were made before the data got reported?\"Indeed, the BLS this year has faced a host of questions over its data collection methods. President Donald Trump in August, furious over huge downward revisions in nonfarm payrolls data, sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.watch nowThough still considered part of the \"gold standard\" U.S. economic data collection apparatus, the BLS has also been criticized for its decidedly analog approach, which includes in-person visits, phone calls and written response forms.The agency faces the added burden of staffing cuts — even before the shutdown — and has eliminated several cities from its collection efforts. Now, it is putting together a key inflation report with most of the government closed and risks that sample data could be incomplete.For those reasons, Khanduja thinks investors should be careful with how much emphasis they place on the CPI reading.\"The efficacy and the cleanliness of data — there will definitely be a little bit of a skepticism had from my end, and I'm thinking the market will do the same,\" he said.Muted expectationsEven with the questions over the data, economists aren't looking for anything dramatic from the actual numbers.The Dow Jones consensus has the CPI report showing 3.1% annual inflation levels on both the headline, or all-items, gauge as well as the core, which excludes food and energy. Economists see the monthly headline number rising 0.4% and 0.3% for core, right in line with the August gains.What gives this report an even higher profile is that all other data collections and releases have been suspended during the shutdown. The reason the Labor Department called back BLS staffers is because the CPI report is used to index Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.So outside of this, there will be no other releases, leaving investors as well as Federal Reserve policymakers flying blind on data. That in itself presents a bevy of problems and another headache for agencies like the BLS.\"As the shutdown appears likely to last into November, it is not clear how the BLS will deal with an unprecedented lack of real-time collections,\" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark said in a note. \"November data collections are also increasingly likely to be affected. We will be watching for any possible release of guidance on October CPI collections with Friday's September report.\"In the meantime, the Fed will hold a meeting next week, with markets widely expecting a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate, likely to be followed by another in December. Fed funds currently stand at 4.00% to 4.25%.However, there's considerable uncertainty about what will happen in 2026 and beyond. Trump wants rates aggressively lower, and he's likely to nominate a candidate next year to succeed Chair Jerome Powell with that philosophy.With a lack of data certainty, though, formulating policy will be difficult.\"I don't think we're going to learn a whole lot from this [CPI] data that we're not seeing at the moment,\" Mike Wilson, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, said Tuesday on CNBC. \"I think it will give the Fed cover to do what I think they need to do, which is cut rates in a more meaningful way. To me, that [is] the risk, that we don't get the data that allows the Fed to cut more meaningfully.\"",

    "body": "Alphabet-owned Waymo has resumed its driverless ride-hail service in the San Francisco Bay Area after a temporary pause during blackouts that plagued the city beginning on Saturday afternoon.\"Yesterday's power outage was a widespread event that caused gridlock across San Francisco, with non-functioning traffic signals and transit disruptions,\" a Waymo spokesperson, Suzanne Philion, told CNBC in an e-mailed statement Sunday afternoon. \"While the failure of the utility infrastructure was significant, we are committed to ensuring our technology adjusts to traffic flow during such events,\" she added.Waymo notice of service outage in San Francisco. Source: WaymoAs power outages spread yesterday, videos shared on social media appeared to show multiple Waymo vehicles stalled in traffic in different parts of the city.San Francisco resident Matt Schoolfield said he saw at least three Waymo autonomous vehicles stopped in traffic Saturday around 9:45 p.m. local time, including one he photographed on Turk Boulevard near Parker Avenue.\"They were just stopping in the middle of the street,\" Schoolfield said.A Waymo vehicle stuck between Parker and Beaumont, on the north side of Turk Boulevard in San Francisco.Credit: Matt SchoolfieldThe power outages began around 1:09 p.m. Saturday and peaked roughly two hours later, affecting about 130,000 customers, according to Pacific Gas and Electric. As of Sunday morning, about 21,000 customers remained without power, mainly in the Presidio, the Richmond District, Golden Gate Park and parts of downtown San Francisco.PG&E said the outage was caused by a fire at a substation that resulted in \"significant and extensive\" damage, and said it could not yet provide a precise timeline for full restoration.San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a 9 p.m. update on X that police officers, fire crews, parking control officers and city ambassadors were deployed across affected neighborhoods.\"While the Waymo Driver is designed to treat non-functional signals as four-way stops, the sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections,\" Waymo's Philion also told CNBC. \"This contributed to traffic friction during the height of the congestion.\" Waymo \"closely coordinated with San Francisco city officials,\" she said, and proactively paused its service as of Saturday evening and in the first half of the day on Sunday. \"The majority of active trips were successfully completed before vehicles were safely returned to depots or pulled over,\" she noted.Amid the disruption, Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X: \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\"Unlike Waymo, Tesla does not operate a driverless robotaxi service in San Francisco.Tesla's local ride-hailing service uses vehicles equipped with \"FSD (Supervised),\" a premium driver assistance system. The service requires a human driver behind the wheel at all times. According to state regulators — including the California Department of Motor Vehicles and California Public Utilities Commission — Tesla has not obtained permits to conduct driverless testing or services in the state without human safety supervisors behind the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Tesla is vying to become a robotaxi titan, but does not yet operate commercial, driverless services. Tesla's Robotaxi app allows users to hail a ride; however, its vehicles currently have human safety supervisors or drivers on board, even in states where the company has obtained permits for driverless operations. Waymo, which leads the nascent industry in the West, is Tesla's chief competitor in AVs, along with Chinese players like Baidu-owned Apollo Go.The outage-related disruptions in San Francisco come as robotaxi services are becoming more common in other major U.S. cities. Waymo is among a small number of companies operating fully driverless ride-hailing services for the public, even as unease about autonomous vehicles remains high.A survey by the American Automobile Association earlier this year found that about two-thirds of U.S. drivers said they were fearful of autonomous vehicles.The Waymo pause in San Francisco indicates cities are not yet ready for highly automated vehicles to inundate their streets, said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the MIT Center for Transportation and co-author of \"How to Make AI Useful.\"\"Something in the design and development of this technology was missed that clearly illustrates it was not the robust solution many would like to believe it is,\" he said.Reimer noted that power outages are entirely predictable. \"Not for eternity, but in the foreseeable future, we will need to mix human and machine intelligence, and have human backup systems in place around highly automated systems, including robotaxis,\" he said.State and city regulators will need to consider what the maximum penetration of highly automated vehicles should be in their region, Reimer added, and AV developers should be held responsible for \"chaos gridlock,\" just as human drivers would be held responsible for how they drive during a blackout.— CNBC's Riya Bhattacharjee contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files released by the U.S. Justice Department shows photos with prominent people including a Pope, Bill Clinton, and Donald Trump. Image was redacted by CNBC.U.S. Department of JusticeThe Department of Justice on Sunday restored online a photo from the Jeffrey Epstein files that contained images showing President Donald Trump after backlash over its removal.The image, which contained two separate photos showing Trump, had been removed by the DOJ from public view after being published on the department's website on Friday.  The image showed an array of items on and in Epstein's desk or credenza.One of the photos showed Trump with a group of women, while the other was a well-known image showing him with his wife, Melania, Epstein, and Epstein's now-convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\"The Southern District of New York flagged an image of President Trump for potential further action to protect victims,\" the DOJ said in a post on the social media site X.\"Out of an abundance of caution, the Department of Justice temporarily removed the image for further review. After the review, it was determined there is no evidence that any Epstein victims are depicted in the photograph, and it has been reposted without any alteration or redaction.\"The DOJ did not say what it meant by the Southern District of New York. The SDNY can refer both to the federal judicial district that includes Manhattan, New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in that district, which prosecutes federal criminal cases.On Saturday, congressional Democrats questioned the removal of the photo.\"This photo, file 468, from the Epstein files that includes Donald Trump has apparently now been removed from the DOJ release,\" Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in a post on X. \"@AGPamBondi is this true? What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.\"Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docsDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche early Sunday said the image was removed from the website after learning there were concerns about women in the photo, \"so we pulled that photo down.\"\"It has nothing to do with President Trump,\" said Blanche on NBC's \"Meet the Press.The disappearance of the files came despite a law signed by Trump that required the agency to make public all of the so-called Epstein files by Friday.The image went live on the DOJ's website on Friday, and disappeared from the webpage several hours later. The photograph showed a collection of framed and unframed photos that included Trump and other high-profile figures such as former President Bill Clinton and Pope John Paul II.\"When we hear from victims' rights groups about this type of photograph, we pull it down and investigate,\" Blanche said.Earlier this month, SDNY Judge Richard Berman ordered the unsealing of grand jury materials related to the DOJ's prosecution of Epstein in 2019 on child sex trafficking charges.That order included a provision that the DOJ address survivors' concerns about the content of the files. The DOJ on Friday released just a fraction of documents and images from the Epstein case, even though the new Epstein Files Transparency Act mandated that all DOJ files related to him and Maxwell be released by that date.The DOJ's failure to release all material by that deadline drew sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike. In addition, several Epstein victims criticized the DOJ for allegedly not keeping them informed about the contents of Friday's release — a move some survivors said could have put them in danger, according to several news reports.Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky. — who with Ro Khanna, D-Calif., co-sponsored the House bill that ordered the DOJ to release the Epstein files — has threatened to hold Justice Department officials accountable for how the files' release has been handled.In an interview Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" Massie said some congressional lawmakers are considering holding Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt.\"The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims, is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi,\" Massie said.",

    "body": "Capsule hotels are a cheap alternative to expensive accomodation in London for office workers.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers who moved out of London for remote work are under pressure to come back to the office in the city, and some are choosing to stay in Japanese-inspired sleeping pods for just £30 ($40). I travelled to Piccadilly Circus in the heart of London to spend a night in a newly opened capsule hotel, after two of my colleagues who live outside the city recommended staying there. Zedwell Capsule Hotel, a brand owned by Criterion Capital, opened in September and offers nearly 1,000 capsules measuring 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth — likely the smallest hotel rooms in London. It has a rather unassuming exterior despite being located inside the historic London Pavilion building — originally built as a music hall in 1885. The entrance is around the corner of the busy station, through some black doors.Private sleeping capsules alongside each other in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaThe cost of staying in a hotel in Central London is staggering, sitting at an average of £265 per night in the third quarter of 2025, according to real estate firm Knight Frank. In comparison, the average daily rate of hotels across Europe was 125 euros in the summer, according to an analysis of over 600,000 reservations from 2,000 independent hotels by RoomRaccoon. Criterion's Head of Hotels Halima Aziz told me that the capsule hotel addresses a gap in the market between budget hostels and affordable accommodation. \"We've formed this sweet spot between the two. We're not a budget hostel. We're not coming in at a £15 rate, giving you a bunk bed in a steel room,\" she said. \"When we decided to get into capsules, we really took inspiration from Asia, and the capsule concept was really born out of Japan as a response to very similar pressures we're facing in London.\" In Japan, the first capsule hotel was built in the city of Osaka in 1979, primarily to serve as an inexpensive overnight option for salarymen who worked late and preferred to stay out drinking and socializing rather than spending more money commuting home. It's given rise to some capsule-style hotels in New York, from sleeping pods by Kama Central Park, to Nap York, a sleeping station with private pods for short naps or overnight stays. Now that the concept has come to London, I was keen to see for myself what the British version has to offer.Inside a sleeping capsuleInside a sleeping capsule in Zedwell Capsule Hotel in London.Sawdah BhaimiyaIt's a Monday evening, and instead of my usual work-from-home routine, which involves preparing to go into the office the next day, I'm crawling into a brightly lit sleeping pod.I roll down the garage-like shutters and lock it from the inside as I prepare to sleep. My head is just inches beneath the ceiling of my pod, which has a light dimmer, two clothing hooks, an air purifier, a wide mirror stretching along the head of the capsule, and charger sockets. Although I can feel my luggage — a backpack and tote bag — at the end of my bed, and the bottom of my coat hung on the hooks, I'm surprised by how comfortable and cozy the bedding is. I switch off the lights and noisy air purifier and find myself enveloped by pitch black and silence. It feels eerie, but with nothing to distract me, I fall asleep quickly.Each capsule measures 1 meter long, 1 meter wide, and 2 meters in depth.Sawdah BhaimiyaEarlier in the day, I checked myself into the hotel using one of four kiosks, and as I roamed around the hotel, I noticed that the walls were painted black to match the exterior — and there isn't a single window in sight. I rode up to the first floor and used a key card to access my female-only dormitory. My capsule was one of seven stacked side by side or on top of each other, and some were only accessible via steps. A female-only dormitory inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaI learned that despite the low initial cost, there was a series of additional amenities guests can pay for, from an extra £10 to be in a female-only dormitory, to £8 for a padlock, and £15 to store luggage securely. The hotel had an unfinished feel. The entrance was covered in scaffolding and the faint sound of drilling could be heard from inside the building. That's because it is \"still under construction,\" Zedwell's General Manager Greg Walsh told me. The drilling sounds were coming from underground where a larger reception was being built, with direct links to Piccadilly Circus Station. CEO Aziz confirmed that the building is not complete, adding that the additional cost for the female dorms was largely due to upgraded amenities, including a towel inside the pod and a female-only beauty room complete with hairdryers  — although this is still under construction and not currently accessible. \"Ultimately, if you're not just targeting the traditional hostel market, and you want to widen access, you need to respond to people's needs, and people have needs for laundry, for beauty, that wouldn't typically be considered,\" she added. While exploring the building, I found shared toilets and showers with classical music playing inside, as well as vending machines in the reception with snacks, drinks, slippers and eye masks amongst other items. I wandered out for dinner and with Oxford Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden within walking distance, it wasn't hard to entertain myself. Zedwell Capsule Hotel is located in Piccadilly Circus, London.Sawdah BhaimiyaWorkers are coming back to the city During my time in the hotel, I discovered I was one of many working professionals in the building. I spotted several guests arriving in suits and ties and carrying briefcases. One chef from Newcastle even told me he paid a total of £284 to stay in the hotel for a fortnight to work in London. During the Covid-19 pandemic, many office workers in London moved out of the city, where it was cheaper to rent or own a home, due to remote and flexible working options becoming a normality. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high.\"Halima AzizCriterion's Head of Hotels A 2021 report from City Hall said it was likely that London's population fell during the pandemic. The number of payrolled London employees dropped sharply by about 210,000 by November 2020, with the report citing that flexible work arrangements made it easier to move out of the city. The trend persisted, and by 2022, 43% of commuters lived over 30 minutes away from their workplace in the U.K., reflecting higher property prices in central areas, according to a report by commercial real estate firm CBRE which surveyed over 20,000 people globally.  Additionally, CBRE found that 41% of people worldwide were planning to move to more remote locations in the next two years either in the same city or to a different city. However, in 2025, there's been a sharp recall in remote work offerings with major companies enforcing return to office mandates in London from HSBC to JPMorgan, Amazon, Salesforce and John Lewis. A typically dormitory with roughly a dozen capsules inside Zedwell Capsule Hotel.Sawdah BhaimiyaZedwell's Aziz said one of the hotel's core demographics is young professionals and hybrid workers who are using Zedwell as a \"base in the city\" due to their flexible working patterns which require them to be in the office for a few days a week. Roughly 20% of the hotel's customers are corporate workers, Aziz said. \"The cost of commuting from Oxford, Cambridge, city centers that aren't accessible via the London Underground system, is quite high,\" she said. \"Our product is often cheaper than their commute or late-night travel home.\" The return-to-office mandate has left workers who don't live in cities scrambling to find inexpensive ways of staying in the city, without having to resort to unattractive options like hostels. \"Where they wouldn't traditionally consider a hostel product, we identified that they would indeed consider a capsule hotel, because it gave that privacy,\" Aziz added. As a Londoner, my usual commute to the office lasts just over 30 minutes, so the hotel doesn't offer much in terms of convenience for me, but I can see the appeal for those living further away from the city. When I awoke in the morning, I almost forgot that I wasn't in my bed at home. After a quick shower, I got ready inside my capsule before heading out and joining the throng of commuters in central London. ",

    "body": "Vladimir Godnik | Fstop | Getty ImagesFor years, Braden Wallake has posted everything from business lessons to animal pictures on his LinkedIn page. A fateful midweek post on a late-summer day stopped the marketing executive in his tracks.Wallake shared a teary-eyed selfie with a message about his feelings after laying off staff. Just like that, he was the \"Crying CEO.\"\"I woke up the next day, texted my marketing person and said, 'I think I went viral last night,'\" said Wallake, whose post has raked in more than 57,000 reactions and 10,000 comments.Users blasted the HyperSocial CEO as being \"manipulative\" and displaying \"self indulgence.\" The photo \"would make a great dart board,\" another wrote.Corporate executives and founders like Wallake were sold on the idea that a vibrant social media presence can boost their personal and firm-wide brand awareness. But the reality is less picture-perfect than it's made out to be.In many cases, these leaders come off not as relatable but as cringey. And they're learning the hard way that their digital footprints can even have material business implications.\"There can be real benefits from CEOs being online, but there can also be great risks,\" said Ann Mooney Murphy, a Stevens Institute of Technology professor who has studied how company leaders gain social media celebrity status. \"One needs to tread carefully.\"The online executiveThe pitfalls of social media usage for business leaders are becoming increasingly clear as more executives take to the platforms. Nearly three-fourths of Fortune 500 chief executives had at least one social media account last year, up from roughly half in 2019, data from Influential Executive showed.More than seven out of 10 Fortune 100 CEOs with social platforms posted at least once a month in 2024, a 32% increase from the year prior, according to an analysis from communications firm H/Advisors Abernathy released this week. CEOs have flocked in particular to the work-focused social site LinkedIn, where they post three times a month on average. An active social media presence can help build brand recognition and drive attention from mainstream news outlets, Murphy said. It can also allow executives to develop para-social relationships directly with consumers — something that was once reserved for more-traditional celebrities like actors or athletes, she said.While company news was king in these posts, H/Advisors Abernathy found executives devoting more social real estate to sharing personal happenings. This softer style of content — examples of which include Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sharing pictures from Taylor Swift's \"Eras\" tour and Goldman Sachs' David Solomon posting details for his DJ sets — can help keep followers engaged, Murphy said.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon performs at Schimanski night club in Brooklyn, New York.Trevor Hunnicutt | ReutersA subsector has sprouted up around executives' social media habits, with several businesses offering training programs or consulting services focused on best practices. PayPal made waves in marketing circles earlier this year when it posted a \"Head of CEO Content\" role, which paid upwards of $300,000 in part to lead social media communications strategy.Promise and perilBut in recent years, a growing list of anecdotes like Wallake's \"Crying CEO\" experience show how posting through life can go awry.Jason Yanowitz boasted on X in October that Blockworks, the crypto company he co-founded, saw \"massive growth\" and hit \"record revenues\" in 2025. He also said the company was shuttering its news division and recommended staffers to anyone hiring journalists covering digital currencies.One user suggested that Yanowitz forgo smiley faces and strike a tone with less \"triumphancy\" in a post announcing job cuts. Someone else replied that \"before jumping into what's next,\" he should \"address the real people who were impacted.\"Yanowitz, who declined CNBC's interview request, later wrote on X that he \"should not have mentioned revenue\" in the original post.Around the same time as Yanowitz's tweet, a social media video featuring Snowflake revenue chief Mike Gannon offered a case study on how these incidents can evolve into real-world crises.In an Instagram clip viewed millions of times, Gannon told a street interviewer that the data storage firm was slated to rake in $10 billion \"in a couple of years.\" Shortly after, Snowflake said in a regulatory filing that statements made in the interview were not authorized and that investors \"should not rely upon\" them. The company declined to make Gannon available for an interview.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared visions for his business ventures on social media in between musings about politics and cultural issues.

Some, like Ryan Benson, have also mocked the broader trend of business leaders' attempting to connect directly via social media.\"It's just disingenuous,\" said Benson, 28. \"They're not trying to speak with people the way that maybe an influencer has success in. They're trying to talk at people to make them think something about their position.\"Executives' missteps on social media can catalyze discontent from investors, consumers or employees, according to Murphy of the Stevens Institute of Technology. In some situations, she said social media statements could lead to increased regulatory or legal risk for the companies they represent.Is all attention good?Despite the downfalls, corporate leaders who have seen the underbelly of social media don't regret being online.HyperSocial's Wallake said he initially took time away from LinkedIn to let the dust settle and now thinks twice before making a post. But Wallake still recommends other business managers harness social media to grow their brands given the benefits. If someone does bring up his teary picture, Wallake brushes it off.\"If people want to call me the 'Crying CEO,' they're more than welcome to,\" Wallake said. \"If they actually get to meet me, they're going to see me smiling way more often than they're going to see me ever crying.\"When Yehong Zhu, co-founder of media technology startup Zette AI, jumped on a day-in-my-life trend, responders roasted her over perceived laziness. People said she should be \"embarrassed\" and was \"fundamentally useless to society.\" One commenter said they were \"printing this out and taping it to the wall to remind me every time I catch myself believing in meritocracy.\"Zhu received handwritten hate mail tied to the post sent to her office. But she also noticed a flood of press coverage that included the company's name and signups to a product waitlist, underscoring the power of publicity — even if it's negative.\"After there was this huge influx of attention, I realized, you know what, maybe all attention is good attention,\" Zhu said. \"As long as your name is in their mouth, you're doing something right.\"Zhu later understood that her post was taken as \"rage bait,\" a genre of content so infamous that Oxford named it the 2025 word of the year. She's currently undergoing a social media rebrand and is considering leaning toward controversial posts — with the hope of winning more attention online.\"I was not trying to rage bait,\" she said of the original post. \"The day that I actually try to rage bait, everybody will be actually enraged.\"Read more CNBC analysis on culture and the economyAn industry focused on death faces an existential crisisFrom fraternities to women's soccer, this under-the-radar T-shirt brand is popping up everywhereFor first-time job hunters, a college degree isn't unlocking the opportunities it once didYoung adults are betting on risky stock and crypto investments.

    "body": "Most parents know the frustration of dealing with a child's unexpected public tantrum.But parents are often too quick to call out their child's negative behavior — chastising them for that unnecessary meltdown or even telling them to \"cheer up\" when they seem sad — while ignoring the underlying emotions behind those actions, according to parenting expert Reem Raouda.Focusing solely on children's behaviors, particularly bad behavior, rather than investigating and validating their emotions is a common parenting mistake that hinders your child's ability to develop emotional intelligence, says Raouda, an author and certified conscious parenting coach.\"Stop focusing on their behavior and start focusing on their [well-being],\" she says. \"Children are not robots, and their emotions are being completely ignored, dismissed [or even] punished.\"Experts often link emotional intelligence to success, because it helps people manage the kinds of negative emotions that could otherwise lead to burnout, anxiety or depression, research shows.\"Your emotional well-being is your success,\" says Raouda, adding that parents who ignore their kids' emotional development are less likely to raise happy, successful adults. \"Who cares about how much money you have, if you are anxiety-ridden, depressed, [and] don't know who you are?\"DON'T MISS: The ultimate guide to teaching your kids about moneyParents do need to enforce boundaries, Raouda says, particularly when a child's outburst involves mistreating other people. They also need to remind kids that their feelings — positive or negative — are normal, and that it's healthy to express them constructively, she says.Focus on \"not making them feel bad for their anger [and] not telling them to cheer up when they're sad,\" says Raouda. \"Letting them be in their feelings is No. 1.\"You might, for example, ask your child what they were feeling that led them to act out, break a rule or otherwise cross a previously established boundary. Helping your kids name their emotions is the first step toward them developing the ability to manage those emotions, Raouda says.Some other experts agree: Children who feel heard and not shamed for their feelings typically become more open to avoiding negative behaviors, according to psychologist Caroline Fleck. \"The point is to validate the emotion and then focus on what's not valid, which is the behavior [and that's] what needs to change,\" Fleck told CNBC Make It in January.Parents who overemphasize obedience, which can require the suppression of big feelings, run the risk of raising people-pleasers who can't advocate for themselves and are more likely to grow into anxious, unhappy adults, Raouda says.A mother herself, Raouda says she'd practice emotion-naming exercises with her son even when he was too young to articulate how he was feeling on his own. That involved asking if he was angry or frustrated and, if so, having him rank the severity of his feelings on a scale of 1 to 10, she says.And when parents feel emotional themselves, they can tell their children directly: I'm upset, or I'm sad. The idea is to show your children that you don't have to suppress those negative feelings, says Raouda.\"Naming it takes away from the [negative] stigma,\" she says. \"It's just, like, 'Yeah, I was angry, I was embarrassed, I was sad, I was nervous' … Feelings are normal and healthy and fine.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "A Baidu Apollo RT6 robotaxi during Baidu's Apollo Day in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday, May 15, 2024. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesChinese tech giant Baidu has announced plans to bring robotaxis to London starting next year through its partnerships with Lyft and Uber, as the UK emerges as a growing autonomous vehicle battleground.The announced collaborations will bring Baidu's Apollo Go autonomous vehicles to the British capital through the Uber and Lyft platforms, the companies said on their respective social media accounts. Lyft's testing of Baidu's initial fleet of dozens of vehicles will begin in 2026, pending regulatory approval, \"with plans to scale to hundreds from there,\" Lyft CEO David Risher said in a post on social media platform X on Monday.Meanwhile, Uber said that its first pilot is expected to start in the first half of 2026. \"We're excited to accelerate Britain's leadership in the future of mobility, bringing another safe and reliable travel option to Londoners next year,\" the company added.The moves add to Baidu's growing global footprint, which it says includes 22 cities and more than 250,000 weekly trips, as it races against other Chinese players like WeRide and Western giants like Alphabet's Waymo. The UK, in particular, has seen a wave of interest from driverless taxi companies, following the government's announcement in June that it would accelerate its plans to allow autonomous vehicle tech on public roads. The government now aims to begin permitting robotaxis to operate in small-scale pilots starting in spring 2026, with Baidu likely aiming to be among the first. The city of London has also established a \"Vision Zero\" goal to eliminate all serious injuries and deaths in its transportation systems by 2041, with autonomous driving technology expected to play a large role. News of Baidu pilots comes as its competitor, Waymo, also looks to begin testing in London, with plans for a full-service launch in 2026. Waymo currently operates, is testing, or has plans to launch in at least 26 markets, including major cities like Tokyo and New York City.Baidu, for its part, has been aggressively expanding globally, with testing rolling out in international markets like the United Arab Emirates and Switzerland. ",

    "body": " An illustration photo shows Moore Threads logo in a smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China on October 30, 2025. Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesChina's hottest artificial-intelligence listings are delivering eye-popping gains.Shares of chipmaker MetaX Integrated Circuits skyrocketed almost 700% in their Shanghai market debut last week, while Moore Threads soared over 400% on its first day of trading earlier this month.While domestic investors scramble for exposure to promising Chinese tech listings, overseas investors are largely left out from partaking in such blockbuster offerings.Foreign retail investors in particular are shut out of mainland China IPOs: \"It's not even possible. Unless they open up an account with a Chinese broker,\" said Chris Zhang, executive director at Chinese financial services firm China Fortune Securities Company.Opening an onshore brokerage account with a Chinese securities firm requires a linked Chinese bank account, which generally requires a proof of residence in China, or a Chinese visa with sufficient validity. Foreigners also need to already hold other mainland-listed shares before being eligible to participate in an IPO lottery.Most foreign banks do not have the necessary arrangements with Chinese brokers to support account openings, Zhang said, making the process unworkable for the vast majority of overseas retail investors.Official guidance from Shanghai's city government states that only a narrow set of foreign individuals can directly open brokerage accounts for A-shares — stocks listed in mainland China. For example, foreigners with permanent resident status, workers in China, or foreigners working abroad with equity incentive plans in A-share listed companies. For many global investors, Stock Connect, a program that allows Hong Kong and mainland Chinese exchanges mutual access to each other's stocks, is the most convenient way to gain exposure to Chinese equities.It allows overseas investors to buy A-shares through their Hong Kong brokers without needing an onshore account, or special licenses— but the scheme offers little help when it comes to IPOs, or even freshly listed stocks. Access also depends on Hong Kong brokers' eligibility requirements, such as minimum account balances and risk disclosures.\"Stock Connect does not work because newly listed stocks are not included in Stock Connect as yet. Usually it takes a few weeks to months should the stocks qualify,\" said Theodore Shou, chief investment officer at Skybound Capital.Inclusion of companies in the Stock Connect scheme depends on whether a stock meets the eligibility rules such as sufficient trading activity and market value, which often requires a period of trading and data history for qualifying.Institutional exposure  Northbound trading, which refers to overseas and Hong Kong investors buying mainland China stocks via Stock Connect and other schemes, will not be available until \"typically several months after any listing,\" Shou said. Even then, it's not a guarantee that Moore Threads and MetaX will be included.Overseas retail investors can gain limited exposure through offshore funds that invest in A-shares. Foreign retail investors interested in STAR Market IPOs, such as Moore Threads and MetaX, can invest in non-China domiciled funds that invest in A-shares and usually these funds do participate in IPOs, Shou said. China's STAR Market is a Nasdaq-style tech board in Shanghai focused on strategic sectors such as semiconductors, AI and biotech, with looser profitability requirements and tighter access for foreign retail investors.\"However, such participation will be indirect, very limited, and mostly non-meaningful,\" he caveated, as IPO allocations may be tiny relative to the fund's total assets.While foreign retail investors are largely locked out of access to mainland Chinese IPOs, some large institutions can participate in them.A program for qualified foreign institutional Investors, or QFIIs, allows approved global institutions to invest directly in onshore Chinese stocks, including IPOs. But it is designed for large asset managers, sovereign funds and banks, not individual investors.QFIIs include the likes of investment banks such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs as well as central banks, among hundreds of other participants.The QFII and renminbi QFII schemes are programs that allow approved institutional investors to trade onshore A-shares and participate in IPOs, but they require approval from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, with foreign-exchange registration and settlement overseen by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE.While China's QFII and RQFII regimes do not set explicit asset-size or operating-history thresholds, applicants must be institutions with sound financial standing, relevant investment experience, robust governance and compliance systems, and a clean regulatory record.They must also appoint an onshore custodian and complete foreign-exchange registration with SAFE.The CSI 300 Information Technology Index, which measures the performance of information-technology companies within China's CSI 300, is up 32% year to date, compared with the benchmark CSI 300, up 17%, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index, which has gained 24% so far this year.",

    "body": "watch nowBuild-A-Bear Workshop wasn't always a retail winner.The toy store, known for its interactive experience of building and accessorizing stuffed animals, has gone through a significant turnaround since CEO Sharon Price John took the helm of the company over a decade ago.\"When I first came in 2013, that assessment of the brand was strong,\" she told CNBC. \"We don't have a broken brand, we have a broken business, and when you started doing interviews, you really understood how much this brand meant to people.\"The company found initial success in malls in the early 2000s, but Build-A-Bear's stock plunged after the 2008 financial crisis, with the company reporting a $49 million loss in fiscal 2012.Under Price John, the company began investing in e-commerce, shifting orders to stores instead of its distribution center and diversifying its sales beyond just malls to turn around the company.\"Our goal overall was to create sustained, profitable growth, but the profitable was first,\" Price John said.That strategy worked. Virtually all of Build-A-Bear's stores are now profitable, and the stock experienced an Nvidia-like run earlier this year, hitting an all-time high of about $76 in September. The stock has come down some since then, but it's still up more than 125% over the past two years.But tariffs have taken a hit to the business. Build-A-Bear imports over 90% of its products from China and Vietnam, and the company said in its third-quarter earnings report in early December that it expects to take a roughly $11 million hit from tariffs for fiscal 2025.Company executives also said on a call with analysts that the company experienced a slowdown in traffic in October during the government shutdown.Small Cap Consumer Research analyst Eric Beder wrote in a note this month that the firm was lowering projections and reducing its price target by $10 due to the company reporting lighter-than-expected revenue and the \"implied deep tariff impacts.\"Still, the company is outperforming most of its retail competitors, expecting to reach $500 million in annual revenue for the first time.\"You can buy stuffed animals or a plush pretty much everywhere, right from Target to FAO Schwarz and every place in between,\" Beder told CNBC. \"The difference is that at Build-A-Bear, it's yours. You helped make it.\"Watch the video to learn more about how Build-A-Bear has made its comeback.",

    "body": "French cheeses displayed in a store in Paris. Bertrand Guay | Afp | Getty ImagesChina on Monday announced tariffs of up to 42.7% on dairy products from the European Union, following the results of an anti-subsidy investigation that began in August 2024. In a statement by the country's Ministry of Commerce, China said that EU subsidies for dairy products had caused \"substantial damage\" to China's domestic dairy industries. The tariffs are set to take effect on Dec. 23, the ministry said, and the rates would be determined by the amount of \"ad valorem subsidy rates\" from the country's Customs Tariff Commission.The tariffs range from 21.9% to 42.7%, with companies \"who cooperated with the investigation\" subject to tariffs of 28.6%, and those that \"did not cooperate\" facing the top rate of 42.7%, according to a statement from a Commerce Ministry official.Products that will be affected include fresh, processed and blue cheeses — such as the famous Roquefort blue cheese aged in the caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France — as well as some kinds of milk and cream. The latest tariffs mark an escalation in trade tensions between the regions, which flared up when Brussels slapped tariffs of up to 45% on electric vehicles imported from China in October last year.Separately, the bloc in November challenged China's imposition of tariffs on imports of EU brandy at the World Trade Organisation, saying \"China's provisional measures on EU brandy are not in line with WTO rules.\"An EU spokesperson described the measures as \"unjustified and unwarranted\" on Monday, according to Reuters, and said the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, would be providing comments to the Chinese authorities.The Commission was not immediately available to comment when contacted by CNBC Monday. Last week, Beijing sharply cut its duties on pork imports and pig by-products from the European Union, with new tariff rates ranging from 4.9% to 19.8% on dozens of European pork exports.It comes after the country in September imposed temporary anti-dumping tariffs of up to 62.4% in the form of cash deposits on pork imports from the EU.— CNBC's Anniek Bao contributed to this report.Correction: This article has been updated to reflect that China's tariffs will come into force on Dec. 23.

    "body": "Still from Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash.\"DisneyThe opening weekend for Disney's \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" was less of a blaze and more of a simmer.And that's the expectation for the full theatrical run of the third installment in James Cameron's Avatar franchise. During its first three days in theaters, \"Fire and Ash\" tallied $88 million, falling well shy of analysts' expectations, which called for a debut haul between $110 million and $125 million. For comparison, 2022's \"Avatar: The Way of Water\" brought in $134 million during the same three-day period.Internationally, the film collected $257 million, bringing the film's global opening to an estimated $345 million.\"Fire and Ash\" faced some theatrical headwinds, namely its over-three-hour runtime. There was also less pent-up demand compared to \"The Way of Water,\" which was released more than a decade after the first Avatar film. Some box office analysts and critics noted that \"Fire and Ash\" has less technological innovation than its predecessors, which had been a driving factor in past ticket sales.Around 5.2 million domestic moviegoers went to see \"Fire and Ash,\" according to data from EntTelligence, a massive decline from the 8.7 million that ventured out in 2022 to see the opening weekend of \"The Way of Water.\"Still, the Avatar franchise has never been front-loaded at the box office. The first film, 2009's \"Avatar,\" generated just $77 million in its opening weekend domestically, but stayed in theaters for nearly a year. By the time it exited theaters, the film had generated $2.7 billion globally. With re-releases, the film now stands at $2.9 billion, according to data from Comscore.\"The Way of Water\" ran in theaters for 23 weeks and has grossed $2.3 billion globally.\"With less than two weeks remaining in the box office year, the pressure on 'Avatar: Fire And Ash' to deliver big was intense and though the film may have come in a bit below pre-release opening weekend projections, the Avatar films have always been known for their marathon box office trajectories,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, head of marketplace trends at Comscore.Also aiding the franchise at the box office are premium large-format ticket sales. The Avatar films have over-indexed with the more expensive experiential screens like IMAX and Dolby as well as 3D showings. Disney reported that 3D and premium theaters accounted for 66% of the weekend total.While 3D films have fallen out of favor with domestic audiences, they remain popular internationally —especially in China. Indeed, \"Avatar\" made the bulk of its money outside the U.S., with a whopping $2.08 billion coming from overseas.",

    "body": "Company: LKQ Corp. (LKQ)Business: LKQ engages in the distribution of replacement parts, components, and systems used in the repair and maintenance of vehicles and specialty vehicle aftermarket products and accessories. The company operates through four segments: wholesale-North America, Europe, specialty, and self service. It offers bumper covers, automotive body panels, and lights, as well as paint and paint-related consumables for refinishing vehicles; mechanical automotive parts and accessories; salvage products, including mechanical and collision parts comprising engines; transmissions; door assemblies; sheet metal products, such as trunk lids, fenders, and hoods; and lights and bumper assemblies. The company also provides scrap metal and other materials to metals recyclers; precious metals contained in certain of our recycled parts, such as catalytic converters; and brake pads, discs and sensors, clutches, steering and suspension products, filters, and oil and automotive fluids, as well as electrical products. It serves collision and mechanical repair shops, and new and used car dealerships, as well as retail customers. LKQ was incorporated in 1998 and is headquartered in Antioch, Tennessee.Stock Market Value: $7.66 billion ($30.15 per share)Activist: Ananym Capital ManagementOwnership: 0.39%Average Cost: n/aActivist Commentary: Ananym Capital Management is a New York-based activist investment firm which launched on Sept. 3, 2024, and is run by Charlie Penner (a former partner at JANA Partners and head of shareholder activism at Engine No. 1) and Alex Silver (a former partner and investment committee member at P2 Capital Partners). Ananym looks for high quality but undervalued companies, regardless of industry. They would prefer to work amicably with their portfolio companies but are willing to launch a proxy fight as a last resort. According to their most recent 13F filing, they manage $260 million across 10 positions.What's happeningOn Oct. 21, Ananym Capital called on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business.Behind the scenesLKQ is a leading distributor of aftermarket vehicle parts. Its core North America segment (40% of revenue and 55% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) primarily supplies aftermarket collision parts, such as mirrors and bumpers. The Europe segment (47% of revenue/38% of EBITDA) primarily supplies mechanical and suspension products but contains a wide variety of other replacement and maintenance products. Although the European business is slightly larger by revenue, the North American business has significantly higher margins and a much larger market share compared with its peers. Lastly, the specialty segment (13% of revenue/7% of EBITDA) provides aftermarket parts for the RV market. Originally just a U.S. aftermarket parts business, the company began aggressively pursuing acquisitions in Europe starting in 2011, shifting from a focus on recycled parts consolidation to building and integrating a European footprint. Moreover, these two businesses are not nearly as similar as they sound, in North America they do primarily aftermarket collision parts like mirrors and bumpers and in Europe, it's primarily mechanical suspension and things under the hood.LKQ is no stranger to shareholder activism. In September 2019, when the stock was trading at $27 per share, ValueAct Capital engaged the company and settled for a board seat for one of its partners. Through this campaign, ValueAct was able to usher in a new wave of operational discipline, where instead of focusing on European M&A, LKQ paused large acquisitions and shifted its focus to growing the company's free cash flow and executing buybacks at an attractive discount. The results of this campaign speak for themselves, as LKQ's share price rose to over $60 during ValueAct's campaign, giving them an 86.39% return on their investment versus 16.15% for the Russell 2000. However, following ValueAct's exit, LKQ returned to its old ways, shifting their focus back to M&A, and the stock had subsequently declined more than 25% by February 2025, when two new activists entered the stock. In an uninspired campaign and settlement, those activists quickly settled for two board seats for independent directors and the stock has declined by 20% in the eight months since while the Russell 2000 has been up more than 7% during the same time.Now with the stock just slightly higher than it was in 2019 when ValueAct engaged, a third activist has entered to take over where ValueAct had left off, calling on LKQ to divest its European operations and refocus on its North American business. LKQ has always been a company that has benefited from simplification and harmed by complexity – and Ananym's plan seems to align with this approach: (i) halt major M&A, (i) divest the European business and other non-core assets, and (iii) use the proceeds to fund buybacks and reinvest in organic growth in the core NA segment. Operationally, there are several benefits to Ananym's plan. While the U.S. functions as a single market with consistent regulations, Europe is a series of nation states each with their own regulatory framework, making integration far more complex. This creates meaningful execution risks, exemplified by the company still needing to integrate more than 20 ERP systems in 18 different countries. Not only would divesting Europe leave the company with a higher margin business with a much larger relative market share, but it would also allow management to devote all their time and resources to North America. The alternative is to continue to focus a disproportionate amount of time on integrating all the European acquisitions across the different European countries all from their headquarters in Chicago and Nashville.The opportunity here is also clear from a valuation perspective. Industrial distribution peers typically trade at mid-teens or higher EBITDA multiples, while LKQ currently trades at 7.3x forward EBITDA. Not only is this a discount to the market, but to its historical levels, as even in its messy conglomerate form, LKQ has still traded on a 10-year historical average of 10x EBITDA. The European business could potentially be sold at an 8 to 9x multiple, but a sale even at the company's current multiple would be beneficial to unlocking value in the North American business, which could re-rate to its historical multiple of 10x EBITDA. The proceeds from such a sale could enable LKQ to repurchase up to 40% of its outstanding shares, which, when combined with the re-rating of NA, could easily translate to more than 60% upside from the company's current share price. While strategics with similar models, such as O'Reilly, AutoZone, and Genuine Parts, may find the European business appealing, strategics generally prefer clean businesses and this is far from that. Private equity, on the other hand, feasts on these types of projects, using their operational and restructuring expertise and flexibility of being out of the public eye to unlock these complex assets overtime in a way that is more difficult for public companies to address.In its short history, Ananym has established a reputation for striving to work amicably with management to create value for shareholders, and this situation appears to be no different. The fund has been largely complimentary of LKQ CEO Justin Jude who was named to the position in July 2024 and has his roots in the North American business. Under his short leadership, the company has already taken steps in the right direction — announcing plans to repurchase 14% of outstanding shares and divesting non-core assets such as its self-service salvage business that was sold in August to private equity. It has also signaled that its specialty business is on the market and it's expected to be sold in the near term. However, Jude seems to be a little more attached to the European business than these other businesses. Persuading him to divest Europe may take a little more time. If we learned anything from the previous activist campaigns at LKQ, this company needs a financially astute shareholder representative, not an independent industry executive. They do not need someone to help them with operations, they need someone to help them financially model, evaluate and potentially execute strategic options and work with the board to arrive at what is best for shareholders. Given Ananym's reputation as an amicable activist and their constructive relationship with Jude thus far, we think this is a perfect opportunity to put an Ananym representative on the board like Alex Silver who has extensive financial and private equity experience and brings a team of analysts ready to model available opportunities.Ken Squire is the founder and president of 13D Monitor, an institutional research service on shareholder activism, and the founder and portfolio manager of the 13D Activist Fund, a mutual fund that invests in a portfolio of activist investments.",

    "body": "Volatility is nothing new for crypto investors, and 2025 has been a wild ride, with bitcoin climbing above $125,000 in October before experiencing several sharp drops — peak to trough, a decline of over $40,000 from its record high.\"Crypto is a volatile asset class, and in some sense, there is no avoiding that volatility,\" said Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management company which runs one of the largest bitcoin ETFs, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). \"It's an alternative asset class, and we are seeking its particular return characteristics,\" he said.Bitcoin is now trading near $88,000, and whether the next move is up or down, investors in the crypto space need to have what it takes to stomach the volatility. There may be some help — in the form of new market ideas and classic diversification concepts — to cushion portfolios from at least some of crypto's risk-on nature. These are some of the ideas to consider.Identify your appropriate portfolio sizing.The first step is to make sure your crypto position sizing within your portfolio is appropriate. Some financial advisors are going out on a limb and telling investors to hold as much as 40% in crypto. But for most investors, there is a strong case to be made for crypto remaining only a modest part of a broadly diversified portfolio. This can vary by an individual's age, income, risk profile and other factors, but a good rule of thumb is to allocate no more than 5% of a well-balanced portfolio to crypto. Even so, many investors opt for a smaller allocation, often in the 1% to 3% range. Consider dialing down the risk level in your other holdings.David Siemer, co-founder and chief executive of Wave Digital Assets, an investment advisory firm specializing in digital asset management, emphasized the importance of ensuring the rest of an investor's portfolio is aligned to help maintain volatility at a comfortable level. That may mean a less heavy tilt to the market's leading growth stocks across the broader portfolio.\"Because [crypto's] going to give you either rocket fuel or the opposite, you probably want to be a little heavier on value stocks or bonds, for example,\" he said.Diversify within the crypto asset class.Bitcoin is the largest digital asset by market capitalization, but there are many others with valuable use cases, Pandl said. Adding exposure within a crypto portfolio to ether and the solana cryptocurrency, for instance, \"can be a way to make sure you're capturing all of these trends in your portfolio,\" he said. This approach may improve risk-adjusted returns in the same way diversification improves risk-adjusted returns in other asset classes, Pandl added.Still, investors need to recognize that other types of crypto are highly correlated to bitcoin, so there's only so much diversification within crypto itself that's possible, Siemer said. Other advisors caution that many of the non-bitcoin digital assets becoming popular still trade more like tech stocks than stores of value. It is too soon to know how their trading will evolve, investment advisor Nate Geraci, president of NovaDius Wealth Management, told CNBC's \"ETF Edge\" earlier this year, and they may remain more closely hitched to the risk-on market trade than bitcoin itself does over time. Using ether as an example, Geraci said, \"I view it more as a tech play than bitcoin, which many view as digital gold. It takes time for advisors and investors to get comfortable with where it fits in a diversified portfolio. It's very early quite frankly,\" he added.Buy a range of ETFs, or buy into the concept of an index-based crypto fund.The crypto ETF landscape has significantly expanded since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January 2024. Bitcoin and ether spot ETFs have garnered billions in institutional inflows, and asset managers are actively filing for ETFs covering solana, XRP, litecoin, cardano and more, with the Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH) and the Solana ETF (SOLZ) as examples. Investors should expect many more ETFs to launch in the next year, which will provide additional options for consumers and opportunities for diversification, Pandl said.Investors can also now take an index-based approach within ETFs, which is a convenient way to gain diversification in crypto, while managing volatility. Grayscale has an index fund, the Grayscale CoinDesk Crypto 5 ETF (GDLC) that became available as an ETF in September and holds a basket of the top five crypto assets weighted by market capitalization. Seventy-five percent of the assets were bitcoin as of Dec. 8, but that automatically rebalances based on market capitalization, Pandl said.The recently launched Bitwise 10 Crypto Index ETF (BITW) holds 10 crypto assets including bitcoin, ether, XRP, solana, chainlink and litecoin. It is the first ETF to also include exposure to cardano, avalanche, sui and polkadot. But as with the Grayscale crypto index fund, it is important for investors to understand that holdings remain heavily weighted to the more established cryptocurrencies. BITW allocates 90% of its holdings to bitcoin and ether.Use a financial advisor who is crypto friendly.One of the ways to encourage diversification — and shield against big portfolio swings — is to work with a financial advisor who can help you craft an appropriately diversified portfolio that includes crypto. Not all advisors incorporate crypto into their model portfolios, but that's starting to change as digital assets gain traction.Thryve Wealth Management, for example, uses bitcoin as a hedge against the U.S. dollar. Randol W. Curtis, chief investment officer, said if inflation continues at 2.5% to 3%, that's a significant erosion of the U.S. dollar's purchasing power. That's where bitcoin comes in. \"Every bitcoin will be worth more and more dollars every year that the dollar inflates away,\" Curtis said. The firm is also researching the ethereum and solana platforms, used primarily for stablecoins.Ric Edelman, who runs the Digital Assets Council of Financial Advisors, told CNBC earlier this year that crypto's mainstream adoption phase is occurring at a time when investors need to hold equities later in life than ever before to achieve retirement income security, and bonds are not able to serve in the same role as they did throughout the 20th century. As the asset allocation model shifts away from the classic 60% stock/40% bond approach, crypto needs to play a bigger role in investing, he says. There are now crypto ETFs offering an income component to perform some of the functions that bonds once did within a portfolio, including Simplify Bitcoin Strategy PLUS Income ETF (MAXI) and a planned bitcoin income fund from the world's largest asset manager, BlackRock.Dollar cost average and rebalance in the crypto market.Another way to reduce crypto's volatility is dollar cost averaging, which involves systematic weekly or monthly purchases of crypto. That way, whether it's going up or going down, you're buying in at various prices, which will reduce the volatility, said Steve Larsen, president of Columbia Advisory Group and co-founder of the Certified Digital Asset Advisor designation.Larsen also advises regular crypto rebalancing. He gives the hypothetical example of an investor who holds 5% of his portfolio in bitcoin, which rises to 7% based on market appreciation. The investor should then sell 2% of his bitcoin holdings and use the proceeds to buy other assets. If bitcoin becomes too small a percentage of the portfolio, the investor can buy more, Larsen said.Advisors have professional tools to automatically rebalance portfolios. Additionally, most major retail brokerages offer clients rebalancing and trading tools as part of their online account tools. The problem is, many self-directed investors don't take the time to do this.\"The reason people get stunned with bitcoin is they don't treat it like anything else,\" said Ivory Johnson, founder of Delancey Wealth Management. If you had tech stocks and you never rebalanced when tech stocks tanked, you'd be kicking yourself. Bitcoin is the same thing. \"It goes up, and people think it's going to keep going to the sky. Treat crypto like any other asset class,\" he said.Johnson points to previous market cycles where investors made risky bets based on unbridled optimism. \"There are people who lost their entire savings because they thought there was no way General Motors could go bankrupt.\" In 2009, it was one of the largest corporate bankruptcies in U.S. history.Consider downside protection ETF products.Some investors who want to dabble in crypto, but who prefer downside protection, might consider a principal protected note, a financial instrument that returns the principal amount invested at maturity regardless of the underlying asset's price movement.Multiple companies offer these types of products. Calamos Investments, for example, launched the first \"downside protection\" crypto ETF in January, the Calamos Bitcoin Structured Alt Protection ETF (CBOJ). The fund company offers multiple ETFs using this strategic approach with different levels of downside protection — 100%, 90% or 80%. Of course, there are management fees associated with ETFs, and even higher fees on more sophisticated products. The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) has an annual management fee of 0.25%, versus 0.69% on the Calamos bitcoin ETF. But some investors prefer to use professional managers versus investing on their own directly, Siemer said.  \"For some people, doing it in a simple product that's easy to buy has value,\" he added.Sign up for our weekly newsletter that goes beyond the livestream, offering a closer look at the trends and figures shaping the ETF market.

    "body": "Sad female worker carrying her belongings while leaving the office after being firedIsbjorn | Istock | Getty ImagesLayoffs have been a defining feature of the job market in 2025, with several major companies announcing thousands of job cuts driven by artificial intelligence. In fact, AI was responsible for almost 55,000 layoffs in the U.S. this year, according to consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.There were in total 1.17 million job cuts through 2025, the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 when there were 2.2 million layoffs announced by the end of the year. In October, U.S. employers announced 153,000 job cuts, and there were over 71,000 job cuts in November, with AI being cited for over 6,000 for the month, per Challenger. At a time when inflation bites, tariffs are adding to expenses, and firms are looking to carry out cost-cutting measures, AI has presented an attractive, short-term solution to the problem. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology released a study in November showing that AI can already do the job of 11.7% of the U.S. labor market and save as much as $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and other professional services. Not everyone is convinced that AI is the real reason behind the dramatic job cuts, as Fabian Stephany, assistant professor of AI and work at the Oxford Internet Institute, previously told CNBC, that it might be an excuse. Stephany said many companies that performed well during the pandemic \"significantly overhired\" and the recent layoffs might just be a \"market clearance.\"\"It's to some extent firing people that for whom there had not been a sustainable long term perspective and instead of saying 'we miscalculated this two, three years ago, they can now come to the scapegoating, and that is saying 'it's because of AI though,'\" he added.Here are the top firms that cited AI as part of their layoff and restructuring strategy in 2025. Amazon Amazon CEO Andy Jassy speaks during a keynote address at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada.Noah Berger | Getty ImagesIn October, Amazon announced the largest ever round of layoffs in its history, slashing 14,000 corporate roles, as it looks to invest in its \"biggest bets\" which includes AI. \"This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we've seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before... we're convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business,\"  Beth Galetti, senior vice president of people experience and technology at Amazon, wrote in a blog post.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy warned of the cuts earlier this year, telling employees that AI will shrink the company's workforce and that the tech giant will need \"fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\" Microsoft Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella appears at the CES event in Las Vegas on Jan. 9, 2024. The event typically doubles as a preview of how tech giants and startups will market their wares in the coming year and if early announcements are any indication, AI-branded products will become the new \"smart\" gadgets of 2024.David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft has cut a total of around 15,000 jobs through 2025, and its most recent announcement in July saw 9,000 roles on the chopping block. CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo to employees that the company needed to \"reimagine\" its \"mission for a new era,\" and went on to tout the significance of AI to the company. \"What does empowerment look like in the era of AI? It's not just about building tools for specific roles or tasks. It's about building tools that empower everyone to create their own tools. That's the shift we are driving — from a software factory to an intelligence engine empowering every person and organization to build whatever they need to achieve,\" Nadella said.

However, unlike other companies that had cited AI in job cuts, Krishna admitted that the firm had increased hiring in other areas that required more critical thinking, such as software engineering, sales, and marketing. In November, the company announced a 1% global cut, which could impact nearly 3,000 employees. Crowdstrike Founder and CEO of CrowdStrike George Kurtz speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesCybersecurity software maker CrowdStrike said in May that it's laying off 5% of its workforce or 500 employees, and directly attributed the cuts to AI. \"AI has always been foundational to how we operate,\" co-founder and CEO George Kurtz wrote in a memo included in a securities filing. \"AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.\"Workday Carl Eschenbach, CEO of Workday speaks on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 23, 2025.Gerry Miller | CNBC In February, HR platform Workday was one of the first companies this year to say its cutting 8.5% of its workforce, amounting to around 1,750 jobs, as the company invests more in AI. Workday CEO Carl Eschenbach said the layoffs were needed to prioritize AI investment and to free up resources. ",

    "body": "New Delhi, India – March 17: Prime Minister Narendra Modi and New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon witness the exchange of MOUs during the joint press statement at Hyderabad House in New Delhi on March 17, 2025. The India Today Group | The India Today Group | Getty ImagesIndia and New Zealand on Monday announced a free trade deal that will make a majority of the goods trade between the two countries duty free. The trade pact, which will be reviewed after one year, will be signed in the first half of next year.\"This historic agreement eliminates and reduces tariffs on 95% of New Zealand's exports,\" New Zealand Trade and Investment Minister Todd McClay said in a statement, adding that nearly 57% of exports from the country will become duty-free in India \"from day one.\"The pacific island nation will also invest $20 billion in India over next 15 years and allow mobility of professionals, skilled labor and students from India to New Zealand, according to a statement from India. India has also secured a \"zero duty market\" on all its exports to New Zealand that includes textiles, apparel, leather, footwear, marine products, gems and jewelry, handicrafts, engineering goods and automobiles. \"Today this Free Trade Agreement is about building trade around people and launching opportunities,\" India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said. The deal will give Indian businesses and youth an opportunity to \"learn, work and grow on a global stage,\" he added.India will eliminate tariff on sheep meat, wool, coal and nearly all of forestry and wood exports. New Delhi will also allow duty-free access for dairy and other food ingredients for re-exports.However, to ensure protection to farmers and the domestic industry, New Delhi has said the market access excludes dairy, coffee, milk, cream, cheese, yoghurts, whey, caseins, onions, sugar, spices, edible oils, rubber.India's trade pact with New Zealand \"provides policy certainty and lowers input costs for manufacturing, creating a vision for long-term economic resilience,\" said Ranjeet Mehta, chief executive officer and secretary general, of Indian industry body PHDCCI.Bilateral merchandise trade between the two countries stood at  $1.3 billion in 2024–25 while total trade in goods and services was $2.4 billion in 2024. \"The FTA provides a stable and predictable framework to unlock the full potential of this relationship,\" India's commerce ministry said.The FTA marks India's third deal this year following a free trade agreement with the UK in July and another pact with Oman earlier this month. The deals comes at a time when the U.S., New Delhi's largest trading partner, has levied 50% tariffs on its goods exports, that includes 25% duties for India's purchases of Russian oil.  India, which has ambitions to become an export powerhouse, has been looking to diversify its exports to make up for the impact of U.S. tariffs. After steep tariffs came into force in August, India's exports to the U.S. fell nearly 12% in September and 8.5% in October, before a sharp growth of 22.6% in November.",

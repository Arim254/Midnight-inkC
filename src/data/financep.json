    "body": "Dating is full of tiny money moments: choosing a restaurant, talking about travel, splitting a check, and deciding whether a gift is \"too much.\" You don't need to ask someone how much they make, what their net worth is, or how much student loan debt they carry to learn how they approach money and what kind of financial partner they might be.Talking about money with a potential partner is never just about money. It's about values, habits, and expectations around how someone thinks a \"team\" should work. What not to ask early onOn your first few dates with someone, can you imagine actually asking, \"How much do you make?\" Or, \"What's your net worth?\" I wouldn't be surprised if they excused themselves to the restroom and didn't come back. The irony is, those questions aren't even the best way to get at what you're trying to learn. Someone can earn a lot and still feel financially unstable. Someone can earn less but have excellent systems, habits, and boundaries. The goal is to understand how they think about money and what their values are. 7 money questions to ask on a dateStart with these questions that invite real answers, stories, preferences, and patterns — and reveal their financial mindset more organically.\"Where did you grow up and what was it like?\" It's a basic getting-to-know-you question, but you'll learn a lot about the environment they were raised in, their family norms, and the lifestyle they consider \"normal,\" without forcing them into specifics.\"Tell me about your family. What were they like when you were a kid?\" People will tell you what shaped them if you give them an opening. Pay attention to themes like stability, ambition, generosity, privacy, education, status, faith, and community. These are the things that drive financial decisions.\"What was your first job?\" This is an easy way into someone's relationship with work, motivation, and independence. Did they feel proud, pressured, supported, or alone? Did they work well with other people? Those early experiences tend to show up in adulthood, including how someone thinks about earning and financial stability. A first job often reveals what money represents to them: freedom, security, responsibility, or survival. It can also hint at their default habits, like whether they saved their first paychecks, spent them immediately, or used them to help their family.\"Are you more of a planner or a wing-it person?\" This is a window into how someone handles uncertainty, and money is full of uncertainty. Two people can be completely different here and still work, but it helps to know what you might be signing up for early on — before life gets busy and important financial decisions have to be made.\"What's something you'll happily spend on and something you refuse to overpay for?\" Most people have \"yes\" categories and \"no\" categories that reflect their values. You can learn how they perceive things like convenience, health, quality, experiences, style, generosity, and savings. It's also a great way to talk about spending without getting into budgets.\"What's your ideal vacation?\" Vacation preferences are just as much about money expectations as they are about travel. A \"camping in national parks\" person and a \"boutique hotel and tasting menu\" person can find common ground, but it's helpful to learn early what someone assumes about cost and how they handle it when planning trips with other people. Do they openly talk about a budget before booking, or hope it all just works out?\"When you get stressed, what do you like to do?\" You're not fishing for a perfect answer. You're learning how someone copes with stress, because stress changes how people spend, save, and communicate about money. Some people plan. Some distract. Some shut down. Some spend. The key is whether they recognize their patterns, because self-awareness is what allows us to better manage our behaviors.When to get more directWhen money stops being theoretical and starts showing up in decisions that affect both of you — moving in, splitting regular expenses, building a shared life — it's time to have more direct and specific conversations.Money doesn't have to be a third wheel on your early dates with someone new. Start with questions that reveal how they think and live, and save the hard numbers for when you're building something together. That's how you avoid surprises and set the relationship up to last.Douglas A.

    "body": "When choosing a romantic partner, money is likely to play a factor in some capacity. From deciding who pays for the first date to figuring out how to split bills when you move in together, money comes up time and again throughout a relationship.Among single adults, 74% say financial stability is one of the most attractive traits in a partner, and 60% say financial compatibility matters more than chemistry in today's economy, according to a recent survey of over 2,100 Americans aged 18 and older from The Harris Poll. Financial compatibility is key in relationships because money doesn't just shape your lifestyle — how you approach and manage money is often reflective of other personality traits and attitudes, says Valerie Galinskaya, head of the Merrill Center for Family Wealth, a specialized group within wealth management company Merrill Lynch. The group provides education, insights and guidance to ultrahigh net worth families.\"It is oftentimes representative of other things like love, control, power. And if individuals don't take the time, especially couples, to really think through that, they are not really setting themselves up for success,\" Galinskaya says.Common red flags for daters include expecting the other person to pay for everything or having bad spending habits, The Harris Poll survey found. While these types of concerns may be dealbreakers for some, they could be things you can work through together if you decide you want to pursue the relationship anyway, Galinskaya says. However, she identifies other factors that could signal you and your partner are financially incompatible. Here are three to watch out for.1. Lack of willingness to share informationYou don't necessarily have to share your salary or how much debt you have on the first date, Galinskaya says. But as a relationship progresses, \"a lack of willingness to disclose information\" can be \"representative of really unhealthy patterns,\" she says.She emphasizes that there's a difference between \"privacy and secrecy,\" but adds that it can be challenging to set and accomplish goals like buying property or retiring together if one partner has been hiding things like unmanaged debt or a lack of savings. Relationship and money experts agree that transparent conversations around money are key to building successful relationships. \"Once you and your partner know how to talk about money, everything changes,\" self-made millionaire and money expert Ramit Sethi wrote in his book, \"Money for Couples.\" \"Strong couples know that handling money together is about values, trust, and communication,\" writes Heather Boneparth, director of business and legal affairs for Bone Fide Wealth and co-author of \"Money Together.\"2. Control issuesEspecially early on in a relationship, one partner trying to exert control over the other's financial decisions can be a sign of incompatibility, Galinskaya says. \"We all have different levels of the amount of control that we like to have,\" she says. \"But in my experience, [over-exerting control] can be a reflection of ... deeper trust and control issues, not often restricted to money.\"Additionally, rigid control of a partner's finances can be a sign of economic abuse, which is a form of domestic abuse, according to the National Network to End Domestic Violence. If you may be a victim of financial abuse, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 800-799-SAFE or visit its website.Couples in long-term relationships should work toward making joint decisions when it comes to money, but it may start to be problematic if you want to make your own decision and \"your partner all of a sudden feels entitled to have a very strong input,\" Galinskaya says. 3. Ambition gapYou and your partner don't need to make the same or similar incomes to be compatible, Galinskaya says, but you should be more aligned on your views of productivity and ambition. If one partner is career-driven while the other is routinely in and out of jobs or isn't motivated to keep building their career, that \"can be a reflection that this is not going to be an individual who's really going to contribute,\" she says. \"Not just financially, but contribute their insight, their time, their effort in a relationship.\"One strategy Galinskaya suggests is for couples to start by defining what success means for them, whether that's building a business together or ensuring they have enough saved for retirement. It's unlikely you'll meet those goals if you don't first communicate them to each other and revisit them periodically as your lives and priorities change, she says.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "New York City shoppers lined up in Greenwich Village on Thursday for the grand opening of The Polymarket, a free grocery store. The market — perhaps a nod to New York mayor Zohran Mamdani's proposed city-run grocery stores — is only operating through 7 p.m. on Sunday. But its namesake sponsor, a prediction market that allows users to trade binary \"yes\" or \"no\" contracts on the outcome of real-world events, from the Super Bowl coin flip to Federal Reserve rate cuts, appears to be here to stay. That didn't always appear to be the case. In 2022, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined Polymarket $1.4 million for operating as an unregistered derivatives market and forced the firm to block U.S. users. The company continued to operate offshore, and in July 2025 spent $112 million to acquire QCEX, the holding company for a regulated and licensed options trading platform. The move paved the way for U.S. federal regulatory approval, which the firm received in November. The firm has relaunched a beta version of its app in the U.S., which is gradually being rolled out to users who sign up to be on a waitlist. Polymarket is not disclosing how many users it currently has. Polymarket and rival prediction market Kalshi are currently embroiled in legal battles at the state level, where regulators in states including Nevada, New York and New Jersey say that trading event contracts on sports amounts to gambling that falls under state jurisdiction and is taxed differently than financial markets. State regulators in Massachusetts recently won an injunction against Kalshi in court, which temporarily banned the firm from offering sports-related contracts in the state.In response to the lawsuit, a Kalshi spokesperson told CNBC, \"Massachusetts is trying to block Kalshi's innovations by relying on outdated laws and ideas.\" The company said it is \"ready to defend [its technology] once again in a court of law.\"This week Polymarket filed a lawsuit against the state, in which the company's representatives say Polymarket hopes to avoid \"imminent and irreparable harm arising from Massachusetts's enforcement of state gambling laws against federally regulated derivatives exchanges.\"In the meantime, customer money continues to pour in. Kalshi's CEO estimated the firm saw more than $1 billion in trades on the Super Bowl. That includes $100 million in trades coming on which song halftime performer Bad Bunny would perform first alone.The mechanics of prediction marketsSo how does this all work? Prediction markets run on event contracts, financial instruments that essentially let you buy a share in the outcome of an event. The price of those shares ranges between $0 and $1, with the value reflecting the likelihood of your chosen outcome coming to fruition.Ahead of the Super Bowl, contracts predicting that the Seattle Seahawks would win on both Polymarket and Kalshi cost $0.68, per Barron's, implying a 68% chance of a Seattle victory according to these markets. At the game's final whistle, all Seattle contracts bought at any price went to $1 per share. All New England Patriots contracts went to $0.Unlike a traditional casino, those buying events contracts aren't playing against the \"house.\" Rather, platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi allow traders to buy and sell contracts among themselves, with the companies collecting a small fee on each trade. The more money piles in on the \"yes\" or \"no\" side of a particular event, the more expensive that contract gets. For example, shares predicting a Seahawks victory in the Super Bowl, increased closer and closer to $1 the more it became apparent that Seattle was going to win. Importantly, investors can buy or sell their options at any time before the event is over. Say you picked \"yes\" on a fringe political candidate to win an election at $0.05. Then, a month later, that candidate made a landmark speech that boosted popularity. After more money comes in on your candidate, the price is now $0.10. You could hang onto your shares if you think they may go higher (or actually win) or you could sell them for double what you paid. Essentially, these markets provide real-time odds on future events, according to a crowdsourced pool of people who have skin in the game. On some level this has always been the case, says Stephane Ouellette, co-founder and CEO of digital asset investment bank FRNT Financial. Some who understood the intricacies of oil futures, for instance, could suss out whether political tensions in the Middle East might boil over, he says. \"There's been a huge innovation where now we're turning these markets into more digestible information that a retail trader can now understand,\" Ouellette says. \"Whereas before you needed like a Ph.D. in market analysis to be able to figure this out.\"Tread carefully putting money behind your predictions, experts sayWhether buying contracts on prediction markets constitutes gambling akin to making a bet with a sportsbook is up for legal debate. But the distinction is moot when it comes to investing and managing your money, says Ivory Johnson, a certified financial planner and founder of Delancey Wealth Management. \"It's that old adage, you've got to know how much you're willing to lose,\" he says. \"It's no different than if you go to Vegas with your friends.\"  Of course, no matter how convicted you may feel on the future outcome of a particular event, you'd be wise to not make prediction contracts a major part of your investing strategy, financial pros say. At most, they belong in an \"opportunity portfolio,\" says Doug Boneparth, a CFP and founder of Bone Fide Wealth. This sleeve of your portfolio, which might constitute 5% to 10% of your investable assets, is reserved for riskier plays such as individual stocks, cryptocurrencies, niche exchange-traded funds and maybe a prediction or two, Boneparth says. The rest of it generally belongs in a broadly diversified portfolio of investments you plan to buy and hold for the long term, he says. The thinking here is that, even if your predictions end up going to zero, the loss won't be enough to derail your financial plans. \"Most retail investors should be approaching investing as a long-term consistency and discipline game. That's how you quietly compound your returns over time,\" Boneparth says. \"So while [prediction markets] may be a piece of the puzzle, and I think it's a little bit of a stretch, it definitely would go into that more speculatory opportunity bucket.\"Johnson recommends thinking of prediction markets as part of your entertainment budget, the same way you might think about what you spend each month on a hobby like golf. That way, you're doing it for fun, and whether you turn a profit on your predictions is incidental, he says.\"If I make money, great,\" he says. \"But when you start getting into, 'I'm going to do this because I'm smarter than everybody else, and I'm going to pay my mortgage with it,' that's when you that's you have a problem.\"Disclosure: CNBC and Kalshi have a commercial relationship that includes a minority investment.Want to improve your communication, confidence and success at work?

    "body": "watch nowInvestor Matt Shumer ignited a firestorm on social media this week with an essay that warned about the disruptive potential of AI. More than 80 million views later, he said it \"wasn't meant to scare people.\"\"I want to be very clear about this, the article wasn't meant to scare people in this way,\" Shumer told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Friday. \"If I had known how viral this was going to go, I would have thought about certain parts and rewritten some of the parts for sure.\"The essay, \"Something Big Is Happening,\" details Shumer's recent experiences using artificial intelligence. In it, he argues that AI's capabilities are under appreciated by the wider public. He compared the state of AI to the rumblings during early days of the Covid-19 pandemic in February 2020, right before the number of cases soared in the U.S.OpenAI rocketed into mainstream with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, and the company kicked off a high-stakes race for dominance among rivals like Google and Anthropic. Investors have been pouring billions of dollars into the technology, and Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon are expected to spend nearly $700 billion on capital expenditures this year alone.He wrote that he's been \"shocked\" to discover that AI can perform all of the actual technical work of his job, and Shumer said professionals across fields like law, finance, medicine and accounting, among others, will begin to share similar experiences. Shumer published the essay on Tuesday. Since then, it has racked up more than 100,000 likes and nearly 6,000 comments, according to X. The essay prompted a range of praise and criticism from readers. In retrospect, Shumer said he would have liked to have framed some parts differently. Even so, Shumer reiterated his belief that AI could be disruptive to many knowledge workers. He said its \"clear\" that AI will be able to do anything that can be done on a computer, though he said it doesn't necessarily mean that it will immediately be adopted or proliferate through society. Shumer said the \"core message\" he is trying to convey is that people in the workforce should start to use and experiment with AI tools so they can understand what's coming. \"Everybody likes to think their thing is special,\" Shumer said. \"I thought my thing was special for a while.\"",

    "body": "Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodríguez and U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright speak with the media after attending a meeting, marking the highest-level U.S. visit focused on energy policy to the OPEC nation in nearly three decades, as Washington conducts its first on-the-ground assessment of the oil industry it aims to help rebuild, in Caracas, Venezuela, Feb. 11, 2026.Leonardo Fernandez Viloria | ReutersVenezuela oil revenue will no longer be deposited in an account in Qatar, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told NBC News in an interview this week. \"An account was set up in Qatar, controlled by the U.S. government the whole time, to land that money in and then send the money from there down to Venezuela,\" Wright told NBC News on Thursday. \"Now we have an account at the U.S. Treasury. The money won't go to Qatar anymore,\" the energy secretary said.The Trump administration has taken control of Venezuela's oil sales after capturing former President Nicolás Maduro in a military raid last month. Wright met Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodríguez, in Venezuela this week, the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the country in decades. Wright told NBC News that revenue from Venezuelan oil sales now tops $1 billion. The U.S. has short-term agreements to sell another $5 billion of the country's crude over the next few months, he said. The oil has gone to U.S. refineries and Europe so far, he said. The U.S. deposited the initial $500 million of oil sales in the Qatar account before transferring the funds back to Venezuela, Wright said. Democrats in Congress have questioned the transparency and legality of the arrangement. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., introduced legislation Thursday that directs the Government Accountability Office to conduct an independent audit of the Qatar account.  watch nowWright said the U.S. deposited the initial sales in Qatar because the funds face the risk of Venezuela's creditors attempting to claim them. Caracas faces tens of billions of dollars in outstanding claims from defaulting on its sovereign debt and nationalizing the assets of oil companies like Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips. \"Since Venezuela has so many creditors and they owe a lot of money, we had some risk if we put it into a U.S. bank account set up quickly that creditors could freeze that money,\" Wright said. \"We want those creditors ultimately to get their money back, but that money urgently needs to get to Venezuela.\"The U.S. faces the added complication that it does not officially recognize the government led by Rodríguez. President Donald Trump recognized the 2015 opposition-led National Assembly during his first term in 2019. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 28 that Washington must find a way to resolve the issue of government recognition for the funds to be deposited in the U.S.\"You have to recognize a government, but we don't recognize this government,\" Rubio said. \"We recognize the 2015 National Assembly, so we have to find some creative way legally to meet that standard.\"Venezuelan oil revenue deposited in the U.S. should in theory be under the control of the opposition National Assembly due to Trump's recognition, said Scott Anderson, an international law expert who previously served with the State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under President Barack Obama.This raises the question of which government the U.S. will ultimately recognize and when. Wright told NBC that elections and a transition of power will likely happen in Venezuela during Trump's term. He said U.S. government oversight of Venezuela's domestic affairs would conclude at that point. \"It is a question of a process to get there,\" Wright said. \"Ultimately, what the long-term political leadership in Venezuela is going to be, it's going to be up to Venezuela.\"",

    "body": "Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel (C) takes part in the \"Anti-Imperialist\" protest in front of the US Embassy against the US incursion in Venezuela, where 32 Cuban soldiers lost their lives, in Havana on January 16, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesCuba's communist-run government is facing its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on the Caribbean island since the Jan. 3, military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a long-time ally of Cuba's government. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.Trump has since effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil, called its government \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the move and said: \"Surrender is not an option.\" He's since said the government is prepared to hold talks with Washington, albeit \"without pressure or preconditions.\"The country has warned that international airlines would no longer be able refuel in the country due to fuel shortages. Gripped by a worsening economic crisis, Cuba's government recently adopted rationing measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a shorter working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday. \"The current situation in Cuba is as serious as it has been since the 1990s, when Cuba suddenly had to survive without the support of the Eastern Bloc,\" Par Kumaraswami, professor of Latin American Studies at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, told CNBC by email.The odds are shortening that President Miguel Díaz-Canel will be forced from power in the weeks or months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition.Robert MunksHead of Americas research at Verisk MaplecroftTrump's tariff threats have created a deterrent for many nations, Kumaraswami said.Mexico has sent humanitarian aid but suspended oil shipments, as it sought to preserve its relationship with Havana while avoiding Trump's tariffs.Kumaraswami said there was \"of course frustration with the difficulties of daily life,\" but that \"many Cubans are resolved to resist threats to their national sovereignty and a new wave of patriotism has emerged.\"'An accelerating collapse' Air Canada subsequently has canceled all flights to Cuba amid the fuel shortage, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country home over the coming days. Tourism is a significant source of revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped government and the country is a popular winter vacation destination for Canadian tourists.  A Turkish Airlines plane takes off at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana on February 9, 2026.Yamil Lage | Afp | Getty ImagesUnlike in previous crises, Cuba's regime lacks foreign partners that can step in to help, according to Robert Munks, head of Americas research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft. \"Raising the stakes, the US has also limited Cuba's access to hard currency and pressured Nicaragua to end visa-free travel for Cubans,\" Munks told CNBC by email.The government's pledge to increase the use of limited renewable energy sources is likely \"too little, too late,\" Munks said. He added that outbreaks of civil unrest were possible, given that the island's domestic energy production is far short of what it needs to keep the lights on. \"An accelerating collapse of basic services will put the regime under extreme pressure to find a negotiated solution,\" Munks said.He added that \"the odds are shortening\" on Díaz-Canel being forced from power in the months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition, but Munks said it was more likely that \"the regime will try to muddle through\" until the U.S. midterm elections in November.Read moreCuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian \"collapse\" last week.\"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet,\" said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.A big test for BRICS Cuba's emergency measures should be seen as crucial test for the BRICS bloc of developing nations, according to Helen Yaffe, a Cuba expert and professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.\"This is probably the most important test now for BRICS … If BRICS cannot protect, defend and rally around a member, then what is it worth?\" Yaffe told CNBC by telephone.  Cuba acquired \"partner country\" status of the BRICS group in January last year, bolstering its ties with the likes of Brazil, Russia and China. Indeed, each of these three countries have sought to offer support to Cuba in recent days.The Mexican government has dispatched humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba aboard two ships of the Mexican Navy. More than 800 tons of supplies were transported by sea from Asipona, in Veracruz, Mexico, on February 9, 2026.Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesA spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Tuesday that Beijing \"stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development.\" They added that China would, \"as always,\" seek to provide assistance to Cuba.Russia, meanwhile, has described Havana's fuel situation as \"truly critical\" and said U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.\"The Cuban government is not going to submit,\" Yaffe said. \"The fact is, [the U.S. is] going to keep squeezing and the Cubans are going to keep resisting and there's going to be a lot of unnecessary suffering.\" She added: \"I'm a historian and it's very vainglorious for historians to try and predict the future but we can look at trends — and I can guarantee you that we were here before in the early 1990s where nobody thought Cuba would pull together and pull through — and they did.\"",

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump on Friday said he will  issue an executive order \"shortly\" laying out the \"legal reasons\" for national voter-identification requirements.Trump, in posts late Friday to Truth Social, said he wants voter-ID laws implemented for the 2026 midterm elections, even though legislation mandating them appears poised to stall in Congress.\"The Democrats refuse to vote for Voter I.D., or Citizenship. The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections,\" Trump posted to Truth Social.  \"This was not what our Founders desired. I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future. There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!\" he continued.In a second post, published minutes after the first, Trump said, \"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.\"Under pressure from Trump, his allies in the House and Senate and conservative online influencers, the issue of voter ID has dominated social media and reverberated through the halls of Congress in recent days. Trump's comments have also raised fears among Democrats and voting-rights groups that the president could try to intervene in this year's pivotal midterm elections, as Republicans try to hold on to slim majorities in both chambers.President Donald Trump speaks to members of the media on the South Lawn of the White House before boarding Marine One in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Samuel Corum | Sipa | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe House on Wednesday advanced, 218-213, a Trump-backed elections bill, dubbed the SAVE America Act, that would require proof of citizenship to register to vote and photo ID to cast a ballot. All but one Democrat voted against the proposal, which critics argue could disenfranchise millions and make it harder for people including women whose birth certificates would not show a married name to register. It now moves to the Senate, where it needs 60 votes to overcome a filibuster. Republicans hold just 53 seats in the chamber — and one, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has come out against the proposal. More than a handful of Democrats would have to support the legislation for it to succeed. Only one Senate Democrat, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, has supported national voter-ID requirements, though he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this week that he doesn't support other voting restrictions such as limiting mail-in ballots.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has vowed that Democrats will block the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival.\"\"The SAVE Act is not a mainstream bill whatsoever. It's a fringe piece of legislation that has now taken over the Republican Party, masquerading as election security when it's really about laying the groundwork to meddle in the midterm elections and make it much harder for people to vote,\" Schumer said from the Senate floor this week.Trump has recently said he wants to nationalize federal elections and revived election conspiracies, launching an FBI investigation into the election results in Fulton County, Georgia, a state the president has repeatedly and without evidence said he won in 2020. States are granted control of most aspects of U.S. elections under the Constitution.In his second post on Friday, Trump cast the midterms in existential terms. \"(T)hese Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT with a total of 21 Supreme Court Justices, THEIR DREAM, which they will submit easily and rapidly when they immediately move to terminate the Filibuster, probably in their first week, or sooner,\" Trump wrote. \"Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it. Thank you for your attention to this matter — SAVE AMERICA!,\" he continued.",

    "body": "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during the Munich Security Conference (MSC) in Munich, Germany, on Feb. 14, 2026.Thilo Schmuelgen | ReutersThe U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Saturday.\"We care deeply about your future and ours,\" Rubio told the Munich Security Conference (MSC).\"We want Europe to be strong,\" he said. \"We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours.\"U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.\"We do not need to abandon the system of international cooperation we authored, and we don't need to dismantle the global institutions of the old order that together we built. But these must be reformed. These must be rebuilt,\" Rubio said.The U.S.'s top diplomat told the gathering of European leaders that American leadership has succeeded in resolving thorny issues such as the Israel-Gaza conflict and made progress in ending Russia's war with Ukraine which multilateral organizations including the U.N. have so far failed to.\"The United Nations still has tremendous potential to be a tool for good in the world, but we cannot ignore that today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role. It could not solve the war in Gaza,\" Rubio said. \"Instead, it was American leadership that freed captives from barbarians and brought about a fragile truce. It has not solved the war in Ukraine.\"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky speaks during the 62nd Munich Security Conference (MSC) on February 14, 2026 in Munich, southern Germany. (Photo by THOMAS KIENZLE / AFP via Getty Images)Thomas Kienzle | Afp | Getty ImagesUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude to the U.S. for its help in Ukraine's fight against Russia.\"I am grateful to every American heart that was helping us no matter what. Thank you. Without you, Americans, Europeans and everyone who stands with us, it would have been very, very difficult to hold on,\" Zelenskyy said to applause.But he criticized the administration of Trump's predecessor for being slow to ramp up military aid to Ukraine. Zelenskyy also had harsh words for Iran's government, which he accused of supplying the drones Russia uses to attack Ukrainian territory.\"Ukraine does not share a border with Iran and we have never had a conflict of interests with the Iranian regime,\" Zelenskyy said. \"But the Iranian Shahed drones they sold to Russia are killing, especially, our people, Ukrainians, and destroying our infrastructure.\"NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, speaking next to Zelenskyy, urged member countries to step up military support for Ukraine under the alliance's Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative.\"Keep (Ukraine) strong in the fight. They will do it, but they need our support,\" Rutte said.European independenceEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking after Rubio at the conference, said the region faces \"the very distinct threat of outside forces trying to weaken our union from within, the return of overtly hostile competition and power relations.\"Von der Leyen said Europe needs to become more independent \"in every dimension that affects our security and prosperity, defense and energy, economy and trade, raw materials and digital tech.\"But she emphasized that that does not mean weakening the trans-Atlantic bond.\"The opposite is true and we've just heard it from State Secretary Rubio. An independent Europe is a strong Europe and a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance.\"On Friday, the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, urged European leaders to stand up to Russian aggression.\"The lesson learned is that appeasement always brings new wars,\" Kallas told CNBC in an interview. \"That's very clear. If you think that, okay, let them have this territory. ... We will have peace that is actually never going to work. It actually increases the appetite. They walked away with more territory, more valuables, than they had before.\"watch nowAlso speaking to CNBC on Friday ahead of the conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, the organization's chairman, said it was Europe's \"own fault\" that its power on the global stage has been diminished.\"Europe has failed to speak with one voice to China and about China, Europe has failed with one voice, to come up with a clear concept about the future of the Middle East, including about how to deal or not to deal with the Iranian nuclear question,\" said Ischinger, who is a former German ambassador to the U.S.Earlier this week, the MSC published its 2026 report, for which Ischinger wrote the foreword. It warned that \"the world has entered a period of wrecking-ball politics,\" where \"sweeping destruction … is the order of the day.\"The report said that Trump was \"at the forefront of those who promise to free their countries from the existing order's constraints and rebuild stronger, more prosperous nations,\" arguing he was just one movement \"driven by resentment and regret over the liberal trajectory their societies have embarked on.\"Ischinger said that Europeans were \"totally on the sidelines\" on negotiations around Gaza and Ukraine.Economic cooperationRubio said the U.S. sought a \"reinvigorated alliance\" with Europe, \"one that does not maintain the polite pretense that our way of life is just one among many and that asks for permission before it acts.\"In a wide-ranging speech, Rubio criticized past policies that encouraged mass migration, outsourced supply chains and contributed to \"deindustrialization,\" which he said was \"not inevitable.\"\"It was a conscious policy choice, a decades-long economic undertaking that stripped our nations of their wealth, of their productive capacity, and of their independence. And the loss of our supply chain sovereignty was not a function of a prosperous and healthy system of global trade. It was foolish,\" Rubio said.Rubio also discussed how greater trans-Atlantic cooperation could reposition the West to lead in 21st-Century industries.\"Together, we can reindustrialize our economies and rebuild our capacity to defend our people,\" he said.\"Commercial space travel and cutting-edge artificial intelligence, industrial automation and flex manufacturing, creating a Western supply chain for critical minerals not vulnerable to extortion from other powers, and a unified effort to compete for market share in the economies of the global South.\"",

    "body": "President Donald Trump speaks to the media as he walks to board Marine One prior to departure from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Feb. 13, 2026.Andrew Caballero-Reynolds | AFP | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump's iron grip on the Republican Party might be starting to loosen, just a bit. The few elected Republicans who regularly cross him — including Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina — are more vocal than ever. And in recent days, daylight has emerged between the president and a handful of his top supporters in Congress.The apparent shift is underway as Trump, the Republican Party's undisputed leader, grapples with stubbornly low approval ratings — especially on the economy, a perennial issue on which he was elected that has only grown more important to Americans chafing under high prices.Six U.S. House Republicans voted this week to overturn Trump's tariffs on Canada. Tillis remained resolute in holding up the president's Fed chair nomination in protest over a Justice Department investigation of the current one. The administration pulled back the sustained anti-immigration law enforcement push in Minnesota. And fallout from the Epstein files — in which Trump and allies are mentioned — is roiling the world and its most powerful players.Democrats are jumping on the opening, with some pushing a narrative that \"the tide is turning\" on Trump. Their perceived momentum follows big wins in last fall's off-year elections after hammering an affordability message, and as prediction markets favor them to win control of the House in the midterms.\"Trump's grip on power is slipping,\" Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said Thursday in a gloating social media post. \"Nobody is taking his bulls--- that somehow he's lowering prices for families.\"The administration's efforts this week to wrest the affordability narrative — by drawing attention to Trump's drug-pricing initiatives, or to gains in the stock market, or to projections that Americans' tax refunds will rise this season — have been muddied by the deluge of political setbacks and controversies. Trump on Friday gave a passing glance to curbing price increases when he spoke to troops in North Carolina hours after the release of January consumer price index figures that showed slowing inflation.He's had fewer public appearances since a racist social media post last Friday, a shift from his recent cadence of Oval Office appearances in front of reporters with supporters from the political ranks and business community. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a frequent press conference partner of Trump, but his visit to the White House this week yielded no public remarks.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked about challenges to Trump from the Republican Party, said the party will stay together with the president as its leader. \"Under President Trump's leadership, Republicans will remain united together against the radical Democrats, who will destroy our country once again, if given the chance, with wide open borders, noncitizens voting in elections, and horrible economic policy,\" Leavitt said via email.Read more CNBC politics coverageEpstein files: DOJ says it logs Congress members' searches to 'protect' victim informationEpstein files: AG Pam Bondi seemed to have Rep. Jayapal's DOJ database search history at hearingJudge blocks Pete Hegseth's censure of Sen. Mark Kelly over troops video, for nowWatch Pam Bondi hearing: AG touts record Dow as Democrats grill her over Trump, EpsteinThe majority-GOP House of Representatives' vote to override Trump's tariffs on Canadian goods only came about because three Republican members previously sided with Democrats to defeat a rule that would have blocked House votes on Trump's tariffs through July. Trump's threats of retaliation didn't thwart the end result.While the tariff votes are almost purely symbolic, they show GOP leadership failing to stop enough of their members from publicly defying Trump on his signature economic policy. Republicans can only afford to lose one vote in the House to prevail on party-line votes.A day after the House tariff vote, U.S. border czar Tom Homan announced the government would wrap up its immigration enforcement \"surge\" in Minnesota, following public outcry against federal agents' aggressive tactics exacerbated by the killing of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.A new AP-NORC poll found most Americans think the administration's deployment of deportation forces has gone too far, and that the GOP's advantage on immigration has shrunk since last year.The Minnesota actions drew fiery pushback not only from protesters and Democrats but also from business owners. In an open letter shared Thursday, more than 266 businesses from across the U.S. that said they represent 100,000 others warned the government's actions threaten free markets. A series of other Trump-related stumbles have drawn national focus away from the administration's attempt to tout its accomplishments.Last week, the president's social media account posted a racist image depicting the Obamas as apes. Numerous Republicans spoke out forcefully and quickly against the post, including close Trump ally Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Senate Republican, who called it \"the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House.\"The White House initially defended the post, but after the flood of bipartisan outrage, pivoted to blaming it on an unnamed staffer. Trump subsequently condemned the image but refused to apologize.This week, a federal grand jury rejected U.S. prosecutors' attempt to indict six Democratic lawmakers, weeks after Trump accused them of sedition for telling military members not to follow unlawful orders. It is highly unusual for grand juries to decline to indict.The Department of Justice is also in the midst of a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, whose refusal to quickly slash interest rates has made him a top target of Trump's ire.The probe, which Powell says is retaliatory, has prompted vocal pushback from Republicans worried about the erosion of the central bank's long-established independence.Tillis, who is retiring at the end of his current term, is blocking all Trump administration nominees to the Fed — including Kevin Warsh, the president's pick to replace Powell — from advancing through the Senate until the DOJ drops the investigation.The president has said U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia Jeanine Pirro, a Trump loyalist, should continue the probe to completion. Scott, the Senate Banking Committee chairman, said he does not believe Powell committed a crime —while Trump has repeatedly claimed Powell is either corrupt or grossly incompetent, complaining about cost overruns on building renovations. Numerous Republicans on the Banking panel agree that Powell did not commit a crime, according to Tillis.Trump is also grappling with the fallout from the DOJ's release of millions of its files on notorious sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein, which is only intensifying days after the latest disclosures. Trump had opposed a bill forcing the DOJ to publicly share its files, but he reversed course as a growing number of Republicans geared up to vote for it anyway. The newly released records have revealed ties between Epstein and administration officials, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who has since admitted visiting Epstein's island for lunch with his family in 2012.",

These models from China are directly competing with video generation models such as OpenAI's Sora, as well as robotics models from Nvidia and Google. Here's a rundown of the models.watch nowAlibaba's RynnBrainAlibaba's DAMO Academy unveiled RynnBrain this week, an AI model designed to help robots comprehend the physical world around them and identify objects.In a video demo, Alibaba showed a robot with pincers for hands that appeared to be able to count oranges, pick them up and place them in a basket. It was also shown taking milk out of a fridge.Models require extensive training to enable them to identify everyday objects to interact with, which means that simple tasks like picking up fruit can be challenging in robotics.RynnBrain now puts Alibaba in competition with the likes of Nvidia and Google which are developing their own AI models for robots.\"One of its key innovations is built-in time and space awareness,\" Adina Yakefu, a researcher at Hugging Face, told CNBC.\"Instead of simply reacting to immediate inputs, the robot can remember when and where events occurred, track task progress, and continue across multiple steps. This makes it more reliable and coherent in complex real-world environments.\"Yakefu added that Alibaba's \"broader ambition\" was to \"establish a foundational intelligence layer for embodied systems.\"ByteDance's Seedance 2.0Seedance 2.0 is a video generation AI model capable of generating a realistic video from just a text prompt from a user. But prompts can also contain other videos and images. Videos created with Seedance 2.0 and reviewed by CNBC appear to show quite realistic imagery and video that has been fully created with AI.Billy Boman, who is based in Stockholm, Sweden, and runs a creative advertising agency that produces AI-generated content, has used Seedance 2.0.He said AI video generation has made significant strides over the past two years, with rapid improvements across the industry.watch now\"Back in 2023 … it was difficult to get someone to run or to walk. Any type of realism was [limited to] very short clips, everything was very slow, bad textures, no skin textures, lacking detail. Now the script has flipped. Now I can do anything. It has been nothing short of exceptional, the technological advancements,\" Boman told CNBC in an interview. Hugging Face's Yakefu, added that the Seedance 2.0 model has shown progress from previous generations in \"controllability, speed and production efficiency.\"\"Seedance 2.0 is one of the most well-rounded video generation models I've tested so far. It genuinely surprised me by delivering satisfying results on the first try, even with a simple prompt. The visuals, music, and cinematography come together in a way that feels polished rather than experimental,\" Yakefu said.However, while users have praised the technology, Seedance has run into trouble. Local Chinese media reported that Seedance has suspended a feature that allowed the AI to generate the voice of a person based on a picture they uploaded. It came after a blogger in China raised concerns about the voice generation taking place without consent. ByteDance was not immediately available for comment when contacted by CNBC.Kuaishou's Kling 3.0Released last week, Kuaishou's Kling 3.0 is another video generation model to rival ByteDance's. Kling 3.0 \"features major upgrades in consistency, photorealistic output, extended video duration up to 15s, and native audio generation across multiple languages, dialects, and accents.The model is only available to paying subscribers but will be available to the public soon, Kuaishou said.Kuaishou's success with its Kling models has been a key factor behind its more than 50% share price rise over the last year. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKuaishou shares year-to-dateOther key AI model releasesZhipu AI — which trades as Knowledge Atlas Technology in Hong Kong — saw its shares surge on Thursday after it released GLM-5, an open-source large-language model with enhanced coding capabilities and long-running agent tasks.The company said the model approaches Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 in coding benchmarks while surpassing Google's Gemini 3 Pro on some tests. CNBC could not verify those claims. Shares of MiniMax also jumped Thursday after it launched its updated M2.5 open-source model with enhanced AI agent tools. \"Agents\" or \"agentic AI\" refers to AI tools designed to automate tasks. — CNBC's Anniek Bao and Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Carl Smith | Fstop | Getty ImagesSocial Security benefits are typically adjusted every year to keep up with rising prices. Social Security beneficiaries saw record-high COLAs in 2022 and 2023, when the annual increases climbed to 5.9% and 8.7%, respectively. Yet as the pace of inflation subsided, the size of the annual COLA increase has also come down. The 2026 cost-of-living adjustment was 2.8%. That added about $56 per month on average for retirees, and for some beneficiaries, higher Medicare premiums offset that increase.Now, new government inflation data for January suggests the cost-of-living adjustment for 2027 may be even lower, if the pace of inflation stays the same in the coming months.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsFollowing Super Bowl ad, Trump accounts launch a new sign-up optionSome student loan borrowers wait over a year for public servant debt forgivenessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe 2026 COLA affects around 75 million beneficiaries, according to the Social Security Administration.Estimates range from 1.2% to 3.1%The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment may be just 1.2% in 2027, estimates Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. If that increase were to go into effect, it would be the lowest COLA since a 0.3% increase to benefits in 2017.Separately, the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior group, now projects a 2.8% Social Security COLA for 2027, consistent with the benefit boost beneficiaries saw for this year. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office has forecast a 3.1% Social Security COLA for next year, followed by 2.5% the following year, as part of its estimates on the program's future costs.Low COLA would 'exacerbate' financial stressIf the COLA landed at 2.8%, \"this paltry figure would only exacerbate seniors' financial stress,\" the Senior Citizens League states. The group's polling has found more than half of seniors — almost 58% — have skipped at least one health care product or service in the past 12 months to cut costs.A separate September AARP survey found that a 3% COLA is \"insufficient.\"The organization asked about 1,000 adults ages 50 and older what they thought of a then-estimated 3% increase and found 77% of respondents said that was not enough to keep up with rising prices. Most respondents — 72% — said the ideal benefit boost would be 5% or higher.watch nowTo be sure, the current COLA projections are preliminary and subject to change.The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment is calculated each year using third-quarter data for the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. Third-quarter CPI-W data for the current year is compared to the third quarter of the previous year. The percentage increase from one year to the next, if there is one, determines the COLA. New CPI data for January shows the CPI-W increased 2.2% over the previous 12 months. ",

    "body": "Cavan Images | Cavan | Getty ImagesAt the start of 2025, during President Joe Biden's final weeks in office, lawmakers pushed forward with last-minute major legislation that provides Social Security benefit increases to certain public pensioners.The Social Security Fairness Act was passed with an overwhelming bipartisan majority in both the House and Senate, and Biden signed it into law on Jan. 5, 2025.Now, several senators are calling on the Social Security Administration to reconsider what they say is a flaw in the law's implementation: retroactive payments limited to six months rather than one year for certain beneficiaries.The Social Security Fairness Act eliminated two provisions — the Windfall Elimination Provision, or WEP, and the Government Pension Offset, or GPO — that reduced or, in some cases, eliminated Social Security benefits for individuals who receive pension income from jobs where Social Security payroll taxes were not paid. However, those individuals also have other income from jobs that paid into the program, which made them eligible for benefits.Read more CNBC personal finance coverageHome sellers start getting lower prices at 70, research shows — here's whyAverage IRS tax refund is up 10.9% so far this season, early filing data showsEarly estimates point to lower Social Security COLA for 2027Senators call for longer Social Security Fairness Act lump-sum payment timelineHere's the inflation breakdown for January 2026 — in one chartAverage tax refund is up 22%, Bessent says — what filers can expect this seasonK-shaped economy looks like 'jaws of a crocodile,' economist says: Here's whyHow EPA 'endangerment finding' repeal could impact your walletMedical emergencies can lead to debt and bankruptcy — even for insured AmericansBigger tax refunds may be coming — but missing key forms could risk an auditHow Social Security Fairness Act payments may affect beneficiaries' taxesCredit card debt tops $1.28 trillion, consistent with 'K-shaped' economy: NY FedHow affordability led to a chasm between stock prices, consumer optimismStudent loan complaints at record high, CFPB finds, but agency omits detailsFollowing Super Bowl ad, Trump accounts launch a new sign-up optionSome student loan borrowers wait over a year for public servant debt forgivenessCNBC's Financial Advisor 100: Best financial advisors, top firms rankedThe law affects more than 2.8 million people, according to the Social Security Administration, including teachers, firefighters and police officers in certain states. Relatives of affected workers — specifically spouses and surviving spouses — also received adjusted benefits under the provisions.The adjustments include new, higher monthly benefit payments as well as a retroactive lump-sum payment for benefits paid from January 2024 onward. Some beneficiaries' lump-sum payments are smallerYet while the law provides for one-year retroactive payments, some beneficiaries have only received payments for six months, based on the Social Security Administration's interpretation of the law, several senators wrote in a Feb. 5 letter to the agency. Bill Cassidy, R-La., John Cornyn, R-Texas, and John Fetterman, D-Pa., signed the letter.The senators had previously sent a letter to the SSA in April 2025 expressing concerns about retroactive spousal benefits under the new law. In its response to the lawmakers, their letter states, the SSA said the six-month limitation for new applicants was because the new law did not amend certain wording of the Social Security Act that established the program in 1935. Consequently, the one-year retroactive benefits could be applied only to individuals who were already receiving benefits as of January 2024 or who had filed a benefit application on or before that date, according to the agency.The Social Security Administration did not provide a comment by press time.watch now\"We do not fault SSA for not having a crystal ball,\" Sens. Cassidy, Cornyn and Fetterman wrote in their Feb. 5 letter.Because Congress did not know if or when the Social Security Fairness Act would pass, it \"did not distinguish between new and current beneficiaries in setting the Act's effective date,\" the senators wrote. Likewise, the agency could not have predicted the changes that were enacted, they wrote.The Social Security Administration should follow the \"plain text\" of the Social Security Fairness Act and provide a one-year retroactive date, starting from January 2024, for all applicants, regardless of their benefit application date, the senators wrote. Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said, \"the law that was passed is absolutely clear .... The law says it's 12 months.\" The National Committee, an advocacy organization, lobbied for the changes in the Social Security Fairness Act for decades, said Richtman, who attended Biden's signing of the law.Following the law's implementation, millions of Social Security beneficiaries have seen their payments increase.\"The biggest difference has been for public servants who didn't earn as much,\" including bus drivers, cafeteria workers, sheriff deputies and policy officers, Cassidy said in an email statement. \"Restoring their benefits restored their ability to live securely in retirement.\"",

    "body": "A worker stocks beef filets in the meat section of a grocery store in Washington.Tom Williams | Cq-roll Call, Inc. | Getty ImagesInflation decelerated in January as price pressures eased across a range of consumer staples such as food and gasoline, though they remain elevated for certain categories, including electricity and home heating, economists said. The consumer price index, a key inflation gauge, rose 2.4% in January from 12 months earlier, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday. That was down from 2.7% in December and lower than expected.Inflation is still running above the target of policymakers at the Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, which aims for an inflation level around 2%, economists said. Effect of tariffs and immigration policyInflation would likely be at the Fed's target absent Trump administration policies on tariffs and immigration, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's.Tariffs levied by President Donald Trump on a host of trading partners have put upward pressure on prices, as many businesses pass at least some of those import taxes on to U.S. consumers, economists said. Immigration policy has also put some upward pressure on prices for services by reducing labor supply, they said.\"Broadly speaking, inflation is still too high for most Americans and the Fed,\" Zandi said. \"But I think we've seen the worst of it. If there are no changes in policy — to tariffs and immigration policy — we should get inflation back to something more comfortable by this time next year.\"The Yale University Budget Lab estimated in January that the U.S.' effective tariff rate had risen to 16.9%, the highest since 1932. The Supreme Court is poised to rule on the constitutionality of a large swath of Trump's tariffs in the coming weeks. 'Big caveat' in CPI reportThe slowdown in inflation was \"relatively broad-based\" in January, aside from \"some pockets of acceleration in services (particularly transportation costs),\" Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy and research at Glenmede, an asset manager, wrote in a note Friday.But there's a \"big caveat\" in the CPI data, Zandi said: Inflation looks better on paper than in reality due to a quirk in the data from the government shutdown in the fall.The record-long shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12, prevented federal statisticians from collecting typical inflation data in October. Without that data, the BLS assumed that no price increases had taken place during the month for most categories of goods and services.Moody's estimates the CPI inflation rate would be around 2.7% if that data were included, Zandi said.Inflation report likely doesn't change Fed postureThe inflation report comes amid a backdrop of calls for lower interest rates from Trump, who recently unveiled his pick of Kevin Warsh to succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Powell's term ends in May.

For example, gasoline prices were down about 3% on a monthly basis in January and by 7.5% on an annual basis, according to CPI data. Food inflation — for groceries and dining out — was 2.9% on an annual basis in January. That's high by historical standards, Zandi said. Likewise for categories like electricity, apparel, child care, medical care and home heating, he said. Prices for utility gas service were up about 10% annually in January, according to CPI data.Outside of gasoline, \"inflation for most necessities are well above target and in most cases above 3%,\" Zandi said. watch now",

    "body": "D-keine | E+ | Getty ImagesThe average tax refund is 10.9% higher so far this season, compared to about the same point in 2025, according to early filing data from the IRS. The 2026 tax season opened Jan. 26, and the average refund amount was $2,290 as of Feb. 6, up from $2,065 about one year prior, the IRS reported Friday night. As of Feb. 6, the total amount refunded was more than $16.9 billion, up 1.9% compared to last year, according to the IRS release. That figure reflects current-year returns only. Earlier on Friday, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS Commissioner Scott Bessent told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that refunds were up 22%.

Alternatively, filers owe a balance when they don't pay enough. In recent years, IRS data has reflected a smaller refund during the beginning of the tax season, but those payments have \"risen sharply\" in mid-February, Lautz wrote. After the February peak, the average refund has \"declined slightly\" through the April 15 deadline, he wrote. In 2025, the average refund for individual filers was $3,052 through Oct. 17, according to the IRS.Filers could see bigger tax refundsFor the 2026 filing season, the size of tax refunds has been a key political topic with the midterm elections approaching. President Donald Trump has promised that 2026 will be the \"largest tax refund season of all time\" based on changes enacted via his \"big beautiful bill.\" The legislation added new tax breaks for 2025, and the IRS did not adjust paycheck withholdings, which could result in refunds for many workers. However, there could be \"a lot of variation between taxpayers,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, previously told CNBC.

Schaben | Los Angeles Times | Getty ImagesA record-breaking number of companies shipping products into the United States are coming up short on a federal government requirement to financially guarantee they can cover the import trade duties triggered by President Donald Trump's tariff policies. And this is leading to a record amount of money paid to the U.S. to cover the shortfalls.U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shared with CNBC shows that what are called customs bond \"insufficiencies\" reached a total of 27,479 in fiscal 2025, with the combined value soaring to almost $3.6 billion. It is the highest number of bond insufficiencies and the highest total value across insufficiencies ever recorded. In fact, it doubles the 2019 level when tariffs enacted by Trump under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also fueled bond shortfalls. \"Bonds are the primary tool used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to safeguard the revenue of the United States and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations,\" said a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson.Under CBP guidelines, the agency continuously reviews bond adequacy, and a bond is flagged as being insufficient when an importer's duty/tax liability exceeds 100% of their current bond capacity. The shortfall comes at a time of record tariff revenue for the U.S. government, with tariff collections surging in January to $30 billion and reaching a year-to-date total of $124 billion. That is up 304% from the same period in 2025.\"In totality, it makes sense that insufficiencies are more than double,\" said Jennifer Diaz, attorney at Diaz Trade Law. \"Many companies take it for granted that a $50,000 bond should be able to cover you for a one-year period,\" she said. \"But it might not. They are not utilizing set calculations, and don't have anyone in their corner telling them that their bond obligation is higher.\"International trade experts told CNBC that with some tariffs increasing from 10%-25% or more for certain products, importers are facing customs bond amounts that now range from the minimum bond amount by regulation of $50,000 to as high as $450 million.Importers buy customs bonds, also known as surety bonds, through specialized insurance companies known as surety companies. The bonds are issued approximately 30 days before imports arrive in the U.S. to ensure that Customs collects the requisite tariffs in the event an importer does not pay its obligation. The bonds are held for 314 days by CBP in accounts that bear no interest. During this time, duties that were paid can be reviewed and receive final government sign-off.U.S. importers pay a premium to insure their bonds. The premium is typically 1% of the bond limit, with the price of the bonds covering 10% of the duties and taxes paid over a rolling 12-month period. If tariffs and taxes go up, the customs bond requirement goes up as well.Surety companies have told CNBC they have seen bond increases upward of 200%. \"In one unusual case, a large auto manufacturing client saw its custom bond amount increase by 550%,\" Vincent Moy, international surety leader for Marsh Risk, recently told CNBC.If the bond is insufficient, the importer can't get the freight, and it is held by CBP until the bond meets requirements. To address the shortfall, importers need to have another bond issued and that can take at least 10 days.In addition to the bonds, companies rely on related collateral to guarantee trade duty coverage. \"If companies do not increase their collateral, the goods will be stopped at the port,\" Moy said. The collateral is held by the insurance company that issues the bond for the 314-day period dictated by CBP. Companies have told CNBC that the tariff-triggered bond insufficiencies have created additional strain on their relationships with customs brokers.The Supreme Court could soon rule on Trump's International Emergency Economic Powers Act tariffs, deciding if they are legal. Feb. 20 is the next date for a potential decision and U.S. importers may be in line for not only trade tax refunds but also the money laid out for customs bonds and related collateral. If tariffs are refunded, the bond amounts associated with those imports can be used to reduce to levels sufficient to cover the duties, taxes and fees. Companies will need to petition the insurer that issued the bond for a reduction of the bond and collateral. Trade experts tell CNBC importers should be ready if this happens.Surety companies tell CNBC importers should expect some lag time in receiving these funds due to insurance paperwork requirements. The insurance company will need to verify and audit the paper trail before it releases any collateral.watch now",

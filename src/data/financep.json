    "body": "ChatGPT for TeachersCourtesy of OpenAIOpenAI on Wednesday announced ChatGPT for Teachers, a version of its artificial intelligence chatbot that is designed for K-12 educators and school districts. Educators can use ChatGPT for Teachers to securely work with student information, get personalized teaching support and collaborate with colleagues within their district, OpenAI said. There are also administrative controls that district leaders can use to determine how ChatGPT for Teachers will work within their communities. OpenAI said it is initially launching ChatGPT for Teachers with a cohort of districts that represent roughly 150,000 educators. ChatGPT for Teachers will be free to K-12 educators in the U.S. through June 2027, the company said. \"Our objective here is to make sure that teachers have access to AI tools as well as a teacher-focused experience so they can truly guide AI use,\" Leah Belsky, vice president of education at OpenAI, told reporters during a briefing. The company said student data will be protected and that anything shared within ChatGPT for Teachers will not be used to train its models. Read more CNBC tech newsAnthropic valued in range of $350 billion following investment deal with Microsoft, NvidiaZoox begins offering robotaxi rides in San Francisco, facing off with WaymoGoogle announces Gemini 3 as battle with OpenAI intensifiesCloudflare blames 'unusual' spike in traffic before massive outageOpenAI rocketed into the mainstream following the launch of its generic ChatGPT chatbot in 2022. It's faced criticism from teachers and parents who argue that students can use the tool to cheat and avoid engaging in critical thinking.ChatGPT for Teachers is not intended for students, but OpenAI said giving teachers hands-on experience with AI tools will help them understand and establish best practices in their classrooms.  \"Every student today is growing up with AI, and teachers play a central role in helping them learn how to use these tools responsibly and effectively,\" the company said in a blog post. \"To support that work, educators need space to explore AI for themselves.\"In July, OpenAI released a product within ChatGPT called \"study mode.\" Study mode was built with college-age students in mind, and it aims to help them work through problems step-by-step before they arrive at an answer.OpenAI said it built study mode as \"a first step in a longer journey to improve learning in ChatGPT.\"WATCH: Investors believe OpenAI will become the largest hyperscaler: The Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newmanwatch now",

The new model is an improvement on its predecessor, Gemini 2.5, which Google released about eight months ago. Google said Gemini 3 allows users to get better answers to more complex questions and doesn't need as much prompting to determine the context and intent behind their requests.Gemini 3 will be integrated into Google's search products, the Gemini app and enterprise services.Analysts at D.A. Davidson said in a Tuesday note that they were quickly impressed by Gemini 3, calling it a \"genuinely strong model\" and \"the current state-of-the-art\" based on preliminary testing and how it scored against AI benchmarks.\"We'd go as far to say that this latest model from [Google DeepMind] meaningfully moves the frontier forward, with capabilities that in certain areas far exceed what we've typically come to expect from this generation of frontier models,\" the analysts wrote.

Handout | Via ReutersBlock said Wednesday that it expects gross profit to increase in the mid-teens annually for the next three years, reaching about $15.8 billion in 2028. At the payment company's first investor day event since 2022, Block unveiled a three-year financial outlook. The announcements land as Wall Street has turned skeptical on Block's prospects, pushing the stock down by more than 30% in 2025, while major indexes have notched solid gains. Trading in Block shares was halted around the time of the announcement. The fresh guidance also comes two weeks after Block reported quarterly results, missing revenue estimates for a sixth straight time. Block has been diversifying away from its point-of-sale business, which has become increasingly crowded, launching more services tied to Cash App and offering artificial intelligence tools to sellers. Block said in its new outlook that adjusted operating income is projected to increase about 30% annually, topping $4.6 billion by 2028. Adjusted earnings per share will grow in the low 30% range, reaching $5.50 in three years.Chief Financial Officer Amrita Ahuja told CNBC ahead of the release that the company is entering a new phase of execution. Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBlock vs. Nasdaq this year\"Since 2022, our last investor day, we're nearly double the size from a gross profit perspective,\" Ahuja said, adding that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization \"more than tripled.\"Block also introduced a new non-GAAP cash flow metric, designed to reflect the capital required to grow its lending products, which it expects to reach more than $4 billion, or 25% of gross profit, by 2028.For 2026, Block expects gross profit to rise 17% to $11.98 billion, with adjusted operating income and EPS both increasing more than 30%, to $2.7 billion and $3.20, respectively.Ahuja said Block has adopted a \"rule of 40\" investment framework. That typically refers to revenue growth rate plus profit margin exceeding 40. She said the company expects to reach that metric this year and has reorganized around a single roadmap with a shared technical infrastructure. \"That transformation has resulted in us moving faster, with more connected decisions across our ecosystem,\" Ahuja said. On Wednesday, Block also expanded its share repurchase program by $5 billion, adding to the $1.1 billion in remaining authorization as of Sept. 30. The prior buyback plan was for up to $4 billion in purchases. Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who co-founded the company as Square in 2009, was in attendance at the investor event. Dorsey has largely been out of public view in recent years. WATCH: Block shares drop more than 8% on quarterly misswatch now",

The company said its new free product will be better at detecting shopping intent and will deliver more personalized results by drawing on memory from a user's previous searches. Perplexity declined to share whether it will earn revenue from transactions that are completed through its platform.The startup's competitor OpenAI announced a similar e-commerce feature called Instant Checkout in September, which allows ChatGPT users to buy items from merchants without leaving the chatbot's interface.

Through its \"Buy With Pro\" offering, Perplexity had served as the intermediary that completed purchases.Gill said PayPal's buyer protection policies, which can help users get reimbursed if there are problems with their orders, will also apply to transactions on Perplexity.\"We're really excited about this launch because we will see it come to life during a period that's so organic for people to shop,\" Gill said in an interview.

Demand from airlines for more spacious, premium seats has been so high in recent years it has contributed to bottlenecks of new airplane deliveries.watch nowThe New York-based airline last month said its first lounge at John F. Kennedy International Airport, which it plans to open this year, will be accessible for trans-Atlantic Mint customers, among travelers.JetBlue's first trans-Atlantic flight debuted in 2021 with a nonstop route to London, and it has since added service from both New York and Boston to Paris; Amsterdam; Edinburgh, Scotland; and Dublin.   The new flights go on sale Thursday.JetBlue's additions show how airlines are flying newer Airbus narrow-body planes farther. It will use its A321LR, or long-range, Airbus jets for the Barcelona and Milan flights. The Milan flight will be the longest in JetBlue's network, at about nine hours westbound and about seven hours and 45 eastbound, a spokesman said, though times can vary based on weather conditions and other factors.Those planes carry fewer travelers than large twin-aisle jets like Boeing 777s but are cheaper to operate since they require less fuel, among other things. American Airlines plans to debut its Airbus A321XLR, an ultra-long-range version of its popular 321 plane, in December and eventually fly it to Edinburgh from both New York and its Philadelphia hub next March.Read more CNBC airline newsThe government shutdown is over.

CNBC has reached out to the White House for comment on the remarks.Trump went on to recite a conversation in which Bessent pleads with the president to let Powell finish out his term as chair, which is set to end in May 2026. \"I can't tell you — Scott: 'Sir, don't fire him. Sir, please don't fire him. He's got three months to go, don't fire him,'\" Trump said. \"I wanna get him out!\"Trump added that Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is \"a little bit more for firing.\"\"I think Howard would say, 'Get him the hell out.'\"The remarks came shortly before the release of minutes from the Fed's October meeting, which show central bank officials were conflicted over whether to cut rates further.

    "body": "Recruiters speak to job seekers at the Appalachian State University internship and job fair in Boone, North Carolina, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.Allison Joyce | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe Bureau of Labor Statistics said Wednesday it will not release a full U.S. jobs report for the month of October, following the longest federal government shutdown in the history of the country. Instead, the agency said October payroll data will be released along with a full report for November. An unemployment rate for October will not be included in those figures because the data \"could not be collected,\" the BLS said, citing the shutdown. The agency also pushed back its November jobs data release to Dec. 16 from Dec. 5. The new date is six days after the Federal Reserve concludes its final policy meeting of the year — leaving the central bank with less information on the state of the economy. The delayed September nonfarm payrolls report is scheduled to be released on Thursday.Without the full October data — and following recent hawkish commentary from some Fed officials — traders may be pricing in a lower chance of another rate reduction. The CME Group's FedWatch tool at midday Wednesday showed there's a 63.8% chance that the Fed keeps its overnight benchmark rate steady in the 3.75%-4% range. That's up from around 50% earlier in the day. ",

The company controls a large land package in an emerging district that Block said could eventually host a new multi-deposit gold camp.The focus is the Rogue project's Valley deposit, which holds an estimated 8 million ounces of gold in the measured and indicated category at an average grade of 1.21 grams per ton. While Snowline has other exploration targets, Block said Valley is likely the asset that will attract interest from major producers facing declining reserves.\"This is one of the few assets globally that can move the needle for a mid- or large-cap gold miner,\" Block's presentation materials stated, calling the firm \"an elephant.\"Block expects Snowline to be acquired within the next three years. If a transaction comes in the next 12 months, he sees a potential valuation of C$4 billion to C$6 billion, and suggested the price could rise further as drilling continues.\"The longer it takes for this asset to be bought, the more expensive it will be,\" he said.Snowline shares have surged more than tenfold since early 2022, when the company drilled its initial discovery hole at Valley. Still, Block argued the stock doesn't yet reflect the strategic value of the resource in a mining industry that has seen increasing consolidation.The Canadian-listed stock popped more than 6% after Block made his call. Carson Block will be on \"The Exchange\" with CNBC's Jon Fortt at 1 p.m. ET.",

Nathan Howard | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday called for ABC's broadcast license to be revoked as he angrily lashed out at a reporter from the network who asked why he has not released files on notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his former friend.\"I think you are a terrible reporter,\" Trump told ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce.The president said he did not like Bruce's \"attitude.\"\"You ought to go back and learn how to be a reporter. No more questions from you,\" Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was meeting with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.Trump's tirade came shortly before the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly in favor of a bill to compel the Department of Justice to release all of its records on Epstein.The DOJ earlier this year refused to release those documents, despite prior promises by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump administration officials.Trump does not need to wait for Congress to pass a bill. He could order the DOJ to release more Epstein files.\"Why wait for Congress to release the Epstein files?\" Bruce asked the president. \"Why not just do it now?\"Trump said, \"As far as the Epstein files ... I have nothing to do with\" him.Read more about the Epstein filesHouse overwhelmingly passes bill to release Jeffrey Epstein filesTrump calls to revoke ABC's license over reporter's Epstein files questionJeffrey Epstein files: Larry Summers steps back from public commitments over email falloutJeffrey Epstein victims' ad calls for files to be released, Trump urges GOP to vote for House measureTrump reverses stance on Epstein records, presses Republicans to support releaseJeffrey Epstein on Trump: 'I know how dirty donald is'Trump to ask DOJ to probe Jeffrey Epstein involvement with Clinton, JPMorgan, SummersGoldman Sachs stands by top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler after her emails with Jeffrey Epstein exposedJeffrey Epstein files: House speaker announces vote next week on release of docs\"I threw him out of my club many years ago because I thought he was a sick pervert,\" Trump said, referring to his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida.\"People are wise to your hoax,\" the president told the reporter. \"Your crappy company is one of the perpetrators.\"\"And I'll tell you something,\" Trump said. \"I think the license should be taken away from ABC. Because your news is so fake and so wrong.\"\"We have a great commissioner ... who should look at that,\" he added, apparently referring to Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr, whose agency oversees broadcast licenses.In September, Carr threatened ABC's license over comments by late-night show Jimmy Kimmel about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\"We can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" said Carr on a podcast at the time. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"Hours after Carr's remarks, ABC suspended \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"The show returned to air about a week later after backlash against ABC and its parent company, Disney.Trump has repeatedly called the Epstein matter a \"hoax\" created by Democrats, even though members of Trump's Make America Great Again movement were leading advocates for releasing the files.And Trump failed to dissuade Republican allies in Congress from supporting the bill to release the files.On Sunday night, as the Epstein bill's chances of passage appeared to rise, Trump suddenly reversed course and urged his GOP allies to support the measure.On Monday, Trump said he would sign the bill if Congress passes it.Trump and Epstein had been longtime friends but had a falling out years before Epstein killed himself in jail in August 2019 after being arrested on federal child sex trafficking charges.Last week, the House Oversight Committee released emails showing Epstein discussing Trump.In one email from 2019, Epstein wrote that Trump \"knew about the girls.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Fed cut interest rates by quarter of a percentage point, in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersFederal Reserve officials were at odds during their October meeting over cutting interest rates, divided over whether a stalling labor market or stubborn inflation were bigger economic threats, minutes released Wednesday showed.While the Federal Open Market Committee approved a cut at the meeting, the path forward looks less certain. Disagreements stretched into the outlook for December, with officials expressing skepticism about the need for an additional reduction that markets had been widely anticipating, with \"many\" saying that no more cuts are needed at least in 2025.\"Several participants assessed that a further lowering of the target range for the federal funds rate could well be appropriate in December if the economy evolved about as they expected over the coming intermeeting period,\" the minutes said. \"Many participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for the rest of the year.\"In Fed parlance, \"many\" is more than \"several,\" indicating a tilt against a December cut. However, \"participants\" does not denote voters. There are 19 participants at the meeting, but only 12 vote, so it's unclear how the voting members' sentiment is set for a December move.However, the notation jibes with a statement at Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting news conference. Powell told reporters that a December cut was not a \"foregone conclusion.\"\"In discussing the near-term course of monetary policy, participants expressed strongly differing views about what policy decision would most likely be appropriate at the Committee's December meeting,\" the minutes said.Previous to Powell's statement, traders had been pricing in a near certainty of another move at the Dec. 9-10 session. As of Wednesday afternoon, that had been reduced to about a 1 in 3 chance, according to the CME Group's FedWatch measure of futures pricing. Odds for a January cut are around 66%.The minutes did note that \"most participants\" saw further cuts likely in the future, though not necessarily in December.Ultimately, the FOMC approved a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. But the 10-2 vote was not indicative of how split officials were at an institution not generally known for dissent.Officials generally indicated concern over a slowing labor market and inflation that has \"shown little sign of returning sustainably\" to the Fed's 2% target. The minutes reflected multiple camps within the committee.\"Against this backdrop, many participants were in favor of lowering the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting, some supported such a decision but could have also supported maintaining the level of the target range, and several were against lowering the target range,\" the minutes said.At the heart of the debate was a disagreement over how \"restrictive\" the current policy is for the economy. Some participants thought that even with the quarter-point cut policy was still holding back growth, while others saw that \"the resilience of economic activity\" indicated that policy is not restrictive.Judging from public statements, the panel is divided between inflation doves including Governors Stephen Miran, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, who prefer cuts as a way to stave off weakness in the labor market. On the other side are more hawkish members such as regional Presidents Jeffrey Schmid of Kansas City, Susan Collins of Boston and Alberto Musalem of St. Louis, who worry that cutting more could prevent the Fed from getting to its 2% inflation goal.In between are moderates such as Powell, Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and New York President John Williams who favor a patient approach.The minutes noted that \"one participant,\" a reference to Miran, preferred a more aggressive half-point cut. Schmid also voted no, saying he preferred not to cut at all.The meeting minutes indicated the decision-making was complicated by a lack of government data during the 44-day federal government shutdown. Reports on the labor market, inflation and a host of other metrics were not compiled or released during the impasse. Government agencies such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Bureau of Economic Analysis have announced schedules for some of the releases but not all.Powell compared the situation to \"driving in the fog,\" though Waller on Monday rejected that comparison, saying the Fed has plenty of data to formulate policy.The minutes also discussed the balance sheet aspect of policy. The FOMC agreed to stop the reduction of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities in December, a process that has shaved more than $2.5 trillion off the balance sheet, which is still around $6.6 trillion. There appeared to be widespread approval for the halting of a process known as quantitative tightening.",

Nvidia typically provides one quarter of revenue guidance.Anything Nvidia or CEO Jensen Huang says about the company's outlook and its sales backlog will be closely scrutinized.He'll have lots to talk about.Nvidia is at the center of the AI boom, and it counts counts every major cloud company and AI lab as a customer. All of the major AI labs use Nvidia chips to develop next-generation models, and a handful of companies called hyperscalers have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to construct new data centers around Nvidia technology in unprecedented build-outs.Last month, Huang said Nvidia had $500 billion in chip orders in calendar 2025 and 2026, including the forthcoming Rubin chip, which will start shipping in volume next year. Analysts will want to know more about what Nvidia sees coming from the AI infrastructure world next year, because all five of the top AI model developers in the U.S. use the company's chips.As of Tuesday, analysts polled by LSEG expect Nvidia's sales to rise 39% in the company's fiscal 2027, which starts in early 2026.Investors will want to hear about Nvidia's equity deals with customers and suppliers, including an agreement to invest in OpenAI, a deal with Nokia and an investment into former rival Intel. Nvidia has kept its pace of deal-making up, agreeing to invest $10 billion into AI company Anthropic earlier this week.Nvidia management will also be asked about China, and the possibility that the company could gain licenses from the U.S. government to export a version of its current-generation Blackwell AI chip to the country. Analysts say Nvidia's sales could get a boost of as much as $50 billion per year if it is allowed to sell current-generation chips to Chinese companies.WATCH: There's a lot riding on Nvidia's earnings, says Interactive Brokers' Sosnick watch now",

The electric vehicle company applied for a \"transportation network company\" permit on Nov. 13, and was approved on Monday, ADOT said in an emailed statement. Additional permits will be required before Tesla can operate a robotaxi service in Arizona.In July, Tesla applied to conduct autonomous vehicle testing and operations in Phoenix, with and without human safety drivers on board. A month earlier, Tesla started a robotaxi pilot in Austin, Texas, with safety valets and remote operators. Tesla also operates a more traditional car service in the San Francisco Bay Area.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla plans to take human safety drivers out of its cars in Austin before the end of this year. The company is aiming to operate a commercial robotaxi service in Phoenix and several other U.S. cities before the end of 2026.According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website, Tesla cars equipped with automated driving systems were involved in seven reported collisions following the launch of the company's pilot in Texas. Competitors including Alphabet's Waymo in the U.S. and Baidu's Apollo Go in China are way ahead in the nascent robotaxi ride-hailing market. In the Phoenix area, Waymo operates a sizable commercial business, with at least 400 autonomous vehicles, the company previously told CNBC. In May, Waymo said it had surpassed 10 million driverless trips served to riders across the U.S.Baidu said in an earnings update on Tuesday that its Apollo Go service \"provided 3.1 million fully driverless operational rides in the third quarter of 2025,\" representing year-over-year growth of 212%.Musk has been promising that Tesla will \"solve\" autonomy for years without reaching its goals. The world's richest person has continued with the lofty pronouncements. At the company's 2025 shareholder meeting earlier this month, Musk said the \"killer app\" for self-driving technology is when people can \"text and drive,\" or \"sleep and drive.\" \"Before we allow the car to be driven without paying attention, we need to make sure it's very safe,\" Musk said. \"We're on the cusp of that.

Kirk Sides | Houston Chronicle | Getty ImagesThis is the strongest buyer's market in housing in more than a decade. That's the headline on a new report from Redfin, a real estate brokerage owned by Rocket Cos. The report points to specific data on the supply of homes for sale and the number of buyers actively looking. There were an estimated 36.8% more sellers than buyers in October, according to Redfin, the largest gap in records dating back to 2013. Redfin defines a buyer's market as one with at least 10% more sellers than buyers. Economists at the brokerage estimate that the last time there was a stronger buyer's market was in the years following the 2008 financial crisis, when home prices plummeted across the nation. \"Of course, it's only a buyer's market for those who can afford to buy—many Americans have been priced out of the housing market as affordability has eroded,\" Redfin researchers noted. And that's the crux of the problem. Is it really a buyer's market, if so many buyers are still priced out and therefore not even looking?Real estate firms cite housing affordability as the biggest challenge to their business, according to a new report from the National Association of Realtors. It far outweighs other challenges, including industry costs.\"Real estate firms are on the frontlines of the industry and are seeing firsthand how housing affordability and local economic conditions are impacting their clients,\" said Jessica Lautz, NAR deputy chief economist.Home prices continue to weaken but, nationally at least, were still 1.2% higher in September from the year before, according to Cotality. Prices are roughly 50% higher nationally than they were just five years ago, pre-pandemic.\"Much like the K-shaped trend seen in overall consumer spending—driven largely by higher income groups—lower-income potential homebuyers are facing challenges due to an uncertain job market, sluggish wage growth, and worsening financial conditions. This is leading to weaker demand for homes and downward pressure on prices,\" said Selma Hepp, Cotality's chief economist. Get Property Play directly to your inboxCNBC's Property Play with Diana Olick covers new and evolving opportunities for the real estate investor, delivered weekly to your inbox.Subscribe here to get access today.Mortgage rates have come off their recent highs, but are still roughly twice what they were in the first years of the pandemic, when it fast became a seller's market.Cost remains the primary obstacle to homebuying, with about 75 of the top 100 housing markets still considered overvalued, according to Cotality. In Washington, D.C., which was hardest hit by the recent government shutdown, potential buyers — largely those who were unaffected by the shutdown — are discovering it is easier to get good deals. \"They are figuring out they have leverage and are finding they can seek price concessions and repairs,\" said Paul Legere, a buyer's agent with the Joel Nelson Group of Keller Williams, adding it \"feels like it might be a short moment in time.\"The shutdown may be over, but consumer sentiment is not pointing to a surge in homebuying. In its November sentiment survey, that National Association of Home Builders reported a drop in builder sales expectations over the next six months. \"We continue to see demand-side weakness as a softening labor market and stretched consumer finances are contributing to a difficult sales environment,\" said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. ",

The firm had planned to merge its smaller, nontraded Blue Owl Capital Corporation II (OBDC II), into the larger, publicly traded fund Blue Owl Capital Corporation (OBDC). In doing so, the firm restricted investors in the $1.7 billion OBDC II from redeeming until the deal closed, even as the merger would have meant about 20% paper losses, based on where the $17.1 billion OBDC has been trading. News of the restricted redemptions caused shares of the parent company – Blue Owl Capital to slump about 6% on Monday. It also added to concerns about the state of the private credit industry among investors, especially the area that has started to heavily finance the artificial intelligence data center build-out that many fear is overhyped.

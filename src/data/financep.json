    "body": "Workers demolish the facade of the East Wing of the White House on Oct. 20, 2025 in Washington, DC.Kevin Dietsch | Getty ImagesThe White House on Tuesday dismissed anger over the demolition of parts of the building's East Wing to build a new ballroom at the behest of President Donald Trump.\"In the latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies are clutching their pearls over President Donald J. Trump's visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom to the White House,\" the White House said in a statement.The White House called the ballroom \"a bold, necessary addition that echoes the storied history of improvements and additions\" by prior presidents.Photos of construction workers tearing down parts of the building went viral online Monday, triggering public anger over the planned 90,000-square-foot, $250 million ballroom.\"You probably hear the beautiful sound of construction to the back,\" Trump said during a Rose Garden event Tuesday. \"That's music to my ears. I love that sound. Other people don't like it. I love it.\"In July, Trump said that construction of the ballroom \"won't interfere with the current building.\"\"It'll be near it but not touching it, and pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,\" Trump said of the White House at the time.The Treasury Department has told staff not to share photos of the East Wing, a spokesperson confirmed to CNBC on Tuesday. The department is located next to the White House, and has a clear view of the demolition work.\"Carelessly shared photographs of the White House complex during this process could potentially reveal sensitive items, including security features or confidential structural details,\" the Treasury spokesperson told CNBC.\"Out of an abundance of caution, we have urged our employees to avoid sharing these images.\"The Wall Street Journal first reported Treasury's message to employees.\"Trump's billionaire ballroom. This is a disgrace. Welcome to the Second Gilded Age,\" Rep. Darren Soto, D-Fla., tweeted Monday, above a photo from The Washington Post showing the demolition work.Trump has said that he and private donors will finance the construction of the ballroom.Comcast, the current parent company of CNBC, was on a list of top donors to the ballroom's construction. It is unclear how much Comcast and other donors contributed. CNBC will spin off from Comcast before the end of this year under a new parent company Versant.",

We don't expect this matter to have a material impact on future results.\"Revenue for the quarter rose 17%, in-line with analyst expectations.

DraftKings targeted the company for its team and proprietary technology. \"We are excited about the additional opportunity that prediction markets could represent for our business,\" DraftKings CEO Jason Robins said in a statement to CNBC. \"We believe that Railbird's team and platform—combined with DraftKings' scale, trusted brand, and proven expertise in mobile-first products—positions us to win in this incremental space.\"Predictions markets allow customers to trade on the outcomes of various events in the worlds of finance, culture and entertainment, which will allow DraftKings to expand beyond its sports betting business. The markets on election outcomes and sports are the most controversial.  Dozens of states, their gaming regulators and tribes are suing or taking other actions to try to prohibit companies from offering trades based on sporting events, because they see it as unlicensed gambling.  Nevada is among the states warning that companies risk losing their gambling licenses if they offer sports in their prediction markets.If DraftKings offers sports events contracts, it's likely to focus only on states that don't offer licensed sports betting, like California and Texas, to avoid running afoul of the states where it offers sports betting.  Additionally, technology exists to prevent those sports trades from being available on tribal lands.  DraftKings also may offer more advanced \"know your customer\" guardrails, a term commonly used to reference identity verification, given its experience in the regulated gambling market.  ",

    "body": "Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesHBO Max is the latest streaming services to raise its prices.The streaming giant, owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, announced Tuesday that it is raising prices across all plans. HBO Max's Basic with ads plan is increasing $1 a month to $10.99, the Standard plan is going up $1.50 to $18.49, and Premium is increasing $2 to $22.99. HBO Max last raised prices in June 2024.The price hikes are effective immediately for new subscriptions. Existing monthly subscribers will be notified 30 days in advance of their plan renewing, with the new prices starting on their next billing date on or after November 20, the company said. The updates come as the streaming market becomes increasingly saturated with options — and as other major apps hike their prices. Disney raised the price of its Disney+ plans and bundles last month, Apple hiked the price of Apple TV by 30% in August and Netflix raised its prices early this year.WBD CEO David Zaslav indicated in September that price increases were on the way along with a stricter crackdown on sharing passwords.\"The fact that this is quality, and that's true across our company, motion picture, TV production and streaming quality, we all think that gives us a chance to raise prices,\" Zaslav said at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference last month. \"We think we're way underpriced.\"As of June 30, WBD said it had 125.7 million paying subscribers to all of its streaming services. That stat includes HBO Max as well as other legacy linear subscribers to HBO, who have access to the streaming service.HBO Max's news comes as its parent company, WBD, undergoes changes of its own. The company announced in June that it plans to split into two public companies by 2026. A streaming and studios company would include its movie properties and HBO Max, while a global networks business would include linear channels like CNN and TNT Sports. At the same time, WBD is fielding takeout interest from companies including Paramount Skydance and said Tuesday it's open to a sale. ",

    "body": "Customers check out at a supermarket on August 12, 2025 in New York City. Liao Pan | China News Service | Getty ImagesThe September consumer price index report coming out Friday will command full attention from financial markets, even as some investors will view the data with a skeptical eye.With the Bureau of Labor Statistics already under scrutiny this year for its broad menu of data releases, the government shutdown gripping Washington, D.C., will only raise concerns from parts of Wall Street about whether the inflation reading will present a full picture.\"Skeptics like me are going to be focused on how clean is this data,\" said Vishal Khanduja, head of broad markets fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. \"What were the accommodations made for the lack of full personnel staff showing up? What adjustments were made before the data got reported?\"Indeed, the BLS this year has faced a host of questions over its data collection methods. President Donald Trump in August, furious over huge downward revisions in nonfarm payrolls data, sacked former BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer.watch nowThough still considered part of the \"gold standard\" U.S. economic data collection apparatus, the BLS has also been criticized for its decidedly analog approach, which includes in-person visits, phone calls and written response forms.The agency faces the added burden of staffing cuts — even before the shutdown — and has eliminated several cities from its collection efforts. Now, i is putting together a key inflation report with most of the government closed and risks that sample data could be incomplete.For those reasons, Khanduja thinks investors should be careful with how much emphasis they place on the CPI reading.\"The efficacy and the cleanliness of data — there will definitely be a little bit of a skepticism had from my end, and I'm thinking the market will do the same,\" he said.Muted expectationsEven with the questions over the data, economists aren't looking for anything dramatic from the actual numbers.The Dow Jones consensus has the CPI report showing 3.1% annual inflation levels on both the headline, or all-items, gauge as well as the core, which excludes food and energy. Economists see the monthly headline number rising 0.4% and 0.3% for core, right in line with the August gains.What gives this report an even higher profile is that all other data collections and releases have been suspended during the shutdown. The reason the Labor Department called back BLS staffers is because the CPI report is used to index Social Security cost-of-living adjustments.So outside of this, there will be no other releases, leaving investors as well as Federal Reserve policymakers flying blind on data. That in itself presents a bevy of problems and another headache for agencies like the BLS.\"As the shutdown appears likely to last into November, it is not clear how the BLS will deal with an unprecedented lack of real-time collections,\" Citigroup economist Veronica Clark said in a note. \"November data collections are also increasingly likely to be affected. We will be watching for any possible release of guidance on October CPI collections with Friday's September report.\"In the meantime, the Fed will hold a meeting next week, with markets widely expecting a quarter percentage point reduction in the overnight borrowing rate, likely to be followed by another in December. Fed funds currently stand at 4.00% to 4.25%.However, there's considerable uncertainty about what will happen in 2026 and beyond. Trump wants rates aggressively lower, and he's likely to nominate a candidate next year to succeed Chair Jerome Powell with that philosophy.With a lack of data certainty, though, formulating policy will be difficult.\"I don't think we're going to learn a whole lot from this [CPI] data that we're not seeing at the moment,\" Mike Wilson, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley, said Tuesday on CNBC. \"I think it will give the Fed cover to do what I think they need to do, which is cut rates in a more meaningful way. To me, that [is] the risk, that we don't get the data that allows the Fed to cut more meaningfully.\"",

    "body": "watch nowLauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, said the surge in enthusiasm around artificial intelligence has all the markings of a bubble.\"We are absolutely in an AI bubble now. It is going to burst,\" she said on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" Tuesday to David Faber. \"I don't know when, I don't know the order of magnitude. A lot of people are going to lose money.\"Her remarks come as enthusiasm for AI continues to drive markets higher, with investors betting the technology will transform industries and lift corporate earnings. Taylor Wolfe said investors are underestimating the risks tied to the surge in AI-related spending by major technology companies.\"There are trillions of dollars that are being earmarked to be spent relative to hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow generated by the Mag 7,\" she said, referring to the group of large-cap tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. \"They're going to have to borrow to invest in all this CapEx, and we have yet to see the returns on investment.\"Her remarks come at a time when analysis shows the S&P 500 has become pretty much an AI index.Taylor Wolfe believes the mismatch between capital expenditures and profit potential makes current valuations difficult to justify.\"Show me the trillions of dollars of profits that are going to be generated in the next five years,\" she said. \"And you just can't. The math doesn't work.\"She said the current environment is reminiscent of the late 1990s, when investors chased anything associated with the internet regardless of valuation or business model. During the dotcom era, the right thing to do wasn't short the bubble companies; it was to look where no one else was looking, she said.\"You'd have been better off owning a railroad in 2000 than buying Cisco at 35 times earnings, Taylor Wolfe said. \"So at Impactive, what we're doing today is looking for our railroads.\"At the 13D Monitor's Active-Passive Investor Summit Tuesday, Taylor Wolfe presented her new idea Advanced Drainage Systems, which she called the undisputed leader in plastic stormwater and residential septic systems. She said the company is AI proof.",

Its popularity has spurred Netflix to release it twice in theaters — once in August for a two-day weekend event and again next week around Halloween.Partnering with Mattel and Hasbro will allow Netflix to offer a suite of consumer products based around the film.Mattel will handle dolls, action figures, accessories and playsets, while Hasbro will focus on plush, electronics, roleplay items and board games, the companies announced Tuesday. There will likely be some overlap in product categories between the two toy makers, however. Mattel is currently taking pre-orders for a three-pack of dolls featuring Rumi, Mira and Zoey, the members of the fictional KPop trio HUNTR/X. And Hasbro's first product is a \"KPop Demon Hunters\" themed Monopoly Deal game. Merchandise and toys from both companies will be available at retail in spring 2026.\"Netflix, Mattel and Hasbro joining forces on this first-of-its-kind collaboration means fans can finally get their hands on the best dolls, games, and merchandise they've been not-so-subtly demanding on every social platform known to humanity,\" said Marian Lee, Netflix's chief marketing officer, said in a statement Tuesday.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he hosts a Rose Garden Club lunch at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., October 21, 2025.  Kevin Lamarque | ReutersPresident Donald Trump has demanded that the Department of Justice pay him a whopping $230 million in compensation for its criminal investigations of him after his first term in the White House ended, The New York Times reported Tuesday.The Times noted that any potential settlement might have to be approved by people he has appointed during his second term.One of them, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, previously represented Trump as a defense attorney in criminal cases against the president.Trump submitted complaints related to the DOJ's probes \"through an administrative claim process that is often the precursor to lawsuits,\" the newspaper reported.One claim, submitted in 2023, requests damages in connection with the DOJ's investigation of interference in the 2016 presidential election by Russia and potential connections to Trump's campaign that year, the Times said.The other claim, filed in mid-2024, accuses the FBI of violating Trump's rights by conducting a search of his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in 2022 as part of an investigation into his retention of classified government documents after leaving the White House at the end of his first term.Trump was indicted in federal court in Florida in connection with that investigation on charges of retaining those records and of interfering in efforts by federal authorities to recover them.A judge tossed out that case, and the DOJ ultimately dropped an appeal of her decision and the entire case after Trump won the 2024 election.The Times noted that Trump alluded to his claims during an event last week in the Oval Office, while standing next to Blanche, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel.\"I have a lawsuit that was doing very well, and when I became president, I said, I'm sort of suing myself. I don't know, how do you settle the lawsuit, I'll say give me X dollars, and I don't know what to do with the lawsuit,\" Mr. Trump said.\"It sort of looks bad, I'm suing myself, right?\" Trump said. \"So I don't know. But that was a lawsuit that was very strong, very powerful.\"The White House referred questions from CNBC about the Times article to the DOJ. CNBC has requested comment from the DOJ.",

    "body": "Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersSpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy after he told media outlets this week that the billionaire's space company is falling behind U.S. plans to return to the moon.\"The person responsible for America's space program can't have a 2 digit IQ,\" Musk wrote in a Tuesday post on X.In response to other user posts, Musk referred to the Transportation secretary as \"*Sean Dummy\" and said he is \"trying to kill NASA!\" Musk later posted a poll asking users \"Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America's space program?\" Musk appeared to be referring to Duffy's background as a competitive speed climber.On Monday, Duffy told CNBC that SpaceX was \"behind\" schedule on building its lunar landing system for the space agency's Artemis III mission and that he would consider other contracts with competitors such as Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.SpaceX and Blue Origin will have until Oct. 29 to offer ways to speed up the project, a NASA official told CNBC. The agency will also ask the industry to suggest ways to \"increase the cadence\" of Moon missions.President Donald Trump selected Duffy to become the acting NASA administrator in July. The position had been vacant since the start of Trump's presidency. Trump had previously nominated Musk ally Jared Isaacman, but he pulled the nomination earlier this year, saying he was a \"blue blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"CNBC reported earlier this month that Trump has held talks with Isaacman to reconsider the role.NASA is racing against China and others to get humans back to the moon for the first time since 1972. The space agency launched the Artemis project under Trump's first administration with the goal of creating a \"long-term presence\" on the moon for science and tech discovery.SpaceX won a $2.9 billion contract to build the technology in 2021. Other contractors such as Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin and Boeing are participating in various stages of the program.But the project has been fraught with setbacks.NASA launched its first Artemis mission in November 2022. Last December, the agency delayed its planned Artemis missions. NASA's first Artemis launch with astronauts is now slated for April 2026, with a third mission to land two astronauts on the moon planned for 2027.Now, the space agency is also grappling with the aftershocks from an ongoing government shutdown that threatens to stall any plans to reopen contracts. NASA made exceptions for employees and contractors working on Artemis missions to keep working during the shutdown, CNBC previously reported.When Musk worked at the helm of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, NASA faced sweeping, anti-DEI-related reductions in force, and implemented deferred resignation programs that have slashed the space agency's workforce.Around 4,000 NASA employees accepted the deferred resignation program offers since Trump took office for his second term, which reduced the staff of the space agency by nearly one-fifth.WATCH: Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy: SpaceX is behind Artemis III timelinewatch now— CNBC's Lora Kolodny contributed reporting.",

    "body": "Dario Amodei, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence startup Anthropic.Chesnot | Getty ImagesAnthropic CEO Dario Amodei on Tuesday addressed what he called \"inaccurate claims\" about the artificial intelligence startup's policy stances after repeatedly facing criticism from venture capitalist David Sacks, who is serving as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar.Amodei said the company is aligned with the Trump administration across \"key areas of AI policy,\" and that it is interested in working with \"anyone serious about getting this right.\"\"I fully believe that Anthropic, the administration, and leaders across the political spectrum want the same thing: to ensure that powerful AI technology benefits the American people and that America advances and secures its lead in AI development,\" Amodei said in a statement.Anthropic was founded in 2021 by a group of former OpenAI executives, including Amodei, who left the company over concerns about safety. It's one of the startups at the center of the AI boom, and its valuation has swelled to $183 billion in just four years.The company caught the attention of Sacks last week after Jack Clark, one of Anthropic's co-founders and its current head of policy, published an essay called \"Technological Optimism and Appropriate Fear,\" which sparked a debate over AI regulation online.Sacks criticized the essay and accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering,\" according to a post on X. He said the company is \"principally responsible for the state regulatory frenzy that is damaging the startup ecosystem.\"Read more CNBC tech newsCoreWeave CEO says Core Scientific 'not a need to have' as shareholder opposition to deal risesOpenAI investor Reid Hoffman spars with AI czar Sacks, calls Anthropic 'one of the good guys'OpenAI cracks down on Sora 2 deepfakes after pressure from Bryan Cranston, SAG-AFTRATransportation Secretary Duffy says Musk's SpaceX is behind on moon trip and he will reopen contractsAnthropic opposed a proposed amendment to Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that would have enacted a 10-year-long suspension on state-level AI laws. That provision ultimately failed and was not included in the legislation. The company also supported a bill in California that requires large AI developers to make their model safety protocols public, though there are exemptions for companies that generate an annual gross revenue of less than $500 million.Billionaire tech investor and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman defended Anthropic on Monday and called the startup \"one of the good guys.\" Hoffman was an early investor in OpenAI, Anthropic's larger rival, and remains a shareholder. He revealed on Monday that Greylock, where he's a partner, has invested in Anthropic.Sacks quickly responded to Hoffman's post, and the two sparred back and forth on Monday. In one post, Sacks wrote that the \"real issue\" is \"Anthropic's agenda to backdoor Woke AI and other AI regulations through Blue states like California.\"Amodei worked to clarify Anthropic's view on Tuesday, writing that the company's longstanding position has been that a uniform federal approach is preferable to a patchwork of state laws.\"\"When we agree, we say so. When we don't, we propose an alternative for consideration,\" Amodei said. \"We do this because we are a public benefit corporation with a mission to ensure that AI benefits everyone and to maintain America's lead in AI.\"\"Again, we believe we share those goals with the Trump administration, both sides of Congress, and the public,\" he said.WATCH: Watch CNBC’s full interview with White House AI czar David Sackswatch now",

More than 63% of the shares available for trading were sold short, per FactSet.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBeyond Meat, 1-day performanceIt's a remarkable turnaround for a stock that tumbled more than 67% just last week, after the company announced it has finalized a debt deal. The stock is currently trading around $2 per share, after ending last week at just 65 cents.Indeed, the stock has been under pressure for many years, posting losing returns over each of the last five years. After surging past $230 per share following its IPO in 2019, it has since become a penny stock.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBYND, all timeYet this week's rally harkens back to when Beyond Meat enjoyed meme stock status among retail traders, who crowded into the stock based more on sentiment than on corporate fundamentals after coordinating on online message boards.In 2021, Bank of America called Beyond Meat a Reddit stock to watch. It ended that same year down more than 47%.watch nowThe return of Beyond Meat could also be the latest sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names in spite of elevated valuations, and possibly a signal of a market top.Roundhill actually shut its meme ETF down at one point because of lack of interest, but revived it earlier this month as retail traders dive back into this relentless bull market.",

CNBCA day ahead of Tesla's quarterly earnings report, a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs wants investors to focus their attention on matters of governance.On Tuesday, a group that includes the American Federation of Teachers and Public Citizen launched a website for Take Back Tesla, a campaign urging shareholders to vote against a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that would net him nearly $1 trillion worth of stock and expand his control over the company.Tesla's board floated the pay proposal in September, saying the largest ever CEO pay plan was appropriate and necessary to lock Musk in for a decade. The plan is up for a shareholder vote at the company's annual meeting next month.On the Take Back Tesla website, the group calls the outsized package \"outrageous,\" in part because Musk's \"political activities have damaged Tesla's brand and distracted him from leadership at Tesla.\" The site says the plan doesn't require Musk to focus more on the automaker than his political interests or other business endeavors.The site also encourages the general population to petition state treasurers and other financial officers, who oversee funds on behalf of workers and retirees, to reject the plan. The coalition plans to share materials online that teach investors how to vote their shares or influence fund managers who vote on their behalf.\"Public pension funds are significant shareholders in Tesla, and the asset managers who invest those funds have even larger holdings,\" the site says. \"That's our money and we should tell the people who invest it for us that we want them to vote to hold Musk and Tesla Board members accountable.\"Additional groups in the coalition include Americans for Financial Reform, the Communication Workers of America, corporate watchdog group Ekō, People's Action and Stop the Money Pipeline.Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Top proxy firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against authorizing the $1 trillion pay plan, which was disclosed amid a tense battle over Musk's previous 2018 pay package, which amounted to about $56 billion in stock when it vested.Following those firms' suggestions, Tesla wrote in a post that, \"ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against Tesla's proposals time and time again since the 2018 CEO Performance Award was introduced.\" The company added that shareholders who sold would \"have missed out on our market capitalization soaring by 20x from March 2018 to August 2025.\"watch nowThe Delaware Court of Chancery ruled early last year that the 2018 plan was improperly granted by Tesla, with the judge finding that the company hid crucial details from shareholders and that Musk had controlled board members rather than negotiating with them for a fair deal.Musk appealed the matter to the Delaware State Supreme Court and is seeking to get the 2018 CEO pay package reinstated.Around the time that plan was rescinded, in January 2024, Musk wrote on his social network X, \"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI & robotics without having ~25% voting control.\" The new plan would add 12% to his stake over the next decade.Musk had already started artificial intelligence startup xAI in March 2023, taking some ex-Tesla employees with him, and was developing Grok, a would-be challenger to OpenAI's ChatGPT.By May 2025, Musk said he was committed to running Tesla for at least five more years.New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who oversees a $300 billion pension fund, said he \"vociferously opposes this pay package\" and says other public fiduciaries should do the same.\"Most of the time we've held Tesla stock, it has been a solid investment, it's grown over time, and that's why we haven't chosen to dump it,\" Lander, who also serves as finance and accountability chief for the city, said in an interview. Lander said that he's preferred to \"hold on to it and participate in shareholder engagement to address the concerns we have.\"Lander manages funds that own about $1.1 billion worth of Tesla, based on holdings reported in August.He said he views Tesla's board he as \"insufficiently independent,\" and that it's allowed Musk to be an \"absentee CEO.\" The company has also failed to hit its marks when it comes to robotaxis and self-driving technology, Lander said.The stock has rallied of late after a brutal start to the year, but it's still underperforming its tech peers and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq in 2025.Musk has \"been an inconsistent CEO at best,\" Lander said, \"and the pay package is like a ransom attempt after volatile stock performance and destroying consumer confidence.\"Tesla is scheduled to report third-quarter results after the close of regular trading on Wednesday. Analysts are expecting revenue growth of 4.7% from a year earlier to $26.37 billion, according to LSEG, following two straight year-over-year declines.WATCH: Former Tesla board member on Muskwatch now",

Chevrolet Silverado truck at a dealership in Upland, California, US, on Wednesday, Oct 15, 2025.Kyle Grillot | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesDETROIT — General Motors raised its 2025 financial guidance Tuesday after beating Wall Street's top- and bottom-line earnings expectations for the third quarter, while lowering its expected impact from tariffs.GM stock rose more than 15% in trading Tuesday. The stock, which closed Monday at $58 per share, had its best day since 2020 and its second best day on the market since its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy.Here's how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:Earnings per share: $2.80 adjusted vs. $2.31 expectedRevenue: $48.59 billion vs. $45.27 billion expectedAdjusted EBIT: $3.38 billion vs. $2.72 billion expectedGM's third-quarter revenue of $48.59 billion was down less than 1% from $48.76 billion in the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude one-time or special items, some interest and taxes as well as other financials not considered \"core\" to the company's operations. GM's new outlook signals strength for the automaker heading into the fourth quarter and beats Wall Street analysts' current expectations for the last three months of the year.The updated guidance includes adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of between $12 billion and $13 billion, or $9.75 to $10.50 adjusted EPS, up from $10 billion to $12.5 billion, or $8.25 to $10 adjusted EPS, and adjusted automotive free cash flow of $10 billion to $11 billion, up from $7.5 billion to $10 billion.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGM stock in 2025The automaker's new EPS target suggests fourth-quarter adjusted EPS of between $1.64 and $2.39, with a midpoint around $2.02, which is above current consensus of $1.94.\"Thanks to the collective efforts of our team, and our compelling vehicle portfolio, GM delivered another very good quarter of earnings and free cash flow,\" GM CEO Mary Barra said Tuesday in a shareholder letter. \"Based on our performance, we are raising our full-year guidance, underscoring our confidence in the company's trajectory.\"GM also reduced the expected impact of tariffs this year to between $3.5 billion and $4.5 billion, down from $4 billion to $5 billion. The automaker expects to offset about 35% of that impact.Barra on Tuesday thanked President Donald Trump for \"the important tariff updates\" Friday that included imposing levies on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and parts as well as extending a tariff offset worth 3.75% of the value of American-made vehicles.Read moreEV impactGM's adjusted results do not include $1.6 billion in special charges reported by the automaker last week due to its pullback in all-electric vehicles, which more than halved its net income attributable to stockholders compared with the third quarter of 2024.The company's net income attributable to stockholders was $1.3 billion during the just-reported period, down 57% from roughly $3.1 billion a year earlier. Its net income margin also plummeted to 2.7%, down from 6.3% a year earlier.GM CFO Paul Jacobson on Tuesday said only about 40% of the company's EVs were profitable on a production, or contribution-margin basis. He signaled that the company expects profitability for EVs to take longer than previously expected amid an expected slowdown in adoption.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" he told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box.\"GM has made significant gains in EV sales this year. Motor Intelligence reported that the Detroit automaker went from an 8.7% market share to begin this year to 13.8% through the third quarter – topping Hyundai Motor, including Kia, at 8.6% through September. GM still trails U.S. EV leader Tesla by a wide margin.NA business downGM's North American business, which has driven its profits this decade, earned more than $2.5 billion during the third quarter, on an adjusted basis. Its adjusted profit margin declined from 9.7% a year earlier to 6.2% during the most recent quarter.Barra said in Tuesday's letter that the automaker's \"top priority\" is to return to 8% to 10% adjusted profit margins in North America through \"driving EV profitability, maintaining production and pricing discipline, managing fixed costs, and further reducing tariff exposure.\"Gains in the company's China operations, up $217 million from a year earlier, as well as its international markets, up $184 million, helped offset the lower North American earnings during the third quarter.GM Financial, the automaker's lending arm, also reported adjusted earnings of $804 million, up 17% from the third quarter of 2024.",

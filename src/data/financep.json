The show was canceled in 2023 after two seasons.</p><p>In addition to several anti-trans posts, Musk also <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1973101319222165785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973101319222165785%7Ctwgr%5E6bb1e8bac213d47b901b22d6ba65042b371c9caf%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.firstpost.com%2Fexplainers%2Felon-musk-netflix-boycott-charlie-kirk-controversy-13938760.html\" target=\"_blank\">responded</a> to a post criticizing alleged statements made by the show's creator, Hamish Steele, that a prominent conservative X account said \"mocked\" the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p><p>Steele responded to Musk's callout on rival social media platform Bluesky saying, \"It's probably going to be a very odd day.\" Steele also shared a post by TV writer Jack Bernhardt that called \"Dead End\" a \"brilliant show about kind, wonderful characters.\"</p><p>Netflix did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206766-17593554481759355445-41906018363-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759355447&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"‘Fast Money’ traders talk Netflix shares dropping after Elon Musk tells people to cancel\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Analysts say the backlash might not pose as big of a threat to Netflix as Musk may be hoping for.</p><p>Netflix reported 301.63 million subscribers as of the fourth quarter of 2024, the last time it reported the metric before shifting priority to revenue over user growth. The company has a roughly $490 billion market cap, and its stock is up more than 60% in the past year.</p><p>Shares are down 4% so far this week.</p><p>\"Is that going to move the needle necessarily? ...

It was our military versus insurgents, guerrillas, asymmetric warfare, relatively low-tech fighters in most cases,\" said Darby.</p><p>But war today is more focused on \"great power competition,\" said Mak.</p></div><blockquote><div><p>The battlefield is changing and new technologies are needed ... warfare no longer being limited to land, sea, air.

There's also cyber and space domains that have become contested.\"</p><p>Today, some of these Silicon Valley \"neoprimes\" are developing not just weapons, but also dual-use technologies that can be applied both commercially and by militaries.</p><p>\"So things like artificial intelligence and autonomy have broad, sweeping commercial applications, but they're also clearly a force multiplier in a military context,\" said Darby. \"[The] Department of War is rapidly assessing and adopting these dual-use technologies ... they're sending signals to the investment world, to the defense industrial base, that the U.S. government needs these things.\"</p><p>That direction from the government has, in turn, provided a clear and strategic roadmap for both investors and entrepreneurs, said Mak.</p></div><h2><a></a>The 'new guard'</h2><div><p>On Sept. 17, MVA came out of stealth mode after quietly backing some leading defense tech startups since 2021.</p><p>Today, Mak says the syndicate's roughly 250 members include tech founders, Wall Street financiers, company executives, intelligence officials, former military leaders and Navy SEALs. Together, they've <a href=\"https://www.thecipherbrief.com/defense-neoprime-innovation\" target=\"_blank\">invested in companies</a> like Anduril Industries, Shield AI, Hermeus, Ursa Major and Aetherflux.</p><p>\"Overall, we believe that 'neoprimes' cannot exist in the abstract. They require people — individuals who bring technical expertise, who carry a deep sense of mission, and who contribute complementary voices and talents. Together, this coalition forms what we are convening and calling the 'new guard,'\" said Mak.</p><p>She added that modern national security requires both the \"warrior's insight on the battlefield\" and the \"builder's drive for innovation\".</p><p>\"Working together with engaged, informed patriots whose participation strengthens our defense ecosystem and reinforces the very fabric of national security,\" Mak said.</p><p>Mak and Darby both agree that as new technologies develop and make their way onto battlefields globally, it's changing the way militaries fight, which can also pose new threats.</p><p>\"You're seeing these technologists, these builders ... building defense tech, and the reason why they're doing so, is not to initiate conflict, but rather to create a credible deterrent that discourages aggression,\" said Mak.</p><p>\"No one in defense tech is looking to wage war, rather, it's looking to deter it and wanting adversaries to think twice before threatening peace and stability,\" Mak added.</p></div></div>",

That strategy was on full display after China's DeepSeek released a powerful model at the end of last year that was cheaper and faster to build than anything out of Silicon Valley.</p><p>OpenAI responded within weeks, debuting two new <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9624314-model-release-notes\" target=\"_blank\">models</a> in what was widely viewed as a defensive move to preserve its lead.</p><p>But OpenAI has a key advantage: Its growing institutional muscle.</p><p>Once a scrappy research lab in San Francisco's Mission District, the company has since become more structured, enabling it to spin up cross-functional teams more quickly and accelerate the development and deployment cycles for products like Sora.</p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/index/launching-sora-responsibly/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI said</a> Sora includes multiple layers of safeguards meant to prevent unsafe content from being generated, using prompt filtering and output moderation across video frames and audio transcripts. It bans explicit content, terrorist propaganda, and material promoting self-harm. The app also uses watermarks and bans likeness impersonation.</p><p>But some users have already found ways to skirt those protections.</p><p>Sora 2, the AI model powering OpenAI's app, is a sharp improvement over the first version.

Sentiment from Democrats, who had typically had better views of Disney before the past two weeks, soured more strongly than Republicans. Though both groups showed significant declines.</p><p>\"The last two weeks for Disney have been as eventful to say the least, and have been equally controversial,\" analyst James Heaney wrote in a Thursday note to clients. The analyst noted a recent price hike for Disney+ added to the plunging mood around the brand.</p><p>Disney became a cultural flashpoint after taking Kimmel's late-night comedy show <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html\">briefly off the air</a> in the wake of his comments about slain conservative activist <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/11/who-was-trump-ally-and-conservative-influencer-charlie-kirk.html\">Charlie Kirk</a> last month.

And then bring him back.</p><p>Critics of Disney's decision — including Democratic-leaning Hollywood power players — argued that the company was acquiescing to appease President Donald Trump's administration rather than stand up for the First Amendment right of free speech. Kimmel's show returned to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/24/jimmy-kimmel-return-ratings-abc-disney.html\">much higher viewership</a> than is typical.</p><p>A chart Heaney shared with clients of the bank's research showed the readings of positive Disney sentiment divided by negative sentient among Democrats, Republicans and all consumers plunging to near zero, the lowest readings going back to before 2024.</p><p>Disney also announced late last month it was <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/23/disney-plus-new-pricing-streaming-kimmel.html\">upping prices</a> for many of its subscriptions by $2 to $3. The new cost tiers take effect Oct. 21.</p><p>Heaney noted that Disney as a whole saw its highest brand awareness in the past two years. For Disney+ specifically, the jump was much smaller, which the analyst said bodes well from a business perspective for CEO Bob Iger.</p><p>\"This is clearly a PR hit for Disney,\" Heaney said. \"But the data implies a smaller impact on Disney+ than the brand as a whole, which may limit the amount of streaming churn.\"</p><p>Disney shares have dropped 6% over the last month, pulling the stock into the red for 2025. But Heaney reaffirmed his buy rating and $144 price target, which implies nearly 30% upside over Wednesday's close.</p></div></div>",

Clary | Afp | Getty Images</p></div><div><p>PIMCO President Christian Stracke is upbeat on the asset-based finance segment of the private credit market, but warns of \"cracks\" in corporate direct lending, which makes up the bulk of the sector.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/chery-kang/\">Speaking with CNBC's </a>Chery Kang at the annual Milken Asia Summit in Singapore Wednesday, Stracke highlighted the widening gap between the two lending spheres.</p><p>\"There are problems [in corporate private credit] where borrowers are going to their lenders and saying, 'Can I not pay you cash interest now, but basically borrow the interest from you and pay it later?' It's called Payment-in-Kind [PIK], and it's fairly prevalent right now,\" Stracke said.</p></div><h2><a></a>Balance sheet divergence</h2><div><p>He referred to asset-based financing as a \"much healthier\" credit environment.</p><p>\"In asset-based financing — residential mortgages, consumer loans, student loans and auto loans — the economy is strong, households are strong, the consumer is strong, and we really aren't seeing cracks that way,\" he added.</p><p>The widening gap stems from the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which saw consumer borrowers scale back their borrowing and deleverage their household balance sheets, which has helped boost asset-based financing activity. Corporate borrowers, in contrast, have built up their leverage and have \"less clean\" balance sheets.</p><p>In October last year, PIMCO raised more than $2 billion for asset-based specialty financing strategy as part of its continued push into private credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206130-17592796421759279639-41893235216-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759279641&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"'Real cracks' showing in the direct lending market within private credit: PIMCO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Corporate borrowers also face a trade-off in public versus private debt markets, according to Stracke.</p><p>The smaller number of lenders in private markets means it can be easier for borrowers to renegotiate loan terms in the event of loan pressure — albeit with higher costs.</p></div><h2><a></a>Unfolding opportunities</h2><div><p>More liquid bank debt, on the other hand, comes at a much lower cost, though the refinancing process can be trickier.</p><p>\"It's more difficult with a broadly syndicated bank loan or bond,\" Stracke said. \"We're seeing some real problems in the credit markets. There have been some high-profile defaults in the credit markets — in the public markets — where it's very difficult for the company to negotiate with the lenders to preserve value in the company.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, Stracke said that as the Federal Reserve continues on its path of interest rate cuts, and the overall all-in cost of borrowing comes down, particularly in mortgage rates, there will be more opportunities for PIMCO to take advantage of that demand for credit.</p></div><div><p><img src=\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108206122-17592776821759277679-41892888085-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1759277682&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y\" alt=\"We are going to see more IPOs in the first half of next year: Hostplus CEO\" /><span></span><span><div><p><span>watch now</span><span></span></p></div></span></p></div><div><p>Meanwhile, David Elia, CEO of Australian superannuation fund Hostplus, said institutional investors in search of portfolio diversification are increasingly drawn to the private markets space – but said regulation should be focused on the retail wealth space.</p><p>Elia told CNBC at the Milken Asia summit that any push for tougher regulation of private markets should center around \"mom-and-dad\" investors who are attracted to the diversifying benefits of the asset class, rather than sophisticated institutional investors.</p><p>\"There are probably about 19,000 companies that are listed on global markets. There are 140,000 private companies who generate in excess of $100 million in U.S. revenue,\" Elia said.</p><p>\"As long-term institutional investors, you will not see the level of concentration, if you're genuine about diversification, in listed markets. Therefore, it's going to drive you towards the unlisted sector, largely around private equity-style types of investments.\"</p><p>He also predicted more IPOs in the coming months.</p><p><em>— CNBC's Nicole Teo and Asriel Chua contributed to this report.</em></p></div></div>",

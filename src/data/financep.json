    "body": "The Federal Reserve announced its second consecutive cut to its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday, reducing the federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 3.75% to 4%.While this will reduce borrowing costs for loans, credit cards and auto financing, lower interest rates can also fuel inflation. And inflation is still a concern: Prices are up 3% year over year as of September — well above the Fed's target rate of 2%.So why is the Fed still cutting rates?The Fed is trying to protect jobs, which is part of its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices. And while inflation remains elevated, the labor market has been cooling in a way that could slow the economy.\"The Fed sees greater downside risk to the labor market than it sees the risk in inflation spiraling away,\" Ryan Severino, chief economist and head of U.S. research at BGO, tells CNBC Make It.Why the Fed's focus has shifted from prices to jobsIn an August speech, Powell described the labor market as being in a \"curious kind of balance,\" where both demand for workers and labor supply were weakening — an uncommon pattern that often signals the start of a labor market slowdown.Two months later, the picture hasn't improved. \"Payroll gains have slowed sharply … and the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\" he said in an Oct. 14 speech at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.While the ongoing government shutdown has delayed some U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data releases, the latest available indicators still show a job market losing momentum:Job growth has slowed to about 159,500 jobs, with monthly payroll gains barely keeping pace with population growth.Unemployment has edged up from 4.1% to 4.3% since June.Job openings have fallen to about 7.2 million, the lowest level since 2020.Labor force participation has been trending lower in 2025, with the Dallas Fed suggesting that President Trump's immigration crackdown is a factor.Wage growth has cooled to around 4.1% year over year, down from more than 5% a year ago, according to the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker — a sign the balance of power in the job market is shifting toward employers.\"The Fed is worried that layoffs will increase sooner and faster than hiring will accelerate,\" says Severino. In cutting rates, \"they are trying to head that off at the pass.\"Tariffs continue to add to price pressureThat doesn't mean inflation isn't a concern, especially with tariffs increasing costs.As of October, Yale's Budget Lab estimates that tariffs implemented in 2025 have lifted overall prices by about 1.3%, roughly equivalent to a $1,800 loss in household purchasing power.Some economists, however, view tariffs as a one-time price shock — a temporary bump that raises inflation in the short term but not necessarily in a lasting way. By lowering rates gradually, the Fed aims to contain inflation while easing pressure on the job market.As Powell put it in his October speech, there's currently no \"risk-free path\" as the Fed navigates \"the tension between our employment and inflation goals.\"In the meantime, the Fed is expected to announce another cut before the end of the year, especially if the labor market continues to weaken.The probability of either a 25- or 50-basis-point cut by January is at 93% as of Wednesday afternoon, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. By the end of 2026, the federal funds rate is expected to be closer to 3%, which would mean at least one more cut.Want to level up your AI skills? Sign up for Smarter by CNBC Make It's new online course, How To Use AI To Communicate Better At Work.

The central bank instead decreased the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or a quarter percentage point.Miran joined the Fed in September after being appointed by President Donald Trump and confirmed by the Senate. Schmid voted for the rate decrease in September, despite expressing some doubt about lowering interest rates during a CNBC interview in late August.",

    "body": "The logo and lettering of Paramount Skydance Corporation can be seen at a Paramount stand at the Media Days in Munich (Bavaria, Germany). Matthias Balk | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesParamount Skydance is slashing nearly 1,000 jobs beginning on Wednesday, just months after the close of its merger, according to a person close to the situation. The layoffs will eventually amount to 2,000 roles, the person said.\"When we launched the new Paramount in August, we made clear that building a strong, future-focused company would require significant change – including restructuring the organization,\" CEO David Ellison told employees in a memo on Wednesday morning. \"As part of that process, we must also reduce the size of our workforce, and we recognize these actions affect our most important asset: our people.\"The merger between Paramount and Skydance closed in August, weeks after receiving long-sought regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission.Shortly after the deal closed Ellison and Paramount leadership telegraphed the upcoming job cuts, and said it had identified more than $2 billion in cost synergies.In Wednesday's memo, Ellison said the cuts would address \"redundancies that have emerged across the organization,\" as well as \"phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth.\"\"Ultimately, these steps are necessary to position Paramount for long-term success,\" Ellison said in the memo. The layoffs will occur across the company, which includes CBS News, a portfolio of pay-TV networks and the film studio.Under Ellison's leadership Paramount has made a series of changes and deals since the summer — including a 7-year, $7.7 billion media rights deal for TKO Group's UFC and the acquisition of online publication The Free Press. The company has also made three takeover offers for Warner Bros. Discovery in recent weeks, CNBC previously reported.While it's the first round of layoffs for the newly merged company, Paramount had been through a series of employee cuts prior to the deal close. In 2024, Paramount's prior leadership said it would reduce its U.S.-based workforce by 15%.In June Paramount cut its U.S.-based staff by 3.5%, or several hundred employees, CNBC reported at the time.Layoffs have been hitting the media industry broadly in recent months as companies contend with the decline of the traditional pay-TV bundle and macroeconomic headwinds that have weighed on advertising revenue.— CNBC's Julia Boorstin contributed to this article.",

Revenues are expected to grow 3.5% to 4%, versus a prior estimate of 10%.During an earnings call Wednesday, Lyons said Argentina's deteriorating economic environment contributed to slowing growth and margin disappointment. Last year, the South American country contributed 10 percentage points to its 16% organic growth rate, he said.Fiserv's original growth estimate \"assumed that to compensate for the slowdown, our non-Argentinian businesses would grow significantly faster than their historical mid-single-digit range,\" he said.Adjusted earnings came in at $2.04 per share, falling short of the LSEG estimate of $2.64. Revenues rose about 1% from a year ago to $4.92 billion, missing the $5.36 billion forecast. Net income grew to $792 million from $564 million in the year-ago period.Along with the results, Fiserv announced a slew of executive and board changes.Read more CNBC tech newsApple's iPhone Air doesn't look like a best-seller.

    "body": "The Ultium Cell factory in Warren, Ohio, is shown, July 7, 2023.Gene J. Puskar | APGeneral Motors laid off roughly 1,700 workers at manufacturing sites in Michigan and Ohio on Wednesday, citing a slowdown in the electric vehicle market.The company confirmed there were around 1,200 layoffs at Detroit's electric vehicle plant and 550 cuts at Ohio's Ultium Cells battery cell plant, in addition to 850 temporary layoffs at that site in Ohio. The company also said it would temporarily lay off 700 at Ultium Cells' Tennessee plant.\"In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,\" the company said in a statement. \"Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint, and we believe our investments and dedication to flexible operations will make GM more resilient and capable of leading through change.\"GM also said battery cell production at its Ohio and Tennessee facilities will be temporarily paused beginning in January. It anticipates resuming operations at both battery cell sites by the middle of 2026 and will use the pause to upgrade its facilities.Wednesday's layoffs follow the company saying last week that it would cut more than 200 salaried employees, mostly engineers at its global tech campus in metro Detroit, as part of a restructuring effort.After September, federal incentives of up to $7,500 to purchase electric vehicles was discontinued, leaving consumers racing to use the benefit before the expiration. Though sales for plug-in vehicles soared to records for many automakers in the third quarter, that demand is expected to decline following the discontinuation.GM previously reported a more than doubling of sales for electric vehicles during the third quarter from the year prior, a trend other automakers like Ford Motor and Hyundai saw as well.\"We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, and we've got a great portfolio to be competitive, but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,\" CFO Paul Jacobson told CNBC's Phil LeBeau during \"Squawk Box\" last week.Still, GM's third-quarter results last week included a $1.6 billion impact from its all-electric vehicle plans not playing out as anticipated, signaling it was undergoing a reassessment of its EV capacity and manufacturing processes. The Detroit News first reported on the layoffs.",

Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments,\" the statement read.Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economists, believes that the Federal Reserve may take a breather from its rate-cutting cycle in the near term.\"We expect the Fed to slow the pace of cuts from here. Our view is predicated on a stabilization in labor market conditions, which is a difficult call amid the dearth of official data,\" he said. \"Our forecast is for the Fed to remain on pause over coming months and deliver three cuts at a quarterly pace in 2026.\"",

    "body": "U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary speaks during a press conference alongside U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz, discussing administration plans to lower drug costs, at the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., U.S., Oct. 29, 2025. Annabelle Gordon | ReutersThe Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday said it will take steps to speed up the process of developing generic versions of complex biological drugs, in a bid to increase cheaper competition for expensive medicines and lower drug costs for Americans. It's the Trump administration's latest move to rein in high prescription drug costs in the U.S., where medication prices are two-to-three times higher than those in other developed nations. The move to support the development and approval of so-called biosimilars could be a blow to pharmaceutical companies, whose most profitable products are often biological products that treat serious and chronic diseases. The exact impact will depend on the drugmaker and its products.The FDA's new reforms \"will take the five-to-eight year timeframe to bring a biosimilar to market and cut it in half,\" the agency's Commissioner Marty Makary said during a press conference on Wednesday.During the event, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the FDA has an \"outdated and burdensome approval process that has slowed down the entry of biosimilars.\" He said \"even when [the drugs] do get approved, current laws often prevent pharmacists or patients from substituting them for patients who would benefit from a more affordable option.\"\"That all ends today, a the FDA is taking bold, decisive action to break down these barriers and open the markets for real competition,\" Kennedy said.Biological products are engineered with living cells, which makes manufacturing more complex than for chemically derived drugs. Biologics have a special pathway to FDA approval, and it is harder for generic drug manufacturers to sell cheaper versions due to the high costs of development and difficult regulatory landscape. Biologic medications make up only 5% of prescriptions in the U.S., but account for 51% of total drug spending as of 2024, according to an FDA release. FDA-approved biosimilars are as safe and effective as their branded counterparts, yet their market share remains below 20%, the agency added. The FDA said it has so far approved 76 biosimilars, making up only a small fraction of approved biologic drugs.Kennedy said biosimilars, on average, cost half the price of their branded counterparts. Their entry into the market drives down brand-name drug prices by another 25%, which is a \"real relief for patients,\" he added. Biosimilar generics saved $20 billion in U.S. health-care costs last year alone, the FDA said.In a new draft guidance, the FDA proposed major updates to simplify biosimilar studies. For example, the agency recommended that human studies directly comparing the biosimilar to a branded product may not be necessary for drug companies to conduct. That research takes years and costs tens of millions of dollars. Biosimilars have historically struggled to gain market share from their branded counterparts compared to generic copies of small-molecule drugs, which are often delivered in pill form and can enter cells easily because it has a low molecular weight.The difference is that many biosimilars aren't identical copies of branded biologic drugs, while generics are. In many cases, pharmacists can't directly substitute a branded biologic for a biosimilar when filling a prescription unless they are classified as \"interchangeable\" and it is permitted by state law. But the FDA on Wednesday said it generally recommends against requiring so-called \"switching studies,\" which determine whether biosimilars have that classification. That step is not required for generic copies of small-molecule drugs. \"These additional studies can slow development and create public confusion about biosimilar safety,\" the FDA said in a release.",

    "body": "US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference at the end of a Monetary Policy Committee meeting in Washington, DC, on Oct. 29, 2025. Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesThe Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved its second straight interest rate cut, though Chair Jerome Powell rattled markets when he threw doubt on whether another reduction is coming in December.By a 10-2 vote, the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee lowered its benchmark overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75%-4%. In addition to the rate move, the Fed announced that it would be ending the reduction of its asset purchases – a process known as quantitative tightening – on Dec 1.Governor Stephen Miran again cast a dissenting vote, preferring the Fed move more quickly with a half-point cut. Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid joined Miran in dissenting but for the opposite reason – he preferred the Fed not cut at all. Miran is an appointee of President Donald Trump, who has pushed hard on the committee to lower rates quickly.The rate also sets a benchmark for a variety of consumer products such as auto loans, mortgages and credit cards.The post-meeting statement did not provide any direction on what the committee's plans are for December. At the September meeting, officials indicated the likelihood of three total cuts this year. The Fed meets once more in December.Powell, however, cautioned against assuming that a rate cut is a sure thing at the next meeting.\"In the committee's discussions at this meeting, there were strongly differing views about how to proceed in December,\" Powell said during his post-meeting news conference. \"A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a foregone conclusion. Far from it.\"He later added that there is \"a growing chorus\" among the 19 Fed officials to \"at least wait a cycle\" before cutting again. Traders lowered odds for a December cut to 67% from 90% a day ago, according to the CME Group's FedWatch.Stocks, which had been higher after the initial decision was released, turned lower on the chair's comments. Major averages slowly came back during the session with reporters.The reduction came even though the Fed essentially has been flying blind lately on economic data.Other than the consumer price index release last week, the government has suspended all data collection and reports, meaning such key measures as nonfarm payrolls, retail sales and a plethora of other macro data is unavailable.In the post-meeting statement, the committee acknowledged the uncertainty accompanying the lack of data, qualifying the way it categorized broad economic conditions.\"Available indicators suggest that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace. Job gains have slowed this year, and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low through August; more recent indicators are consistent with these developments,\" the statement said. \"Inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remains somewhat elevated.\"Each of those characterizations represented tweaks from the September statement. The most significant change was the view on broad economic activity. In September, the FOMC said activity had moderated.The statement reiterated concerns that policymakers have over the labor market, saying that \"downside risks to employment rose in recent months.\"Even before the shutdown, evidence had begun to build that while layoffs have been contained, the pace of hiring had flattened. At the same time, inflation has held considerably above the Fed's 2% annual goal. The CPI report last week, released because of its importance to Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, showed the annual rate at 3%, pushed by higher energy costs as well as several items with direct or indirect links to Trump's tariffs.The Fed tries to strike a balance between full employment and stable prices. Officials lately, though, have said they see a slightly higher risk posed by the jobs picture. Along with the interest rate decision, the Fed said its process of reducing the amount of bonds it holds on the central bank's $6.6 trillion balance sheet will end.The program, also known as QT, had shaved some $2.3 trillion off the Fed's portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Instead of reinvesting maturing proceeds from the securities, the Fed has been allowing them to roll off the balance sheet at a limited level each month. However, recent signs of some tightening in short-term lending markets have raised concern that the roll-off has gone far enough.An implementation note accompanying the decision indicated the Fed will be rolling proceeds from maturing mortgage securities into shorter-term bills.Markets recently had begun anticipating that the Fed would end QT either in October or by the end of the year. The Fed expanded its holdings during the Covid crisis, pushing the balance sheet from just over $4 trillion to close to $9 trillion. Powell has said that while the Fed found it necessary to shrink its holdings, he did not foresee a return to pre-pandemic levels.In fact, Evercore ISI analyst Krishna Guha said he could foresee a scenario where the Fed actually restarts the purchases early in 2026 for \"organic growth purposes\" as market conditions shift. The Fed rarely eases monetary policy during economic expansions and bull markets in stocks. Major averages, though volatile, have been posting a series of record highs, boosted by further gains in Big Tech stocks and a robust earnings season.History has shown that the market continues to rise when the Fed does cut under such circumstances. However, easier policy also poses the risk of higher inflation, a condition that forced the Fed into a series of aggressive rate hikes.Correction: This story has been updated to correct that Jeffrey Schmid is president of the Kansas City Fed, and that the Fed raised interest rates following an inflation spike.",

    "body": "A man holds a sign reading \"SNAP Feeds Families,\" as food aid benefits will be suspended starting November 1 amid the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, during \"A Rally for SNAP\" on the steps of the Massachusetts Statehouse in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., October 28, 2025.   Brian Snyder | ReutersNearly 42 million Americans are days away from missing their monthly food stamp check as the government shutdown enters its 28th day.The Trump administration has said funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will not be distributed if the federal government is still shut down on Nov. 1. With little movement toward a resolution on Capitol Hill, Congress appears set to blow past that deadline.The expiration of aid would have a devastating effect on millions of households already struggling to afford food, and force people across the country to seek help at food banks. The lapse in that spending would also have a ripple effect on the economy, from small grocers to massive chains like Walmart and even retailers that sell discretionary merchandise.There will be \"an immediate effect on the purchasing mix\" toward lower profit margin groceries and household staples, and the potential for more theft as food budgets dry up, Wolfe Research analyst Spencer Hanus wrote in a note to investors Monday. Consumer confidence among lower-income Americans could also take a hit heading into the holiday season, Hanus said.SNAP recipients received an average of about $187 per month in fiscal 2024, according to government data. Among those beneficiaries, 73% live below the poverty line, which is currently $32,150 or less for a family of four.Following years of high food inflation and other recent hits to the size of government benefits, the loss of that assistance would be a massive blow to many low-income Americans.Consumers who use SNAP benefits to pay for groceries spend more, and shop more often, than other shoppers, according to data from Numerator. On average, a SNAP beneficiary spends $832 per month on groceries, 20% more than a non-SNAP shopper, though the amount spent on each trip averages 12% less, or about $20.80 per outing, the market research company said. SNAP shoppers visit more retailers per month at 6.6, compared to 6.1 for people who don't receive the aid, according to Numerator.Hanus said his firm is seeing Google search interest for \"food banks\" and \"food stamps\" surge as SNAP beneficiaries look for alternatives. While there is often a spike in interest in those terms around Thanksgiving, he said \"it is up materially year over year, implying that this consumer is feeling a shock here.\"The potential loss of aid from the shutdown is the second recent hit to government food assistance programs for lower-income Americans. The One Big Beautiful Act legislation passed by Republicans this year cuts SNAP benefits by an estimated 20%.Hanus estimates the spending changes in the bill equate to a 1.5% to 2% hit to retail industry sales.The retailers most reliant on SNAP benefit spendingA person shops at a Dollar General store on May 28, 2025 in Chicago, Illinois. Scott Olson | Getty ImagesWhile there are different ways to consider how a lapse in SNAP benefits could impact retailers, grocers will likely take a hit. And the effects could reach employees.\"Often, grocers' staffing and inventory are planned around benefit cycles, so a lapse could lead to reduced employee hours, perishable food losses, and declining sales,\" industry group the National Grocers Association said in a statement. \"Furthermore, when benefits are restored, the resulting surge in demand could strain supply chains nationwide.\"Numerator data shows Walmart, Dollar General and Dollar Tree are more likely to cater to SNAP shoppers, while Target, Costco and Amazon-owned Whole Foods are less likely. Hanus estimates a high-single digit percent of Walmart's sales are related to SNAP, while Dollar General and Dollar Tree are in the mid-single digits.But SNAP users spend the most annually on groceries at Walmart, followed by Kroger and Costco, according to Numerator.Customers enter a Walmart store on April 09, 2025 in San Leandro, California.Justin Sullivan | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesWalmart is the country's largest retailer, and its largest grocer. It also captures significantly more SNAP grocery spending than competitors, Numerator found. More than 94% of SNAP shoppers have bought food there in the past year, with an average annual spend of $2,653, or 26% of the cohort's annual grocery spending.Just under half, or 48.8%, of all SNAP recipients shopped at Kroger in the past year, spending an average $1,687.67 annually, or 8.6% of the group's total yearly grocery spend.While it requires a membership to shop, Costco takes the third spot for where SNAP users buy groceries by average annual spend at $1,482.98. Walmart-owned membership club Sam's Club captures the fourth spot for share of spend at 3.8% and does offer discounted memberships for new members who verify participation on a government assistance plan.Walmart referred CNBC to the National Retail Federation, which said cutting off funding for food aid \"creates a crisis for millions of American families.\" Albertsons referred CNBC to the Food Industry Association, which called on Congress to reopen the government and \"ensure that these vital programs remain dependable for those who have to rely on them to get them through a difficult time.\"Costco declined to comment. Kroger, Dollar General, Dollar Tree, Amazon and Whole Foods did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In all, 3.6% of U.S. in-store grocery trips paid using the government's SNAP or Women, Infants and Children benefits in 2025 through September, which is down from 3.9% in 2024, according to Numerator. That share has fallen from the pandemic peak of 6.5% in November 2021, when there was an additional emergency allotment. However, more grocery trips are funded with SNAP benefits now than pre-pandemic, when between 2.2% and 2.8% of groceries were purchased under the program in all of the months between February 2019 and February 2020.The impact beyond groceryIf SNAP funding expires, recipients may buy less of other goods, too.\"Fewer dollars in the consumers' wallet forces a reallocation of discretionary dollars towards food and more tepid spending overall,\" said Wells Fargo equity analyst Edward Kelly in a note to investors last week. He noted that retailers reporting earnings in November may say they have seen weaker discretionary spending during that month due to the food assistance expiration.While there has never been a time when the federal government has not come up with a contingency for SNAP funding during shutdowns, states are beginning to step in. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is working on $30 million in aid for impacted New Yorkers. Plus, missed SNAP benefits should be paid in arrears once the government reopens — though it's unknown when that will be. \"We'd expect an eventual resolution of the government shutdown, which could mean a windfall for low-end consumers into peak shopping season as missed payments are made up,\" Kelly said.",

    "body": "A Boeing 777x is displayed during the International Paris Air Show at the Paris-Le Bourget Airport on June 20, 2023.Geoffroy Van Der Hasselt | AFP | Getty ImagesBoeing said Wednesday its jetliner deliveries drove it back into cash-positive territory for the first time in nearly two years, but it took a $4.9 billion charge on additional delays of its long-awaited 777X wide-body plane.Boeing is on track to deliver the most aircraft this year since 2018, before two crashes grounded its bestselling jetliner, the Covid pandemic hit supply chains and a host of manufacturing crises drove years of losses at the top U.S. exporter.everyCEO Kelly Ortberg, an aerospace veteran who came out of retirement to helm Boeing in August 2024, has worked to steady the manufacturer's sprawling supply chain and cash-generating production lines.The 777X, an updated version of its 777 plane, took its first flight nearly six years ago but still hasn't won regulator approval. Boeing said it now expects the first delivery in 2027, leading to the noncash charge.Boeing CFO Jay Malave told analysts that questioned why the charge on the program was so high that slower production rates and holding onto planes longer for rework added to costs.\"The team is just not going to sit here and take this lightly and hasn't taken it lightly,\" Malave said. \"They are focused — we are all focused on doing everything we can to improve the long-term productivity on this program, while also working to mitigate the total delay impact to our customers the best we can.\"Boeing shares were down roughly 4% in early afternoon trading, though they were still up more than 20% so far this year.A Boeing 777x aircraft during an aerial display on the opening day of the Farnborough International Airshow in Farnborough, UK, on Monday, July 18, 2022.Jason Alden | Bloomberg | Getty Images\"While there's still more work to do to advance our development programs, particularly on our commercial development and certification programs, we're seeing positive signs across our business, and I'm proud of how we are coming together to turn our company around,\" Ortberg said in a staff note.Still, Boeing generated free cash flow of $238 million, its first time in the black on that metric since late 2023.The company lost $4.78 billion, or $7.14 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. That's better than a $5.76 billion loss a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company reported a loss of $7.47 a share. Revenue jumped 30% to $23.27 billion for the third quarter, up from $17.84 billion a year ago and ahead of analysts' estimates.A year ago, Boeing machinists were on strike in a contract impasse that crippled production at the majority of the company's commercial airplane factories.Here's how Boeing performed for the third quarter compared with analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG:Loss per share: $7.47 per share adjusted vs. a loss of $4.59 expectedRevenue: $23.27 billion vs. $21.97 billion expectedAirline customers have said they've seen an improvement at Boeing, with more accurate delivery projections, a change in tune from the complaints of prior years.In the first nine months of the year, Boeing delivered 440 airplanes, up from 291 in the same period last year. Airlines and other customers pay for the bulk of the planes when they receive them, so increasing the delivery pace is key for Boeing to stem an outflow of cash totaling close to $17 billion since the start of 2024 through June of this year.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom. Can it catch up?Boeing gets FAA approval to hike 737 Max outputAir traffic control shortages add to U.S. flight delays, FAA saysSpirit wins court approval for a $475 million bankruptcy lifelineLast year was supposed to be a turnaround year for Boeing, but a midair blowout of a door panel in January 2024 resulted in a near catastrophe and increased federal scrutiny that slowed production.But Boeing has made progress. Earlier this month, the Federal Aviation Administration lifted a production cap for Boeing's 737 Max to 42 a month from 38, a restriction it put in place after the accident. Ortberg said the company will increase production beyond that level when it has FAA approval.The FAA is also now allowing Boeing to perform final sign-offs on some of its aircraft, a sign of increased confidence from its regulator.Boeing's commercial unit revenue rose 49% from a year earlier to $11.09 billion, though it still had negative operating margins. Its defense unit generated $6.9 billion, up 25% from last year in the third quarter, with a 1.7% operating margin, while its profitable global services business brought in nearly $5.4 billion, a 10% increase.The company isn't out of the woods. Its Max 7 and Max 10 variants and the 777X are years behind schedule.\"Pencils are down from a design perspective\" on an anti-icing system for the two Max variants, the largest and smallest of the family, Ortberg told CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" on Wednesday. \"We know what hardware and software changes are needed to the airplane.\"He said Boeing is now working through certification with the FAA.Additionally, about 3,200 of its defense unit workers who make F-15 fighter jets and missile systems have been on strike since the summer as the two sides have yet to reach a new contract.",

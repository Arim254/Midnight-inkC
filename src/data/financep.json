    "body": "Brex co-founders Pedro Franceschi and Henrique Dubugras.BrexCapital One said Thursday that it was acquiring payments startup Brex for $5.15 billion, the latest splashy deal undertaken by the bank's CEO, Richard Fairbank.The firm, which disclosed the deal in its fourth-quarter earnings statement, said the deal is made up of 50% cash and 50% stock. Brex was previously valued at $12.3 billion. Shares of the bank fell about 3%.Under Fairbank, a rare founder-CEO of a major U.S. bank, Capital One acquired rival card firm Discover Financial last year for about $35 billion. That deal was Fairbank's crowning achievement, giving the credit card lender access to one of the only payment networks of any scale. \"Since our founding, we set out to build a payments company at the frontier of the technology revolution,\" Fairbank said in a release. \"Acquiring Brex accelerates this journey, especially in the business payments marketplace.\"Fairbank said that Brex pioneered the combination of corporate cards, banking and spend management software: \"They have taken the rarest of journeys for a fintech, building a vertically integrated platform from the bottom of the tech stack to the top.\"Still, the more than 50% decline in valuation for Brex from its 2023 level shows the headwinds that even successful fintech companies have encountered. Brex is among a class of fintech firms that rose to prominence during a period of low interest rates; it was known initially as a startup that made loans to other startups via its cards.But the company expanded beyond technology into other sectors and now services larger established firms and startups alike, including Robinhood, Zoom and Anthropic. Capital One, which has offered business credit cards for decades, became increasingly convinced that it was Brex's model that would be the winning offering, according to a person with knowledge of the lender's strategy. \"We didn't have to pursue this acquisition, our growth was incredibly strong,\" Brex CEO Pedro Franceschi told CNBC in an interview.Combining Brex's technology with Capital One's reach and resources would grow the startup's scale faster than as a standalone firm, he said.",

Fabrice Coffrini | Afp | Getty ImagesBEIJING — Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang plans to visit China in the coming days ahead of the mid-February Lunar New Year, two people familiar with the matter told CNBC. The trip comes as questions persist over the U.S. chip giant's ability to sell in the Chinese market, which once accounted for at least one-fifth of revenue from Nvidia's data center business.U.S. export restrictions have prevented Nvidia from selling its most advanced chips to China as Washington seeks to maintain an edge over Beijing in chips used to develop cutting-edge artificial intelligence.Huang is expected to attend an Nvidia company party in Beijing on Monday, said one of the sources, who requested anonymity to speak about the trip.He is also set to meet with potential buyers in China and discuss recent logistical challenges in supplying U.S.-approved Nvidia chips into the market, according to a person with direct knowledge of the travel plans. The Information reported last week, citing sources, that China would only approve local purchases of Nvidia's H200 AI chips for limited purposes such as research. When asked about the report Thursday, China's Commerce Ministry claimed it was unaware of the situation. Bloomberg first reported news of Huang's China trip earlier this week. Nvidia declined to comment on executive travel plans. Huang visited mainland China at least three times last year, including in January for Lunar New Year celebrations. \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\t",

    "body": "LONDON — European markets opened lower on Friday as investors digest events at Davos, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's excoriating speech about the continent. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was 0.16% in the red at the opening bell in London.European stocks finished higher on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said a \"framework\" agreement had been reached over Greenland, and called off imposing escalating tariffs on a group of European countries.It comes after intense speculation of tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. business leaders welcomed Europe's tougher stance with Trump amid news of the framework. JP Morgan EMEA co-CEO Conor Hillery said it was \"very good for business.\"Zelenskyy, however criticized European leaders' response to geopolitical threats in his speech at the WEF in Davos. He accused Europe of being \"lost\" while trying to convince Trump to \"change\" and support it, rather than uniting to defend itself.Zelenskyy also said there would be trilateral meetings in the United Arab Emirates on Friday and Saturday between Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. over ending the war in his country.Investors will be taking note of who is on the \"Board of Peace,\" chaired by Trump, which was originally designed to oversee the demilitarization and rebuilding of Gaza. Trump, however, said he sees the board taking on a role that could rival the United Nations, causing alarm among several U.S. allies. Trump rescinded Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to join overnight.Trump also said that the U.S. has an \"armada\" headed in Iran's direction amid a brutal government crackdown on protesters in the oil-producing state.\"We have a lot of ships going that direction, just in case …I'd rather not see anything happen, but we're watching them very closely,\" Trump told reporters on board Air Force One. March futures for the benchmark Brent crude moved 0.5% higher Friday.On companies, Ericsson said in filings that it has planned a 15 billion Swedish krona ($1.7 billion) buyback scheme. The Swedish telecoms giant reported 12.26 billion krona in adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, excluding restructuring costs, for the final quarter of 2025. It comes in higher than a forecast of 10.09 billion krona, according to an Infront poll cited by Reuters.Stockholm-listed shares in the company popped at the open, gaining almost 11%.Börje Ekholm, president and CEO, said in a statement that he expected the radio access network to be flat in 2026. \"Mission critical and enterprise markets, where we are well positioned, are expected to grow. In this environment, we plan to increase investments in defense during 2026 while continuing to optimize our cost base to support margins and cash flow generation,\" he added. Ubisoft shares plunged as much as 34% on Thursday after announcing a major restructuring and cancelling six games. The Assassin's Creed maker said it expected to make an operating loss of around 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion) in the financial year ending 2026, following a 650 million euro write-down caused by the restructuring, and is considering selling some assets.Market watchers will also be paying attention to a looming Supreme Court decision over Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, putting the central bank's independence back into focus. Following arguments this week, Cook appears to be safe.Asia-Pacific markets rose Friday, tracking Wall Street gains from the previous session as geopolitical concerns eased and investors assessed the Bank of Japan's decision to keep interest rates steady. Futures linked to the S&P 500 traded higher Thursday night after the major averages posted back-to-back gains.— CNBC's Hugh Leask and Lucy Handley contributed to this report. ",

    "body": "The Intel logo is displayed on a sign in front of Intel headquarters on Jan. 22, 2026 in Santa Clara, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesIntel reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations but offered soft guidance for the current quarter.Shares of the company were down as much as 13% in after-hours trading. Here's how the chipmaker did compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Earnings per share: 15 cents adjusted vs. 8 cents expectedRevenue: $13.7 billion vs. $13.4 billion expectedIntel said it expected first-quarter revenue between $11.7 billion and $12.7 billion, and breakeven adjusted earnings per share. That came in below LSEG expectations of 5 cents earnings per share on $12.51 billion in sales. Finance chief David Zinsner told CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos that the company's soft guidance in the first quarter was partially because the company doesn't have the supply it needs for seasonal demand, and that supply would improve in the second quarter this year. On a call with analysts, CEO Lip-Bu Tan said that the company was looking to improve its production efficiency, called yield, in order to improve supply of the company's products. \"Our yields are in line with our internal plans,\" Tan said. \"They are still below what I want them to be.\"The company said it had a net loss of $600 million, or 12 cents per diluted share. In the year-ago period, Intel reported a net loss of $100 million, or 3 cents per share. Investor expectations were high for Intel heading into the report, with the stock up 147% in the past year. The rally has been driven by optimism that Intel may be on the cusp of securing its first major anchor customer for its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies.Tan said earlier this month that the company's 18A manufacturing technology — competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's 2nm technology — \"over-delivered\" in 2025. That suggests that the technology is mature enough to start volume production of products, such as Intel's own Core Ultra Series 3 central processor. In a statement, Tan said that Intel was \"working aggressively\" to increase 18A supply to meet \"strong customer demand.\"Zinsner told CNBC that customers for Intel's next-generation 14A technology would show up in the second half of the year. Zinsner added that the company was unlikely to announce customers in general. \"Once we get them, we're gonna need to start really spending capital on the 14A front, and that's how you'll know,\" Zinsner said. Intel said its foundry had $4.5 billion in revenue, although some of that is accounting for making the company's own chips. There is also optimism tied to strong sales of Intel's latest server chips, which analysts say are seeing a sales boom because of increased spending on infrastructure for artificial intelligence. Tan said in a statement Thursday that Intel's central processing units were becoming more important because of systems built for artificial intelligence. Revenue from those chips is reported as Data Center and AI sales, which totaled $4.7 billion in revenue during the quarter, up 9% on an annual basis. Chips for laptops are reported as Client Computing Group sales. The product category was down 7% on a year-over-year basis to $8.2 billion in sales. During 2025, the U.S. government, SoftBank and Nvidia made big investments into the chipmaker, all becoming major shareholders. Intel said that its sale of stock to Nvidia worth $5 billion was completed during the quarter. WATCH: Can Intel's New Arizona Chip Fab Bring It Back From The Brink?watch now",

    "body": "The TikTok USDS (U.S. Data Security) logo appears on a smartphone screen in this illustration photo in Reno, United States, on Dec. 19, 2025.Jaque Silva | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump and TikTok said Thursday that the company had formed a joint venture to keep the video-sharing app operating in the U.S. under new American leadership.The company said Adam Presser, who has been serving as TikTok's head of operations and trust and safety, will be the CEO of TikTok USDS Joint Venture. Presser has worked at TikTok for almost four years and was previously a senior executive at Warner Bros.  TikTok CEO Shou Chew will be a director of the newly formed venture, which will run as an \"independent entity,\" according to Thursday's announcement. TikTok USDS Joint Venture \"will operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for U.S. users,\" the company said.Trump hailed the deal in a Truth Social post on Thursday, stating that the company would now be owned by a \"group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World.\" He also thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for working with his administration, and \"ultimately, approving the Deal.\"\"He could have gone the other way, but didn't, and is appreciated for his decision,\" Trump wrote. China has not issued an official statement confirming the agreement.  According to TikTok, the new venture will be governed by a seven-member board of directors, the majority of whom are American. In addition to Chew, the board is comprised of TPG Global's Timothy Dattels, Susquehanna International Group's Mark Dooley, Silver Lake co-CEO Egon Durban, DXC Technology CEO Raul Fernandez, Oracle's Kenneth Glueck, and MGX's David Scott.ByteDance, the Chinese parent of TikTok, will retain 19.9% of the new venture. Silver Lake, Oracle and MGX are the new managing investors. Other backers include Michael Dell's investment firm, Vastmere Strategic Investments, Alpha Wave Partners, Revolution, and General Atlantic affiliate Via Nova.ByteDance was subject to a national security law, originally signed by former President Joe Biden, that required the company to sell its U.S. operations or be effectively banned in the country. That law was never enacted due to several executive orders signed by President Donald Trump last year.Those orders kept the attorney general from enforcing the national security law while the app's leaders searched for a buyer.\"Interoperability enables the Joint Venture to provide U.S. users with a global TikTok experience, ensuring U.S. creators can be discovered and businesses can operate on a global scale,\" the company said. \"TikTok global's U.S. entities will manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing.\"TikTok's prized content-recommendation algorithm will now be hosted within Oracle's American data centers, and it will be retrained, tested and updated on U.S. user data, the company said. The new structure also helps keep sibling apps like CapCut, Lemon8 and other unspecified services and websites operational in America, the statement said.Although the Chinese government hasn't commented publicly on the deal, Semafor reported earlier on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter, that the U.S. and Chinese governments have signed off on the sale, and that the deal was set to close this week.President Trump said in September that Chinese President Xi Jinping had agreed to move forward with the proposed deal that was codified that month via an executive order. At the time, U.S. Vice President JD Vance said there was \"some resistance\" from the Chinese government to support the deal, which he said would value TikTok's U.S. business at $14 billion.Chew revealed the name of TikTok's U.S. entity to employees in December and said it signed an agreement to form a new U.S. joint venture, CNBC reported.WATCH: TikTok signs agreement to create new U.S. joint venture:watch now— CNBC's Dylan Butts contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Some renters will soon be able to pay their rent using a buy now, pay later plan through financial technology company Affirm, which offers installment-based payment plans for consumers at a wide variety of retailers.Affirm will partner with fintech company Esusu to provide renters with \"a flexible option for managing one of their largest monthly expenses,\" an Affirm spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNBC Make It. Esusu offers memberships starting at $10 a month for services to help users build credit, including reporting rent payments to credit agencies. Eligible renters will be able to use Affirm through Esusu to pay their rent in two equal, biweekly payments with 0% interest and no late fees, the spokesperson said. The offering is rolling out through a pilot program, and the companies have not yet announced a launch date. Esusu's recently launched split pay option already allows its plus and premium membership subscribers to break up rent payments throughout the month after an initial down payment, according to its website. The partnership with Affirm will give Esusu members another option to split their rent into two payments. Plus and premium memberships, which cost $35 and $50 a month, respectively, are only available to residents at Esusu-partnered properties, according to its website.Nationally, rents in the U.S. were up about 3% in December 2025 compared with the previous year, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. And nearly half of all renters spent more than the recommended 30% of their income on housing costs in 2023, according to the most recent Census Bureau American Community Survey 1-year estimates.A new payment option won't solve the 'underlying affordability issue'Some financial experts are skeptical of using buy now, pay later plans for fixed costs like monthly rent.Using a buy now, pay later plan for rent \"could be useful in a true pinch or short-term emergency,\" says Chris Jackson, a certified financial planner based in South Carolina. However, \"relying on it consistently would be a mistake, particularly for people who already struggle keeping up with rent payments.\"Borrowing to cover your rent won't solve the \"underlying affordability issue,\" he adds. Douglas Boneparth, a CFP, founder of Bone Fide Wealth and member of CNBC's financial advisor council, encourages anyone struggling to pay rent to work directly with their landlord to work out a payment agreement, rather than turning to a lender.Boneparth has previously criticized installment plans for encouraging overspending and targeting consumers \"who are most susceptible to borrowing when they shouldn't,\" he wrote on LinkedIn in 2025. Using buy now, pay later plans for rent could be a \"slippery slope\" that has consumers \"falling into traps of fiscal irresponsibility,\" he says.Outside of temporary hardships or broader socio-economic conditions, \"we have to get down to those fundamentals and put yourself in a position to afford your lifestyle,\" Boneparth says.Affirm's spokesperson said the new offer will be \"a transparent option that offers flexibility for renters to align expenses with their paychecks.\" They added, \"We underwrite every application individually and we only approve people for what we believe they can responsibly afford to repay.\"Want to get ahead at work with AI?

    "body": "An employee at the Celsior Wadamachi supermarket in Yokohama, Japan, on Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026. Soaring food costs are a key component driving broader inflation higher, with data Friday expected to show consumer price growth has stayed above the central bank's 2% target for four straight calendar years. Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's headline inflation rate slowed sharply to 2.1%, its lowest level since March 2022, down from 2.9% in November, as easing price pressures collide with political focus on living costs and a looming central bank decision.This was the 45th straight month that the inflation figure has been above the Bank of Japan's 2% target. Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food, stood at 2.4%, in line with analysts' estimates and its lowest level since October 2024. That was sharply lower than November's 3%.The so-called \"core-core\" inflation rate — which strips out prices for fresh food and energy — eased to 2.9% from 3% a month earlier.Japan's full-year inflation stood at 3.2%, according to government data. Inflation hit a two-year high in January 2025, before tapering down over the course of the year.However, Japan saw rice inflation hit its highest in over 50 years in May, and rice prices soared to record highs then. Rice inflation for December came in at 34.4%, marking the seventh straight month of decline from a year ago. Despite that, rice prices in Japan remain near record levels. Data from Japan's agriculture ministry showed the average price of a 5-kilogram bag of rice was at 4,267 yen for the week ended Jan. 11. Back in 2025, soaring rice prices and careless comments cost then farm minister Taku Eto his job and reportedly prompted former prime minister Shigeru Ishiba to take personal responsibility for lowering prices as a rice shortage took hold. \"Goods inflation in Japan is still the main driver of inflation,\" Marcel Theliant, Head of Asia Pacific at Capital Economics, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Friday. He noted that in 2025, import prices slowed as the yen strengthened, but they have since stopped falling. \"So it's possible [that] goods inflation probably remains higher for longer, and that will keep inflation above the BOJ's target for longer.\"This would possibly prompt an interest rate hike as soon as April, Theliant said.Snap electionThe data comes as Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi dissolved Japan's Lower House on Friday ahead of a snap election scheduled for Feb. 8.Takaichi has made tackling the cost of living a priority and has vowed to suspend Japan's 8% food tax for 2 years to help households with rising living costs.Last year, her government put together a massive $135 billion stimulus package for the country, which included measures to expand local government grants, as well as provide subsidies for electricity and gas bills.Separately, the Bank of Japan slightly raised its inflation forecast for the 2026 fiscal year to 1.9% from 1.8% and held its policy rate at 0.75%.— CNBC's Martin Soong, Chery Kang and Kaori Enjoji contributed to this report.

    "body": "Packages of Pampers diapers are displayed at a Target store on June 05, 2025 in Novato, California. Justin Sullivan | Getty ImagesProcter & Gamble is selling diapers made with silk fibers in China as part of the company's strategy to entice shoppers to spend more, even as demand for some of its products wanes.China is the company's second-largest market, trailing only the United States. In both markets, P&G has turned to innovation, rather than discounts, to attract consumers who are otherwise trying to spend less at the grocery store. For example, last year, it unveiled a new formula for its liquid Tide detergent in the U.S. In China, P&G also faces another challenge: a record-low birth rate. Government data released Monday showed that births dropped to 5.6 per 1,000 people in 2025, down from 6.4 in 2023. For P&G, fewer babies means the company is selling fewer diapers. To boost the sales of its baby-care division, P&G is leaning into luxury.Executives touted the success of the Pampers Prestige product on the company's earnings conference call Thursday. It added silk fibers to the inside of the diaper for skin comfort and protection.\"Chinese parents want only the best for their baby,\" P&G CEO Shailesh Jejurikar said.He added that \"reframing\" the company's super-premium diaper line has fueled double-digit organic sales growth and a 3% market share increase for P&G's baby-care business in Greater China over the last 18 months. The company did not share how the pricing of Pampers Prestige compares with its other diaper lines in China.In the latest quarter, P&G's overall baby-care division reported single-digit organic sales declines, despite a 20% jump in organic sales in Greater China, according to CFO Andre Schulten.More broadly, the focus on innovation is paying off for P&G. Consumer sentiment in China is still negative, yet P&G saw 3% growth in the market in the latest quarter, Schulten said on a call with reporters on Thursday.Stateside, P&G's sales were weaker. Organic sales in North America fell 2% in its fiscal second quarter. P&G is hoping that the strategy that is working in China could soon pay off in the U.S. The current bifurcated — or \"K-shaped\" — economy has showed that wealthier Americans are still willing to flex their purchasing power, even as lower-income shoppers pull back. Shares of P&G rose more than 2% in morning trading Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. However, P&G's revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations, hurt by weaker demand in the U.S.",

    "body": "DAVOS, SWITZERLAND - JANUARY 20: Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney delivers a speech at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland on January 20, 2026.Anadolu | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the invitation to Canada to join his \"Board of Peace,\" days after Prime Minister Mark Carney's address in Davos warning against economic coersion by the world's superpowers.   \"Dear Prime Minister Carney: Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada's joining,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Thursday night stateside. Carney said last week that he intended to join the board but details, including financial terms, had yet to be worked out. States looking for a permanent seat need to pay $1 billion.In his speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, earlier this week, Carney said the world's \"middle powers\" must band together to resist coercion from the world's largest powers. \"Great powers have begun using economic integration as weapons. Tariffs as leverage, financial infrastructure as coercion, supply chains as vulnerabilities to be exploited,\" he said. While Carney did not name any country, Trump responded later, saying on the sidelines of the forum that \"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.\" Hours before Carney's speech, Trump had posted on social media a digitally-altered image of a map with Greenland, Venezuela and Canada covered with American flag.  Recent events have shown that \"the rules-based international order\" is effectively dead, while the world's superpowers \"pursue their interests using economic integration as a weapon of coercion,\" Carney said in his speech.  Relations between the two longstanding allies have come under heavy strain in Trump's second term, who has referred to the neighboring country as the U.S.' 51st state, besides targeting it with tariffs. U.S. President Donald Trump (R) meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House on October 07, 2025 in Washington, DC. Anna Moneymaker | Getty ImagesThe \"Board of Peace,\" chaired by Trump, was originally conceived to oversee the demilitarization and rebuilding of Gaza strip after a two-year war with Israel. But Trump said he foresees the board to take a wider role that could ultimately rival the United Nations, a remit that has alarmed several U.S. allies. Trump has garnered the support from regional Middle East countries including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as emerging economies such as Indonesia. But several global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy and some have rejected the proposal. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper reportedly said that it \"won't be one of the signatories\" citing concerns over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invitation to join.  Russia and China are among those invited to join the board. Putin reportedly told the Russian security council that the foreign ministry was still studying the proposal while China has not confirmed whether it will join. Carney's WEF address followed his high-profile visit to China last week, where he reached a wide-ranging agreement with President Xi Jinping to reduce tariffs and rebuild ties. As part of the deal, Beijing cut tariffs on a number of agricultural products from Canada while Ottawa increased the quotas for imports of Chinese electric vehicles into its market with the most-favored-nation tariff rate of 6.1%. Carney hailed his strategic partnership with Xi, touting the importance of their ties in the face of a \"new world order,\" in a veiled reference to the global instability caused by Trump's foreign policy swings and disruptive trade agenda.

    "body": "A Tesla robotaxi drives on the street along South Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, on June 22, 2025Joel Angel Juarez | ReutersTesla CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday that his company is now running a small number of its Robotaxi vehicles in Austin, Texas, without a human driver or safety supervisor on board.\"Just started Tesla Robotaxi drives in Austin with no safety monitor in the car,\" Musk posted on X. \"Congrats to the @Tesla_AI team!\" Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of software, wrote in a separate post that the Austin Robotaxi service included, \"a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors.\" He said the ratio of driverless to supervised vehicles will increase over time in that market.Tesla shares rose 4.2% on Thursday to close at $449.36.Tesla lags behind several companies that are already operating commercial robotaxi services with no drivers or safety monitors present. Alphabet's Waymo leads the U.S. market, while Baidu's Apollo Go is out front in China with significant competition from WeRide.Other players are joining the fray, as Amazon's Zoox is now operating limited driverless services in the U.S., and startups like May Mobility and Nuro are developing their driverless offerings.Elon Musk waves to the crowd during the 56th annual World Economic Forum (WEF) meeting in Davos, Switzerland, January 22, 2026. Denis Balibouse | ReutersMusk said in July that Tesla would likely have \"autonomous ride hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year.\" The company fell far shy of that goal. However, Tesla drummed up excitement with the launch of its Robotaxi ride-hailing app, and its initial services in Austin and the San Francisco Bay area.In Texas, Tesla obtained a permit to run a transportation networking company, which allowed it to use \"automated driving systems,\" or driverless vehicles, there. But in California, Tesla has yet to obtain permits that would allow it to conduct driverless testing or robotaxi rides without a human at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any time.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Musk said, \"I think self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point,\" adding that he expects his company's Robotaxi service will be \"very widespread by the end of this year within the U.S.\" Musk is notorious for missing his self-imposed timelines for grand technical or business achievements.In 2019, he told investors that he was \"very confident\" the company would be able to turn its existing vehicles into robotaxis with a software update by the end of the following year.With its EV sales sliding, Tesla's ability to keep investors enthused may hinge on whether it can scale a driverless, ride-hailing service in the U.S. this year and upgrade the partially automated driving systems in its cars to a fully automated driving system. Today, its premium system is marketed as FSD (Supervised), and the company plans to sell an FSD Unsupervised system in the future.Surveys by the Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report found a majority of U.S. consumers polled late last year did not want to ride in robotaxis, with particular concerns around safety.Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note this week that they anticipated \"muted underlying volume growth\" for Tesla and EV maker Rivian this year with \"autonomy and physical AI driving the narrative.\" They also said, \"Tesla will have to prove out FSD unsupervised and the scaling up of robotaxi (which in our view has been clearly tracking behind schedule) before garnering incremental valuation credit.\" Tesla didn't respond to a request for comment on Thursday.Late last year, California regulators found that Tesla had engaged in deceptive marketing and false advertising around their vehicles' driverless capabilities. And the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is currently investigating Tesla to determine how often the company's FSD systems may have caused traffic safety violations.According to TeslaDeaths.com, which draws on NHTSA data, legal filings and press reports to track fatal Tesla collisions, 65 people have died in Tesla crashes that involved the use of Autopilot, including two in which the company's FSD systems were engaged in the seconds leading up to the crash.Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday.

    "body": "watch nowJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Wednesday that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's approach to immigration, offering a rare public rebuke by a U.S. corporate leader of one of Trump's signature policies. Dimon, speaking on a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, initially praised Trump's moves to secure the borders of the world's largest economy. Illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border fell to the lowest level in 50 years for the period from October 2024 to September 2025, the BBC reported citing federal data.But Dimon, who has long advocated for immigration reform to boost U.S. economic growth, also made an apparent reference to videos of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers rounding up people alleged to be undocumented immigrants.\"I don't like what I'm seeing, with five grown men beating up little women,\" Dimon said. \"So I think we should calm down a little bit on the internal anger about immigration.\"It's unclear if Dimon was speaking about a specific incident, or more broadly about ICE confrontations.In the first year of his second term, Trump has overhauled U.S. immigration policy with a focus on mass deportations, tightened asylum access and ramped-up spending for ICE personnel and facilities. Among a torrent of new policies that changed the landscape for seeking American citizenship, the administration also rescinded guidance on where ICE arrests could happen, leading to raids at schools, hospitals and places of worship.Unlike during Trump's first term, American CEOs have mostly avoided public criticism of his policies. Wall Street analysts have speculated that business leaders fear retribution from the Trump administration, which has sued media companies, universities and law firms, and instead choose to appeal to the president out of the public spotlight.On Wednesday, Dimon said that he wanted to know more about who is being swept up in ICE raids: \"Are they here legally? Are they criminals? ... Did they break American law?\"\"We need these people,\" Dimon added. \"They work in our hospitals and hotels and restaurants and agriculture, and they're good people .… They should be treated that way.\"'A climate of fear'For years, in annual shareholder letters and media interviews, Dimon has cited an immigration overhaul as one of the main avenues to unlock higher U.S. economic growth.The veteran CEO of JPMorgan, the world's largest bank by market cap, has previously supported a merit-based system for green cards as well as citizenship for people brought to America as children, and pushed back on proposals to limit H-1B visas. On Wednesday, Dimon urged Trump to allow citizenship \"for hardworking people\" and \"proper asylum\" opportunities.\"I think he can, because he controlled the borders,\" Dimon said.Later in the wide-ranging interview, The Economist Editor-in-Chief Zanny Minton Beddoes, told Dimon that she was surprised at how careful he and other CEOs were in speaking about Trump.\"You are one of the more outspoken business leaders,\" Beddoes said. \"I'm genuinely struck by the unwillingness of CEOs in America to say anything critical. There is a climate of fear in your country.\"Dimon pushed back, saying that he let his views be known about Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and stance towards European allies. \"I think they should change their approach to immigration,\" Dimon said. \"I've said it. What the hell else do you want me to say?\"watch now",

    "body": "People shop at a Costco store in the Staten Island borough of New York City, U.S., Jan. 16, 2026.  Brendan McDermid | ReutersInflation drifted slightly further from the Federal Reserve's target in November though in line with expectations, according to the central bank's preferred gauge released Thursday.The personal consumption expenditures price index, a Commerce Department measure the central bank uses as its main forecasting tool, showed inflation at 2.8% for the month both for headline and core, in line with the Dow Jones consensus. In addition, the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis reported that the rate for October was 2.7% on both a headline and core basis, the latter excluding volatile food and energy prices.The monthly figures showed a 0.2% increase for both months. The BEA released the October and November numbers together due to impacts from the government shutdown during which official agencies suspended data collection and reports.In addition to the inflation figures, the report showed personal income up 0.1% in October and 0.3% in November, the latter 0.1 percentage point below the forecast. Also, personal consumption expenditures, a proxy for consumer spending, rose 0.5% in both months, matching the November forecast.The personal savings rate rose in November to 3.5%, down 0.2 percentage point from the prior month.Price figures for November reflected 0.2% increases in both goods and services. Food was flat while energy-related costs rose 1.9% and after falling 0.7% in October.The report comes the same day that the BEA said gross domestic product rose 4.4% in the third quarter, according to the second and final estimate. In addition, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims are trending around their lowest level in two years.Together, the data indicates an economy continuing to expand, with consumer spending ahead of inflation despite a somewhat softening labor market.\"The consumer continues to drive the U.S economy, with today's data pointing to another strong gain in spending. This resilience comes in spite of last year's slowdown in the labor market, and still elevated inflation, both of which have weighed on real incomes,\" said James McCann, senior economist for investment strategy at Edward Jones. \"Today's data should reassure the Fed that the economy remains on a solid footing, despite a cooler labor market.\"Markets expect the Federal Reserve to stay on hold at its policy meeting next week following three consecutive interest rate cuts in 2025. Futures traders see at most two rate reductions this year as policymakers weigh the impact of last year's easing, coupled with continued inflation pressures and an uncertain geopolitical landscape.watch now",

Speaking at a post-meeting news conference, Ueda said companies' demand for funds continues to rise moderately and that banks remain active in extending loans. He added that the central bank would need more time to gauge how December's rate increase feeds through to the economy and would continue to scrutinize developments closely.The yen weakened to 159 levels against the greenback before strengthening to 157.3 within minutes, data by Lseg showed.HSBC said it expects the Bank of Japan's next 25 basis point hike to come in July 2026, but warned that further yen depreciation could bring forward the timing and open the door to more rate increases. The bank flagged April as a possible alternative, citing the release of the BOJ's quarterly Outlook report and improved clarity on this year's Shunto wage talks, with another 25 bps hike potentially following later in 2026.Japan's headline inflation rate in December slowed sharply to 2.1%, its lowest level since March 2022.

    "body": "watch nowPresident Donald Trump sued JPMorgan Chase and its CEO, Jamie Dimon, on Thursday for closing accounts belonging to Trump and related entities in early 2021, in what the lawsuit calls political actions. The closures came on the heels of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot by Trump supporters at the U.S. Capitol, and Trump exiting the White House later that same month after his electoral loss to former President Joe Biden was confirmed.\"He debanked me,\" Trump told reporters in Switzerland, when asked about Dimon on Wednesday, hours after his lawsuit was filed in Florida state court in Miami-Dade County.\"He shouldn't be debanking,\" Trump said. \"It's so wrong.\"\"Jamie Dimon is not allowed to do what he did.\"JPMorgan on Thursday denied that it closed Trump's accounts for political reasons and suggested that the closures were due to federal rules and regulations that the bank has been seeking to change during this and prior presidential administrations.Trump and the other plaintiffs in the case, which are business entities related to the president, are seeking at least $5 billion in civil damages. The plaintiffs had been customers of the bank for decades, the suit says.\"Plaintiffs are confident that JPMC's unilateral decision came about as a result of political and social motivations, and JPMC's unsubstantiated, 'woke' beliefs that it needed to distance itself from President Trump and his conservative political views,\" the lawsuit alleges.\"In essence, JPMC debanked Plaintiffs' Accounts because it believed that the political tide at the moment favored doing so,\" says the suit.The suit says JPMorgan failed to disclose why the bank was terminating the accounts, but that the \"plaintiffs have subsequently learned that they were debanked as a result of political discrimination against President Trump, the Trump Organization, its affiliated entities, and/or the Trump family.\"The suit does not detail what the plaintiffs learned that substantiated that claim.The suit also says that JPMorgan's \"reckless decision is leading a growing trend by financial institutions in the United States of America to cut off a consumer's access to banking services if their political views contradict with those of the financial institution.\"In addition to alleging motivations for the closures, the complaint says that Trump and the plaintiffs \"have recently learned that JPMC — at the direction of Dimon — has unlawfully and unjustifiably published some or all of their names, including the names of President Trump, the Trump Organization with its affiliated entities, and/or the Trump family, on a blacklist.\"That purported blacklist is accessible by federally regulated banks \"and is comprised of individuals and entities that have a history of malfeasant acts and are otherwise non-compliant with applicable banking rules and regulations,\" the suit says, while stating that the plaintiffs \"have always complied\" with banking rules and regulations.The complaint does not give a formal name for that blacklist or indicate that it was part of a government regulatory apparatus.The complaint alleges trade libel, and breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by JPMorgan.Read more CNBC politics coverageGreenland PM: Trump-NATO deal framework unclear, sovereignty is a red lineTrump sues Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase over debanking the suit calls 'political'Trump says he reached Greenland deal 'framework' with NATO, backs off tariffsTrump interview live updates: CNBC's Joe Kernen sits down with the president at DavosRussia watches as ally Iran edges closer to collapse.

We regret having to do so but often rules and regulatory expectations lead us to do so,\" Wexler said.\"We have been asking both this Administration and prior administrations to change the rules and regulations that put us in this position, and we support the Administration's efforts to prevent the weaponization of the banking.\"",

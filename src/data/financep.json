    "body": "Children wait outside a supermarket in Canberra, Australia, July 30, 2025. Xinhua News Agency | Xinhua News Agency | Getty ImagesAustralia's inflation accelerated in the third quarter, with consumer prices rising 3.2% from a year earlier — the fastest pace in more than a year — the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The increase topped the 2.1% rise in the second quarter and came in above the 3% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.The figure also pushed inflation beyond the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%–3% target band for the first time since the second quarter of 2024, underscoring the challenge policymakers face in curbing persistent price pressures.The RBA had cautioned in its September Statement on Monetary Policy that inflation for the quarter could come in \"higher than expected,\" citing sticky prices in housing and market services.RBA Governor Michelle Bullock said last month that inflation in those areas was \"a little higher than we were expecting,\" though she stressed that it did not indicate that inflation was \"running away.\"In August, the central bank had forecast that underlying inflation would continue to moderate to around the midpoint of the 2%–3% range, with the cash rate assumed to follow a \"gradual easing path.\"Recent headline CPI readings for July and August came in above expectations for both months, at 2.8% and 3% respectively.Australia's central bank kept its policy rate steady at its last meeting, noting that inflation remained stubborn in some parts of the economy.The country's economy outperformed expectations in the second quarter, growing 1.8% from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace of growth since September 2023. It was higher than the 1.6% expected by economists polled by Reuters and the 1.3% seen in the previous quarter.This is breaking news, please check back for updates.",

Jung Yeon-je | Afp | Getty ImagesSouth Korea's SK Hynix on Wednesday posted record quarterly revenue and profit, boosted by a strong demand for its high bandwidth memory used in generative AI chipsets.Here are SK Hynix's third-quarter results versus LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate:Revenue: 24.45 trillion won ($17.13 billion) vs. 24.73 trillion wonOperating profit: 11.38 trillion won vs. 11.39 trillion wonRevenue rose about 39% in the September quarter compared with the same period a year earlier, while operating profit surged 62%, year on year.On a quarter-on-quarter basis, revenue was up 10%, while operating profit grew 24%.SK Hynix makes memory chips that are used to store data and can be found in everything from servers to consumer devices such as smartphones and laptops.The company has benefited from a boom in artificial intelligence as a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory or HBM chips used to power AI data center servers. \"As demand across the memory segment has soared due to customers' expanding investments in AI infrastructure, SK Hynix once again surpassed the record-high performance of the previous quarter due to increased sales of high value-added products,\" SK Hynix said in its earnings release. HBM falls into the broader category of dynamic random access memory, or DRAM — a type of semiconductor memory used to store data and program code that can be found in PCs, workstations and servers.SK Hynix has set itself apart in the DRAM market by getting an early lead in HBM and establishing itself as the main supplier to the world's leading AI chip designer, Nvidia. However, its main competitors, U.S.-based Micron and South Korean-based tech giant Samsung, have been working to catch up in the space. Micron has already supplied Nvidia with some of its HBM technology, while Samsung recently passed Nvidia's qualification tests for an advanced HBM product, according to a local report last month.\"With the innovation of AI technology, the memory market has shifted to a new paradigm and demand has begun to spread to all product areas,\" SK Hynix Chief Financial Officer Kim Woohyun said in the earnings release.\"We will continue to strengthen our AI memory leadership by responding to customer demand through market-leading products and differentiated technological capabilities,\" he added.The HBM market is expected to continue to boom over the next few years to around $43 billion by 2027, giving strong earnings leverage to memory manufacturers such as SK Hynix, MS Hwang, research director at Counterpoint Research, told CNBC.\"[F]or SK Hynix to continue generating profits, it'll be important for the company to maintain and enhance its competitive edge,\" he added.A report from Counterpoint Research earlier this month showed that SK Hynix held a leading 38% share of the DRAM market by revenue in the second quarter of the year, increasing its shares after having overtaken Samsung in the first quarter. The report added that the global HBM  market grew 178% year over year in the second quarter, and SK Hynix dominated the space with a 64% share.Samsung will report earnings on Thursday.",

Brian Snyder | ReutersA group of more than two dozen states sued the Trump administration on Tuesday, seeking to maintain funding of so-called SNAP benefits during the ongoing federal government shutdown.The suit was filed four days after the Trump administration said it would not use $6 billion in Congressionally-appropriated emergency funding to maintain benefits during the shutdown from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to more than 40 million Americans.The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which blames Senate Democrats for not ending the shutdown, has said that SNAP benefits will cease on Saturday, the lawsuit noted.\"Because of USDA's actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program's inception,\" the suit says.\"Suspending SNAP benefits in these circumstances is both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act,\" the states said in the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts.Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, one of the states in the case, at a press conference accused the Trump administration of \"playing fast and loose with people eating. Can you imagine that?\"\"The money is there! Let us not let them get away with saying that they can't do it,\" DeLauro said. \"Their political will isn't there to feed the people who rely on the SNAP program, which is the most effective anti-hunger program in the United States of America.\"Read more CNBC government shutdown coverageGovernment shutdown becomes 2nd longest in U.S. historyThis week's critical inflation report comes with doubts about the dataHow to get student loan help during the government shutdownWhite House economic advisor Hassett says shutdown could end this weekArmy Corps of Engineers pausing $11 billion in projects over shutdown: VoughtGovernment shutdown: Trump distrust keeps Democrats from forming 'gang'Bill to fund military during government shutdown fails in Senate procedural voteNew York State Attorney General Letitia James, in a statement on the suit, said, \"Millions of Americans are about to go hungry because the federal government has chosen to withhold food assistance it is legally obligated to provide.\"SNAP is one of our nation's most effective tools to fight hunger, and the USDA has the money to keep it running,\" James said. \"There is no excuse for this administration to abandon families who rely on SNAP, or food stamps, as a lifeline. The federal government must do its job to protect families.\"A USDA spokesperson, asked for comment on the suit, said, \"We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats.\"\"Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.\"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, in an interview on Tuesday on Fox News shortly after the suit was filed, was asked if funding for SNAP had \"truly run dry.\"\"100% unequivocally, USDA does not have the $9.2 billion that it would require,\" Rollins answered.\"There's not just pots of $9.2 billion sitting around. And what's particularly rich about New York saying that, or California, or any of these other blue states that have filed the lawsuit to say, 'Oh no, we're going to go, you guys, USDA, go find the money,' \" Rollins said.\"It's their very friends, partners, colleagues, Democrat elected officials, that continue to vote over and over again to keep the government closed,\" Rollins said.\"Again, shame on them. I cannot begin to understand what they're thinking.\"There is no current end in sight for the government shutdown, which began on Oct. 1.On Tuesday, a Republican-backed House bill that would fund the government temporarily failed to win approval in the Senate for the 13th time.Nearly all Senate Democrats have refused to vote for the Republican bill because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for Affordable Care Act health insurance plans.The enhanced tax credits currently used by about 20 million Americans to reduce the cost of health plans purchased on Obamacare marketplaces are due to expire at the end of the year.",

    "body": "The Lucid display is seen at the New York International Auto Show on April 16, 2025. Danielle DeVries | CNBCLucid Group is targeting a new goal that would make it the first automaker to offer highly advanced self-driving capabilities in its vehicles in the coming years, the company said Tuesday.The all-electric vehicle manufacturer expects to launch what it's calling \"mind-off\" driving in which a car can essentially drive itself under normal circumstances without a human needing to monitor it or intervene unless there's a change in circumstances, such as severe weather. That would be like an occupant playing a game of cards or watching TV while the car is driving.Lucid on Tuesday said it plans to leverage Nvidia's \"Drive AV\" platform and multisensor suite that includes cameras, radar, and lidar — or light detection and sensing, which allows the vehicle to better \"see\" its surroundings — for the forthcoming system.Marc Winterhoff, interim CEO of Lucid, said the plan is to debut the new system \"definitely in the coming years,\" but he declined to specify an exact timeframe other than it won't be in 2026. The system is first planned for Lucid's upcoming midsize vehicle before it would expand to other models, he said.\"I want to make sure that we can offer this for our customers in a timeframe that I think is very ambitious, but at the same time, also we're realistic,\" Winterhoff told CNBC. \"The main reason why I decided to not start from scratch, just do it ourselves, it's simply time to market. … Also, it would cost a lot of money.\"Winterhoff said Nvidia's technologies will be a catalyst for the system, while Lucid plans to actually execute the self-driving technology.In the meantime, Winterhoff said Lucid plans to continue to increase the automated technologies on its current vehicles — the Air sedan and Gravity SUV — in partnership with Nvidia.A Lucid-supplied teaser image of its upcoming midsize vehicle behind its current Gravity SUV.Lucid\"It will be a stepping stone,\" said Winterhoff, who has served as interim CEO since company founder Peter Rawlinson left as chief executive in February.Many companies, including General Motors and Tesla, have promised personal self-driving vehicles but have failed to deliver. Automakers have invested billions of dollars working on autonomous vehicles in recent years, with most pulling back spending after years of trying to deploy the technologies.What Lucid is aiming to launch is what the industry refers to as \"Level 4: High Driving Automation.\" As defined by SAE International, formerly the Society of Automotive Engineers, Level 4 technologies should not require monitoring or human intervention under certain, but not all, conditions.There are a limited number of Level 4 vehicles currently on U.S. roadways. Most notably, Alphabet's Waymo operates robotaxis in a variety of cities. Lucid is saying it plans to be the first for a consumer vehicle.Achieving such a system for Lucid will be daunting, especially given its track record on advanced driver assistance system, or ADAS.The company, by its own admission, has not lived up to its customers' expectations. It has been slow to release systems capable of hands-free driving, like many companies offer, or compete with well-known \"Level 2\" technologies such as GM's \"Super Cruise\" or Tesla's \"Autopilot\" or \"FSD.\"Meanwhile, it's set to be a record year for EV sales, but demand for all-electric cars is expected to decline with the end of federal incentives of up to $7,500.Lucid announced the self-driving technology plans as well as other initiatives in conjunction with the Nvidia GTC global artificial intelligence conference taking place this week in Washington, D.C.",

    "body": "Lilly Chair and CEO Dave Ricks speaks during a press conference for Eli Lilly and Company in Houston, Texas, U.S., Sept. 23, 2025.  Antranik Tavitian | ReutersEli Lilly and Nvidia are partnering to build what they call the pharmaceutical industry's \"most powerful\" supercomputer and so-called AI factory to help accelerate drug discovery and development across the sector, the companies announced Tuesday. It's the latest stride by Nvidia and the pharmaceutical industry to harness AI to help shorten the time it takes to bring cures to patients, while reducing costs at every stage of drug discovery and development. The process typically takes about 10 years on average from dosing the first human with a drug to its launch on the market, said Diogo Rau, Eli Lilly's chief information and digital officer, in an interview. Eli Lilly expects to complete the buildout of the supercomputer and AI factory in December. They will go online in January. But the new tools likely won't yield significant returns for the company's business and that of any other drugmaker until the end of the decade. \"The things that we're talking about discovering with this kind of power that we have right now, we're really going to see those benefits in 2030,\" Rau said. The industry's efforts to use AI to bring medicines to people faster are still in the early stages. There are no drugs on the market designed using AI, but progress is evident in the number of AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials, recent AI-focused investments and partnerships among drugmakers.Eli Lilly will own and operate the supercomputer, which will be powered by more than 1,000 Blackwell Ultra GPUs – a newer family of chips from Nvidia – connected on a unified, high-speed network. The supercomputer will power the AI factory, a specialized computing infrastructure that will develop, train and deploy AI models at scale for drug discovery and development.The supercomputer \"is really a novel scientific instrument. It's like an enormous microscope for biologists,\" said Eli Lilly's Chief AI Officer Thomas Fuchs. \"It really allows us to do things we couldn't do before at that enormous scale. Scientists will be able to train AI models on millions of experiments to test potential medicines, \"dramatically expanding the scope and sophistication\" of drug discovery, according to a release from Eli Lilly. While finding new drugs isn't the only focus of the new tools, it is \"where the big opportunity is,\" said Rau.\"We're hopeful that we'll be able to discover new molecules that we never would have with humans alone,\" he said. Several AI models will be available on Lilly TuneLab, an AI and machine learning platform that allows biotech companies to access drug discovery models that Eli Lilly has trained on years of its proprietary research. That data is worth $1 billion.Eli Lilly launched that platform in September as a way to expand access to drug discovery tools across the sector. \"It's really powerful to be able to give that extra starting point to these startups that, you know, otherwise could take a couple of years burning their capital to get to that point,\" said Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health care, adding that the company is \"delighted to participate\" in that effort. In exchange for access to the AI models, biotech companies are expected to contribute some of their own research and data to help train them, Rau noted. The TuneLab platform employs so-called federated learning, which means that companies can take advantage of Lilly's AI models without either side directly sharing data.Eli Lilly also plans to use the supercomputer to shorten drug development and help get treatments to people faster. The company said new scientific AI agents can support researchers, and advanced medical imaging can give scientists a clearer view of how diseases progress and help them develop new biomarkers — a measurable sign of a biological process or condition — for personalized care. \"We would actually like to deliver on that promise of precision medicine,\" Powell said. \"Without an AI infrastructure and foundation, we'll never get there, right? So we're doing all of the necessary building, and now we're seeing this true lift off, and Lilly is an exact example of that.\"Precision medicine is an approach that tailors disease prevention and treatment according to differences in a person's genes, environments, and lifestyles.",

    "body": "NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang speaks during the Live Keynote Pregame during the Nvidia GTC (GPU Technology Conference) in Washington, DC, on Oct. 28, 2025.Jim Watson | AFP | Getty ImagesNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company's GTC conference on Tuesday that its Blackwell graphics processing units — the company's fastest AI chips — are now in full production in Arizona.Previously, Nvidia's fastest GPUs were solely manufactured in Taiwan.Huang said that President Donald Trump had asked him nine months ago to bring manufacturing back to U.S. shores.\"The first thing that President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back,\" Huang said. \"Bring manufacturing back because it's necessary for national security. Bring manufacturing back because we want the jobs. We want that part of the economy.\"Earlier this month, Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company announced that the first Blackwell wafers had been produced in a facility in Phoenix. Wafers are the base material on which semiconductors are etched.Nvidia said in a video that Blackwell-based systems will now be assembled in the U.S., too.Much of what the company announced on Tuesday at its conference in Washington was for an audience of policymakers to convince them of the essential role that Nvidia plays, and that it would hurt U.S. interests to restrict its exports.Huang said on Tuesday on a panel before his speech that Nvidia was holding its conference in Washington to allow Trump to attend, according to CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos, but the president is currently on a trip in Asia.Trump said on Tuesday that he planned to meet with Huang on Wednesday, according to a Reuters report. Demand for the company's GPUs remains high, with 6 million Blackwell GPUs shipped in the last four quarters, Huang said Tuesday. Nvidia expects $500 billion in GPU sales between the Blackwell generation and next year's Rubin chips combined, he added.Cell networks 'built on foreign technologies'Additionally, Huang Tuesday said Nvidia would partner with Finland-based Nokia to build gear for telecommunications, an industry that he said was worth $3 trillion. As part of the partnership, Nvidia will take a $1 billion stake in Nokia.Huang said that Nvidia is building chips for 5G and 6G base stations because it's important to have wireless networks based on American technology.\"Thank you for helping the United States bring telecommunication technology back to America,\" Huang said to Nokia CEO Justin Hotard during his speech.The deal is an appeal to Western policymakers who have long had concerns about the amount of technology from China's Huawei that's used for cellular networks around the world.\"Our fundamental communication fabric is built on foreign technologies,\" Huang said. \"That has to stop, and we have an opportunity to do that, especially during this fundamental platform shift.\"Nokia will use Nvidia chips in its future base stations, which are the pricey computers that distribute cellular signals. Huawei, the market leader, was effectively banned in the U.S. in 2018, leaving Nokia and Ericsson as the primary equipment vendors for U.S. networks. Huang said that Nokia would be using a new product called Nvidia ARC that combines its Grace GPU, a Blackwell GPU and the company's networking parts. Huang said that AI delivered over next-generation 6G networks could help operate robots and deliver more accurate weather forecasts.Stakes are highThe location of the conference carries significance as Nvidia makes the case that it is a core part of the \"U.S. technology stack.\"Huang has argued that it would be better for American interests if Chinese AI developers got used to U.S. technology like Nvidia's chips, rather than forcing the Chinese to develop their own AI chips. \"Nvidia is a proud American company building the U.S. AI infrastructure that will ensure our country leads the world in shaping the future of innovation,\" Kari Briski, Nvidia's vice president of generative AI software for enterprise, told reporters on a Monday call. The stakes are high for Nvidia. U.S. export restrictions have already cost Nvidia billions of dollars in lost sales.In April, the U.S. government informed Nvidia that its H20 chip, which was specially designed to comply with U.S. export controls, would require a license to ship to China. In May, Nvidia said it would have recorded about $10.5 billion in H20 sales over two quarters if the government hadn't made the license requirement.Then, in July, Huang visited Trump in Washington and again tried to persuade him and other administration officials that it's in U.S. interests to ship Nvidia chips to China. The Trump administration said it would approve license requests for the H20, but that Nvidia would have to pay the U.S. government 15% of China sales. Still, Nvidia's China business isn't yet back on track.Earlier this month, Huang said at a financial conference that Nvidia is currently \"100% out of China\" and has no market share there. While Nvidia said it would receive licenses for the H20 chip, the company hasn't revealed a newer chip for China based on the company's current generation of Blackwell GPUs.Quantum computingMany of Nvidia's announcements on Tuesday were partnerships intended to signal that the company works with a variety of U.S. companies.Among those announcements was NVQLink, a new way to connect quantum chips to Nvidia's GPUs.The U.S. having a lead in quantum computing is important to policymakers because military officials are worried that a foreign adversary may be able to spy on military communications if it gets a working quantum computer first. Nvidia officials said in a Monday call that its chips can be used to correct errors that pop up during quantum computing and advance the technology. Nvidia said that 17 different quantum computing startups would produce hardware compatible with NVQLink.\"Researchers will be able to do more than just error correction,\" Huang said Tuesday. \"They will also be able to orchestrate quantum devices and AI supercomputers to run quantum GPU applications.\"Nvidia also said it will partner with the Department of Energy to build seven new supercomputers.WATCH: Nvidia CEO: We brought GTC to DC so President Trump could attendwatch now",

Photographer: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesJapan's Nikkei 225 rose over 1% to hit a fresh record high amid mixed trading in the region on Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, widely believed to bring a second straight 25 basis point cut.Markets are assigning a nearly 100% probability that another quarter-point reduction, on the heels of September's cut, would bring the federal funds rate to a range between 3.75%-4.00%.\"If [Fed chair Jerome Powell] comes off dovish, bets for future Fed cuts will increase and provide more fuel to market momentum,\" veteran investor Louis Navellier wrote in a daily note.The federal funds rate, set by the Federal Open Market Committee, is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans. While it doesn't directly affect consumers, the Fed's moves often influence borrowing costs for mortgages, credit cards and other loans.The Topix was flat. South Korea's Kospi rose 0.17%, while the small-cap Kosdaq lost 0.25%.Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.16%. Australia's consumer prices rose 3.2% in the third quarter, the strongest gain in more than a year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. The increase exceeded the 2.1% rise seen in the second quarter and was above the 3% forecast by economists polled by Reuters.Hong Kong markets are closed for the holidays.Overnight in the U.S., all three major averages closed higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.23% to close at 6,890.89. It had surpassed the 6,900 level for the first time on an intraday basis earlier in the day.The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.80% to finish at 23,827.49, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 161.78 points, or 0.34%, to settle at 47,706.37.

    "body": "watch nowBridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio on Tuesday warned that a bubble could be forming around megacap technology in the U.S. amid the artificial intelligence boom, but said that it may not end until the Federal Reserve reverses its current easy policies.\"There's a lot of bubble stuff going on,\" Dalio told CNBC's Sara Eisen in an exclusive interview from the Future Investment Institute in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. \"But bubbles don't pop, really, until they are popped by tightness of monetary policy and so on.\"Added Dalio, \"We're going to be more likely to ease rates than to tighten rates.\"The hedge fund titan said he uses a personal \"bubble indicator\" that's relatively high right now. Dalio joins a growing chorus of well-known market participants that have cautioned about the potential for a bubble tied to AI spending in recent months.The Fed is set to cut rates for a second time this year on Wednesday and many investors expect the central bank it will do so again at its final meeting of the year in December.The billionaire investor also pointed out that outside of AI-linked names, the market as a whole has done \"relatively poorly\" and there's a \"concentrated environment.\" He noted that 80% of gains are concentrated within Big Tech. The three major indexes on Monday rallied to all-time closing highs, led higher by technology stocks with more good AI news expected from a series of Big Tech earnings this week.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconS&P 500, all-time chartDalio said there's a \"two-part economy,\" with the easing of interest rates because of weakening in some places while a bubble develops elsewhere.He said monetary policy cannot aid both ends of this spectrum given the divergence, making it more likely that the bubble will continue. Dalio said the outcome could be similar to what was seen in 1998 to 1999 or in 1927 and 1928.\"Whether or not it's a bubble and when that bubble is going to burst, maybe we don't know exactly,\" Dalio said. \"But what we can say is there's a lot of risk.\"",

Nathan Howard | ReutersU.S. air traffic controllers Tuesday missed their first full paychecks since the government shutdown began at the start of the month, while the Department of Transportation said flight delays due to staffing shortages have increased.The controllers are facing increased financial stress and it's getting harder to recruit much-needed workers, union officials and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Tuesday. Air traffic controllers and airport security screeners are among the employees required to work during the shutdown as essential employees, even though they're not getting regular paychecks.\"The problems are mounting daily,\" said Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, at a news conference at New York's LaGuardia Airport.The Federal Aviation Administration warned about staffing shortages at airports serving Philadelphia, Denver and airspace over a large swath of the Western U.S. that could disrupt flights on Tuesday.Duffy told reporters that 44% of the flight delays on Sunday, and about 24% of them on Monday, were due to air traffic controller staffing, compared with around 5% of the delays so far this year.U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy holds a press conference on the impact of the government shutdown on air travel, at LaGuardia Airport in the Queens borough of New York City, U.S., October 28, 2025. Shannon Stapleton | ReutersDuffy also said that the shutdown is hurting government air traffic training and recruiting, and that some funds for trainee stipends are \"about to run out.\"Air traffic controller union officials have said that some members have been driving for ride-hailing platforms and taking other jobs to make ends meet.Members of the union, including its president, plan to hand out leaflets and speak to the public at several airports across the U.S. on Tuesday, urging travelers to push Congress to end the shutdown.Read more CNBC airline newsAmerican Airlines is arriving late to the luxury travel boom.

    "body": "Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Fall meetings at the IMF headquarters in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 16, 2025. Kent Nishimura | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe easy part for the Federal Reserve on Wednesday will be announcing an interest rate cut when it wraps up its two-day policy meeting. The hard part will be taking care of other details that are presenting substantial challenges to policymaking these days.Markets are assigning a nearly 100% probability that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a second consecutive quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, reduction in the federal funds rate. The overnight lending benchmark is currently targeted between 4%-4.25%.Beyond that, policymakers are likely to debate, among other things, the future path of reductions, the challenges posed by a lack of economic data and the timetable for ending the reduction in its asset portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.Underlining all of those deliberations will be a growing divergence of opinion over what the future holds for monetary policy.\"They are at a moment in the policy cycle where there's genuine disagreement between people who are thinking we will probably cut rates but I'm not ready to cut again just yet, and people who think even though there's risks, it's time to do more now,\" said Bill English, a Yale professor and the Fed's former director of monetary affairs. \"There's dissent between people who want to cut now, and people who want to wait and see a bit more.\"watch nowJudging by recent statements and prevailing Wall Street sentiment, newly appointed Governor Stephen Miran is likely to dissent in favor of a bigger cut, as he did at the September FOMC meeting.At the same time, regional Presidents Beth Hammack of Cleveland, Lorie Logan of Dallas and Jeffrey Schmid of St. Louis have expressed reluctance to go much further on cuts, though it's far from clear whether they will vote against a cut this week. Only Miran, who wanted a half-point reduction, actually dissented in what was an 11-1 committee vote last month to cut by a quarter point.Left to try to straddle the difference will be Chair Jerome Powell, who in a recent speech gave an implied nod to an October cut when he expressed worry over the state of the labor market.Investors will look to the central bank chief, who will leave the position in May 2026, for guidance on the prevailing sentiment.\"I would expect him to try to walk a middle ground, not tip his hand necessarily, on December,\" English said, referring to the next policy meeting after this one. \"I don't think he wants to be locked into a rate cut in December. But on the other hand, it does seem like he's worried about the labor market and about the outlook for real activity, so he doesn't want to come across as hawkish.\"Markets currently also are pricing in a near-certainty of a December reduction, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool, so it would take a lot do dissuade Wall Street from anticipating more Fed easing.Worries about jobsOne big reason officials are in the mood to lower is concern over the labor market. Even with an absence of data, there are clear signs that inflation is slowing even if layoffs, judging by state-level jobless claims submissions that are still ongoing despite the federal shutdown, do not appear to be accelerating.In fact, worries over jobs could keep the Fed cutting well into 2026, said Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust.\"We expect 25 [basis points Wednesday] and then again in December, and then again in January and March and April,\" Tilley said. \"Then that would bring them down to what we think of as the neutral range to 2.75% to 3%.\"watch nowFed officials in September indicated, through the \"dot plot\" of individual members' expectations, that they won't get to a rate that neither pushes nor restrains growth — the so-called \"neutral\" rate — until 2027, and even then it will be a quarter point above where Tilley sees.However, he thinks the Fed won't have any choice but to react to labor market weakness, particularly as it poses a challenge to surprisingly strong economic growth seen in the second half of this year.Worries over jobs have taken more of the Fed's focus even as inflation remains well above the central bank's 2% target. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported last week, in the only official data release during the shutdown, that the annual inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index was stuck at 3% in September.Lack of data challengeOutside of the CPI report, central bankers face the additional challenge of the data blackout that has accompanied the government shutdown.\"It's hard to make policy to achieve two goals ... when you're not getting data about about at least one of them,\" Tilley said, referring to the Fed's dual mandate to maximize employment and keep prices stable, and the absence of the September nonfarm payrolls report due to the shutdown.\"I expect that to be communicated as more uncertainty about the path forward, that they have to be ready to pivot and hold rates, if need be, or to reduce them faster when they finally do get data,\" Tilley said.Finally, markets will be looking for more definitive answers on when the Fed will stop reducing its $6.6 trillion balance sheet, most of which is in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. Nicknamed quantitative tightening, or QT, the process has entailed allowing proceeds from maturing securities to roll off rather than being reinvested as usual.In a recent speech, Powell indicated the time is getting closer to where the Fed will want to stop QT. While financial conditions are largely still solid, there have been some small signs lately that short-term markets are tightening up. With the Fed's overnight funding facility nearly drained, officials are likely to signal this week that QT is in its final stages.Market commentary was split over whether the Fed will announce the actual end of the program, or signal a future date when it will cease.\"There are signs that they're getting close to bottom, so to speak, in terms of getting through ample reserves and actually getting some tightness and liquidity. So that's why I would expect an announcement, if not action,\" Tilley said.",

The stock is one of the top-performing San Francisco-based companies profiled by CNBC's Brian Sullivan on Power Lunch this week from the City by the Bay.The stock surged in early September after the company posted strong phase 3 trial results for its lead cardio drug called Aficamten, a cardiac myosin inhibitor, which showed an improvement in exercise capacity in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Cytokinetics is now awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its drug, fueling strong investor interest in the company as this drug could disrupt a space dominated by publicly traded biotech giant Bristol Myers Squibb.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconCytokinetics stock performance over the past month.Cytokinetics originally discovered and developed drugs that are tied to heart disease, and one of those drugs, called Mavacamten, was later acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb in 2020. Under the transaction agreements, Bristol Myers Squibb obtained the rights to use the drug for products it is developing or commercializing, while Cytokinetics gained capital which it then used to fund more clinical trials.Now, Cytokinetics' new drug is looking to compete directly with Bristol Myers Squibb, given that it targets the same disease.\"[Bristol Myers Squibb] are actually commercializing a medicine that was discovered in our laboratories, and ultimately the subject of a company we formed that they acquired. They're now selling that, doing a great job. Patients are benefiting from that medicine,\" Blum said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Power Lunch.\" We're now in the process of developing a next-generation medicine that will hopefully enter the same space. It's in front of the FDA for a potential approval later this year.\"Cytokinetics has received funding from specialized biotech financing firms, and uses a mix of royalty financing and partnerships to secure investments for its drug development.\"That journey required us to do a number of things as we invested in research at the moment, and ultimately did some financial engineering in order to support the billions of dollars that we've spent advancing a portfolio of potential medicines,\" Blum told CNBC. He added that heart disease is the primary reason for hospitalization among Americans, especially an increasing aging demographic.\"Our pipeline, our portfolio of potential medicines directed to those diseases, we're in a good position to build an enduring business starting with this first potential medicine,\" he said.",

    "body": "watch nowMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, who wrote a book in 2021 titled, \"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,\" now says leaders need to shift their approach to climate change.In a letter published Tuesday ahead of next week's COP30 U.N. climate summit, Gates argued that too many resources are focused on emissions and the environment, and that more money should go toward \"improving lives\" and curbing disease and poverty.\"Climate is super important but has to be considered in terms of overall human welfare,\" Gates told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin in an exclusive interview. \"I didn't pick that position because everybody agrees with it – it's I think intellectually the right answer.\"In the letter, Gates called out the \"doomsday view\" of climate change and said leaders need to make a \"strategic pivot\" to focus on issues that have the \"greatest impact on human welfare.\"\"It's the best way to ensure that everyone gets a chance to live a healthy and productive life no matter where they're born, and no matter what kind of climate they're born into,\" he wrote.Breakthrough Energy, Gates' climate-focused investment fund, reportedly cut dozens of staffers earlier this year. The New York Times reported in March that the \"change shows how Mr. Gates is retooling his empire for the Trump era.\"This year's climate summit in Brazil comes nearly a decade after world leaders adopted the Paris climate agreement aimed at limiting temperature warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels.Gates called that original goal unrealistic.Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawOver the last decade, the U.S. government has stepped in and out of the commitment depending on who's in the White House.The U.S. initially entered the agreement under President Barack Obama, before President Donald Trump pulled out of the pact when he took office for the first time in 2017. After President Joe Biden rejoined, Trump issued an executive order to again withdraw during his second term.Gates said in 2017 that he was \"deeply concerned\" but \"hopeful\" that the U.S. would continue supporting innovation after Trump left the agreement.Gates told Sorkin that pulling back on climate initiatives is a \"huge disappointment,\" but credited companies like Microsoft for investing in alternative energy technologies. Continued support of these innovations will bring down costs, he said.Over the last decade, several major technology companies, including Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have set 2030 targets to reach net-zero emissions or go carbon negative.In February, Microsoft sustainability chief Melanie Nakagawa admitted that the \"moon has gotten further away\" from previous goals as the company doubles down on artificial intelligence.\"However, the force creating this distance from our goals in the short term is the same one that will help us build a bigger, faster, and more powerful rocket to reach them in the long term: artificial intelligence (AI),\" she wrote.The massive energy demand needed to meet growing data center power requirements has sparked concerns among many climate activists.In terms of AI and concerns that a bubble has formed, Gates said many investments will be \"dead ends.\"Still, he added, \"If you want to be a tech company you don't get to say no let's check out of this race.\"",

Benjamin Fanjoy | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesMicrosoft's GitHub unit on Tuesday announced Agent HQ, a new \"mission control\" interface that will allow software developers to manage coding agents from multiple vendors on a single platform. An artificial intelligence agent is a tool that can independently complete tasks on behalf of a user. Several companies, including GitHub, have built and released popular agents that are specifically designed for programming. Developers have a range of new capabilities at their fingertips because of these agents, but it can require a lot of effort to keep track of them all individually, said GitHub COO Kyle Daigle.Developers will now be able to manage agents from GitHub, OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, xAI and Cognition in one place with Agent HQ.  \"We want to bring a little bit of order to the chaos of innovation,\" Daigle told CNBC in an interview. \"With so many different agents, there's so many different ways of kicking off these asynchronous tasks, and so our big opportunity here is to bring this all together.\"  Read more CNBC tech newsOpenAI's spending bonanza has Wall Street focused on capex in Big Tech earnings reportsAI spending is boosting the economy, but many businesses are in survival modeApple begins shipping American-made AI servers from TexasEU says TikTok and Meta broke transparency rules under landmark tech lawAgent HQ users will be able to access a command center where they can assign, steer and monitor the work of multiple agents.That means they'll be able to see what their agents are working on and course correct in real time if they get off track.The third-party agents will begin rolling out to GitHub Copilot subscribers in the coming months, but Copilot Pro+ users will be able to access OpenAI Codex in VS Code Insiders this week, the company said.GitHub was acquired by Microsoft in 2018, and it allows users to store, share and collaborate on code. Its platform now supports more than 180 million developers, and the company said it is growing at its fastest rate ever. \"This is an era of abundance for AI and we just want to make sure that that abundance doesn't turn to chaos,\" Daigle said. \"We can allow you to have a great experience using all of these tools via a very open GitHub platform.\"WATCH: AI is the biggest technical thing ever in my lifetimewatch now",

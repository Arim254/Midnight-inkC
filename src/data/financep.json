Kristian Tuxen Ladegaard Berg | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said late Tuesday the island and its people should be prepared for \"everything,\" not ruling out a U.S. military action as President Donald Trump doubles down on taking control of the semi-autonomous Arctic island, part of Denmark.Speaking at a news conference, Nielsen said that while the scenario was unlikely, Greenland has to be prepared as \"the other side\" has not ruled out the use of military force, in an apparent reference to the United States. \"It is not likely that there will be a use of military force, but it has not been ruled out yet. This leader from the other side has made it very clear that it is not ruled out. And therefore we must of course be prepared for everything,\" he said, according to a Google translation of his remarks.Nielsen said that Greenland's government was preparing an information campaign for its people, including guidelines on what individuals can do, including recommendation to have at least five days of food in their homes. Greenland will also be forming an emergency response team consisting of departments from municipal authorities, the police and Denmark's Joint Arctic Command.\"We must emphasize that we are in a difficult, a difficult time, a stressful time, and we cannot rule out that it can escalate even [to something] worse,\" Nielsen said.Read moreTrump on Tuesday refused to detail what actions he would take to realize his aim of taking over Greenland. \"You'll find out,\" Trump said in response to a question on how far he would go to acquire the Arctic island. Denmark's armed forces on Tuesday put out releases of European and Danish military training in Greenland, and said that it was \"strengthening its presence in Greenland and the North Atlantic.\"\"The increased presence in Greenland is a consequence of the changed security policy situation, which places new demands on the defence of the Arctic and the North Atlantic by Denmark and NATO,\" the armed forces said. The U.S. is part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Trump has downplayed the likelihood of resistance from European leaders if he were to take over the island. \"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" he said on Tuesday in Florida. \"We have to have it ...They can't protect it.\"On Saturday, Trump threatened eight European countries with higher tariffs, starting at 10% on Feb. 1 and rising to 25% on June 1, if a deal was not reached allowing the U.S. to acquire GreenlandIn response, European states are weighing retaliatory tariffs and broader punitive economic counter-measures against the U.S.",

    "body": "A shopper browses fruit and vegetables for sale at an indoor market in Sheffield, UK. The OECD recently predicted that the UK will experience the highest inflation among all advanced economies this year.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesThe U.K. inflation rate rose to 3.4% in December, above forecasts of 3.3% from economists polled by Reuters.The inflation rate had cooled sharply to 3.2% in the twelve months of November, with the data encouraging the Bank of England to cut interest rates at its final meeting of the year last month.Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, stood at 3.2% in December, unchanged from November, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.\"Inflation ticked up a little in December, driven partly by higher tobacco prices, following recently-introduced excise duty increases,\" the ONS' Chief Economist Grant Fitzner commented on X Wednesday.\"Airfares also contributed to the increase with prices rising more than a year ago, likely because of the timing of return flights over the Christmas and New Year period. Rising food costs, particularly for bread and cereals, were also an upward driver,\" he added.These increases were partially offset by a fall in rents inflation and lower prices for a range of recreational and cultural purchases, the ONS noted.Pound sterling was largely flat against the dollar following the data, at $1.3231.The figures, coming after employment data on Monday which showed further cooling in the labor market, raise doubts over whether the BOE will proceed with its expected February rate cut, or could hold off a little longer.\"A small monthly rise in prices is unlikely to concern policymakers at the Bank of England in the short-term, especially as pay growth continues on a downwards trajectory,\" Scott Gardner, investment strategist at J.P. Morgan Personal Investing, said in emailed comments Wednesday.\"If pay growth continues to fall and this is reflected in inflation data, it could place pressure on the Bank of England to cut interest rates faster than expected. Markets are currently pricing in one to two cuts this year but this could change as inflation data for 2026 starts coming through,\" he said.Matthew Ryan, head of Market Strategy at Ebury, said he expects the BOE to remain on hold for at least the next couple of meetings.\"The hawks on the committee have long emphasised upside risks to U.K. inflation, but these arguments are losing steam amid the deteriorating employment picture and the moderation in wage pressures,\" he noted Tuesday.",

    "body": "Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the December quarter.Sheldon Cooper | Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesIndia's largest business group, Reliance Industries, has been battling geopolitical headwinds in its oil refining and, reportedly, in one of its new energy ventures. But those are not the oil-to-telecom conglomerate's biggest worries. The slowdown in its retail business, the group's third largest vertical, has had analysts reduce earnings estimates and cut stock target price, even as they maintain a buy rating on Reliance shares.Reliance Retail's revenue grew just 8.1% on year and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or EBITDA, improved a mere 2% during the last quarter, raising doubts over its ability to deliver high growth.\"We are confident of delivering 20%+ plus CAGR [compound annual growth rate] in retail revenues over the next three years,\" Isha Ambani, who heads the retail business, told shareholders at the company's annual meeting last year.     Macquarie Capital has removed Reliance from its Asia Marquee list. Reliance Retail \"is a key swing factor\" in the group's sum-of-the-parts valuation due to the slowdown in its growth momentum, the global brokerage said in a report on Monday.Citi has cut its target price to 1,815 rupees ($19.9) per share from 1,860 rupees while UBS has lowered it to 1,790 rupees from 1,820 rupees. UBS was expecting the retail business to grow 10% on year in the December quarter.Just ahead of the festive season, in September, the Indian government slashed goods and service tax rates in order to spur domestic consumption. But the pick up in demand has been uneven across segments with sales of gold and cars increasing in the December quarter while fashion and consumer staples reported softer growth.\"We don't see any incremental near-term catalyst for consumer demand and go into 2026 with somber expectations. While we hope for a delayed impact of the stimulus measures, we expect only a gradual recovery at best, not a dramatic rebound,\" Bernstein said in a note earlier this week. Reliance Retail peers such as Avenue Supermarkets and Tata Group's Trent have also reported slower growth in the December quarter. Reliance has said festive season demand last year was split across second and third quarters, resulting in softer growth numbers. Reliance Retail has also argued that its December quarter results are not comparable year on year as its consumer staples business was demerged and now is a direct subsidy of Reliance Industries.  The gross revenue of consumer staples business was 50.65 billion rupees ($556.8 million)  in the December quarter, or roughly 5% of Reliance Retail's revenue of 976 billion rupee. Brokerages do not see the December quarter results as blip in the company's growth, but more of a secular downtrend. Citi on Monday pared its estimates for Reliance's consolidated EBITDA, from financial year 2026 to 2028 by 1%-2%, citing \"moderation\" in the retail business.Reliance Industries' shares have lost nearly 5% since its earnings were announced, even though the company's core oil refining business appears to be navigating well a tough business environment and its large telecom business reported steady growth.   Weathering headwindsReliance had to cut back on imports of cheap Russian oil as the U.S. imposed sanctions on oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil, one of which had a long-term supply contract with the Indian firm.The company has been one of the largest consumers of Russian crude oil, which accounted for 40%-45% of its crude mix at its peak, said Pankaj Srivastava, senior vice president of commodity markets-oil at Rystad Energy.EBITDA for oil-to-chemicals business, which includes refining and petrochemicals, rose 15% year on year and as \"refining cracks [margins] strength more than offset lower Russian crude intake, higher freight rates and petchem weakness,\" Goldman Sachs said in a report on Monday. Geopolitical concerns appear to have also weighed on the company's new energy business. A report from Bloomberg last week claimed that the company's plans of setting up a battery storage plant with an annual capacity of 40 gigawatt were put on hold. The report claimed that the Indian company was unable to procure technology from China owing to Beijing's curbs on technology transfer.During its earnings call the company denied any delays in the project. Karan Suri, senior vice president of new energy business, said the company was \"fast progressing on setting up our 40 gigawatt battery storage plant and the commissioning will happen over \"next few quarters.\"Untouched by domestic consumption worries or geopolitical tensions, the telecom business of Reliance, continued to deliver a steady performance, in line with expectations of brokerages such as UBS and Citi.The business, which is looking to list this year, reported a 12.7% year on year rise in its revenue and 16.4% rise in EBITDA. It added 8.9 million customers in the quarter taking its total subscriber base to 515 million. ",

    "body": "One kilogram gold bars stacked at the Perth Mint Refinery, operated by Gold Corp.Matt Jelonek | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesGold prices climbed to a fresh record above $4,800 on Wednesday, extending a sharp rally as investors sought safety amid tariff threats from the White House and renewed concerns about a global trade war.The surge has reignited debate among investors over how much prices can rise after a blockbuster year for the bullion.Following a record-breaking 2025, gold has entered 2026 with momentum intact as geopolitical tensions, falling real interest rates and efforts by investors and central banks to diversify away from the dollar reinforce its role as the world's ultimate haven, analysts said.Forecasts are increasingly bullish. Analysts surveyed by the London Bullion Market Association expect prices to rise above $5,000 this year, citing expectations of lower U.S. real rates, continued Federal Reserve easing and sustained central-bank diversification away from the dollar.Julia Du, a senior commodities strategist at ICBC Standard Bank, sees gold prices pushing as high as $7,150.\"Gold remains the headline story after a record-breaking 2025,\" the LBMA said in its forecast survey.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconGoldman Sachs also reiterated its bullish stance, calling gold its highest-conviction trade, driven by a shift in who is buying the metal.\"Gold remains our highest conviction long or base case, the price by the end of this year is $4,900,\" said Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs.He noted that central bank purchases drove gains in 2023 and 2024, while the rally accelerated in 2025 as private-sector demand increased.\"Private investors are starting to diversify into gold through different channels,\" he said in a media briefing on Wednesday, with ETF inflows offering one clear evidence of that shift, though it's difficult to separate retail demand from institutional flows. According to Goldman Sachs, demand largely came from private wealth firms, asset managers, hedge funds and pension investors.For many gold bulls, geopolitics remains the defining backdrop. Nicky Shiels, head of metals strategy at MKS PAMP,  said the current cycle does not resemble a speculative peak. She expects gold prices to reach $5,400 this year.\"Last year was historic, sort of a once in a hundred year event across precious metals, where silver basically doubled,\" she said.\"Gold was up 60%, so we won't see a repeat of those gains, but $5,400 is a solid 30% up year on year,\" she said. \"This is a secular trade. This isn't a commodity blowoff top.\"Geopolitical tensions, she argued, are not fading into the background. Recent flashpoints, including U.S. actions in Venezuela and Washington's push to assert control over Greenland, have only deepened investors' flight to gold.\"You're entering a world where ... there is a strong demand to secure critical metals, critical commodities in this decade,\" Shiels said.",

(Photo by Press Information Bureau (PIB)/Anadolu via Getty Images)Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesIndia said it plans to double bilateral trade with the UAE to $200 billion by 2032, in a step toward diversifying its partnerships as a deal with the Asian country's biggest trading partner, the U.S., remains elusive.In a whirlwind, three-hour long meeting late Monday between UAE's President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, both countries' state-owned companies signed a 10-year liquefied natural gas supply agreement. Under the deal, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi government, will supply LNG worth up to $3 billion for a period of 10 years, starting 2028, to India's state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. With this deal, India is now UAE's largest customer of LNG and will account for 20% of sales by 2029, ADNOC said in a release.Both countries also discussed \"a wide range of issues aimed at further strengthening the multifaceted India-UAE friendship,\" Prime Minister Modi said in a post on X.\"It was a productive visit in terms of outcome,\" said Harsh Pant, vice president for studies and foreign policy at New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation told CNBC's Inside India.He added that India-UAE ties have evolved to a point where \"regular high-level interaction at relatively short notice is going to become more common\".Trade between India and UAE touched $100 billion in fiscal year 2025. Both countries signed the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in 2022.India is the Middle Eastern country's second-largest trading partner, accounting for nearly 9% of its total trade and 14% of non-oil exports as of September 2025, according to India Brand Equity Foundation, an initiative backed by the commerce ministry. UAE was India's third largest trading partner after the U.S. and China in fiscal year 2025, and is home to 3.5 million Indian expatriates.Diversifying alliesIndia's plan to expand its trade with UAE comes at a time when the country's exports to the U.S. are under pressure owing to the 50% tariff imposed by Washington on Indian goods since August last year.\"Even with a trade deal [with the U.S.] there is no guarantee that President Trump's \"unpredictability would end,\" said Pant, adding that it is the reason that India has been reaching out to finalise trade deal with other countries.Last year, following the U.S. tariffs, India entered trade pacts with the UK and Oman, and said it will sign a deal with New Zealand in the first half of 2026.",

    "body": "U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference following their meeting at Chequers, near Aylesbury, Britain, Sept. 18, 2025. Kevin Lamarque | ReutersU.S. President Donald Trump has taken aim at another NATO ally on the eve of his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, this time lambasting the U.K.The so-called \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and U.K., and President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, was left looking bruised on Tuesday after Trump posted a tirade against London's decision to hand sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.The islands include Diego Garcia where a joint U.K.-U.S. military base is stationed. The deal, which was agreed in May 2025, saw the British government agree to hand sovereignty to Mauritius, but to lease the military base on Diego Garcia for £101 million ($135.7 million) a year. The White House voiced its support for the deal last year but, on Tuesday, Trump said it was \"an act of great stupidity.\"\"Shockingly, our \"brilliant\" NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Trump posted on social media platform Truth Social early Tuesday.The president said China and Russia would view this act as one of \"total weakness,\" and that they were international powers that only recognized strength. \"The U.K. giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.\"He added that Denmark and its European allies, who oppose Trump's takeover bid, had to \"do the right thing.\"Responding to Trump's comments, a U.K. government spokesman said Tuesday that \"the U.K. will never compromise on our national security.\"\"We acted because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future,\" he added, according to comments published by BBC News.Rift among alliesTrump's comments come amid a growing rift between the U.S. and its European NATO allies, including the U.K. and France, over the president's incessant pursuit of Greenland, a Danish territory in the Arctic.Greenland, Denmark, and European leaders have said the island is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out using military force to seize the territory if necessary. He has also threatened eight European NATO allies with escalating tariffs if they continue to block his takeover bid.The U.K. is the second NATO ally to be lambasted by Trump in as many days, with the president threatening to impose 200% tariffs on French wines and Champagne on Monday after French President Emmanuel Macron reportedly turned down a seat on Trump's \"Board of Peace\" for Gaza.The U.K. has tried to defuse tensions between the U.S. and Europe, calling for cool heads and further discussions over Greenland.In a press conference Monday, Starmer said that Britain greatly values its long-standing special relationship with the U.S., but that only Greenland and Denmark can decide the island's future.People bear Greenlandic flags as they gather in front of the U.S. consulate  protest against U.S. President Donald Trump and his announced intent to acquire Greenland on January 17, 2026 in Nuuk, Greenland. Sean Gallup | Getty Images News | Getty Images\"On Greenland, the right way to approach an issue of this seriousness is through calm discussion between allies,\" Starmer said at a press conference in Downing Street, the PM's official residence.\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" he added.Starmer spoke to Trump on Sunday night, telling him he was wrong to threaten to impose fresh tariffs on NATO allies if they didn't agree to his demands to \"buy\" Greenland.Starmer and Trump have always seemed to enjoy a warm and respectful relationship, despite their political differences.The U.K. was the first country to strike a trade deal with Washington last year, largely owing to Trump's apparent warmth toward the country. The U.S. president enjoyed all the pomp and pageantry the U.K. could muster during a state visit last fall.",

    "body": "watch nowFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell shouldn't attend upcoming Supreme Court arguments regarding President Donald Trump's efforts to fire one of the central bank's governors, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday. CNBC reported Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter, that Powell plans to be present for oral arguments in a case that challenges Trump's power to remove governor Lisa Cook. \"I actually think that's a mistake,\" Bessent told CNBC's Joe Kernen in an interview from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"If you're trying not to politicize the Fed, for the Fed chair to be sitting there trying to put his thumb on the scale, that's a mistake.\"Trump said in August he was firing Cook from the Fed's board on mortgage fraud allegations. Cook, however, remains in her post at the central bank. Trump has also threatened to fire Powell on multiple occasions. Bessent's comments come after Powell issued a rare video statement, disclosing he was under criminal investigation. \"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress's oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said in the Jan. 11 statement. ",

    "body": "Algi Febri Sugita | SOPA Images | Lightrocket | Getty ImagesNetflix said on Tuesday it had reached 325 million global paid subscribers, a new milestone for the streaming giant that last reported membership numbers a year ago. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly beat Wall Street estimates. Here's how Netflix performed for the period ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:Earnings per share: 56 cents vs. 55 cents, estimatedRevenue: $12.05 billion vs $11.97 billion, estimatedNet income for the fourth quarter was $2.42 billion, or 56 cents per share, up from $1.87 billion, or 43 cents per share, during the same period a year earlier. Netflix said revenue during the period rose 18% year over year, driven by membership growth, higher subscription pricing and increased advertising revenue. In recent years Netflix has been focused on growing its ad-supported membership tier. Netflix launched its ad-supported option in late 2022. On Tuesday, it said 2025 ad revenue grew by more than 2.5-times from 2024 to over $1.5 billion.The company said it expects 2026 overall revenue to range between $50.7 billion and $51.7 billion, due to increases in membership and pricing, as well as \"a projected rough doubling of ad revenue in 2026\" compared to the prior year. On Tuesday's earnings call with investors, Netflix leaders noted what they described as heated competition among industry peers when it comes to gaining subscribers and growing profitability. \"Looking ahead to '26 we're focused on improving the core business, you know, and we do that by increasing the variety and quality of our series and films,\" said co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Still, Netflix's stock was down more than 4% in after-market trading on Tuesday. Netflix's report drew comparisons to a Wall Street Journal report from April that outlined ambitious internal financial targets at the streamer. By those lofty standards, Netflix's growth underwhelmed. But co-CEO Greg Peters said Tuesday the internal targets were considered \"long-term aspirations\" and not to be confused with a forecast. \"Having said that, those goals were based on organic process,\" Peters added, noting they didn't take into account the impact of mergers and acquisitions. WBD deal updateNetflix's quarterly report comes against the backdrop of its proposed transaction of Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and film studio assets. The company announcement in December that it had agreed to acquire streamer HBO Max and the Warner Bros. film studio for $27.75 per WBD share, or an equity value of $72 billion.Earlier on Tuesday Netflix amended its offer to be all-cash. The company said Tuesday it would pause share repurchases to fund the acquisition. Netflix said in its letter to shareholders that it believes the transaction will \"allow us to accelerate our business strategy.\" Netflix said Warner Bros.' library, development and intellectual property will allow it to boost its content selection for members and that HBO Max will help to \"offer more personalized and flexible subscription options.\" However, the proposed acquisition came as a shock to the market as the streaming giant has long stayed away from industry consolidation and mega deals. Since October, when Netflix was first rumored to be interested in the assets, the company's stock has dropped nearly 30%.And the potential acquisition has not been without its bumps. Soon after announcing the deal with Netflix, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile effort to buy all of WBD. Lawmakers and industry insiders have also raised questions about whether the Netflix deal could win necessary regulatory approval. \"We're working really hard to close the acquisition of Warner Bros. Studios and HBO, which we see as a strategic accelerant,\" Sarandos said on Tuesday's call. \"And we're doing all this while we're driving and sustaining healthy growth.\"Netflix has started the regulatory process, Sarandos said, adding he is confident the company will be able to secure regulatory approval \"because this deal is pro-consumer, ... pro-innovation, pro-worker.\" The company has repeatedly argued the combination would preserve jobs during a time of heavy layoffs across media. On Tuesday, Sarandos said the Warner Bros. assets would bring the addition of businesses that don't already exist for Netflix. \"We're going to need those teams, these folks that have extensive experience and expertise. We want them to stay on and run those business,\" Sarandos said. \"So we're expanding content creation, not collapsing it in this transaction.\"Sarandos and Peters both discussed the high level of competition in the media industry, which they said spans various platforms — from traditional TV to social media platforms like YouTube. Proving that Netflix is a small part of an expansive competitive landscape is likely to be key to Netflix's argument to antitrust regulators, CNBC previously reported. ",

The Danish Defense will continue the increased presence with exercise activities together with a number of NATO allies in and around Greenland in 2026.Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty ImagesU.S. President Donald Trump has dismissed the prospect of the European Union resisting his push to annex Greenland \"too much,\" shortly after Denmark sent additional troops to the Arctic island.Speaking ahead of his trip to Davos for the World Economic Forum, Trump repeated his desire to take the self-governing Danish territory. The issue has ratcheted up trans-Atlantic tensions and rattled the NATO military alliance.\"I don't think they are going to push back too much,\" Trump told reporters in Florida on Monday evening, referring to EU opposition over Greenland. \"Look, we have to have it,\" he added.The U.S. president, who has long coveted making Greenland a part of the U.S., reiterated his interest in the sparsely populated territory following an audacious military intervention in Venezuela on Jan. 3.Trump has repeatedly said taking control of Greenland is vital for U.S. national security, frequently citing concerns about Russia and China's Arctic influence.The comments have raised alarm across Europe and prompted demonstrations in Copenhagen and Greenland's capital, Nuuk, over the weekend.  watch nowTrump sought to raise the stakes even further on Saturday when he announced a rising wave of tariffs on eight European countries if they oppose his bid to acquire Greenland. An extra levy of 10% will apply to the U.K., Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland from Feb. 1, Trump said, before rising to 25% from June 1.European political leaders called the tariffs \"unacceptable\" and vowed to back Denmark, which is responsible for the island's foreign, defense, and security policies.The EU is also reportedly considering retaliatory measures against the Trump administration's fresh import levies, including a so-called trade \"bazooka\" and broader economic countermeasures. 'Arctic Endurance' exerciseDenmark has sought to beef up its military presence in Greenland, according to local media reports.  A \"substantial contribution\" of Danish combat troops were expected to arrive in Greenland's Kangerlussuaq on Monday evening, Danish broadcaster TV2 reported. Kangerlussuaq, in western Greenland, is home to the island's major international transport hub.Denmark's top military commander in the Arctic, Major General Søren Andersen, reportedly said that 100 Danish soldiers had already arrived in Nuuk and a similar number in Kangerlussuaq.

    "body": "A giant screen shows a news report on China's \"Justice Mission 2025\" military drills around Taiwan, in Beijing, China Dec. 30, 2025. Tingshu Wang | ReutersChina has doubled down on its criticism of the trade deal between Taiwan and the U.S. agreed last week, warning that it would benefit Washington, while eroding the island's industrial strength. The trade agreement saw U.S. tariffs on the Taiwan's exports reduced to 15% with Taipei committing billions in additional investments in America. Peng Qingen, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said on Wednesday that the deal would \"only drain Taiwan's economic interests,\" while slamming the Democratic Progressive Party, the ruling party of Taiwan, for letting the U.S. \"hollow out\" the island's key industry. That's according to a CNBC translation of his remarks in Mandarin.Beijing's last week had said that China \"firmly opposed\" agreements between Taiwan and countries that maintain diplomatic ties with Beijing, and urged the Washington to adhere to the \"one-China principle.\" China considers democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and Chinese President Xi Jinping regards its reunification with the mainland \"a historical inevitability.\" Taiwan rejects those claims.Taiwanese firms will make direct investments to the tune of $250 billion in the U.S. to build and expand tech operations including chips and AI. The Taiwanese government also promised to guarantee $250 billion in credit to its chip and technology companies to further expand their production capacity in the U.S. Taiwanese companies will also enjoy higher quotas for tariff-free imports of their chips into the U.S. In return, Washington would lowered its levies on most goods from Taiwan to 15% from 20%, and waived tariffs on generic drugs and ingredients, aircraft components and natural resources unavailable domestically.The goal is to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire semiconductor supply chain to the U.S., Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC on Thursday. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's largest contract chipmaker, has already pledged to invest $165 billion into chip fabrication and processing facilities in the U.S., along with a research and development lab. The company is reportedly planning to build 4 to 6 more plants, raising the total to more than 10. Beijing on Wednesday said that the U.S. was \"using Taiwan to contain China,\" claiming that labor costs for  TSMC's U.S. factory were more than double those at its Taiwan factory. TSMC did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comments.watch nowDPP wants \"TSMC to significantly increase its investment in the U.S., creating so-called high-paying jobs for Americans, which will only destroy the roots of the island's industries,\" Peng said.Experts have pointed out that the deal was unlikely to fully wean Washington off Taiwan's most advanced semiconductors anytime soon, as Taipei has stuck to its policy of keeping its most advanced technology at home. When asked about Lutnick's statement, Taiwan's vice premier Cheng Li-chiun said that the U.S. goal of achieving 40% domestic chip self-sufficiency as a national security priority does not depend on Taiwan alone, adding that the U.S. chip giants and other nations were also part of the plan. Taiwan dominates global chip production, with TSMC producing most of the world's advanced chips. Nearly a third of the global demand for new computing power is estimated to be met by Taiwan.   The island's central role in the global semiconductor supply chain has also made preserving its de facto autonomy against any Chinese attack a strategic priority for the U.S. and its allies.The pact deepens the Trump administration's ties with Taipei at a time when China has ratcheted up pressure on the island. watch now",

    "body": "Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is pictured on Sept. 25, 2025, in Berlin.Florian Gaertner | Photothek | Getty ImagesOpenAI on Tuesday said it is rolling out an age prediction model to its ChatGPT consumer plans to help the artificial intelligence company identify accounts that belong to users under 18 years old.The model relies on a combination of account-level signals and behavioral signals, OpenAI said. Some of those signals include usage patterns over time, how long an account has existed, the typical times of day a user is active and the user's stated age. OpenAI has rolled out several new safety features in recent months as it faces mounting scrutiny over how it protects users, particularly minors. The AI startup and other tech companies are facing a probe from the FTC over how their AI chatbots potentially negatively affect children and teenagers, and OpenAI is named in several wrongful death lawsuits, including one that centers around a teenage boy's death by suicide. Once OpenAI's age prediction model suggests that a user is under 18, OpenAI said, ChatGPT will automatically apply protections designed to reduce exposure to \"sensitive content,\" like depictions of self-harm. If users are incorrectly identified as being under 18, they will be able to use the identity-verification service Persona to restore their full access.

    "body": "watch nowAfter months of speculation and political intrigue, President Donald Trump is close to nominating the next chair of the Federal Reserve, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Tuesday.The president has whittled down the field to four candidates to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell and a decision is forthcoming, Bessent told CNBC during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\"My guess is the president will reach a decision maybe as soon as next week,\" he said during the \"Squawk Box\" interview. \"We've had substantial conversations about this. We've run a process that started in September — 11 very strong candidates. We're now down to four candidates. The president has personally met with all of them, and it's going to be his decision.\"Bessent did not name the four finalists, though previous comments have indicated a field of five that included National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, current Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman and BlackRock's chief fixed income strategist, Rick Rieder.Prediction markets have honed in on Hassett, Warsh and Waller, though White House officials have said Rieder also met with Trump, and he has gotten more interest. Recently, Warsh has become the front-runner on Kalshi, with Rieder and Waller trailing, following comments from Trump that he'd prefer Hassett stay in his current role.Bessent has run the screening process but did not indicate a personal preference. White House officials including Trump and the Treasury secretary have regularly criticized Powell both for his stewardship of monetary policy and setting of interest rates, as well as the way he has run the institution in general. Recent developments have seen the Justice Department subpoena Powell relating to the renovation project at Fed headquarters.Trump nominated Powell for the position in 2017, and former President Joe Biden reappointed him.\"Look, I think the Fed's monetary policy independence is very important. I think that a lot of the issues around the independence are being created by the other things that are happening,\" Bessent said. \"Under Chair Powell's watch, we will have seen between four to six governors and presidents have to resign for ethical issues. That's out of 19. If that happened at a Wall Street firm, the CEO would be out.\"Multiple Fed officials, and most recently Governor Adriana Kugler, either have retired or resigned after running afoul of ethics guidelines on investing. \"The independence does not mean lack of accountability. The Fed has a special obligation to the American people because it influences their lives,\" Bessent said.Though Powell's chair term runs out in May, he will have the option to stay on as governor until 2028.

    "body": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a press conference following the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting at the Federal Reserve in Washington, Dec. 10, 2025.Chip Somodevilla | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesThe saga over President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape the Federal Reserve has another twist to it, revolving over whether current Chair Jerome Powell will leave after his term at the helm is finished.Powell is done as the central bank leader on May 15, and it's highly likely Trump will nominate his successor long before then. In fact, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Tuesday that the long-awaited pick could come as soon as next week.However, Powell's 14-year term as governor stretches to Jan. 31, 2028. Historical precedent has been for almost all outgoing Fed chairs to leave their governor roles as well, but Powell could decide to buck that pattern if he feels threats to central bank independence are stark enough to necessitate him staying. That's what Marriner Eccles did in the late 1940s as he viewed his removal by then-President Harry Truman as a political move.Increasingly vocal Trump has gotten increasingly vocal about controlling the Fed. That has happened through persistent criticism of Powell and his colleagues, his own appointments, as well as saying that he thinks the president should be consulted on interest rate decisions.Some on Wall Street think the prospect of Trump gaining further control of the Fed Board of Governors and using that to steer monetary policy might convince Powell to stay on. Such speculation has heightened in recent days following revelations that the Justice Department is investigating Powell for potential criminal prosecution and Powell's public statement that a related subpoena is \"pretext\" for Trump in his push to control the Fed.The sequence of events \"makes it much more likely that Powell, [Fed Governor Michael] Barr and others will stay on after May,\" Krishna Guha, head of global policy and central bank strategy at Evercore ISI, said in a recent note. Though Barr's term runs into 2032, there also had been some chatter that he might choose to walk away. Barr previously had been the vice chair of bank supervision but left the post shortly after Trump's second stint as president began, heading off a potential move by Trump to replace him. He was replaced in the supervisory post by Governor Michelle Bowman, a Trump appointee during his first term.Similarly, Philip Jefferson, the vice chair of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, also could choose to stay or leave a seat that doesn't expire until January 2036. watch nowBut speculation on the Street is increasing that the threats to Fed independence could raise the possibility that all the current governors stay on. \"We think the probability of Chair Powell remaining on the Board as a governor after his chairmanship expires in May has increased with the release of his statement,\" Nomura economists said in a note. \"Trump's attempt to influence monetary policy could encourage pushback from current FOMC participants.\"Markets see Powell outTraders, though, are betting that Powell leaves.Prediction markets site Kalshi currently has odds on Powell leaving before August 2026 at 70%, a bet that implies he would leave the seat either immediately or shortly after being replaced as chair, assuming Trump's nominee clears the Senate. Sen. Thom Tillis, R- N.C., has vowed to block any Fed appointments until the Department of Justice issue is resolved.For his part, Powell has refrained from addressing the issue. A Fed spokesman contacted by CNBC.com said there would be no comment from the chair's office.At a news conference after the Fed's last meeting in December, Powell also dodged a question about the issue, saying only, \"I'm focused on my remaining time as chair. I haven't got anything new on that to tell you.\"In the meantime, Trump's efforts to push Powell out of his office could backfire, hardening the position of other Fed officials at a time when the president continues to push for lower rates.\"The bottom line is that Trump's push for Fed compliance ironically may lead to more Fed independence,\" wrote market veteran Ed Yardeni, head of Yardeni Research. \"Accordingly, President Trump's appointee for Fed chair may be less able to forge a consensus around his or her views than past Fed chairs have been — giving Trump less control over the Fed's actions than Trump may anticipate.\"watch now",

    "body": "Karl Bushby has been walking around the world over the last 27 years. Anadolu | Anadolu | Getty ImagesKarl Bushby was 29 when he left his home city of Hull, England and took off for the adventure of a lifetime. With $500 in his pocket and some survival gear, he went on a mission that no one else in history had ever completed: walking an unbroken path around the world.Bushby's journey, called the \"Goliath Expedition,\" began in 1998 in Punta Arenas, Chile, a city near the southern tip of South America. It's brought him across continents including the Americas, Asia and Europe, and ultimately ends with the goal of arriving back in the United Kingdom.\"The objective was simply to get home unassisted by any form of transport,\" Bushby told CNBC Make It.Throughout the journey, Bushby has followed two rules: He can only walk or swim, unassisted by any form of transportation, and he cannot return home to Hull, England, until he arrives entirely on foot.\"These sounded like two simple rules from the early days, but you know, once those two rules meet the reality of the real world, things can get mighty complicated, especially [with] visas and difficult governments and regimes and some of the controversial borders that [I've] had to cross,\" he said. After walking about 30 kilometers a day, along with some unexpected setbacks, Bushby has now made his way into Europe and expects to complete his journey and return home to England next year, he told CNBC Make It.Life as a wandererBushby has always been an adventurer. He says he used to go explore all day with his brother before returning home for dinner.Growing up in a military family, he was inspired by his father who served in the British army. Bushby also joined the army at age 16 and served as a parachute regiment for about 12 years before taking off on his expedition.At some point, I started drawing lines on maps and daydreaming about great distances and distant horizons, and one thing led to another.Karl BushbyWorld Explorer At a certain point during his tenure in the British army, Bushby got bored.\"I spent my 12 years in the British army waiting to go somewhere we never really went, other than Northern Ireland,\" he said. \"We happened to be living through one of the most peaceful times in history,\" he said.\"So we got bored and tired and became wondrous and mischievous,\" he said. \"At some point, I started drawing lines on maps and daydreaming about great distances and distant horizons, and one thing led to another.\"One day, Bushby drew a line from the United Kingdom over Europe and Asia, through Siberia, over the Bering Strait, into North America and through to the bottom of South America. \"Once I got that on a map, there was kind of no going back ... The old hairs on the back of your neck stand up,\" he said. So, in 1998, Bushby left the British army to begin the long journey. He took a military flight from the United Kingdom to the Falkland Islands, then a civilian flight to Punta Arenas, Chile, which was the starting point of his expedition.That first day you step onto the road [is] a memorable one ... You're on a road that is about 36,000 miles long, with very little idea of what's coming ... You're further than a man mission to Jupiter at that point.Karl BushbyWorld Explorer\"That first day you step onto the road [is] a memorable one, because at that point, you're a long way from home. You've burned all the bridges. You told everyone you'd rather die than come home,\" said Bushby. \"You got like 500 U.S. dollars in your pocket, no support, no idea how it is going to work out, just absolute faith that you can somehow make it work. And you're on a road that is about 36,000 miles long, with very little idea of what's coming. I mean ... you're further than a man mission to Jupiter at that point,\" he said.Lesson on happinessBushby's journey over the last 27 years has brought him through many close encounters.He has famously crossed the Darien Gap, been detained by Russian authorities, jailed in Panama, nearly frozen to death in Alaska and swam across the Caspian Sea over a 31-day-period. On top of all of this, he's gone days without food after walking for many miles, relied on strangers for medical help and ended many nights by himself in a tent he pitched on the side of the road. \"The psychology of hunger is interesting. It's not something that most of us are really used to. When you have no idea where your next meal will come in, you just become obsessed with finding things to eat,\" said Bushby. \"You'll see food everywhere, every shadow, every rock, looks like something you can eat. You'll end up running around, chasing hallucinations most of the time,\" he said. Despite all of the challenges he's overcome, one of the biggest lessons he discovered throughout his journey didn't have much to do with physical pain or endurance. Rather, it was about happiness and how it ultimately comes from your relationships.\"If you would ask me, what was the hardest thing you've done over the last 27 years – that is losing the women that you fall in love with hands down. That's the toughest thing you will deal with… The physical stuff – pain is easy, suffering is different,\" said Bushby.On the other hand, he said: \"The happiest of times was when I [was in] those relationships. When you're with somebody.\" He's also learned that people are generally very kind, across all cultures and regions in the world. Many times throughout his journey, he says he's been taken in, fed and cared for by strangers who ask for nothing in return.\"You don't even speak the same language, so it's just about smiles and nods and then they send you on your way ... It's just one story after another, and it's across every culture, across every country,\" he said.\"This world is hell of a lot friendlier and nicer than it might appear.\" Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "With just a few trading days left this year, 2025 looks to have been another hot year for stocks. The S&P 500 has returned more than 19% since Jan. 1 as of market close on Monday. Barring a year-end disaster, it will mark the third consecutive year of double-digit returns for investors in the broad U.S. stock market. Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future results, and financial pros generally caution against making wholesale changes to your strategy based on short-term stock market prognostications. But if you're invested in the broad stock market, many investment analysts believe that 2026 has the potential to be another great year for your portfolio. \"Certainly we're at a point where we've had incredibly strong performance from U.S. equity markets over the last three years. We don't think that that means that we can't have another good year next year,\" says Kristy Akullian, head of iShares investment strategy for the Americas at BlackRock. \"We are still pretty optimistic in terms of our outlook for U.S. equities. We're pretty upbeat, relatively bullish.\"Wall Street expects corporate earnings to continue to rapidly grow in 2026. On average, analysts expect companies in the S&P 500 to boost earnings by 15.5% next year, up from an estimated 13.2% in 2025 and 12.1% in 2024, according to data analytics firm LSEG. Additionally, the U.S. and global economy appear to be on healthy footing. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 2.6% U.S. gross domestic product growth in 2026 and a 2.8% growth in the global economy. That's slightly higher than consensus estimates, but generally, any positive momentum for the economy next year is probably a good sign for stocks, says Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at The Carson Group. \"We simply don't see a recession next year,\" he says. \"And when you don't have a recession, the S&P 500 is up double-digits almost 70% of the time.\"Indeed, since 1950, the S&P 500 has posted calendar-year returns of 10% or more 68% of the time and a positive return 86% of the time, according to the Carson Group. Overall, Detrick expects the S&P 500 to record gains of 12% to 15% in 2026. What market projections mean for your portfolio in 2026A huge factor that market prognosticators are baking into their assumptions is continued spending on and adoption of artificial intelligence technology. \"The ongoing wave of AI-driven physical investment is expected to be a powerful force, reminiscent of past periods of major capital expansion such as the development of railroads in the mid-19th century and the late-1990s information and telecommunications surge,\" Vanguard analysts wrote in their 2026 outlook. When markets are expecting a serious paradigm shift, you always run the risk of a pullback should progress stall, says Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"We would argue that AI disappointment is the No. 1 risk market in 2026,\" he says. \"That could take several forms. It could come from doubts that money will be there to pay for all this or concerns that it will not translate into data center construction that the market seems to be counting on.\"Buchbinder says he could see an AI-related pullback rankling markets in 2026. Even with that risk in mind, he and others believe that continued AI adoption — and the productivity it may bring — should drive the economy and stock market upward in the coming year. Based on LPL's 2026 \"fair value\" estimate for the S&P 500, analysts at the firm believe stocks could rise 5.7% to 7.2% from current levels next year. Analysts don't expect AI to do all of the heavy lifting in the stock market. Even non-AI stocks should benefit from more business-friendly tax laws and a Federal Reserve that's willing to continue slashing interest rates next year, says Akullian. \"I would characterize our U.S. equity outlook as AI optimism paired with sensible diversification,\" she says. Rather than trying to figure out where the winners will be or timing the market, you'd be wise to invest consistently, and across a variety of assets, Akullian says. And in a year where the global economy could be picking up steam, it may make sense to add some international exposure if your portfolio is heavily tilted toward U.S. stocks, she says. \"Nearly every investor that we speak to could probably benefit from adding some international allocations,\" she says. No matter how optimistic you are about the economy, you should always be prepared for some volatility,  says Detrick.He recommends talking with a financial advisor before making any moves in your portfolio. Even if you're managing your own investments, it's important to have a plan for the market's inevitable downturns.\"As we head into next year, just remember that markets go up and they go down. There are going to be bad days. There are going to be scary headlines,\" he says. \"At some point during this year, if stocks are down between 10% to 15%, that would be perfectly logical and normal. And if you're planning ahead of time for it, you probably won't make rash decisions with your investments.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage? Sign up for CNBC's new online course, How to Raise Financially Smart Kids.

    "body": "As middle management jobs shrink, workplace experts say executives may be underestimating just how crucial these roles are to their companies — especially in the age of AI.The ranks of middle managers, the professionals that bridge senior leaders with frontline employees, have been thinning in recent years. Middle managers made up one-third of all layoffs in 2023, a Bloomberg and Live Data Technologies analysis found. This year, 41% of employees say their companies trimmed down their management layers, according to organizational consulting firm Korn Ferry's Workforce 2025: Power Shifts report, which surveyed 15,000 professionals worldwide. The trend is expected to continue into 2026: One in five (20%) businesses are expected to use AI to flatten their organizational structure, slashing over half of current middle management positions, an October 2024 report from research and advisory firm Gartner found. The layoffs span from major public companies like Amazon and Google to smaller businesses in the U.S., particularly in industries like tech and retail. Some of these companies say they're rectifying pandemic-era over-hiring. Others say they've laid off middle managers as they seek faster, more efficient workflows, and still others cite downsizing due to economic pressures, according to a recent Harris Poll survey on behalf of staffing agency Express Employment Professionals. And while the timing may be coincidental, the tightening comes as some CEOs mandate using artificial intelligence to accomplish work tasks before requesting more headcount.While there can be some upsides to trimming layers of ineffective management, leadership and management experts warn against cutting too deep. They say these positions are a necessary puzzle piece for a successful workplace.\"Middle managers are more important than ever,\" says Deborah Lovich, a C-suite advisor and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who has counseled leaders on how to improve the employee experience for over 30 years. In today's rapidly changing and uncertain economy where employees are experiencing increased burnout and dissatisfaction and lower confidence, Lovich says middle managers are the ones who can give them the motivation and reassurance they need to be productive. Well-equipped managers aren't just an 'expense'Amid higher inflation, tariffs and economic concerns, many companies are tightening their belts. Middle managers, who typically have higher salaries, can often be the first target in leaner times.To be sure, there can be benefits to thinning out excessive layers of hierarchy.Cutting back on middle managers can help businesses reduce costs, encourage more collaboration between frontline employees and senior executives, and increase a company's overall speed and efficiency, according to a 2020 report from management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.That doesn't mean middle management roles should be eliminated altogether or indiscriminately, says Megg Withinton, vice president of enterprise analytics at HR solutions company Insperity. Instead, she says, these professionals should be better equipped to do their jobs. A competent middle manager builds motivation and productivity for their team and plays a significant role in company culture, says Lovich.In contrast, ineffective middle managers — whether due to inexperience, poor job fit, vague guidance from their own bosses or another reason — can weaken performance and morale. Only 51% of newer managers with less than three years of experience feel completely prepared to lead others, according to Insperity's data. And only 20% of employees say their managers exceed their expectations, according to a recent Insperity survey of 1,000 U.S. executives, managers and frontline employees.One potential solution, suggests Withinton: Companies could invest in management training and upskilling, rather than using layoffs as a short-term fix. Upskilling isn't free, of course. But spending about $1,000 per employee to train and develop your talent may have better long-term outcomes, Withinton says, considering turnover costs and lost employee trust and morale — especially for companies that eventually rehire after layoffs anyway. Besides, effective management is about more than money, says Withinton. Some workers find that their work is more difficult when their immediate manager is cut. In Korn Ferry's report, 37% of survey respondents said that not having that middle management role left them feeling directionless.\"I would really encourage people to think about managers not as an expense or an administrative or bureaucratic layer, but an agent for change,\" she says. As organizations rethink their strategies and workflow to be more AI-forward, managers can help guide their teams to use the technology effectively, instead of fear it. \"[Especially] in a time where things are changing week to week, and we're all just going to be scrambling to keep up for a while as this new [AI-driven] world unfolds.\"How to use managers to their full potentialManagers provide the most value when they're keeping their teams accountable and helping workers feel motivated and supported, says Lovich — not necessarily when they're handling administrative tasks like coordinating meetings or tracking employees.The emotional element of management is particularly important in the age of AI, she notes. The tech can and should be used to augment managers' abilities to complete administrative tasks, but can't authentically congratulate an employee on a job well done or notice that they're a little down and not themselves on a given day, Lovich says.Manager training should emphasize skills like fostering interpersonal relationships, effective communication, decision making and accountability, conflict resolution and building trust within teams, according to Insperity performance consultant Chris Brennan.Organizations that use their managers to their full potential reap significant benefits, Insperity's survey found: Their employees are five times more likely to report a healthy workplace culture and four times more likely to understand and align with company goals. What's more, companies with high-performing managers tend to yield higher shareholder returns than their counterparts, according to a June 2023 report from McKinsey and Company. Those advantages will be especially important as organizations start to integrate artificial intelligence into their workflows, Withinton says.\"Before we all leap to 'AI is going to make the role of manager either obsolete or much more reduced,' you actually have to deploy AI and make it work for your company,\" Withinton says. \"And the managers are the people who are going to be able to really make sure that it's being used in the appropriate way day to day. There is no other way around that.\"Still, a looming question remains: By helping facilitate the transition to AI, are today's managers positioning themselves to be increasingly obsolete tomorrow?

A reading above 50 indicates expansion.The composite PMI, a broader measure that tracks activity across manufacturing and services, climbed to 50.7 from 49.7 in November, pointing to broader improvement across the economy.China's non-manufacturing PMI, which covers services and construction, increased to 50.2 from 49.5 in November.Huo Lihui, chief statistician from China's National Bureau of Statistics, said that new orders rose in December, signaling a \"significant expansion\" in both production and demand in manufacturing.Private-sector data showed a similar trend. A separate PMI from independent research firm RatingDog showed manufacturing activity rising to 50.1 from 49.9, beating expectations of 49.8. Yao Yu, founder at RatingDog, said the reading indicated the manufacturing sector had returned to expansion. He noted that total new orders grew for a seventh consecutive month, supported by domestic new product launches and business development, leading to growth in production.However, Yao said that while firms remain confident for 2026, optimism has eased and remained below the historical average.Large enterprises drove the improvement, with their PMI rising to 50.8, up 1.5 percentage points from the previous month, data from China's National Bureau of Statistics showed.Activity among smaller firms remained weaker. The PMI for medium-sized enterprises rose to 49.8, while the index for small enterprises fell to 48.6, down 0.5 percentage points from November.Markets were mixed after the release. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index fell 0.83%, while the mainland's CSI 300 rose 0.33%. The data followed a decision by China's central bank earlier this week to keep loan prime rates unchanged, despite weak economic data and an extended slump in the property sector plaguing the world's second-largest economy.November's retail sales and industrial output missed expectations, while investment in fixed assets also contracted. Hao Zhou, chief economist at securities company Guotai Junan International, told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" Wednesday that the reading was a \"very good, positive surprise to the market.\"\"Maybe the market is concerned about China's property market, China stock market, as well as the consumption,\" Zhou said. \"The data for now suggests that the economy is on the right trend, and the momentum remains solid.\"",

The broad market index lost 0.14% and closed at 6,896.24, while the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.24% and settled at 23,419.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.20%, and ended at 48,367.06.The three major averages have slumped to start the week, dragged down by losses in tech. Nvidia posted back-to-back losing sessions, as did fellow AI play Palantir Technologies.—CNBC's Lim Hui Jie, Sean Conlon and Liz Napolitano contributed to this report.",

(photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images)Andrew Aitchison | In Pictures | Getty ImagesBritish renewable energy startup Octopus Energy is set to spin out its AI tech unit Kraken Technologies, setting the stage for a potential public listing.Origin Energy, which holds a major stake in Octopus, said in a statement late on Monday that Octopus had raised $1 billion in its first standalone funding round, valuing the business at $8.65 billion. The funding round paves the way for the spinoff, with Octopus targeting a separation by mid-2026, Origin said.The statement said \"a major Kraken customer,\" which it did not name, and Daniel Sundheim's hedge fund D1 Capital Partners were involved in the investment round. Origin will also invest $140 million as part of the process. \"In signing this major new customer, Kraken is rapidly closing in on its 100 million customer account target well ahead of plan,\" said Origin CEO Frank Calabria.Octopus Energy will retain a 13.7% stake in Kraken following the spin-out, while Origin's interest in Kraken remains at 22.7%.\"We believe these transactions put Octopus and Kraken in a strong position to unlock their next phase of growth, underpinned by the appropriate capital structure,\" Calabria added.Kraken supplies energy software to utility companies, including EDF and E.ON. Its contracted annual recurring revenue more than doubled in the last 18 months, according to Origin Energy.Earlier this year, Kraken CEO Amir Orad told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the company has a \"very strong investor base\" that focuses on energy and utilities. watch nowKraken has benefited from being owned by Octopus, as a growing number of energy companies licensed its technology, turning the company into what Orad described as \"the modern operating system for utilities.\"When asked about a public listing in September, Orad told CNBC that the \"opportunity is significant,\" but that Kraken needed to focus on being a pure software company.\"With that, we expect, over time, to get more pure software long-term, late-stage investors. Today, we have a very strong investor base that focuses on energy and on utilities. Over the years... we expect that to evolve to be more software focused, given the [separation],'\" he said.— CNBC's Domi Suskova contributed to this report.",

    "body": "Before moving to New York City in 2013, Cintia Diaz didn't have any professional culinary experience on her resume. At home in the Dominican Republic, she'd cooked for her family, but she was a stranger to the restaurant business.In New York, that quickly changed. Diaz took on various restaurant roles over the years, from server and bartender to maître d' and host.\"I wanted to learn more about every single role in the industry,\" she tells CNBC Make It.Today, the 33-year-old has experience from two more roles under her belt; she's now a private chef and culinary educator.Cintia Diaz, a private chef living in New York City, offers meal prep and private dinner services.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItIn 2025, she made roughly $66,220 in gross income. \"At the moment, my business is in a very good place, and I'm happy where it's heading,\" she says.From fine dining to home kitchensFollowing her string of restaurant jobs in her first few years in New York, Diaz pivoted into fine dining around 2017 and subsequently pursued a bachelor's degree in hospitality management.Her goal at the time was to one day work in leadership, managing restaurants. But after a few years in the restaurant business, she wanted a healthier work-life balance and felt being a private chef would offer her that. To become one, she went back to school for an associate's degree in culinary arts to get hands-on training in the kitchen.\"Being a chef allows you to explore what balanced meals are, how to eat healthier, how to share the knowledge with others,\" Diaz says. \"I've always been very curious about how the body reacts with the different meals and how we feed the body. Food is medicine.\"Cintia Diaz left the restaurant industry to become a private chef, which she says gives her greater work-life balance.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItDiaz began working as a private chef in 2021. She offers meal prep services as well as private dinners. Today, she averages four to five meal prep clients per week and two to three private dinners per month, she says. She gets clients from referrals and booking platforms like Solette and Take a Chef.Besides being a private chef, Diaz also teaches cooking classes for children at local schools through a culinary education organization. It comes naturally to her, she notes, as her parents are both teachers.\"I like working with the kids; I like to teach,\" she says. \"I grew up around that, and that's something that I really enjoy.\"Besides being a private chef, Cintia Diaz also teaches culinary classes for kids.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make It'I really enjoy the freedom'For a meal prep client, Diaz will usually dish up four to five days' worth of food at a time. She works with each client to create a menu and decide how many meals and which meals of the day to prepare.\"My focus is based on what the client needs, the requirements, the preferences, the culture, the lifestyle,\" she says. \"Different clients have different preferences and needs with their family.\"Diaz either orders groceries online ahead of her visit to the client's home or heads to the supermarket before cooking. After preparing, labeling and storing the meals, she cleans the kitchen and stays in touch with them until her next service.Cintia Diaz either goes grocery shopping before a service at a client's home or orders groceries delivered in advance of her visit.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItOne perk of being a private chef is having \"more direct contact with the person that I'm cooking for,\" Diaz says. Another is flexibility: When she worked in restaurants, she was juggling two to three jobs alongside her college classes; school and work together took 50 to 60 hours a week then, she estimates. Today, Diaz says she works 20 to 25 hours a week.\"I really enjoy the freedom of being able to build my own lifestyle, my own schedule and being able to be creative in my workplace,\" she says. \"There are weeks or months that I decide to have an easier schedule. There are other times that I decided to work a little bit more.\"But, there can be a \"lack of consistency\" in being a private chef.\"Sometimes there are weeks that you can have a full week, but maybe the following week is going to be a little bit slower,\" Diaz says.'The same income that I would have working in a restaurant'Diaz's meal prep pricing ranges from $250 to $450 per service, excluding groceries, depending on how much food she's preparing and for how many people, as well as how labor-intensive the menu is. For private dinners, she charges between $110 and $300. Diaz makes between $90 to $275 per culinary class.Because she primarily uses clients' kitchen supplies, her main business expenses are her $56 monthly phone bill and $34 weekly public transit card.\"I think you can live comfortably in New York City with the amount of money that I make as a private chef,\" she says.Cintia Diaz says she makes \"the same income\" she would have working in a restaurant while working much less, around 20 to 25 hours a week.Valentina Duarte | CNBC Make ItDiaz lives with her boyfriend and says splitting living expenses helps stretch her money further.\"I don't think it's in my plans to work as a restaurant chef,\" she says. \"I have the flexibility in my schedule and the freedom to work in the ranges that I want with the hours that I want with the same income that I would have working in a restaurant.\"At home in her own kitchen, Diaz still cooks and meal preps for her boyfriend and herself on the weekends, usually making Dominican food. Doing it for work too hasn't taken away her love of cooking.\"It's like my mini science project where I can tweak things, create things, and if it doesn't work, I just try it again until it works,\" she says. \"It's very beautiful that you're creating something with your own hands, and the results are something that you can really enjoy.\"Want to give your kids the ultimate advantage?

    "body": "WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve on Tuesday released minutes from its highly divisive meeting earlier this month, which concluded with a vote to lower interest rates again that appeared to be an even closer call than the final vote indicated.Officials expressed a variety of opinions during the Dec. 9-10 meeting, according to the summary provided a day ahead of its customary release due to the New Year's holiday.Ultimately, the Federal Open Market Committee approved a quarter-percentage point cut by a 9-3 vote, the most dissents since 2019, as officials debated the need to support the labor market against concerns about inflation. The move lowered the key funds rate to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.\"Most participants judged that further downward adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate if inflation declined over time as expected,\" the document said.With that, though, came misgivings over how aggressive the FOMC should be in the future.\"With respect to the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, some participants suggested that, under their economic outlooks, it would likely be appropriate to keep the target range unchanged for some time after a lowering of the range at this meeting,\" the minutes said.Officials expressed confidence that the economy would continue to expand around a \"moderate\" pace, while they saw downside risks to employment and upside risks to inflation. The extent of the two dynamics divided FOMC policymakers, with indications that the vote could have gone either way despite the six-vote victory for the cut.\"A few of those who supported lowering the policy rate at this meeting indicated that the decision was finely balanced or that they could have supported keeping the target range unchanged,\" the minutes said.Stocks held slightly negative following the release. Traders raised bets a bit that the Fed would cut again in April.The vote also came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections, including the closely watched \"dot plot\" grid of individual officials' rate expectations.The 19 officials at the December meeting — 12 vote on rates — indicated the likelihood of another cut in 2026 then one more in 2027. That would take the funds rate down to near 3%, a level officials consider as neutral in that it neither restricts nor pushes economic growth.The faction favoring keeping the rate steady \"expressed concern that progress toward the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective had stalled in 2025 or indicated that they needed to have more confidence that inflation was being brought down sustainably to the Committee's objective.\"Officials said President Donald Trump's tariffs were boosting inflation, but they also largely agreed that the impact would be temporary and likely abate into 2026.Since the vote, economic reports have pointed to a labor market where hiring is still slow but layoffs have not accelerated. On the prices side, inflation has been slowly easing but remains a distance away from the Fed's 2% target.At the same time, the broader economy continues to perform well. Gross domestic product soared in the third quarter, rising at a 4.3% annualized pace that was well ahead of estimates and a half-percentage point better than the strong second quarter.However, most of the data carries a significant caveat: Reports are still trailing as government agencies round up data from the dark period during the government shutdown. Even the reports coming in that are more current, at least from official sources, are being weighed with caution due the data gaps.Consequently, markets largely expect the FOMC to stay put over the next few meetings as policymakers weigh incoming data. The holiday season was a quiet one for Fed official commentary and the few comments out there show mostly caution heading into the new year.The committee's complexion also is about to change, with four new regional presidents rotating into voting roles. They will be Cleveland President Beth Hammack, who has expressed opposition not only to additional cuts but also previous ones; Philadelphia President Anna Paulson, who has joined FOMC doves in expressing concern about inflation; Dallas President Lorie Logan, who has voiced concerns about cutting; and Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari, who said he wouldn't have voted for the October cut.Also at the meeting, the committee voted to resume its bond-buying program. Under the new setup, the Fed will be acquiring short-term Treasury bills in an effort to calm pressures in short-term funding markets.The central bank initiated the program by buying $40 billion a month in bills, staying around that level for several months before downshifting. A prior effort to reduce the balance sheet saw the Fed cut its holdings by about $2.3 trillion to its current $6.6 trillion.The minutes noted that unless the buying program, known in markets as quantitative easing, was restarted, it could result in a \"significant declines in reserves\" that would fall below the Fed's \"ample\" regime for the banking system.Correction: The vote came with a quarterly update of the committee's Summary of Economic Projections. An earlier version misstated the name of the forecast.",

    "body": "watch nowThe big artificial intelligence bubble question has been the tech industry's buzziest debate all year, and one robot has weighed in with its opinion.KOID is a short, slender humanoid robot with a black metal body and a bright ring of light for a face. KOID is manufactured by Unitree, one of China's hottest tech companies, and the Nvidia-powered robot shares a name with an ETF launched in June by KraneShares that focuses on robotics companies.The walking, talking machine on Tuesday told CNBC that the AI bubble debate is certainly a \"hot topic,\" but KOID gave a neutral outlook on whether the boom is actually a looming bubble.\"We might see a lot of excitement around AI right now, but whether it's a bubble or just a transformative wave, is something only time will tell,\" KOID said.The AI-powered machine added that AI and humanoids are \"here to stay\" and will continue to evolve.Weighing in at about 77 pounds, KOID is one of Unitree's G1 models. Those humanoids have 23 degrees of freedom, or specific points where it can move independently, enabling it to achieve full-body maneuvers from dancing to boxing. KOID is available to purchase on RoboStore, the largest U.S. distributor of Unitree robots, with the models ranging from $8,990 to $128,900.A humanoid robot from RoboStore joins CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Dec. 30, 2025.CNBCRoboStore CEO Teddy Haggerty told CNBC's \"Power Lunch\" on Tuesday that while KOID can be programmed to do many kinds of tasks, the industry is still in a \"prototyping\" stage of figuring out where robots fit in everyday living.\"What is it that we really want robots to do?\" Haggerty said. \"Do we want robots to become our new housekeepers? Do we want them to help manufacturing? Do we want them to replace jobs?\"KOID, however, seems a little more certain of its own future. It said that robots will likely become \"even more versatile and integrated\" into daily life.\"They'll help out a variety of fields, from home assistants to industrial tasks, making life a bit easier and more efficient,\" the robot said.The humanoid robotics race has been heating up this past year, with companies including Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics emerging in the space. Tesla's Optimus robots have taken center stage, with CEO Elon Musk saying that they are a future key contributor to the company's valuation.Yet while Optimus robots have yet to hit the market, Chinese companies have been ramping up production to beat the U.S. to the punch — with Unitree spearheading the pack.The company outperformed its peers in events like the World Robot Conference and World Humanoid Robot Games. Unitree, which is heading for an initial public offering that could value it at up to $7 billion, debuted its latest H2 model earlier this year.Read more CNBC tech newsElon Musk envisions humanoid robots everywhere.

    "body": "Copper anodes come out of a furnace at the Glencore Canadian Copper Refinery (CCR) in Montreal, Quebec, Canada on Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesCopper is on track for its biggest annual price rise in more than a decade, driven by supply disruptions, a weakening U.S. dollar, improving expectations for Chinese economic growth — and blockbuster spending on artificial intelligence.Analysts say the red metal's rally could continue next year, particularly amid supply fears and a rapidly expanding global data center footprint.Three-month copper prices on the London Metal Exchange, or LME, traded up 1.5% at $12,405 per metric ton on Tuesday, paring recent gains after notching a record high of $12,960 in the previous session.The benchmark contract, which is up around 41% this year, is on pace for its best year since 2009, when it gained more than 140% as countries emerged from the global financial crisis. In New York, copper prices have soared more than 40% since the start of 2025, also putting it on track for its biggest annual jump since 2009, when the contract rose 137.3%. Demand for copper is widely considered a proxy for economic health. The base metal is critically important to the energy transition ecosystem and is integral to the manufacturing of electric vehicles, power grids and wind turbines.Indeed, electrification, grid expansion and data center build-outs all require large amounts of copper for wiring, power transmission and cooling infrastructure. watch nowIan Roper, commodity strategist at Astris Advisory Japan KK, singled out a global boom in AI demand as the latest driver for copper prices, with \"very tight\" markets likely to mean the red metal could rally even further next year.\"The story for copper of the last few years has been green energy, right? Even though China has had a huge property downturn [and] that's hit things like steel demand, iron ore prices, it's not really affected copper so much,\" Roper told CNBC's Dan Murphy on Dec. 23.\"Copper has been a big beneficiary of the build-out of renewable energy, EVs, and now, of course, data centers is the big growth story,\" he added. AI and defenseAnalysts at JPMorgan said in a research note published in late November that LME copper prices could have further room to run next year, predicting an average of $12,500 per metric ton in the second quarter.The Wall Street bank said it expects copper to average $12,075 through 2026, citing data center demand growth as an \"extremely topical\" upside risk.\"All in all, we think these unique dynamics of disjointed inventory and acute supply disruptions tightening the copper market add up to a bullish set up for copper, and are enough to push prices above $12,000/mt in the first half of 2026,\" Gregory Shearer, head of base and precious metals strategy at JPMorgan, said in the note.  Coils, coiled copper wires, lie on pallets in the wire plant (coiler) at Aurubis AG. After a casting and rolling process, hot copper wire is wound through the coiler into a coil weighing up to five tons and measuring around twelve kilometers in length.Picture Alliance | Picture Alliance | Getty ImagesNot everyone is as bullish on the copper price outlook, however.  Analysts at Goldman Sachs Research expect copper prices to decline from their recent record highs, even as growing demand for the metal gradually pushes up prices in the longer term.  In a research note published on Dec. 11, analysts at Goldman Sachs Research said LME copper prices were poised to remain in a range of $10,000 to $11,000 as robust global demand growth from the grid and power infrastructure sector, \"backed by investment in strategic sectors such as AI and defence,\" keeps prices from dipping below $10,000.The analysts said they expect LME copper prices to average $10,710 in the first half of 2026. Looking much further ahead, they projected LME copper prices to climb to $15,000 in 2035, noting that this is above the consensus of industry analysts.",

    "body": "Silver bars are stacked in the safe deposit boxes room of the Pro Aurum gold house in Munich, Germany, January 10, 2025. Angelika Warmuth | ReutersBEIJING — China is set to tighten controls on silver exports from Thursday, expanding restrictions on the once-ordinary metal critical to the U.S. industry and defense supply chains.Tesla CEO Elon Musk criticized the move over the weekend on his social media platform X, responding to a post about the upcoming restrictions. \"This is not good. Silver is needed in many industrial processes,\" Musk wrote.But the rules are not new. China's Commerce Ministry first announced the new measures in October to strengthen oversight of rare metals, on the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in South Korea. At the time, Beijing agreed to a one-year pause on certain rare earth export controls, while the U.S. rolled back tariffs. Earlier this month, China released a list of 44 companies approved to export silver under the new measures in 2026 and 2027. The new rules in 2026 also restrict exports of tungsten and antimony, materials dominated by China's supply chain and widely used in defense and advanced technologies.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconWhile China hasn't explicitly announced a blanket ban on silver exports, the state-run Securities Times on Tuesday cited an unnamed industry insider, who said the new policy formally elevates the metal from an ordinary commodity to a strategic material, placing its export controls on the same regulatory footing as rare earths. The EU Chamber of Commerce in China found in a flash survey of members in November that a majority of respondents have been or expect to be affected by those Chinese export controls.The U.S. added silver to its nationally designated list of critical minerals in November, citing its use in electrical circuits, batteries, solar cells, and anti-bacterial medical instruments. A separate U.S. analysis said China was one of the world's largest producers of silver in 2024, and also home to one of the largest reserves.China exported more than 4,600 tons of silver in the first 11 months of the year, far more than the roughly 220 tons of imports during that time, according to Wind Information, citing official figures.watch nowThe restrictions on silver come just as interest in the metal has increased in recent weeks.Two Chinese companies contacted Canada-based Kuya Silver on Friday, offering to buy physical silver at about $8 more than the market price at the time, CEO David Stein confirmed to CNBC. He said one company was a manufacturer, and the other was a large trading firm. An Indian buyer approached Kuya on Monday with an offer $10 above the market price, he added.Conservative digital media outlet The Free Press ran a column Tuesday by George Mason University economics professor Tyler Cowen, who said the surge in silver and gold prices reflects investors shifting away from the U.S. dollar.He called the surge in prices \"a flashing warning for the [U.S.] economy.\"The U.S. dollar index has fallen by nearly 9.5% in 2025, its worst performance since 2017. In contrast, silver has more than doubled in price, on track for its best year since 1979 when the metal surged by nearly 470%. Silver prices retreated on Wednesday after touching a record peak above $80 an ounce at the start of the week, with spot prices last trading at around $73.\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tWeekly analysis and insights from Asia's largest economy in your inbox\n\t\t\tSubscribe now\n\t\t\n\tGold has gained more than 60% so far this year and is also on pace for its best year since 1979.Bitcoin, sometimes promoted as an alternative to gold as a store of value, was trading near $88,000 Wednesday morning Beijing time, down by more than 5% for the year.— CNBC's Chris Hayes contributed to this report.",

    "body": "The logo of Meta is seen at the Viva Technology conference dedicated to innovation and startups at Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris, France, on June 11, 2025.Gonzalo Fuentes | ReutersMeta Platforms said Tuesday that it has acquired Manus, a Singapore-based developer of general-purpose AI agents, as the tech giant continues its massive investments into artificial intelligence. Manus, founded in China before relocating to Singapore, launched its first general AI agent earlier this year, which can execute complex tasks such as market research, coding, and data analysis. The company claimed it had achieved an annualized average revenue of more than $100 million just eight months after launch, while its revenue run rate exceeded $125 million.Meta said in a statement that its acquisition was aimed at accelerating AI innovation for businesses and integrating advanced automation into its consumer and enterprise products, including its Meta AI assistant.\"Manus is already serving the daily needs of millions of users and businesses worldwide ... We plan to scale this service to many more businesses,\" Meta said.The company also said it will take steps to wind down Manus AI's remaining business operations in China and that \"there will be no continuing Chinese ownership interests\" after the transaction.According to the firms, Manus will continue operating its subscription service without disruption. While further terms of the acquisition were not disclosed, the Wall Street Journal reported that the deal closed at an amount over $2 billion, according to sources familiar with the acquisition. The start-up was seeking a fresh round of fundraising at a $2 billion valuation when it was approached by Meta, the report added.Manus began as a product of Chinese start-up Butterfly Effect, also known as Monica.Im, before growing into a separate entity. It emerged as a notable AI player earlier this year after claiming its chatbot offered superior performance to OpenAI's Deep Research agent.The company raised $75 million in a Series B funding round led by U.S. venture firm Benchmark in April, and is backed by Tencent and private equity firm HongShan Capital Group (HSG), formerly known as Sequoia, according to data from market research firm Tracxn.The start-up reportedly laid off most of its staff in Beijing in July before moving its headquarters to Singapore in June as it looked towards global expansion.\"Joining Meta allows us to build on a stronger, more sustainable foundation without changing how Manus works or how decisions are made,\" Xiao Hong, CEO of Manus, said in a company release. The firm also announced a strategic partnership with Alibaba's Qwen AI team in March, highlighting its existing ties to Chinese tech companies.Aggressive AI expansionMeta's acquisition of Manus fits into its broader AI strategy of scooping up specialized AI start-ups to acquire talent and fast-track its broader AI business, including the development of its open-source Llama large language models.In June, for example, Meta invested $14.3 billion in AI start-up Scale AI, in a deal that brought its founder and CEO, Alexandr Wang, onto Meta's AI leadership team.Meanwhile, Meta acquired AI-wearables start-up Limitless earlier this month as the company looks to grow its AI device business.In the case of Manus, the firm's AI agent tools have drawn interest from major tech companies. In October, Microsoft began testing Manus in Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to create websites from local files. To date, Manus claimed to have processed more than 147 trillion \"tokens\" of text and data, and supported over 80 million virtual computers. It offers both free and paid subscription tiers.Meta said Manus employees will join its teams as the company continues to aggressively poach AI talent from start-ups and major rivals, including OpenAI and Google. ",

With an expected reacceleration of growth in many countries in 2026, precious metals and their safe-haven status might lose some of their shine.\"We're seeing commodities as one of the top performers for next year ... but the source of the performance is more cyclical commodities than defensive precious metals,\" Ielpo told \"Squawk Box Europe\" on Tuesday.watch nowGold futures also recovered from a sharp sell-off on Monday, and last traded 1.2% higher at $4,394.30 an ounce.Meanwhile, copper futures were last seen up 1.9% to $5.673 an ounce.Precious metals had a stellar year, driven by multiple factors. As safe-haven assets, gold and silver benefited from increased geopolitical tensions. They're also viewed as hedges against inflation. A weaker U.S. dollar also makes the metals cheaper and more attractive for foreign buyers as well. Expected interest rate cuts and concerns over supply constraints have also driven up prices. Over the weekend, Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned that China's export restrictions on silver, due to take effect on Jan. 1, were \"not good.\" \"Silver is needed in many industrial processes,\" Musk wrote on X, possibly prompting prices to rise further.Silver is commonly used in electronics, including solar power panels, data centers, and electric vehicles.— CNBC's Sarah Min contributed to this report.",

John Keeble | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesShares of South Korea's largest defense firm Hanwha Aerospace plunged more than 6% Tuesday, after the company reported worse than expected numbers for its fourth quarter revenue and pre-tax profit on Monday.

Full year numbers Annual revenue skyrocketed 137% year on year to hit 26.61 trillion South Korean won, but marginally missed estimates of 27.01 trillion won.

The 2-year Treasury note yield also fell less than 1 basis point to 3.475%.One basis point is equivalent to 0.01%, and yields and prices move in opposite directions.Retail sales for December, to be released later on Tuesday, is expected to tick up 0.4% month-on-month, according to economists polled by Reuters, compared to 0.6% in November.Markets are also anticipating other backlog of data delayed by the partial U.S. government shutdown. Among the key releases is the January nonfarm payrolls report, now scheduled for Wednesday after being postponed from last Friday.Attention will also turn to January consumer price data, due Friday. Forecasts point to a slight cooling in annual inflation to 2.5%, according to the same survey.There will also be data on weekly initial jobless claims on Thursday.Markets are also continuing to track developments in China after Bloomberg News reported that authorities have encouraged banks to scale back exposure to U.S. Treasurys due to concerns over concentration risk and volatility.",

    "body": "Trowbridge in Somerset, England, on March 15, 2025.Anna Barclay | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesBritish oil giant BP on Tuesday posted fourth-quarter profit in line with expectations and suspended share buybacks, seeking to shore up its balance sheet as lower crude prices take their toll.The London-listed energy firm reported underlying replacement cost profit, used as a proxy for net profit, of $1.54 billion for the final three months of 2025. That matched analyst expectations of $1.54 billion, according to an LSEG-compiled consensus.BP's full-year 2025 net profit came in at $7.49 billion, missing analyst expectations of $7.58 billion. That's down from nearly $9 billion in 2024. BP said the board decided to suspend the share buyback and fully allocate excess cash \"to accelerate strengthening\" of its balance sheet. The firm's previous buyback was $750 million and was announced alongside third-quarter results in November.  For the fourth quarter, the company announced a dividend per ordinary share of 8.320 cents.\"2025 was a year of strong underlying financial results, strong operational performance, and meaningful strategic progress,\" Carol Howle, BP interim CEO, said in a statement.\"We have made progress against our four primary targets - growing cash flow and returns, reducing costs, and strengthening the balance sheet - but know there is more work to be done, and we are clear on the urgency to deliver,\" she added.Woodside Energy boss Meg O'Neill is scheduled to take the reins at BP on April 1, following Murray Auchincloss' decision to step down late last year.Shares of BP fell 3.9% shortly after the opening bell, slipping to the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.Some other earnings highlights included:BP's fourth-quarter net debt came in at $22.18 billion, down from around $23 billion in the same period last year.Fourth-quarter operating cash flow came in at $7.6 billion, up from $7.43 billion a year ago.BP set its 2026 capital expenditure budget at $13 billion to $13.5 billion, reflecting the lower end of its guidance range. The results come at a tough time for Europe's oil and gas sector. Oil prices notched their biggest annual loss since the Covid-19 pandemic last year, partly due to oversupply concerns, ratcheting up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to shareholder returns. BP's industry rivals Equinor and Shell both reported weaker quarterly earnings last week, citing lower crude prices, among other factors.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconBP, Equinor and Shell shares year-to-dateEquinor announced it would reduce share buybacks to $1.5 billion this year, down from $5 billion last year, while also trimming investments in its renewables and low-emission energy projects. Shell, for its part, kept its buybacks steady at $3.5 billion, a move that marked the firm's 17th consecutive quarter of $3 billion or more in buybacks.",

    "body": "Customers shop at a GUCCI luxury store in Shanghai, China.Cfoto | Future Publishing | Getty ImagesKering said it expects a return to growth this year even as it posted another quarter of sales declines on Tuesday, with its biggest sales driver, Gucci, continuing to lag in new CEO Luca de Meo's first quarter at the reins. The company, which also owns brands Yves Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga, said fourth-quarter sales fell 3% on a comparable basis to 3.9 billion euros ($4.64 billion), a slight beat according to FactSet estimates.Its flagship label Gucci, posted a 10% decline on a comparable basis in the quarter, also slightly better than consensus, while the other houses posted flat or moderate growth year-on-year.\"2025 was not the year we wanted,\" CEO Luca de Meo said on an earnings call. \"It didn't reflect the full potential of Kering, and we all know it.\"In 2025, sales fell 10% to 14.7 billion euros. Recurring operating income was down 33% from last year, with its operating margin also declining to 11.1% in the period as a result of weaker sales. Shares jumped as much as 14% and were last seen up 11%, however, the stock is down nearly 14% so far this year.The positive sentiment spilled over into the broader luxury space, benefiting Burberry, which gained 3.4% in early trade, Hermes, last seen 3% higher, and Italy's Brunello Cucinelli, which added 2.7%.Shares of French luxury conglomerate LVMH were 1.4% higher, while Switzerland's Richemont gained 2%.Stock Chart IconStock chart iconKering shares year-to-dateKering, like peer LVMH and other fashion players, has seen its business suffer over the past few years, following a boom in demand during Covid-19, which led to price hikes that alienated customers. Paired with weak consumer demand from China — formerly one of the sector's main growth drivers — and strategic missteps, the fortunes of Kering and others have declined.The appointment of Demna as artistic director of Gucci is intended to help sales and get the firm's reputation back on track. His first collection, \"La Famiglia,\" was launched last year.The market is now eagerly awaiting signs that attempts by De Meo — whose surprise appointment last year marked the company's first outsider CEO — to turn Kering around are starting to bear fruit. De Meo was recruited from the auto industry, and his experience included turning around the struggling automaker Renault at the start of the decade.  The start of a turnaround?\"These results point to a slight improvement, all across the board of the Kering brand portfolio and activities,\" said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. \"Whether this could be a precursor for an inflection, moving brands like Gucci to growth in FY26E as consensus currently anticipates, will be the key investment case debate.\"Kering said it sees a \"return to growth and margin improvement\" in 2026, but was light on further details regarding its outlook. It's expected to present a longer-term plan and guidance at the company's Capital Markets Day in April.\"Since the second half of the year, I can assure you, we have been taking action decisively to put the group back on the right trajectory,\" De Meo said, adding that the group is still \"far from\" where they want to be.One of De Meo's actions has been deleveraging the company's balance sheet, and selling its beauty segment to L'Oreal for 4 billion euros in an attempt to tackle the group's high net debt and focus on its core fashion business. \"Our objective is clear, reignite desirability and prepare the next cycle of growth, house by house, product by product, client by client,\" De Meo said. The new CEO also noted Kering is preparing to enter the wellness and longevity segment, \"a space where we want to play and where we know value and growth will be created,\" and added that the company's jewelry strategy will be further unveiled in April.  \"[Kering's] closing stages of 2025 confirm gradually reducing pressures at a time of more supportive industry conditions,\" noted Jefferies analyst James Grzinic. Investors will be keen to hear more from De Meo first impressions, \"with considerable cost savings potential, an inevitable area of focus,\" the analyst added. ",

But the scheduling of her testimony comes amid growing concerns about her presence at a Fulton County, Georgia, elections center last month when FBI agents seized ballots from the 2020 election.Gabbard has said she was at the center at the direction of President Donald Trump.But Trump has said Gabbard was there at the \"insistence\" of Attorney General Pam Bondi.Sen.

Trump lost that election to former President Joe Biden, who defeated him in Georgia, as well as in other states.A federal judge in Georgia over the weekend ordered that the affidavit filed to obtain the search warrant for the FBI raid be unsealed by Tuesday.Disclosure: CNBC and MS NOW are divisions of Versant Media.",

Arm's upside is increasingly driven by AI-linked growth beyond smartphones. \"Our data center royalty revenue has grown more than 100% year-on-year, and we expect in a few years our data center business to be our largest business, larger than mobile,\" Rene Haas, CEO of ARM, said in an earnings call on Wednesday.The company is also aiming to supply half of the central processing units used by the world's largest cloud computing companies, also known as hyperscalers, by year-end.Despite missing Wall Street estimates for licensing revenue, Arm posted record quarterly revenue of $1.242 billion for the last three months of 2025, driven by demand for artificial intelligence. That figure beat LSEG SmartEstimates, which are weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate.",

    "body": "From left, Donald Trump and his girlfriend (and future wife), former model Melania Knauss, financier (and future convicted sex offender) Jeffrey Epstein, and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell pose together at the Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida on Feb. 12, 2000.Davidoff Studios Photography | Archive Photos | Getty ImagesPresident Donald Trump, in a call two decades ago to a Florida police chief, bashed his former friend Jeffrey Epstein and called Epstein's  procurer, Ghislaine Maxwell, \"evil,\" the now-retired cop recounted to FBI agents in 2019, according to a document released by the Department of Justice.Trump called the then-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter \"to tell him 'thank goodness you' [are] stopping [Epstein], everyone has known he's been doing this,\" Reiter told the FBI in October 2019, according to the FBI document, known as a 302. Reiter's name is redacted from the 302. But the document identifies the interview subject as the person who had been Palm Beach's police chief at the time of the department's investigation of Epstein, who was Reiter.Reiter told the Miami Herald, which first reported the document, that Trump called him in 2006, after the police department's probe of Epstein became publicly known.The document came to light hours after Maxwell's lawyer called on Trump to grant her executive clemency, so that she could speak \"honestly\" about what she knows. Maxwell, earlier Monday, refused to testify to a House committee.Trump told Reiter that he had thrown Epstein out of his club, Mar-a-Lago, which is located in Palm Beach, the summary said.\"Trump told him [Reiter] people in New York knew Epstein was disgusting,\" according to the FBI's 302 summary of its interview with Reiter.\"Trump said Maxwell was Epstein's operative, 'she is evil and to focus on her,' \" the FBI said in the 302.U.S. President Donald Trump sits behind a bill he signed to end the partial government shutdown, at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., Feb. 3, 2026. Evelyn Hockstein | ReutersEpstein later pleaded guilty to Florida state charges in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, in exchange for avoiding federal criminal prosecution.Reiter's interview with the FBI in October 2019 came two months after Epstein killed himself in a New York federal jail after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.During the 2006 call, \"Trump told [Reiter] that he was around Epstein once when teenagers were present and Trump got the hell out of there,\" the summary said.\"Trump was one of the very first people to call when people found out that they were investigating Epstein,\" the summary said.In an April 2019 email released last year by House Democrats, Epstein wrote to author Michael Wolff that Trump \"knew about the girls,\" according to a copy of that message purportedly between the two men.It is unclear what the phrase \"knew about the girls\" meant.Trump has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.The White House in November said, \"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees.\"The White House, when asked for comment on Monday night by CNBC about the FBI summary, referred questions to the Department of Justice.The DOJ said, \"We are not aware of any corroborating evidence that the President contacted law enforcement 20 years ago.\"The summary is among millions of documents made public by the DOJ in late January that are related to Epstein and to Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison term for crimes related to procuring underage girls for him to sexually abuse.Ghislaine Maxwell and Donald Trump are shown in this image released by the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C., U.S., on December 23, 2025 as part of a new trove of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. U.S. U.S. Justice Department | Via ReutersMaxwell on Monday appeared virtually before the House Oversight Committee, which is investigating the Epstein case, but refused to answer questions, citing her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.Her attorney, David Oscar Marcus, in a statement, said that Maxwell is willing to \"speak fully and honestly\" if Trump grants her executive clemency. Clemency can include a pardon, which would wipe away Maxwell's conviction, or commuting her sentence to allow her release from prison earlier than scheduled.\"Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters,\" Marcus said. \"For example, both President Trump and President [Bill] Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.\"Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have been subpoenaed to testify to the Oversight Committee about Epstein. They are scheduled to be deposed there in late February.",

Jegannathan's most recent role was vice president of information technology, AI infrastructure, business apps and information security. In his short LinkedIn post, Jegannathan wrote, \"The journey at Tesla has been one of continuous evolution.\"Last year, Jegannathan was tasked with leading the electric vehicle maker's sales team after previous North America sales leader Troy Jones was dismissed. Tesla's core automotive sales were in decline, with its brand reputation falling partly due to its aging lineup of EVs, along with a consumer backlash against CEO Elon Musk over his incendiary political rhetoric, work for the Trump administration and backing of far-right figures and parties around the world.Tesla and Jegannathan didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Tesla's revenue for 2025 dropped 3%, declining for the first time on record. The company is under pressure to revitalize its EV sales, and to finally deliver its long-promised driverless systems and vehicles that can carry passengers around without requiring a human at the wheel. WATCH: Tesla stock still a generational opportunitywatch now",

    "body": "watch nowTarget said Monday that it's stepping up store staffing, but eliminating about 500 jobs at distribution centers and regional offices as it tries to win back shoppers who have complained about sloppier shelves, out-of-stock items and longer checkout lines.In an internal employee memo obtained by CNBC, the big-box retailer said it's making changes to the way it runs and oversees stores to improve the customer experience, a top goal of new CEO Michael Fiddelke. To do that, Target said it will reduce the number of store districts — the geographic areas that its nearly 2,000 stores are broken into, which have dedicated staffing — and put money toward more hours for front-line store employees.As part of the changes, Target is laying off around 500 people, including about 100 at the store district level and about 400 across its supply chain sites, the internal email said.\"This change also fuels our ability to put significantly more payroll in our stores — primarily in additional labor and hours where needed most, but also in new guest experience training for every team member at every store,\" the email said. The email was written by Adrienne Costanzo, chief stores officer, and Gretchen McCarthy, chief supply chain and logistics officer, and sent to Target employees across its headquarters and store field teams on Monday afternoon.A Target spokesperson declined to specify the amount of additional investment planned for Target stores, but said the announcement will not change starting wages for store workers, which range from $15 to $24 per hour depending on the location. Read moreFor Target, the organizational shift marks one of the first changes under Fiddelke, formerly the company's chief financial officer and chief operating officer, who stepped into the top job on Feb. 1. Fiddelke took the helm as the company aims to get back to growth. Its annual sales have been roughly flat for four years, and it cut 1,800 corporate roles last year in its first major layoff in a decade. Customers, vendors and investors say the company had gotten weaker in some of the key areas where it used to stand out. For example, some shoppers said Target had lost its edge with attentive customer service and trendy, fashion-forward merchandise that earned the company its \"Tarzhay\" nickname.The company has also faced backlash and boycotts from customers over a string of political and social stances over the past few years, including its decision to sell and then pull some Pride Month merchandise, its embrace of and reversal of major diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and, most recently, for not speaking out against the surge of immigration enforcement in its hometown of Minneapolis. Along with Target's self-inflicted struggles, the company has faced stiffer competition from peers like Walmart and a tougher economic backdrop. Consumers have been more selective in recent years about discretionary purchases and impulse items — Target's sweet spot — while paying more for necessities like groceries and rent. In an interview with CNBC at Target's Minneapolis headquarters in October, Fiddelke said his leading priorities as CEO would be restoring Target's reputation for style and design, providing a more consistent customer experience and using technology to speed along the business.Yet he added that Target needs to simplify an operation that's become more complicated for store managers and store employees in recent years as they not only stock shelves, but also pick orders for curbside pickup or packing cardboard boxes headed to customers' homes.\"If you're a store manager now, yes, you're supporting your in-store guest, and you're also running a fulfillment business that's gotten pretty big,\" he said in the October interview. \"And I think we're just now fully appreciating, 'All right, we've got to make sure that we're doing both really well, and it's more complex than it used to be.'\"Last year, the company made another store-related change to try to clean up and smooth over its operations. Almost all of Target's online orders are fulfilled in stores, which has taken up more of employees' time and stores' back rooms. In response, the company shook up its online strategy, designating some stores as locations where employees pick and pack online orders to ship to customers' homes and dropping that altogether at other locations.Target is expected to share more details about its turnaround strategy, along with its holiday-quarter results and full-year forecast, on March 3. It will host an event for investors at its Minneapolis headquarters. ",

    "body": "Sebastian Lai, son of Jimmy Lai speaks during a press conference outside Downing street in London on Sept. 15, 2025. Henry Nicholls | Afp | Getty ImagesChina's embassy in London Tuesday criticized the U.K.'s decision to expand a visa program for Hong Kong residents, calling the move an interference in its internal affairs after a court sentenced pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison under a national security law. The U.K. on Monday expanded the British National Overseas (BNO) visa scheme on Monday to allow children of BNO status holders — who were under 18 at the time of Hong Kong's handover to mainland China in June 1997 — to apply for the route independently of their parents.  \"BNO has misled Hong Kong residents to leave their homes, only to face discrimination and hardship in the U.K., living as second-class citizens,\" an embassy spokesperson said in a statement in Chinese translated by CNBC.The embassy described the scheme expansion as \"despicable\" and \"reprehensible.\"\"China has always firmly opposed the UK's manipulation and interference in China's internal affairs,\" the embassy spokesperson said.The scheme was launched in 2021 after Beijing imposed the sweeping national security law on Hong Kong. Since then, over 230,000 people have been granted visas, and almost 170,000 have relocated to the U.K. The diplomatic tensions followed the sentencing of Lai by a Hong Kong court on Monday, in one of the city's most prominent prosecutions. That was the heaviest penalty ever meted out under the national security law. The 78-year-old founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper was a vocal critic of Beijing and was among the first prominent figures arrested in August 2020. He was jailed on charges of conspiring to collude with foreign forces and publishing seditious materials. Lai pleaded not guilty to all counts.   British Prime Minister Keir Starmer raised the case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to Beijing last month, calling for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. Critics and Lai's family have argued that the U.K. did not take sufficient and concrete steps to reverse the course.The sentencing showed how the Beijing-imposed national security law has \"criminalised dissent, prompting many to leave the territory,\" the British government said in a statement, adding that it will \"rapidly engage [with Beijing] further on Mr Lai's case.\"  The expanded visa route came amid what the British government described as a \"deterioration of rights and freedoms\" in Hong Kong. The government estimated that 26,000 people will arrive in the U.K. over the next 5 years.   Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee said Tuesday that Lai deserved the harsh sentencing for all the harm that he had done, including \"using Apple Daily to poison the minds of citizens\" and \"colluding with foreign forces to take sanctions and hostile actions against China and Hong Kong.\"Other governments have renewed calls for Lai's release following the ruling. Marco Rubio, U.S. Secretary of State, called the ruling \"unjust and tragic\" and urged the authorities to grant humanitarian parole for Lai. ",

    "body": "Printed documents available at Epstein Library on the U.S. Department of Justice website are seen in this illustration photo.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesThe U.S. Justice Department's latest release of millions of documents related to the notorious sex criminal and financier Jeffrey Epstein has shed more light on the relationships he built with various influential figures, including many from the American tech industry.Notably, the files reference communications involving tech mogul Elon Musk and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, two of the world's wealthiest people. This has led to much scrutiny of the pair in recent weeks, both of whom have denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.But those two billionaires are not the only tech names to appear repeatedly in the trove of new documents. Other tech leaders named include Google co-founder Sergey Brin, venture capitalist Peter Thiel, former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.While those four have been linked to Epstein in the past, the new disclosures reveal more than previously known about their association with the convicted sex offender through records ranging from emails, schedules and photos.Brin and Sinofsky have not commented on the matter, while Theil and Hoffman have said they only associated with Epstein for legal and legitimate purposes.Authorities have stressed that being named in the records does not indicate evidence of wrongdoing nor prove that the name was part of a purported client list or blackmail scheme.Still, the files help paint a picture of Epstein's longstanding efforts to embed himself within — and sometimes become a confidant and power-broker for — some of Silicon Valley's most powerful circles prior to his death in 2019Peter Thiel, PayPal and Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, where he once worked alongside Elon Musk, also appears in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Those communications began around 2014 and lasted until around 2019, just months before Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges, and well after he was first formally charged with sex-related crimes in 2006.Among the materials is a recording of an undated conversation between Epstein and former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, in which Epstein references Thiel.In the recording, Epstein advised Barak on how to leverage his connections to get a lucrative position at a company, floating Palantir as a potential option. He added that he had not yet met Thiel but hoped to see him the following week.The duo would indeed get better acquainted, with emails over the years including meeting plans, discussions about the Trump campaign, and other informal exchanges. Ahead of one planned meeting, Thiel's team had even sent his dietary details to Epstein's staff. Peter Thiel, a venture capitalist and co-founder of Palantir and PayPal, appeared in the Epstein files, with the latest release showing correspondence between and about the two.Stephanie Keith | Getty Images News | Getty ImagesFiles released by the House Oversight Committee in November 2025 also showed Epstein invited Thiel to visit him in \"the Caribbean.\"In response to CNBC's request for comment, a representative for Thiel said the venture capitalist never visited Epstein's infamous private island in the Virgin Islands.The New York Times reported in June that Epstein, in 2015 and 2016, had invested $40 million in two funds managed by a venture capital firm co-founded by Thiel.In a podcast appearance that aired on Aug. 16, 2024, Thiel discussed some of his encounters with Epstein, noting that he met him a few times starting in 2014, after being introduced by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman.Thiel said the discussions centered on tax and financial advice. He added that he had underestimated the severity of Epstein's earlier crimes due to Epstein's lenient sentencing in 2008 and his trust in the judgment of his mutual connections.Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn co-founder The latest Epstein file releases feature many references to Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn in 2002, with communications between the two showing several friendly email exchanges.While much of the correspondence centered on fundraising for MIT's Media Lab, it also included personal interactions, tax advice, meeting plans, and mentions of gifts Hoffman sent to Epstein. The documents also confirm a 2014 visit Hoffman made to Epstein's private island. Hoffman has previously acknowledged visiting the island, saying the trip was strictly for philanthropic purposes and that he later regretted not researching Epstein more thoroughly beforehand. However, other emails show plans for additional visits to Epstein's estates, including his Zorro Ranch in New Mexico and his Manhattan apartment, though it's unclear which of those trips actually occurred.  Hoffman recently confirmed 2016 meetings with Epstein in Palo Alto and Cambridge.Epstein is seen referring to Hoffman as a \"very close friend,\" and saying at one point that he missed seeing and talking to the internet entrepreneur. Emails in 2014 also show the financier trying to help connect Hoffman to investment opportunities in India.Reid Hoffman attends a conversation at 92NY on Jan. 28, 2025 in New York City.

He has previously said he regrets his interactions with Epstein and has called for a full release of the Epstein files. However, in November last year, President Donald Trump had ordered a DOJ investigation into Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, along with former president Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.Trump framed the investigation as a probe of Democratic ties to Epstein, though some critics argued it was a deflection from Trump's own mentions in the files. Trump has confirmed a past friendship with Epstein, but said he had no knowledge of his crimes and broke off his relationship with him years ago.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder The file release also contains multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.One particular email chain in April 2003 showed Brin communicating with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's longtime companion and convicted co-conspirator, regarding potential dinner plans at Epstein's New York estate.The exchange appeared to follow up on an earlier encounter between the two. \"Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed. Look forward to seeing you,\" Maxwell wrote.  CNBC contacted Brin through Google for comment, but did not receive a response. Connections between Epstein and Brin have been previously documented, though no allegations of wrongdoing have been leveled.Sergey Brin at the 2024 Vanity Fair Oscar Party on March 10, 2024 in Beverly Hills, California. The Epstein file release contain multiple references to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, including email communications.Lionel Hahn | Getty Images Entertainment | Getty ImagesIn 2004, Epstein had allegedly referred Brin to JPMorgan Chase as a client and later connected him with bank executives for tax advice, per a complaint filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands government in a U.S. district court against JPMorgan Chase Bank. The U.S. Virgin Islands also subpoenaed Brin in March 2023 for documents related to Epstein's interactions with JPMorgan.Meanwhile, court documents unsealed in 2024 related to litigation involving Maxwell included exhibits in which Epstein accuser Sarah Ransome alleged she met Brin and his then fiancée, now ex-wife, Anne Wojcicki, on Epstein's island.Brin stepped down as president of Google's parent company, Alphabet, on Dec. 3, 2019, saying at the time that he was no longer needed in the role. However, he remained a controlling shareholder and board member.He returned from semi-retirement in late 2023 to actively contribute to the company's artificial intelligence initiatives, including work on Gemini.Steven Sinofsky, ex-Microsoft executive More details of the relationship between Epstein and Steven Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive who oversaw key products like Windows and Office, were revealed in the latest files.The documents showed that Sinofsky had sought Epstein's advice on the terms of his exit from Microsoft after leaving in 2012.Sinofsky, who is now a board partner at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, then emailed Epstein in September 2013, about three months after Microsoft announced the terms of his $14 million retirement agreement, writing: \"Got paid. You will be too :)\"Sinofsky continued to email Epstein through 2018, discussing his finances, career prospects and social events in New York, San Francisco and Seattle.Steven Sinofsky speaks at an event at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, on Feb. 29, 2012. More details of the relationship between Epstein and Sinofsky, a former Microsoft executive, were revealed in the latest files.Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty ImagesAn email exchange from November 2012 also appears to show Epstein referencing a possible meeting between Sinofsky and Apple's Tim Cook regarding job opportunities. In the email, Epstein appears to indicate he had recently spoken with Cook, saying \"tim cook was excited to meet\" with Sinofsky, though the context is unclear. Months later, Sinofsky would email Epstein about a meeting with Cook.Sinofsky declined to comment. Apple did not respond to a request for comment regarding the alleged Epstein-Cook interaction.Epstein's relationship with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, who appears in earlier document releases, has also drawn intense scrutiny in recent weeks following mentions in the latest disclosures. Those included draft emails written to himself in which Epstein suggests that he had helped facilitate extramarital affairs and sexual encounters for Gates, amongst other things.In an interview with Australia's 9News on Wednesday, Gates denied any wrongdoing in relation to new files, calling Epstein's allegations \"absolutely absurd and completely false.\"He emphasized that his interactions with Epstein were limited to dinners aimed at potential philanthropy discussions, adding that he \"never went to the island\" and \"never met any women.\"",

    "body": "An Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) speed boat sailing along the Persian Gulf near a cargo vessel.Nurphoto | Nurphoto | Getty ImagesU.S.-flagged ships have been advised to stay \"as far as possible\" from Iranian waters when navigating the Strait of Hormuz as tensions between Washington and Tehran remain elevated.In a notice issued Monday, the U.S. Maritime Administration said ship captains should decline permission for Iranian forces to board U.S. vessels.Boarding attempts, including moves to force commercial vessels into Iranian waters through small boats and helicopters, have occured as recently as Feb. 3, the agency under the Department of Transportation said.Should Iranian forces board a U.S.-flagged commercial vessel, crews were advised not to \"forcibly resist the boarding party,\" the notice said. It added that refraining from forcible resistance does not imply consent or agreement to that boarding.The advisory recommended that ships transiting eastbound in the Strait of Hormuz stay close to the Omani side of the waterway.The guidance followed a round of indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran held in Oman on Friday, centered on how to approach discussions over Tehran's nuclear program. The meeting marked the first talks between the two countries since U.S. bombers struck three Iranian nuclear sites during a 12-day war with Iran last June.  Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian described the talks as \"a step forward,\" while signaling they would be the opening stage of a longer diplomatic process rather than a path to a quick resolution. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also told state media that the talks were a \"good start.\"President Donald Trump said the Oman talks were \"very good\" and that more sessions were planned, even as he warned Iran that failure to reach a deal would carry \"very steep\" consequences for Iran.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet Trump in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the U.S.-Iran talks. Israel, a close U.S. ally, has lobbied Washington to dismantle Iran's nuclear program, curb its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups in the region.watch nowThe Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway connecting the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, has returned to the spotlight this year after Trump warned of possible military action against Tehran.About 13 million barrels per day of crude oil transited the Strait of Hormuz in 2025, according to data from market intelligence Kpler, accounting for nearly a third of global seaborne crude flows. Any disruption to those flows would ripple through global energy markets. Iran has in the past threatened to close the Strait during past confrontations, raising the prospect of higher oil prices.

    "body": "In an aerial view, two-story single family homes line the streets on Jan. 14, 2026 in Thousand Oaks, California. Kevin Carter | Getty ImagesHouse lawmakers on Monday approved a package of bills aimed at increasing housing affordability by giving builders and local governments incentives to boost construction by reducing regulations around home construction. The legislation gained strong bipartisan support, with the House voting 390-9 in favor. A similar Senate counterpart passed last year, also with bipartisan votes. That, as well as President Donald Trump's focus on housing affordability, means the measure has momentum to become law before the end of the year. \"Nothing's more personal to Americans than their opportunity to have a home,\" Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., told reporters on Monday. \"When you ask people what is central to their goals in life, mom and dad are working 55 hours a week and overtime and all these other things ... the idea is, how do we get into a house?\"The bill includes numerous provisions, including cutting housing and environmental regulations around constructing homes. Local communities could get grants to make it easier for builders by offering pre-reviewed housing designs, streamlining construction or housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development would also develop best-practices for zoning guidelines. Definitions around manufactured and modular housing would be updated to encourage more factory-built homes, which can be constructed in a fraction of the time compared to more traditional house-building methods.Community banks would also get a boost through the bill. One change would allow banks to take more custodial and reciprocal deposits, which could help banks provide more mortgages for potential homeowners. Other changes would make it easier to start new banks and change how the FDIC looks at banking mergers. The Senate bill doesn't include many of the provisions on community banks, and would create more programs compared to the House bill. The Senate passed its package last year as part of a larger defense measure, but the bill got significant bipartisan support as a standalone measure, including the backing of both Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., and the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.The bills have received an unusually high degree of bipartisan support. The Senate bill was advanced unanimously out of committee with all 24 senators supporting it. A House panel advanced its bill 50 to 1 in December.Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who supported the bill, warned the legislation wouldn't be effective if housing programs remain underfunded.\"Policy reforms alone are not enough,\" Waters said. \"These programs must be funded if they are going to work.\"House Financial Services Chair French Hill, R-Ark., said getting a housing bill across the finish line is a \"shared goal\" between him and Scott. Hill said he will work with the Senate to see where they have common ground and get consensus on a bill that can get to Trump's desk. Flood said he is optimistic on getting passage this year. \"We are at a juncture to get something very big done here, and everybody wants to participate,\" he said. \"This isn't like we're pushing an agenda trying to talk people into something. White House has ideas. The Senate has ideas. The House has ideas.\"One thing not in the bill: formalizing Trump's proposed ban on large investors buying homes. Hill noted other lawmakers have introduced bills building on Trump's idea and said it could happen if there is a consensus in the Senate and House. ",
